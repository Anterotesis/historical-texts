            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IF at any time there be held forth by the Preacher, the freeness and fulness of the Gospel, together with the readiness of the Lord of Peace to receive those that have any desire thereto; presently it is the spirit of the World to cry out, Sure this man disdains the Law, slights the Law, and counts that of none effect; and all because there is not, together with the Gospel, mingled the Doctrine of the Law, (which is not a right dispensing of the Word according to truth and knowledge.) Again, if there be the terror, horror, and severity of the Law, discovered to a People by the Servants of Jesus Christ, (though they do not speak of it, to the end People should trust to it, by relying on it as it is a Covenant of Works; but rather that they should be driven further from that Covenant, even to embrace the tenders and priviledges of the second) yet, poor Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are unacquainted with the natures of these two Covenants, or either of them; therefore, say they, here is nothing but preaching of the Law, thundering of the Law; when alas, if these two be not held forth (to wit) the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace, together with the nature of the one, and the nature of the other; Souls will never be able neither to know what they are by Nature, nor what they lie under. Also, neither can they understand what Grace is, nor how to come from under the Law, to meet God, in, and through that other most glorious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; through which, and only through which, God can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of himself, grace, Glory, yea, even all the good things of another World.</p>
            <p>I having considered these things, together with others, have made bold to present yet once more to thy view (my
<pb facs="tcp:102284:3"/>
Friend) something of the mind of God, to the end, if it shall be but blessed to thee, thou mayest be benefited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. For verily these things are not such as are ordinary, and of small concernment, but do absolutely concern thee to know, and that experimentally too, if ever thou do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the glory of God through Jesus Christ, and so escape the terrour and unsupportable vengeance, that will other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise come upon thee through his Justice, because of thy living and dying in thy Transgressions against the Law of God. And therefore while thou livest here below, it is thy duty (if thou wish thy self happy for the time to come) to give up thy self to the studying of these two Covenants, treated of in the ensuing Discourse; and so to study them, untill thou through grace, do, not only get the notion of the one and of the other in thy head; but untill thou do feel the very power, life, and glory of the one and of the other. For take this for granted, he that is dark as touching the scope, intent, and nature of the Law, is also dark as to the scope nature, and glory of the Gospel: And also he that hath but a notion of the one, will hardly have any more than a noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the other.</p>
            <p>And the reason is this, because so long as People are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the nature of the Law, and of their being under it, that is, under the curse and condemning power of it, by reason of their sin against it; so long they will be careless, and negligent as to the enquiring after the true knowledge of the Gospel. Before the Commandement came, (that is in the spirituality of it) <hi>Paul</hi> was alive, (that is) thought himself safe, which is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9, 10. compared with the 3. of <hi>Phil.</hi> the 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>ver. &amp;c.</hi> But vvhen that came, and vvas indeed discovered unto him by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord, then <hi>Paul</hi> dies <hi>(Rom.</hi> 7.) to all his former life <hi>(Phil.</hi> 3.) and that man vvhich before could content himself to live, though ignorant of the Gospel, cryes out novv, <hi>I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jesus Christ my Lord, ver.</hi> 8. Therefore, I say, so long they vvill be ignorant of the nature of the Gospel, and hovv glorious a thing it is to be found vvithin the bounds of it;
<pb facs="tcp:102284:3"/>
for we use to say, That man that knoweth not himself to be sick, that man will not look out for himself a Physician; and this Christ knew full well, where he saith, <hi>The whole have no need of a Physician, but them that are sick:</hi> that is, none will in truth desire the Physician, unless they know they be sick. That man also, that hath got but a notion of the Law (a notion, that is the Knowledge of it in the Head, so as to discourse and talk of it) if he hath not felt the power of it, and that effectually too, he, it is to be feared, will at the best be but a Notionest in the Gospel; he will not have the experimental Knowledge of the same in his Heart: nay, he will not seek, nor heartily desire after it, and all because, as I said before, he hath not Experience of the wounding, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, killing nature of the other.</p>
            <p>I say therefore, if thou wouldest know the Authority and Power of the Gospel, labour first to know the Power and Authority of the Law; for I am verily persuaded, that the want of this one thing, namely, the Knowledge of the Law, is one cause why so many are ignorant of the other. That man that doth not know the Law, doth not know indeed and in truth, that he is a Sinner; and that man that doth not know he is a Sinner, doth not know savingly that there is a Saviour.</p>
            <p>Again, That man that doth not know the nature of the Law, that man doth not know the nature of Sin; and that man that knoweth not the nature of Sin, will not regard to know the nature of a Saviour. This is proved, <hi>John 8. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. ver.</hi> This People were Professors, and yet did not knovv the Truth (the Gospel,) and the reason was, because they did not knovv themselves, and so not the Lavv. I vvould not have thee mistake me, Christian Reader, I do not say, that the Lavv of it self vvill lead any Soul to Jesus Christ; but the Soul, being killed by the Lavv, through the operation of its severity seizing on the Soul, then the man, if he be enlightened by the Spirit of Christ, to see vvhere Remedy is to be had, vvill not, through Grace, be contented vvithout the real and saving Knovvledge, through Faith, of him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102284:4"/>
If thou vvouldest then vvash thy Face clean, first take a Glass and see vvhere it is dirty; that is, If thou vvould'st indeed have thy Sins vvashed avvay by the Blood of Christ, labour first to see them in the Glass of the Lavv, <hi>(Jam.</hi> 1.) and do not be afraid to see thy besmeared Condition, but look on every Spot thou hast; for he that looks on the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Face by the halfs, vvill vvash by the halfs: even so he that looks on his Sins by the halfs, he vvill seek for Christ by the halfs. Reckon thy self therefore, I say, the biggest Sinner in the World, and be persuaded, that there is none vvorse than thy self; then let the Guilt of it seize on thy Heart, then also go in that case and condition to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and plunge thy self into his Merits, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Blood; and after that thou shalt speak of the things of the Lavv, and of the Gospel, experimentally; and the very Language of the Children of God shall seelingly drop from thy Lips, and not till then.</p>
            <p>Let this therefore learn thee thus much, He that hath not seen his lost Condition, hath not seen a safe Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he that did never see himself in the Devils Snare, did never see himself in Christ's Bosom. <hi>This my Son was dead, and is alive again. Was lost and is found, with whom we all had our Conversation in time past. But now are</hi> (so many of us as believe) <hi>returned to Jesus Christ, the chief Shepherd and Bishop of our Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say therefore, if thou do find in this Treatise, in the first place, something touching the Nature, End, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Lavv, do not thou cry out therefore all on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, saying, Here is nothing but the Terror, Horror, and thundering Sentences of the Lavv.</p>
            <p>Again, If thou do find in the second part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, something of the freeness and fullness of the Gospel; do not thou say then neither, here is nothing but Grace, therefore surely an under valuing of the Lavv. No, but read it quite thorovv, and so consider of it; and (I hope) thou shalt find the tvvo Covenants (vvhich all men are under ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other) discovered, and held forth in their Natures, Ends, Bounds, together vvith the state and
<pb facs="tcp:102284:4"/>
condition of them that are under the one, and of them that are under the other.</p>
            <p>There be some that through Ignorance do say, hovv that such men as preach Terror and Amazement to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are besides the Book, and are Ministers of the Letter, the Law, and not of the Spirit, the Gospel; but I would answer them, citing them to the 16. of <hi>Luke,</hi> from the nineteenth Verse to the end; and the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. and <hi>Gal. 3. 10. Rom.</hi> 3. from the ninth Verse to the nineteenth: only this Caution I would give by the way, how that they which preach Terror, to drive Souls to the obtaining of Salvation, by the Works of the Law, that preaching is not the right Gospel-preaching. Yet when Saints speak of the sad state that men are in by Nature, to discover to Souls their need of the Gospel, this is honest preaching (see <hi>Romans</hi> 3. the 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and he that doth do so, he doth the Work of a Gospel-Minister.</p>
            <p>Again, there are others that say, because we do preach the free, full, and exceeding Grace discovered in the Gospel, therefore we make void the Law; which indeed, unless the Gospel be held forth in the Glory thereof without Confusion, by mingling the Covenant of Works therewith, the Law cannot be established. <hi>Do we through Faith,</hi> or preaching of the Gospel, <hi>make void the Law?</hi> Nay, stay, saith <hi>Paul, God forbid. We do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by establish the Law,</hi> Rom. 3. 31.</p>
            <p>And verily, he that will indeed establish the Law, or set it in its own place, (for so I understand the Words) must be sure to hold forth the Gospel in its right colour and nature; for if a man be ignorant of the nature of the Gospel, and the Covenant of Grace, they, or he, will be very apt to remove the Law out of its place, and that because <hi>they are ignorant, not knowing what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102284:5"/>
And let me tell you, if a man be ignorant of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and the bounds and boundlesness of the Gospel, though he speaks and makes mention of the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and also of the Name of the New Covenant, and the Blood of Christ; yet at this very time, and in these very Words, he will preach nothing but the Law, and that as a Covenant of Works.</p>
            <p>Reader, I must confess it is a wonderful mysterious thing, and he had need have a wiser Spirit than his own that can rightly set these two Covenants in their right places, that when he speaks of the one, he doth not justle the other out of its place. O, to be so well enlightned, as to speak of the one, that is the Law, for to magnifie the Gospel; and also, to speak of the Gospel, so as to establish (and yet not to idolize) the Law, nor any particular thereof, it is rare, and to be heard and found but in very few mens Breasts.</p>
            <p>If thou should'st say, what is it to speak to each of these two Covenants, so as to set them in their right places, and also to use the terror of the one, so as to magnifie and advance the Glory of the other?</p>
            <p>To this I shall answer also, read the ensuing Discourse but with an understanding Heart, and it is like thou wilt find a Reply therein to the same purpose, which may be to thy satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Reader, if thou do find this Book empty of fantastical Expressions, and without light, vain, whimsical Scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like terms, thou must understand, it is because I never went to School to <hi>Aristotle</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> but was brought up at my Father's House, in a very mean condition, among a Company of poor Country-men. But if thou do find a parcel of plain, yet sound, true, and home Sayings, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute that to the Lord Jesus, his Gifts and Abilities, which he hath bestowed upon such a poor Creature as I am, and have been. And if thou, being a seeing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, dost find me coming short, though rightly touching at some things, attribute that either to my Brevity, or,
<pb facs="tcp:102284:5"/>
if thou wilt, to my Weaknesses, (for I am full of them.) A word or two more, and so I shall have done with this.</p>
            <p>And the first is, Friend, if thou do not desire the Salvation of thy Soul, yet I pray thee to read this Book over with serious Consideration; it may be it will stir up in thee some desires to look out after it, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thou mayest be without.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if thou do find any stirrings in thy Heart, by thy reading such an unworthy man's Works as mine are; be sure that in the first place thou give Glory to God, and give way to thy Convictions, and be not too hasty in getting them off from thy Conscience; but let them so work till thou do see thy self by nature, void of all Grace, as Faith, Hope, Knowledge of God, Christ, and the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, then in the next place, fly in all haste to Jesus Christ, thou being sensible of thy lost Condition without him, secretly perswading of thy Soul, that Jesus Christ standeth open armed to receive thee, to wash away thy Sins, to cloath thee with his Righteousness; and is willing, yea, heartily willing, to present thee before the Presence of the Glory of God, and among the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Company of Angels with exceeding Joy. This being thus, in the next place, do not satisfie thy self with these secret and first Perswasions, which do, or may encourage thee to come to Jesus Christ; but be restless, till thou do find by blessed experience, the glorious Glory of this the second Covenant extended unto thee, and sealed upon thy Soul with the very. Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ. And that thou mayest not slight this my Counsel, I beseech thee in the second place, consider these following things.</p>
            <p>First, if thou do get off thy Convictions, and not the right way, (which is by seeing thy Sins washed away by the Blood of Jesus Christ) it is a question whether ever God will knock at thy Heart again or no; but rather say, Such a one <hi>is joyned to Idols; let him alone.</hi> Hos. 4. 17.
<pb facs="tcp:102284:6"/>
Though he be in a natural state, <hi>let him alone.</hi> Though he be in, or under the Curse of the Law, <hi>let him alone.</hi> Though he be in the very hand of the Devil, <hi>let him alone.</hi> Though he be a going post-haste to Hell, <hi>let him alone.</hi> Though his Damnation will not only be Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Sins against the Law, but also for slighting the Gospel, yet, <hi>let him alone.</hi> My Spirit, my Ministers, my Word, my Grace, my Mercy, my Love, my Pity, my common Providences, shall no more strive with him, <hi>let him alone.</hi> O sad! O miserable! who would slight Convictions that are on their Souls, which tend so much for their good?</p>
            <p>Secondly, if thou shalt not regard how thou do put off Convictions, but put them off without the precious Blood of Christ being savingly applied to thy Soul; thou art sure to have the mispending of that Conviction to prove the hardning of thy Heart against the next time thou art to hear the Word preached or read. This is commonly seen, that those Souls that have not regarded those Convictions that are at first set upon their Spirits, do commonly (and that by the just Judgments of God upon them) grow more hard, more sensless, more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sottish in their Spirits; for some, who formerly would quake and weep, and relent under the hearing of the Word, do now for the present sit so sensless, so fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hardned in their Consciences, that certainly if they should have Hell-fire thrown in their Faces, as it is sometimes cried up in their Ears, they would scarce be moved; and this comes upon them as a just Judgment of God, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if thou do slight these, or those Convictions, that may be set upon thy Heart, by reading of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, or hearing of any other good man preach the Word of God sincerely; thou wilt have the stifling of these or those Convictions to account and answer for at the Day of Judgment: not only thy Sins that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly committed by thee in thy Calling and common Discourse, but thou shalt be called to a reckoning for
<pb facs="tcp:102284:6"/>
slighting Convictions, disregarding of Convictions, which God useth as a special means to make poor Sinners see their lost Condition, and the need of a Saviour. Now here I might add many more Considerations besides these, to the end thou mayest be willing to tend, and listen to Convictions; as,</p>
            <p>First, consider thou hast a precious Soul, more worth than the whole World; and this is commonly worked upon (if ever it be saved) by Convictions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Soul is (for certain) to go to Hell, if thou shalt be a slighter of Convictions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if that go to Hell, thy Body must go thither too, and then never to come out again, <hi>Now consider this, you that</hi> (are apt to) <hi>forget God,</hi> (and his Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) <hi>lest he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver,</hi> Psal. 50. 22.</p>
            <p>But if thou shalt be such a one, that shalt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thy reading of thy Misery, and also of God's Mercy, still persist to go on in thy Sins; know in the first place, that here thou shalt be left, by the things that thou readest, without excuse; and in the World to come thy Damnation will be exceedingly aggravated, for thy not regarding of them, and turning from thy Sins; which was not only reproved by them, but also for rejecting of that Word of Grace that did instruct thee how, and which way, thou should'st be saved from them. And so farewel, I shall leave thee, and also this Discourse, to God, who I know will pass a righteous Judgment both upon that and thee. I am yours, though not to serve your Lusts and filthy minds, yet to reprove, instruct, and according to that proportion of Faith and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which God hath given me, to declare unto you the way of Life and Salvation. Your Judgings, Railings, Surmizings, and disdaining of me, that I shall leave till the fiery Judgment comes, in which the Ostender shall not go unpunished, be he you or me; yet I shall pray for you, wish well to you, and do you what good I can. And that I might not write or speak in vain, Christian,
<pb facs="tcp:102284:7"/>
pray for me to our God, with much Earnestness, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, and frequently, in all your Knockings at our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers door, because I do very much stand in need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for my Work is great, my Heart is vile, the Devil lieth at watch, the World would fain be saying, aha, aha, thus we would have it; and of my self, keep my self I cannot; trust my self I dare not; if God do not help me, I am sure it will not be long before my Heart deceive me, and the World have their Advantage of me; and so God be dishonoured by me, and thou also ashamed to own me. O therefore be much in Prayer for me, thy Fellow, I trust in that glorious Grace that is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Heaven to Sinners, by which they are not only sanctified here in this World, but shall be glorified in that which is to come. Unto which, the Lord of his Mercy bring us all.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the three former Chapters, the Apostle is pleading for the salvation of sinners by Grace, without the Works of the Law, to the end he might confirm the Saints, and also that he might win over all those that did oppose the truth of this Doctrine, or else leave them the more without excuse; and that he might so do, he taketh in hand, First, to shew the state of all men naturally, or as they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102284:10"/>
come into the world by Generation, saying in the third Chapter, <hi>There is none righteous, no not one; there is none that understandeth, there is none that doth good,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had said, It seems there is a Generation of men that think to be saved by the righteousness of the Law, but let me tell them, that they are much deceived, in that they have already sinned against the Law. <hi>For by the disobedience of one, many, yea all, was brought into a state of condemnation;</hi> Rom. 5. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Now in the sixth Chapter, he doth as if he had turned him round to the Brethren, and said, My Brethren you see now that it is clear and evident, that it is freely by the Grace of Christ, that we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit eternal life. And again, for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my brethren, let me tell you, that your condition is wondrous safe, in that you are under Grace, for saith he, <hi>Sin shall not have dominion over you,</hi> that is, neither the damning power, neither the filthy power, so as to destroy your souls; <hi>For you are not under the Law,</hi> that is you are not under that, that will damn you for sin; <hi>But</hi> (you are) <hi>under grace,</hi> or stand thus in relation to God, that though you have sinned, yet you shall be pardoned. <hi>For you are not under the Law, &amp;c.</hi> If any should ask what is the meaning of the word [UNDER] I answer, it signifieth you are not held, kept, or shut up by it, so as to appear before God under that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102284:10"/>
and none but that; or thus, you are not now bound by the authority of the Law, to fulfil it, and obey it, so as to have no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without you so do; or thus, if you transgress against any one tittle of it, you by the power of it must be condemned: No, no, for you are not so under it, that is, not thus under the Law. Again, <hi>For you are not under the Law;</hi> what is meant by this word [LAW?] The word Law, in Scripture, may be taken more ways then one, as might be largely clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There is the Law of Faith, the Law of Sin, the Law of Men, the Law of Works, otherwise called the Covenant of Works, or the first, or old Covenant, <hi>Heb. 8. 13. In that he saith a new Covenant,</hi> (which is the Grace of God, or commonly called the Covenant of Grace) <hi>he hath made the first old;</hi> that is the Covenant of Works, or the Law. I say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word [LAW] and the word [GRACE] in this sixth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> do hold forth the two Covenants, which all Men are under, that is, either the one or the other. <hi>For ye are not under the Law;</hi> that is, you to whom I do now write these words, who are and have been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually brought into the faith of Jesus: you are not under the Law, or under the Covenant of Works. He doth not therefore apply these words to all, but to some, when he saith, <hi>But ye,</hi> mark, [YE] <hi>ye</hi> Believers, <hi>ye</hi> Converted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102284:11"/>
               <hi>ye</hi> Saints, <hi>ye</hi> that have been born again. <hi>Ye, for ye are not under the Law,</hi> implying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are, that are in their natural state, that have not been brought into the Covenant of Grace, by faith in Jesus Christ. The words therefore being thus understood, there is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered these two Truths in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. First, That there are some in Gospel times, that are under the Covenant of Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Secondly, That there is never a Believer under the Law, (as it is a Covenant of Works, but under Grace through Christ) <hi>For ye,</hi> you Believers, you Converted persons, <hi>Ye are not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi> or, for you are delivered and brought into, or under the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>For the first, That there are some that are under the Law, or under the Covenant of Works, see I pray you that Scripture in the third of the <hi>Romans,</hi> where the Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before of sins against the Law, and of the denunciations thereof, against those that are in that condition, he saith, <hi>What things soever the Law saith, it saith to them that are under;</hi> Mark, it saith to them that are under <hi>the Law, That every mouth may be stopped, and all the World become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3. 19. That is, all those that are under the Law, as a Covenant of Works, that are yet in their sins, and unconverted, as I told you before. Again,
<pb facs="tcp:102284:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 18. He saith, <hi>But if you be led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit, you are under the Law,</hi> implying again, that those which are for sinning against the Law, or the works of the Law, either as it is the old Covenant; these are under the Law, and not under the Covenant of Grace. Again, <hi>Gal.</hi> the 3. the 10. Verse, there he saith, <hi>For as many as are of the Works of the Law are under the Curse;</hi> that is, they that are under the Law, are under the Curse; for mark, they that are under the Covenant of Grace are not under the Curse. Now there are but two Covenants; therefore it must needs be that they that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curse are under the Law; seeing those that are under the other Covenant, are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curse, but under the Blessing. <hi>So then, they which be of faith, are blessed with faithful</hi> Abraham, but the rest are under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 9. Now I shall proceed to what I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to speak unto.</p>
            <p>First, I shall shew you what the Covenant of Works, or the Law is, and when it was first given, together with the nature of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I shall shew you what it is to be under the Law, or Covenant of Works, and the miserable state of all those that are under it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I shall shew you who they are that are under this Covenant, or Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:102284:12"/>
Fourthly, I shall shew you how far a man may go, and yet be under this Covenant, or Law.</p>
            <p>For the first, What this Covenant of Works is, and when it was given?</p>
            <p>The Covenant of Works, or the Law here spoken of, is the Law delivered on Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> in two Tables of stone, in ten particular branches, or heads; for this see <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. The Apostle speaking there of the Law, and of some also that through delusions of false Doctrine, was brought again as it were under it, or at least was leaning that way, <hi>Verse</hi> 21. He saith, As for you that desire to be under the Law, I will shew you the mystery of <hi>Abrahams</hi> two Sons which he had by <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Sarah;</hi> these two do signifie the two Covenants, the one named <hi>Agar,</hi> signifies Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> where the Law was delivered to <hi>Moses</hi> on two Tables of stone, <hi>Exod. 24. 12. Chap. 34. 1. Deut.</hi> 10. 1. Which is that, that whosoever is under, he is destitute of, and altogether without the Grace of Christ, in his heart at the present, <hi>Gal. 5. 3, 4. For I testifie again to every man</hi> (saith he) speaking to the same People, <hi>that Christ is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of none effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the Law,</hi> namely, that given on Mount <hi>Sinai. Ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> That is, not that any can be justified by the Law; but his meaning is, all those that seek justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102284:12"/>
by the Works of the Law, they are not such as seek to be under the second Covenant, the Covenant of Grace. Also the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8. The Apostle speaking again of these two Covenants, he saith, <hi>For if the Ministration of Death</hi> (or the Law, for it is all one) <hi>written and engraven in stones</hi> (mark that) <hi>was glorious: how shall not the Ministration of the Spirit</hi> (or the Covenant of Grace) <hi>be rather glorious?</hi> As if he had said, 'Tis true, there was a glory in the Covenant of Works, and a very great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency did appear in it; namely, in that given in the stones on <hi>Sinai,</hi> yet there is another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Covenant of Grace, that doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed it for comfort and glory.</p>
            <p>But secondly, Though this Law was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Moses</hi> from the hands of Angels in two Tables of Stone on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> yet this was not the first appearing of this Law to Man; but even this in substance (tho possibly not so open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) was given to the first Man <hi>Adam,</hi> in the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> in these words, <hi>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every Tree in the Garden thou mayest freely eat. But of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thou shalt surely die,</hi> Gen. 2. 16, 17. Which Commandment then given to <hi>Adam,</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in it, a forbidding to do any one of those things, that was and is accounted evil, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102284:13"/>
at that time it did not appear so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in so many particular heads, as it did when it was delivered on Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> but yet the very same, and that I shall prove thus.</p>
            <p>God commanded <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from all evil against the first Covenant, and not from some sins only: but if God had not commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to abstain from the sins spoken against the Ten Commandments, he had not commanded to abstain from all, but from some; therefore it must needs be, that he then commanded to abstain from all sins forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Law given on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Now that God commanded to abstain from all evil, or sin, against any of the Ten Commandments, when he gave <hi>Adam</hi> the Command in the Garden, it is evident, in that he did punish the sins that was committed against those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that was then delivered on Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> before they were delivered on Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> which will appear as followeth.</p>
            <p>The first, second, and third Commandments were broken by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his men; for they had false Gods which the Lord Executed Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against (as in <hi>Exodus</hi> 12. 12.) and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed their true God; <hi>(Exod.</hi> 7. 17. to the end) for their Gods could neither deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor their people from the hand of God; but in the things wherein they dealt proudly, he was above them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:102284:13"/>
Again, Some judge that the Lord punished the sin against the second Commandment, which <hi>Jacob</hi> was in some measure guilty of, in not purging his house from false gods, with the defiling of his daughter <hi>Dinah,</hi> Gen. 34. 2.</p>
            <p>Again, We find that <hi>Abimelech</hi> thought the sin against the third Commandment so great, that he required no other security of <hi>Abraham</hi> against the fear of mischief that might be done to him by <hi>Abraham,</hi> his son, and his sons son: but only <hi>Abraham's</hi> Oath; <hi>(Gen.</hi> 21. 23.) the like we see between <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Isaac, (Gen.</hi> 31. 53.) the like we find in <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who durst not leave the bones of <hi>Joseph</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> because of the Oath of the Lord, whose Name by so doing, would have been abused, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 19.</p>
            <p>And we find the Lord rebuking his People for the breach of the fourth Commandment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>And for the breach of the fifth, the Curse came upon <hi>Ham, Gen.</hi> 9. 25, 26, 27. And <hi>Ishmael</hi> dishonouring his Father, in mocking <hi>Isaack,</hi> was cast out, as we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 9, 10. The sons in law of <hi>Lot,</hi> for slighting their Father, perish in the overthrow of <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 19. 14, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The sixth Commandment was broken by <hi>Cain,</hi> and so dreadful a Curse and Punishment came upon him, that it made him cry out, <hi>My
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102284:14"/>
Punishment is greater then I can bear,</hi> Gen. 4. 13.</p>
            <p>Again, when <hi>Esau</hi> threatned to slay his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rebecca</hi> sent him away saying, <hi>Why should I be deprived of you both in one day?</hi> hinting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that she knew Murther was to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 54. Which the Lord himself declared likewise to <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 9. 6.</p>
            <p>Again, a notable Example of the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in punishing Murther, we see in the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who drowned the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> Children in the River, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 22. And they themselves were drowned in the Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 27.</p>
            <p>The sin against the Seventh Commandment was punished in the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> &amp;c. with the utter destruction of this City, and themselves, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 24, 25. Yea, they suffer the vengeance of eternal fire, <hi>Jude</hi> 7. Also the Male Seche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, for the sin committed by <hi>Hamors</hi> son, were all put to the sword, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Our first Parents sinned against the Eighth Commandment in taking the forbidden fruit, and so brought the Curse on themselves, and their posterity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p>Again, the punishment due to the breach of this Commandment, was by <hi>Jacob</hi> accounted death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 30, 32. and also by <hi>Jacobs</hi> sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:102284:14"/>
               <hi>Cain</hi> sinning against the Ninth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 9. was therefore cursed to the earth, verse the 11. And <hi>Abraham,</hi> though the Friend of God, was blamed for false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and sent out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 12. 18, 19, 20. and both he and <hi>Sarah</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 20. 9, 10, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sinned against the Tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 15. and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore plagued with great plagues, verse 17. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech,</hi> coveted <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Wife, and the Lord threatned death to him and his, except he restored her again; <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 3. Yea, though he had not come near her, yet for coveting and taking her, the Lord fast closed up the Wombs of his house, verse 18.</p>
            <p>I could have spoken more fully to this, but that I would not be too tedious, but speak what I have to say with as much brevity as I can. But before I pass it, I will besides this, give you an Argument or two more for the further clearing of this; that the substance of the Law delivered on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was before that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Lord to man in the Garden. As first, Death reigned over them that had not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, after the similitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, (that is, though they did not take the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit as <hi>Adam</hi> did) but had the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression been no other, or had their sin been laid to the charge of none but those that did eat
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102284:15"/>
of that fruit, then those that was born to <hi>Adam,</hi> after he was shut out of the Garden, had not had sin; in that they did not actually eat of that fruit, and so had not been slaves to death. But in that Death did reign from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> or from the time of his transgression against the first giving of the Law, till the time the Law was given on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> it is evident, that the substance of the Ten Commandments was given to <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity under that Command, <hi>Eat not of the Tree that is in the midst of the Garden.</hi> But yet if any shall say that it was because of the sin of their Father that death reigned over them: to that I shall answer, that although original sin be laid to the charge of his Posterity, yet it is also for their sins, that they actually committed, that they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued: And again, saith the Apostle, <hi>For where there is no Law, there is no transgression,</hi> Rom. 4. 15. <hi>For sin is not imputed where there is no Law: Nevertheless death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moses, saith he, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13, 14. But if there had been no Law, then there had been no Transgression, and so no death to follow after, as the wages thereof: for death is the wages of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. and sin is the breach of the Law; an actual breach in our particular persons, as well as an actual breach in our publick person, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102284:15"/>
Again, they are no other sins then those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that Law given on <hi>Sinai,</hi> for the which those sins before mentioned was punished; therefore the Law given before by the Lord to <hi>Adam</hi> and his posterity, is the same with that afterwards given on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the Conditions of that on <hi>Sinai,</hi> and of that in the Garden are all one, the one say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> the other saying the same. Also, Judgment denounced against men in both kinds alike; therefore this Law, it appeareth to be the very same, that was given on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the Apostle speaketh but of two Covenants (to wit, Grace and Works) under which two Covenants all are; some under one, and some under the other: Now this to <hi>Adam</hi> is one; therefore that on <hi>Sinai</hi> is one; and all one with this, and that this is a truth, I say I know that the sins against that on <hi>Sinai</hi> was punished by God, for the breach thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was given there: so it doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a truth; for it would be unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with God for to punish for that Law, that was not broken: therefore it was all one with that on <hi>Sinai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Law given on <hi>Sinai,</hi> was for the more clear discovery of those sins that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore committed against it; for though the very substance of the Ten Commandments was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102284:16"/>
in the Garden, before they were received from <hi>Sinai;</hi> yet they lay so darkly in the heart of man, that his sins was not so clearly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as afterwards they were; therefore saith the Apostle, <hi>The Law was added,</hi> Gal. 3. 19. (or more plainly given on <hi>Sinai,</hi> in Tables of Stone) <hi>that the offence might abound;</hi> that is, that it might the more clearly be made manifest, and appear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
            <p>Again, we have a notable resemblance for this at <hi>Sinai,</hi> even in giving the Law; for first, the Law was given twice on <hi>Sinai:</hi> to signifie that indeed the substance of it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before. And secondly, the first tables that was given on <hi>Sinai</hi> was broken, at the foot of the Mount, and the other was preserved whole: to signifie, that though it was the true Law, that was given before, with that given on <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> yet it was not so easie to be read, and to be taken notice of, in that the stones were not whole, but broken, and so the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thereon somewhat defaced, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured.</p>
            <p>But if any object and say, though the sins against the one, be the sins against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so in that they do agree; yet it doth not appear, that the same is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same Covenant of Works with the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:102284:16"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That which was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, you will grant was the Covenant of Works; for it runs thus. <hi>Do thus and live,</hi> do it not, and die; nay <hi>thou shalt surely die.</hi> Now there is but one Covenant of Works: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I prove, that that which was delivered on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> is the Covenant of Works, then all will be put out of doubt. Now that this is so, it is evident.</p>
            <p>First, Consider the two Covenants, are thus called in Scripture, the one the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of death, and the other the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life; the one the Covenant of Works, the other of Grace, but that delivered on <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> is called the ministration of death; that therefore is the Covenant of Works, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. For if</hi> (saith he) <hi>the ministration of death Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and Ingraven in stones, was glorious,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Apostle writing to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> doth labour to beat them off from trusting in the Covenant of Works; but when he comes to give a discovery of that Law, or Covenant (he labouring to take them off from trusting in it) he doth plainly tell them, it is that which was given on <hi>Sinai,</hi> Gal. 4. 24, 25. Therefore that which was delivered in two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Stone on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> is the very same that was given before to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, they running both alike; that in the Garden
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102284:17"/>
saying, <hi>Do this and live; but in the day tho eatest thereof,</hi> (or doest not do this) <hi>thou shal surely die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so is this on <hi>Sinai,</hi> as is evident when he saith, <hi>The man that doth these things shall live by them,</hi> Rom. 10. 5. and in case they break them, even any of them, it saith, <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is every one that continueth not in all things, that are written in the</hi> (whole) <hi>book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. now this being thus cleared, I shall proceed.</p>
            <p>A second thing to be spoken too, is this, to shew what it is to be under the Law; as it is a Covenant of Works, to which I shall speak, and that thus.</p>
            <p>To be under the Law, as it is a Covenant of Works, it is, <hi>to be bound upon pain of eternal damnation, to fulfil and that compleatly, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, every particular point of the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by doing them; do this, and then thou shalt live:</hi> otherwise, <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all</hi> (in every particular thing) (or) <hi>things that are written in the book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. That man that is under the first Covenant stands thus, and only thus, as he is under that Covenant, or Law. Poor souls through ignorance of the nature of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, the Law, that they are under, they do not think their state to be half so bad as it is: when alas there is none in the World
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102284:17"/>
in such a sad condition again besides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; for indeed they do not understand these things. He that is under the Law, as it is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, is like the man that is bound by the Law of his King upon pain of Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of being Hanged, Drawn, and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, not to transgress any of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the King: So here, they that are under the Covenant of Works, they are bound upon pain of eternal banishment, and condemnation, to keep within the compass of the Law of God of Heaven. The Covenant of Works may in this case be compared to the Laws of the Medes and Persians, which being once made, cannot be altered, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 8. You find that when there was a Law made, and given forth, that none should ask a Petition of any, God or Man, but of the King only: this Law being established by the King, <hi>(verse 9.) Daniel</hi> breaking of it, let all do whatever they can, <hi>Daniel</hi> must into the Lions Den, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. So here, I say, there being a Law given, and sealed with the Truth, and the Word of God, (how, that the soul that sinneth shall die, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 4.) whosoever doth abide under this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and dieth under the same, they must and shall into the Lions Den: nay worse then that, for they shall be thrown into Hell, to the very Devils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:102284:18"/>
But to speak in a few partculars for thy better understanding herein. Know first, that the Law of God, or Covenant of Works, doth not contain it self in one particular branch of the Law, but doth extend it self into many, even into all the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> and them Ten into very many more, as might be shewed: so that the danger doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> lie in the breaking of one or Two of these Ten only, but it doth lie even in the transgression of any one of them. As you know, if a King should give forth ten particular commaands to be obeyed, by his subjects upon pain of death: now if any man doth transgress against any one of these ten, he doth commit treason, as if he had broke them all, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> liable to have the sentence of the Law, as certainly passed on him, as if he had broken every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, you know that the Laws being given forth by the King, which if a man keep and obey a long time; yet if at the last he flips and breaks those Laws, he is presently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and condemded by that Law. These things are clear as touching the Law of God, as it is a Covenant of Works: if a man do fulfil nine of the Commandments, and yet breaketh but one, that being broken, will as surely destroy him, and shut him out from the joys of Heaven, as if he had actually
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102284:18"/>
transgressed against them all; for indeed in effect so he hath: there is a notable Scripture for this in the Epistle of <hi>James,</hi> 2 Chap. at the 10 ver. <hi>For whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all;</hi> that is, he hath in effect broken them all, and shall have the voice of them all cry out against him: and it must needs be so saith <hi>James,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, <hi>he that said</hi> (or that Law which said) <hi>Do not commit Adultery, said also, do not Kill. Now if thou commit no Adultery, yet if thou Kill, thou art become a transgressor of the Law.</hi> As thus, it may be thou didst never make to thy self a God of Stone or Wood, or at least not to worship them so really and so openly as the Heathen do; yet if thou hast stollen, born false witness, or lusted after a Woman in thy heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 28. thou hast transgressed the Law; and must for certain, living and dying under that Covenant, perish for ever by the Law: for the Law hath resolved on that before-hand, saying, <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in ALL things;</hi> mark, I pray you, <hi>in all things,</hi> that's the word, and that feals the Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, though a Man do not covet, steal, murther, worship gods of Wood and Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet if they do take the Lords Name in vain, they are for ever gone, living and dying under that Covenant, <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain;</hi> there is the command
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102284:19"/>
but how if we do? then he saith, <hi>The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name in vain:</hi> No, though you live as holy as ever thou can'st, and walk as circumspectly as ever any did; yet if thou doest take the Lords Name in vain thou art gone by that Covenant; <hi>For I will not,</hi> mark, <hi>I will not,</hi> (let him be in never so much danger) <hi>I will not hold him guiltless that takes my Name in vain,</hi> Exod. 20. 7. and so likewise for any other of the ten, do but break them, and thy state is irrecoverable, if thou live and die under that Covenant.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though thou shouldest fulfil this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or Law, even all of it, for a long time, ten, twenty, forty, fifty, or threescore years, yet if thou do chance to slip, and break one of them but once before thou die, thou art also gone and lost by that Covenant; for mark, <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is every one that continueth not in all things</hi> (that continueth not in all things, mark that) <hi>which are written in the Book of the Law to do them:</hi> but if a man do keep all the Law of God his whole life time, only sin one time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dies, that one sin is a breach of the Law, and he hath not continued in doing the things contained therein; (For, for to continue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the sense of this Scripture, is to hold on without any failing, either in thought, word, or deed) therefore I say, though a man do walk up to the Law all his life time, but only
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102284:19"/>
at the very last sin one time before he die, he is sure to perish for ever, dying under that Covenant. For my Friends you must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the Law of God is <hi>(yea)</hi> as well as the Gospel; and as they that are under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace shall surely be saved by it, so, even so, they that are under the Covenant of Works and the Law, they shall surely be damned by it, if continuing there. This is the Covenant of Works, and the nature of it; Namely, not to bate any thing, no, not a mite to him that lives and dies under it; <hi>I tell thee</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>thou shalt not depart thence,</hi> that is from under the Curse, <hi>till thou hast paid the very last mite,</hi> Luke 12. 59.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Again, you must consider, that this Law doth only condemn words and actions, as I said before, but it hath authority to condemn the most secret thought of the heart, being evil; so that if thou do not speak any word that is evil, as swearing, lying, jesting, dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, or any other word that tendeth to, or savoureth of sin, yet if there should chance to pass but one vain thought thorow thy heart but once in all thy life time, the Law taketh hold of it, accuseth, and also will condemn thee for it. You may see one instance for all in the fifth of <hi>Matthew</hi> at the 27, 28. verses, where Christ saith, That though a man do not lie with a woman carnally, yet if he do but look on her, and in his heart lust after her,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102284:20"/>
he is counted by the Law, being rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, such a one that hath committed the sin; and thereby hath laid himself under the condemnation of the Law. And so likewise of all the rest of the commands; if there be any thought that is evil, do but pass thorow thy heart, whether it be against God, or against man in the least measure, though possibly not discerned of thee, or by thee, yet the Law takes hold of thee therefore, and doth by its authority both cast, condemn, and execute thee for thy so doing. The thought of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is sin, <hi>Prov.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Again, the Law is of that nature and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, that it doth not only enquire into the generallty of thy life, as touching several things, whether thou art upright there or no, but the Law doth also follow thee into all thy holy duties, and watcheth over thee there, to see whether thou doest do all things aright there, that is to say, whether when thou doest pray, thy heart hath no wandring thoughts in it; whether thou do every holy duty thou doest perfectly, without the least mixture of sin; and if it do find thee to slip, or in the least mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to fail in any holy duty that thou doest perform, the Law taketh hold on that, and findeth fault with that, so as to render all the holy duties that ever thou didst unavailable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of that: I say, if when thou art a hearing,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102284:20"/>
there is out one vain thought, or in praying but one vain thought, or in any other thing whatsoever, let it be civil or spiritual, one vain thought once in all thy life time, will cause the Law to take such hold on it, that for that one thing, it doth even set open all the Flood gates of Gods wrath against thee, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

me to write, and thee to read: only thus much I would have thee to do at the reading hereof; make a pause, and sit still one quarter of an hour, and muse a little in thy mind thus with thy self, and say; Did I ever break the Law, yea or no? had I ever in all my life time one sinful thought passed thorough my heart since I was born, yea or no? and if thou findest thy self guilty, as I am sure thou canst not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise choose but do, unless thou shut thy eyes against thy every days practice; then I say conclude thy self guilty of the breach of the first Covenant. And when that this is done, be sure in the next place, thou do not straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way forget it, and put it out of thy mind, that thou art condemned by the same Covenant; and then do not content thy self until thou do find, that God hath sent thee a pardon from Heaven, through the Merits of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Mediator of the second Covenant. And if God shall but give thee a heart to take this my counsel, I do make no question but these words spoken by me, will prove an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument for the directing of thy heart, to the right remedy, for the salvation of thy soul.</p>
            <p>Thus much now touching the Law and the severity of it, upon the person that is found under it, having offended, or broken any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of it, either in thought, word, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and now before I do proceed to the next

            <p>The first Objection, And first, but you will say, methinks you speak very harsh; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to daunt a body: set the case therefore, that a man after he hath sinned, and broken the Law, repenteth of his wickedness, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to do so no more; Will not God have mercy then, and save a poor sinner then?</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answ.</hi> I told you before, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant once broken, will execute upon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender that which it doth threaten to lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; and as for your supposing that your repenting, and promising to do so no more, may help well, and put you in a condition to attain the mercy of God by the Law: these thoughts do flow from gross ignorance, both of the nature of sin, and also of the nature of the justice of God. And if I was to give you a description, of one in a lost condition for the present, I would brand him out with such a mark of ignorance as this is.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Answ.</hi> The Law as it is a Covenant of works, doth not allow of any repentance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, to those that live and die under it; for the Law being once broken by thee, never speaks good unto thee, neither doth God at all regard thee: If thou be under that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, notwithstanding all thy repentings, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102284:22"/>
also promises, to do so no more. No, saith the Law, thou hast sinned, therefore I must curse thee; for it is my nature to curse, even, and nothing else but curse every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that doth in any point transgress against me, <hi>Gal..</hi> 3. 10. <hi>They brake my Covenant, and I regarded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not saith the Lord,</hi> Heb. 8. Let them cry, I will not regard them; let them report I will not regard them; they have broken my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and done that in which I delighted not; therefore by that Covenant I do curse, and not bless; damn, and not save, frown, and not smile; reject, and not embrace; charge sin, and not forgive it. <hi>They brake my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and I regarded them not.</hi> So that I say if thou break the Law, the first Covenant; and thou being found there, God looking on thee thorow that, he hath no regard on thee, no pity for thee, no delight in thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But hath not the Law promises as well as threatnings? saying, <hi>The man that doth these things shall live,</hi> (mark, he shall live) <hi>by them,</hi> or in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, to break the Commandments, is not to keep or fulfil the same; but thou hast broken them, therefore the promise doth not belong to thee by that Covenant. Secondly, the promises that are of the Law, are conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, and so not performed, unless there be a full and continual obedience to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102284:22"/>
of it, and that without the feast sin. <hi>Do this,</hi> mark, <hi>do this,</hi> and afterwards <hi>thou shalt live;</hi> but if thou break one point of it once in all thy life, thou hast not done the Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the the promises following the Law do not belong unto thee, if one sin hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by thee. As thus, (I will give you a plain instance) <q>Set the case there be a Law made by the King, that if any man speak a word against him, he must be put to death, and this must not be revoked, but must for certain be expected on the offender; though though there be a promise made to them that do not speak a word against him, that they shall have great love from him: yet this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is nothing to the offender, he is like to have no share in it, or to be ever the better for it; but contrariwise, the Law that he hath offended must be executed on him; for his sin shutteth him out from a share of, or in the Promises.</q> So it is here, there is a promise made indeed, but to whom? Why, it is to none but those that live without sinning against the Law: but if thou (I say) sin one time against it in all thy lifetime, thou art gone, and not one promise belongs to thee, if thou continue under this Covenant. Methinks the Prisoners at the bar, having offended the Law (and the charge of a just Judge towards them) do much hold forth the Law, as it is a Covenant of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102284:23"/>
Works, and how it deals with them that are under it. The Prisoner having offended cries out for mercy; good my Lord mercy (saith he) pray my Lord pity me; the Judge saith, What canst thou say for thy self, that Sentence of Death should not be passed upon thee? Why, nothing but this, I pray my Lord be merciful: But he answers again, Friend, the Law must take place, the Law must not be broken: The Prisoner saith, Good my Lord spare me, and I will never do so any more: The Judge not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the mans out-cries, and sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, must according to the tenor of the Law, pass Judgment upon him, and the Sentence of the Condemnation must be read to the Prisoner, though it makes them fall down dead to hear it, if he executes the Law, as he ought to do. And just thus it is concerning the Law of God.</p>
            <p>Object. 3. I, but sometimes (for all your haste) the Judge doth also give some Pardons, and forgive some offenders, notwithstanding their offences, though he be a Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not because the Law is merciful, but because there is manifested the love of the Judge, (not the love of the Law) I beseech you to mark this distinction; for if a man that hath deserved death by the Law, be notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this forgiven his offence; it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102284:23"/>
the Law saith, spare him, but it is the love of the Judge (or Chief Magistrate) that doth set the man free from the Condemnation of the Law: But mark, here the Law of Men and the Law of God do differ; the Law of Man is not so irrevokable, but if the Supream please, he may sometimes grant a Pardon, without sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction given for the offence; but the Law of God is of this nature, that if the Man be found under it, and a transgrssor, or one that hath transgressed against it, before that Prisoner can be released, there must be a full and compleat satisfaction given to it, either by the mans own life, or by the blood of some other man; <hi>For without shedding of blood there is no remission,</hi> Heb. 9. 22. that is, there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from under the curse of the Law of God; and therefore however the Law of man may be made of none effect, sometimes by shewing mercy without giving of a full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, yet the Law of God cannot be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, nor at the least give way, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son offending that, should escape the curse, and not be damned, except some one do give a full and compleat satisfaction to it for him, and bring the Prisoner into another Covenant, (to wit) the Covenant of Grace, which is more easie, and soul-refreshing, and sin-pardoning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:102284:24"/>
I say therefore, you must understand, that if there be a Law made that reaches the life, to take it away for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> given by the offender against it; then it is clear, that if the man be spared and saved, it is not the Law that doth give the man this advantage, but it is the meer mercy of the King, either because he hath a ransom, or satisfaction some other way; or being provoked thereto out of his own love to the person whom he saveth. Now thou also having transgressed and broken the Law of God, if the Law be not executed upon thee, it is not because the Law is merciful, or can pass by the least offence done by thee, but thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance comes another way: Therefore I say, however it be by the Laws of men, where they be corrupted and perve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted, yet the Law of God is of that nature, that if it hath not thy own blood, or the blood of some other man (for it calls for no loss) for to ransom thee from the curse of it, being due to thee for thy transgression, and to satisfie the cries, the doleful cries thereof, and ever for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thee pure and spotless before God (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this fiery Law) thou art gone if thou hadst a thousand souls; <hi>For without shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood there is no remission,</hi> Heb. 9. 22. No forgivness of the least sin against the Law.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:102284:24"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. But you will say, I do not only repent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of my formed life, and also promise to do so no more, but now I do labour to be righteous, and to live a holy life; and now instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a breaker of the Law, I do labour to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the same: what say you to that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> See the case thou couldest walk like an Angel of God; set the case thou couldest fulfill the whole Law, and live from this day to thy lives end, without sinning in thought, word, or deed, which is unpossible: but I say, set the case it should be so, why, thy state is as bad, (if thou be under the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) as ever it was. For first, I know thou darest not say but thou hast at one time or other sinned; and it so, then the Law hath condemned thee; and it so, then I am sure, that thou with all thy actions, and works of righteousness, canst not remove the dreadful and unresistible Curse that is already laid upon thee, by that Law which thou art under, and which thou hast sinned against, though thou livest the holiest life that any man can live in this world, being under the Law of Works, and so not under the Covenant of Grace, thou must be cut off without remedy; for thou hast sinned, though afterwards thou live never so well.</p>
            <p>The reasons for this that hath been spoken, are these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:102284:25"/>
First, Tho nature of Gods justice calls for it, that is, it calls for irrecoverable ruin on them that transgress against this Law: for justice gave it, and justice looks to have it compleatly, and continually obeyed, or else justice is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take place, and execute its office, which is to punish the transgressor against it; you must understand that the justice of God is as unchangable as his love; his justice cannot change its nature, justice it is, if it be pleased, and justice it is be if it displeased. The justice of God in this place, may be compared to fire; there is a great fire made in some place, if thou do keep out of it, it is fire; if thou do fall into it thou wilt find it fire; and therefore the Apostle useth this as an Argument to stir up the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to stick close to Jesus Christ, lest they fell under the justice of God, by these words, <hi>Heb. 12. 29. For our God is a consuming fire:</hi> into which if thou fall, it is not for thee to get out again, as it is with some that fall into a material fire; no, but he that falls into this, he must lie there for ever; as it is clear where he saith, <hi>Isa. 33. 14. Who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings, and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire?</hi> For justice once offended, knoweth not how to shew any pitty or compassion to the offender; but runs on him like a Lion, takes him by the throat, throws him into Prison, and there he is sure to lie, and that to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102284:25"/>
unless infinite satisfaction be given to it, which is impossible to be given by any of (us) the sons of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the faithfulness of God calls for irrecoverable ruine, to be poured out on those that shall live and die under this Covenant. If thou having sinned but one sin against this Covenant, and shouldest afterwards escape damning, God must be unfaithful to himself, and to his Word, which both agree as one. First, he would be unfaithful to himself; to himself; that is, to his Justice, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Righteousness, Wisdom, and Power, if he should offer to stop the runnings out of his Justice, for the damning of them that have offended it. And secondly, he would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to his Word (his written Word) and deny, disown, and break that, of which he hath said, <hi>Luk. 16. 7. It is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the Law to fail,</hi> or be made of none effect; now if he should not according to his certain decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations therein, take vengeance on those that fall and die within the threat, and sad curses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, it that, his word could not be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Because otherwise he would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the sayings of his Prophets, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the sayings of his enemies: his Prophets say he will take vengeance, his enemies say he will not; his Prophets say he will remember
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102284:26"/>
their iniquities, and recompence them into their bosom; but his enemies say they shall do well, and they <hi>shall have peace though they walk after the imagination of their own heart;</hi> Deut. 29. 19, 20. and be not so strict as the word commands, and do not as it saith: but let me tell thee, hadst thou a thousand souls, and each of them was worth a thousand worlds, God would set them all on a light fire; if they fall within the condemnings of his Word, and thou die without a Jesus, even the right Jesus; <hi>for the Scriptures cannot be broken.</hi> What doest thou think that God, Christ, Prophets, and Scriptures, will all lie for thee? and falsifie their words for thee? it will be but ill ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy soul upon that.</p>
            <p>And the reasons for it are these, First, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God is God, and Secondly, because Man is Man.</p>
            <p>First, Because God is perfectly just, and eternally just, perfectly holy, and etern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lly holy, perfectly faithful, and eternally faithful; that is without any variableness or shadow of turning: but perfectly continueth the same, and can as well cease to be God, as to alter or change the nature of his God-head. And as he is thus the perfection of all perfections, he gave out his Law to be obeyed, but if any offend it, then they fall into the hands of this his eternal justice, and so must drink of his irrecoverable
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102284:26"/>
wrath, which is the execution of the same ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. I say, this being thus, the Law being broken, justice takes place, and so faithfulness followeth, to see that execution be done, and also to testifie that he is true, and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his unspeakable, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nsupportable, and unchangeable vengeance on the party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because thou art not as infinite as God, but a poor created weed, that is here to day and gone to morrow; and not able to answer God in his Essence, Being, and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, thou art found to fall under him, for that thy soul or body can do nothing that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in such a way as to satisfie this God, which is an infinite God in all his attributes</p>
            <p>But to declare unto you the misery of man by this Law to purpose, I do beseech you to take notice of these following particulars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what hath been already spoken. First, I shall shew the danger of them by reason of the Law, as they come from <hi>Adam.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they are in their own persons particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, as they come from <hi>Adam,</hi> they are in a sad condition; because he left them a broken Covenant: or take it thus, because they, while they were in him, did with him break that Covenant. Oh! this was the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that <hi>Adam</hi> left to his posterity, it was a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102284:27"/>
broken Covenant, insomuch that death reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over all his Children, and doth still to this day, as they come from him, both natural and eternal death, <hi>Rom.</hi> the 5. It may be Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, Swearer, Liar, Thief, thou dost not think of this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, he did not only leave them a broken Covenant, but also made them (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) sinners against it: he made them sinners; <hi>By one mans disobedience many were made sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> Rom 5. 19. And this is worse than the first.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, not only so, but he did deprive them of their strength, by which at first they were enabled to stand, and left them no more than dead men. Oh helpless state! Oh! how beggarly and miserable are the sons of <hi>Adam?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, not only so; but also before he left them, he was the conduit-pipe through which the Devil did convey of his poisoned spawn and venome nature into the hearts of <hi>Adams</hi> sons and daughters, by which they are at this day so strongly and so violently carried away, that they flie as fast to Hell and the Devil, by reason of sin, as chaff before a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wind.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, in a word, <hi>Adam</hi> led them out of their Paradise, that is one more; and put out their eyes, that is another; and left them to the leading of the Devil; O sad! Canst thou
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102284:27"/>
hear this, and not have thy ears to tingle and burn on thy head? Can'st thou read this and not feel this and not feel thy Conscience begin to throb and dagg? If so, surely it is because thou art either possessed with the Devil, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides thy self. But I pass this, and come to the second thing, which is the cause of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a sad condition, which is by reason of their being in their Particular persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
            <p>First, therefore they that are under the Law, they are in a sad condition; because they are under that which is more ready (through our infirmity) to curse than to bless; they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that called the ministration of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. that is, they are under that dispensation, or administration, whose proper work is to curse, and condemn, and nothing else.</p>
            <p>Secondly, their condition is sad, who are under the Law; because they are not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that administration that doth condemn, but also that which doth wait an opportunity to condemn: the Law doth not wait that it might be gracious, but it doth wait to curse and condemn; I, it came on purpose to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover sin, <hi>Rom. 5. 20. The Law entred,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>that the offence might abound;</hi> or appear indeed to be that which God doth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102284:28"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:102284:29"/>
hate; and also to curse for that which hath been committed, as he saith, <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them;</hi> Gal. 3. 10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they are in a sad condition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>because that administration they are under, that are under the Law, doth always find fault with the sinners obedience, as well as his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience; (if it be not done in a right spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which they that are under that Covenant cannot do, by reason of their being destitute of Faith) therefore, I say, it doth controle them, saying, This was not well done; this was done by the halves; this was not done freely, and that was not done perfectly, and out of love to God: and hence it is that some men, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they labour to live as holy as ever they can, according to the Law; yet they do not live a peaceable life, but are full of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, full of guilt and torment of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; finding themselves to fail here, and to fall short there, omitting this good which the Law commands, and doing that evil which the Law forbids; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver giveth them one good word for all their pains.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they that are under the Law are in a sad condition; because they are under that administration that will never be contented
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102284:29"/>
with what is done by the sinner: if thou be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Covenant, work as hard as thou can'st, the Law will never say, <hi>Well done;</hi> never say, <hi>My good servant:</hi> No, but always it will be driving of thee faster, hastning of thee harder, giving of thee fresh commands, which thou must do; and upon pain of damnation not to be left undone. Nay, it is such a Master that will curse thee, not only for thy sins, but also because thy good works were not so well done, as they ought to be.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, they that are under this Covenant or Law, their state is very sad; because this Law doth command impossible things of him that is under it; and yet doth but right in it, seeing man at the first, had in <hi>Adam</hi> strength to stand, if he would have used it, and the Law, was given then, (as I said before) when man was in his full strength; and therefore no unequality, if it commands the same still, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God that gave thee strength, did not take it away. I will give you a similitude for the clearing of it; set the case that I give to my servant ten pounds, with this charge, lay it out for my best advantage, that I may have my own again with profit; now if my servant contrary to my command, goeth and spends my money in a disobedient way; is it any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality in me to demand of my servant what I gave him at first? nay, and though he have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102284:30"/>
nothing to pay, I may lawfully cast him into Prison, and keep him there until I have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. So here, the Law was delivered to man, at the first when he was in a possibility to have fulfilled it; now then, though man have lost his strength, yet God is just in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the same work to be done. I, and if they do not do the same things, I say, that are impossible for them to do, it is just with God to damn them, seeing it was they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that brought themselves into this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore saith the Apostle, <hi>What things soever the Law, or Commands saith, it saith to them that are under the Law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3. 19. and this is thy sad condition that art under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>But if any should object and say, but the Law doth not command unpossible things of natural man.</p>
            <p>I should answer in this case as the Apostle did in another, very much like unto it, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>They know not what they say, nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they affirm:</hi> For doth not the Law command thee to love the Lord thy God, with all thy soul, with all thy strength, with all thy might; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and can the natural man do this? <hi>Jer. 13. 23. How can those that are accustomed to do evil, do that which is commanded in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular?
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102284:30"/>
Can the</hi> Ethiopian <hi>change his skin, or the</hi> Leopard <hi>his spots?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth the Law command thee to do good, and nothing but good? and that with all thy soul, heart, and delight, (which the Law as a Covenant of Works called for) and can'st thou being Carnal do that? But there is no man that hath understanding, if he should hear thee say so, but would say that thou wast either bewitched, or stark mad.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, they that are under the Law, are in a sad condition; because, that though they follow the Law, or Covenant of Works, I say, though they follow it, it will not lead them to Heaven; no, but contrariwise, it will lead them under the Curse. <hi>It is not possible,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, that any should be justified by the Law,</hi> (or by our following of it) <hi>for by that is the knowledge of sin,</hi> and by it we are condemned for the same, which is far from leading us to life, being the ministration of death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and again, <hi>Israel that followeth after the Law of righteousness, hath not attained to the Law of righteousness: wherefore? because they sought it not by faith, but by the Law, and by the Works thereof,</hi> Rom. 9. 30, 31, 32.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, they that are under the Law, are in a sad condition; because they do not know whether ever they shall have any wages for their work or no; they shall have no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102284:31"/>
of the pardon of their sins, neither any hopes of eternal life: but poor hearts as they are, they work for they do not know what, even like a poor Horse that works hard all day, and at night hath a dirty Stable for his pains; so thou mayest work hard all the days of thy life, and at the day of death instead of having of a glorious rest in the Kingdom of Heaven, thou mayest, nay, thou shalt have for thy sins, the damnation of thy soul and body in Hell to all eternity; for as much as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Law, if thou sinnest, it doth not take notice of any good work done by thee; but takes its advantage to destroy and cut off thy soul for the sin thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, they that are under the Law, are in a sad condition, because they are under that administration, upon whose souls God doth not smile (they dying there) for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration that God doth smile upon his Children through, is the Covenant of Grace, they being in Jesus Christ, the Lord of life and consolation: but contrariwise to those that are under the Law; for they have his frowns, his rebukes; his threatnings, and with much severity they must be dealt withal. For <hi>they break my Covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord,</hi> Heb. 8. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:102284:31"/>
Ninthly, they are in a sad condition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are out of the faith of Christ: they that are under the Law, have not the faith of Christ in them; for that dispensation which they are under, is not the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, <hi>The Law is not of faith,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, because they have not received the Spirit; for that is received <hi>by the bearing of faith,</hi> and not by the Law, nor the Works there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, in a word, if thou live and die under that Covenant, Jesus Christ will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray for thee, neither let thee have one drop of his Blood to wash away thy sins; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shalt thou be so much as one of the least in the Kingdom of Heaven; for all these privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges come to souls under another Covenant, as the Apostle saith, <hi>For such are not under the Law, but under Grace,</hi> that is, such as have a share in the benefits of Jesus Christ, or such as are brought from under the first Covenant, into the second; or from under the Law, into the Grace of Christs Gospel; without which Covenant of Grace, and being found in that, there is no soul can have the least hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, no joy in the holy Ghost, no share in the priviledges of Saints, because they are tied up from them by the limits and bonds of the Covenant of Works. For you must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102284:32"/>
that these two Covenants have their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral bounds and limitations, for the ruling and keeping in subjection, or giving of freedom to the parties under the said Covenants: now they that are under the Law, are within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass and the jurisdiction of that, and are bound to be in subjection to that; and living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under that, they must stand and fall to that, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>To his own master, he shall stand or fall.</hi> The Covenant of Grace doth admit to those that are under it, also liberty and freedom, together with commanding of subjection to the things contained in it, which I shall speak to further hereafter.</p>
            <p>But now, that the former things may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made to appear, that is, what the sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all them that are under the Law is; as I have shewn you something of the nature of the Law, so also shall I shew, that the Law was added and given for that purpose, that it might be so with those that are out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</p>
            <p>First, God did give the Law, that sin might abound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20. not that it should take away sin in any, but to discover the sin which is already begotten, or that may hereafter be begotten, by Lust and Satan: I say, this is one proper work of the Law to make manifest sin; it is sent to find fault with the sinner, and it doth also watch that it may so do, and it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102284:32"/>
doth take all advantages for the accomplishing of its work in them that give ear thereto, or do not give ear, if it have the rule over them. I say, it is like a man that is sent by his Lord to see and pry into the labours and works of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, taking every advantage to discover their infirmities and failings, and to chide them; yea, to throw them out of the Lords favour for the same.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another great end why the Lord did add or give the Law, it was that no man might have any thing to lay to the charge of the Lord, for his condemning of them that do transgress against the same. You know that if a man should be had before an Officer or Judge, and there be condemned, and yet by no Law; he that condemns him, might be very well reprehended or reproved for passing the Judgment; yea the party him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self might have better ground to plead for his liberty, than the other to plead for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of him: but this shall not be so in the judgment day, but contrariwise; for then every man shall be forced to lay his hand on his mouth, and hold his tongue at the Judgment of God, when it is passed upon them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith the Apostle, <hi>What things soever the Law saith, it saith to them that are under the Law</hi> (that is all the commands, all the curses and threatnings that are spoken by it, are spoken
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102284:33"/>
saith he) <hi>that every mouth may be stopped;</hi> mark, I beseech you, it saith, saith he, <hi>that every mouth might be stopped, and that all the world might become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3. 19. So that now in case any in the judgment day, should object against the judgment of God, as those in the 25. of <hi>Matthew</hi> do, saying, Lord when saw we thee thus and thus? And why dost thou pass such a sad sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon us? surely this is injustice and not equity: Now for the preventing of this, the Law was given; I, and that it might prevent thee to purpose, God gave it betimes, before either thy first father had sinned, or thou wast born. So that again, if there should be these Objections offered against the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord in justice, and judgment, saying: Lord, why am I thus condemned, I did not know it was sin? now against these two, was the Law given, and that betimes, so that both these are answered. If the first come in and say, why am I judged? why am I damned? then will the Law come in, even all the Ten Commandments, with every one of their cries against thy soul, the first saying, he hath sinned against me, damn him; the second saying also, he hath transgressed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, damn him; the third also saying the same, together with the 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102284:33"/>
10. even all of them will discharge themselves against thy soul, if thou die under the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, saying he, or they, have transgressed against us, damn them, damn them: and I tell thee also, that these ten great guns, the Ten Commandments, will with discharging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in justice against thy soul, so rattle in thy conscience, that thou wilt in spight of thy teeth, be immediately put to silence, and have thy mouth stopped; and let me tell thee further, that if thou shalt appear before God, to have the Ten Commandments discharge themselves against thee, thou hadst better be tied to a tree, and have ten, yea ten thousand of the biggest pieces of Ordnance in the world, to be shot off against thee; for these could go no further, but only to kill the body; but they both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soul to be tormented in Hell with the Devil to all eternity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, if the second thing should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, saying, But Lord I did not think this had been sin, or the other had been sin; for no body told me so: then also will the giving of the Law take off that, saying, nay, but I was given to thy father <hi>Adam</hi> before he had sinned, or before thou wast born, and have ever since been in thy soul to convince thee of thy sins, and to controul thee for doing the thing that was not right. Did not I secretly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102284:34"/>
tell thee at such a time, in such a place, when thou wast doing of such a thing, with such a one, or when thou wast all alone, that this was a sin, and that God did forbid it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou didst commit it, God would be displeased with thee for it? And when thou wast thinking to do such a thing, at such a time, did not I say, forbear, do not so? God will smite thee, and punish thee for it, if thou doest do it? And besides God did so order it, that you had me in your Houses, in your Bibles, and also you could speak and talk of me; thus pleading the truth, thou shalt be forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it is so; nay, it shall be so in some sort with the very Gentiles and barbarous People, that fall far short of that light we have in these parts of the world (for saith the Apostle) <hi>The Gentiles which have not the Law, these do by nature the things contained in the Law; these having not the Law</hi> (that is, not written as we have, yet they) <hi>are a Law unto themselves, which sheweth the works of the Lavv is vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts,</hi> Rom. 2. 14, 15. that is, they have the Law of works in them by nature, and therefore they shall be left without excuse; for their own consciences shall stand up for the truth of this, where he saith, <hi>Their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing, or else excusing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> I but when? <hi>Why, in the day vvhen God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102284:34"/>
shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Gospel,</hi> Rom. 2. 15, 16. So this I say is another end, for which the Lord did give the Law, namely, that God might pass a sentence in righteousness, without being charged with any injustice, by those that shall fall under it, in the judgment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth end, why the Lord did give the Law, it was, because they that die out of Jesus Christ, might not only have their mouths stopped, but also that their persons might become guilty before God <hi>(Rom.</hi> 3. 19.) and indeed this will be the ground of silencing (as I said before) they finding themselves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their consciences backing the truth of the judgment of God passed upon them, <hi>they shall become guilty,</hi> that is, they shall be fit vessels for the wrath of God to be poured out into, being filled with guilt, by reason of transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions against the Commandments: thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall the parties under the first Covenant <hi>be fitted to destruction</hi> (Rom. 9. 22.) even as wood, or straw, being well dried, is fitted for the fire, and the Law was added and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and speaks to this very end that sins might be shewn, mouths might be stopt from quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling: <hi>And that all the vvorld,</hi> mark, <hi>the vvorld might become guilty before God,</hi> and so be in justice for ever and ever overthrown, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their sins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:102284:35"/>
And this will be so, for these reasons.</p>
            <p>First, Because <hi>God</hi> hath a time to magnifie his <hi>justice,</hi> and <hi>holiness,</hi> as well as to shew his <hi>forbearance</hi> and <hi>mercy.</hi> We read in <hi>Scripture</hi> that his <hi>eyes</hi> are too pure to behold <hi>iniquity,</hi> Hab 1. 13. and then we shall find it true. We read in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that he will <hi>magnifie</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> and make it <hi>honourable,</hi> and then he will do it indeed.</p>
            <p>Now because the <hi>Lord</hi> doth not strike so soon as he is provoked by <hi>sin,</hi> therefore <hi>poor souls</hi> will not know, nor regard the <hi>Justice</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> neither do they consider the <hi>time</hi> in which it must be advanced (which will be) when <hi>men</hi> drop under the <hi>wrath</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as fast as <hi>hail</hi> in a <hi>mighty storm,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9. Psal. 50. 21, 22. Now therefore look to it <hi>all you</hi> that count the <hi>long-suffering</hi> and <hi>forbearance</hi> of <hi>Gods slackness;</hi> and because for the present he keepeth <hi>silence,</hi> therefore to think that he is like unto <hi>your selves.</hi> No, no, but know that <hi>God</hi> hath his set time for every <hi>purpose</hi> of his, and in its time, it shall be advanced most marvellously, to the <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing astonishment</hi> and <hi>overthrow</hi> of that <hi>soul,</hi> that shall be dealt withal by <hi>Justice</hi> and the <hi>Law.</hi> O! how will <hi>God</hi> advance his <hi>Justice?</hi> O! how will <hi>God</hi> advance his <hi>Holiness?</hi> First, By shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>men</hi> that he in <hi>justice</hi> cannot, will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>them,</hi> because <hi>they</hi> have sinned: And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In that his <hi>holiness</hi> will not give way
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102284:35"/>
for such <hi>unclean wretches</hi> to abide in his <hi>sight, his eyes</hi> are so pure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because <hi>God</hi> will make it appear that <hi>he</hi> will be as good as his <hi>word</hi> to <hi>sinners; sinners</hi> must not look to escape <hi>always,</hi> though they may escape a <hi>while,</hi> yet they shall not go for all ado <hi>unpunished;</hi> no, but they shall have their due to a <hi>farthing,</hi> when every <hi>threatning</hi> and <hi>curse</hi> shall be accomplished, and fulfilled on the head of the <hi>transgressor.</hi> Friend, there is never an <hi>idle word</hi> that thou speakest, but <hi>God</hi> will account with thee for it; there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a <hi>lie</hi> thou tellest, but <hi>God</hi> will reckon with thee for it; nay, there shall not pass, so much as <hi>one passage</hi> in all thy <hi>life-time,</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>righteous God,</hi> will have it in the <hi>trial</hi> by his <hi>Law</hi> (if thou die under it) in the <hi>Judgment-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say: But who are those that are thus under the <hi>Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Those that under the <hi>Law,</hi> may be branched out into three ranks of <hi>men:</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, first such as are <hi>grosly prophane,</hi> or such as are <hi>more refined;</hi> which may be two ways, some in a <hi>lower sort,</hi> and some in a <hi>more eminent vvay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Then they are under the <hi>Lavv</hi> as a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> who are <hi>open prophane</hi> and <hi>ungodly vvretches,</hi> such as delight not only in <hi>sin,</hi> but also make their boast of the same,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102284:36"/>
and brag at the <hi>thoughts</hi> of committing of it: now as for such as these are; there is a <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in the first <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the 1 Chap. at the 9. and 10. verses, which is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table one to this purpose, <hi>The Lavv</hi> (saith he) <hi>is not made for a righteous man</hi> (not as it is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works) <hi>but for the</hi> (unrighteous or) <hi>lawless and disobedient; for the ungodly, and for sinners, for unholy, and prophane, for murderers of fathers; and murderers of mothers, for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slayers, for whore-mongers, for them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file themselves with mankind, for men-stealers, liars</hi> (look to it liars) <hi>for perjured persons, and</hi> (in a word) <hi>if there be any other thing that is not according to sound Doctrine.</hi> These are one sort of <hi>People</hi> that are under the <hi>Law,</hi> and so under the <hi>curse</hi> of the same, whose due is to drink up the <hi>brim-full Cup</hi> of <hi>Gods eternal ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,</hi> and therefore I beseech you not to deceive your selves. <hi>For know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Neither Fornicators, nor Idolators, nor Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, nor Effeminates, nor Abusers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. Poor souls, you think that you may have your <hi>sins,</hi> your <hi>lusts</hi> and <hi>pleasures,</hi> and yet you shall do pretty well, and be let to go free in the <hi>Judgment day:</hi> but see what
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102284:36"/>
               <hi>God</hi> saith of such in that 9. of <hi>Deuternomy,</hi> at the 19. and 20. verses, <hi>Which shall bless them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their heart, saying, I shall have peace, I shall be saved, I shall do as well as others, in the day when God shall judge the World by Jesus Christ</hi> (but saith God) <hi>I will not spare them; no, but my anger and my jealousie shall smoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. How far, even to the executing all the curses that are written in the Law of God upon them.</hi> Nay, saith God, I will be even with them; <hi>For I will blot out their names from under Heaven.</hi> And indeed it must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be so, because such <hi>souls</hi> are <hi>unbelievers,</hi> in their sins, and under the Law, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, will not shew any <hi>mercy</hi> on them; for it is not the <hi>administration</hi> of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> but the <hi>administration</hi> of <hi>death</hi> and <hi>destruction</hi> (as you have it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> the 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> the 7, 9. <hi>verses)</hi> and all those, every one of them, that are <hi>open prophane</hi> and <hi>scandalous wretches,</hi> are under it, and have been so ever since they came into the <hi>World</hi> to this <hi>day;</hi> and they will for certain live and die under the same <hi>dispensation,</hi> and then be <hi>damned</hi> to all <hi>eternity,</hi> if they be not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> from under that <hi>Covenant,</hi> into, and under the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> (of which I shall speak in its place) and yet for all this, how brag and cranck are our <hi>poor wantons,</hi> and <hi>wicked ones,</hi> in this day of <hi>forbearance?</hi> as if <hi>God</hi> would never have a <hi>reckoning</hi> with them,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102284:37"/>
as if there was no <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>condemn</hi> them, as if there was no <hi>hell fire</hi> to put them into: but Oh! how will they be deceived? when they shall see <hi>Christ</hi> sitting upon the <hi>Judgment-seat,</hi> having laid aside his <hi>priestly</hi> and <hi>prophetical Office,</hi> and appearing only as a <hi>Judge</hi> to the <hi>wicked.</hi> When they shall see all the records of <hi>Heaven</hi> unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laid open; when they shall see each <hi>man</hi> his <hi>name</hi> out of the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and in the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> when they shall see <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Majesty, Christ</hi> in his <hi>Majesty,</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> in their <hi>Dignity;</hi> but themselves in their <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity,</hi> what will they say then? whither will they fliethen? where will they leave their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? <hi>Isa,</hi> 10. 3. O sad state!</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are under the <hi>Law,</hi> also, who do not only so break and disobey the <hi>Lavv,</hi> but follow after the Law, as hard as ever they can, seeking <hi>justification</hi> thereby; that is, though a <hi>man</hi> should abstain from the <hi>sins</hi> against the <hi>Law,</hi> and labour to fulfil the <hi>Law,</hi> and give up himself to the <hi>Lavv,</hi> yet if he look no further than the <hi>Lavv,</hi> he is still under the <hi>Lavv;</hi> and for all his <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Lavv,</hi> the <hi>righteous Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> he shall be destroyed by that <hi>Lavv. Friend,</hi> you must not understand that none but <hi>profane persons</hi> are under the Law: No, but you must understand that a man may be turned from a vain, loose, open, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Conversation,</hi> and <hi>sinning</hi> against the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102284:37"/>
               <hi>Law,</hi> to a <hi>holy, righteous, religious life,</hi> and yet be in the same <hi>state,</hi> under the same <hi>Law,</hi> and as sure to be <hi>damned</hi> as the other that are more <hi>prophane</hi> and <hi>loose.</hi> And though you may say this is very strange, yet I shall both say it, and prove it to be true. Read with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that <hi>Scripture</hi> in <hi>Romans</hi> 9. at the 30, 31. <hi>verses,</hi> where the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaking of the very same thing, saith, <hi>But Israel which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the Law of righteousness;</hi> mark, that followed after the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>righteousness;</hi> they notwithstanding their earnest pursuit, or hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>righteousness, fell short of the Law of righteousness.</hi> It signifies thus much to us, that let a man be never so earnest, so servent, so restless, so serious, so ready, so apt and willing to follow the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>righteousness</hi> thereof, if he be under that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> he is gone, he is lost, he is deprived of eternal life; because he is not under the <hi>ministration</hi> of <hi>life</hi> (if he die there) read also that Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. (which saith) <hi>For as many as are of the Works of the Law are under the Curse,</hi> mark, they that are of the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> now for to be of the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> it is to be of the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> thereof; that is, to abstain from <hi>sins</hi> against the <hi>Law,</hi> and to do the commands thereof, as near as ever they can for their lives, or with all the might they have; and therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102284:38"/>
you to consider it; for mens being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this, is the cause why so many go on, supposing they have a share in <hi>Christ;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are reformed, and abstain from the <hi>sins</hi> against the <hi>Law,</hi> who when all comes to all, will be <hi>damned</hi> notwithstanding; because they are not brought out from under the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> and put under the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But (can you in very deed make these things manifestly evident from the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God)</hi> methinks to reason this is very strange, that a man should labour to walk up accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as much as ever he can, and yet that men notwithstanding this should be still under the Curse. Pray clear it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Truly this doth seem very strange, I do know full well, to the natural man, to him that is yet in his unbelief; because he goeth by <hi>beguiled reason:</hi> but for my part I do know it is so, and shall labour also to convince thee of the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Then the <hi>Law</hi> is thus strict and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, that if a man do <hi>sin</hi> but once against it, he (I say) is gone for ever by the <hi>Law,</hi> living and dying under that <hi>Covenant:</hi> If you would be satisfied, as touching the truth of this, do but read the third of the <hi>Galations</hi> at the 10. <hi>verse.</hi> Where it saith, <hi>Cursed is every one</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:102284:38"/>
(that is, not a man shall misss by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) <hi>that continueth not in all</hi> (mark, in all) <hi>things that are written in the book of the Law to do them:</hi> pray mark, here is a curse in the first place, if all things written in the Book of the Law be not done, and that continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, that is, without any failing, or one slip, as I said before. Now there is never a one in the world, but before they did begin to yield obedience to the least command, they in their own persons did <hi>sin</hi> against it, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: the <hi>Apostle</hi> methinks is very notable for the clearing of this in that 3 of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and also in the fifth, in the one he endeavours for to prove that all had <hi>transgressed</hi> in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> as he stood a common person repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting both <hi>himself</hi> and <hi>us</hi> in his standing and falling, <hi>Rom. 5. 12. Wherefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>as by one man sin entered into the World, and death by sin: and so death passed upon all men;</hi> mark that, but why? <hi>for that all have sinned,</hi> that is, for as much as all naturally are guilty of <hi>original sin,</hi> the <hi>sin</hi> that was committed by us in <hi>Adam:</hi> So this is one cause why none can be justified by their <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have in their first place broken it in their first parents. But secondly, In case this should be opposed and rejected by <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsome persons,</hi> though there be no ground for it, <hi>Paul</hi> hath another <hi>argument</hi> to back
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102284:39"/>
his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> saying, <hi>For we have proved</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) <hi>that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin.</hi> First, <hi>As it is written, there is none righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, no not one.</hi> Secondly, <hi>They are all gone out of the way, they are together</hi> (mark, together) <hi>become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Their throat is an open Sepulchre, with their tongues they have used de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, the poyson of asps is under their lips.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>Their feet are swift to shed blood.</hi> In a word, <hi>Destruction and misery are in their ways: And the way of peace they have not known.</hi> Now then saith he, having proved these things so clearly, the conclusion of the whole is this, <hi>That what thing, soever the Law saith</hi> (in both shewing of sin and cursing for the same) <hi>it saith</hi> (All) <hi>to them that are under the Law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. So that here I say lieth the ground of our not being <hi>justified</hi> by the <hi>Law,</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the first place we have sinned against it; for know this for certain, that if the Law doth take the least advantage of thee, by thy sinning against it, all that ever thou shalt afterwards hear from it, is nothing but curse, curse, curse him, <hi>For not continuing in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:102284:39"/>
Secondly, Thou canst not be saved by the righteous <hi>Lavv</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the first <hi>Covenant,</hi> because, that (together with this thy miserable state, by original and actual sins, before thou didst follow the Law) since thy turning to the Law, thou hast committed several sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, the Law. <hi>(In many things vve offend all)</hi> So that now thy righteousness to the Law, being mixed with sometimes the lust of concupiscence, for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idation, coverousness, pride, heart-risings against God, coldness of affection towards him, backwardness to good duties, speaking idle words, having of strife in your hearts, and such like; I say, these things being thus, the righteousness of the Law is become (do) weak through this our flesh, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. 30) and so notwithstanding all our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Law, we are yet through our weakness under the Curse of the Law; for as I said before, the Law is so holy, so just, and so good, that it cannot allow that any fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or slip should be done by them that look for life by the same. <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in every thing,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. and this <hi>Paul</hi> knew full, well, which made him throw away all his righteousness (But you will say that was his own. <hi>Ansvver,</hi> But it was even that which while he calls it his own, he also calls it the righteousness of the <hi>Law,</hi> see <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10.) and to account it but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102284:40"/>
dung, but as dirt on his shoes, and that, that he might be found in Christ, and so he saved by him without the deeds of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, Set the case the righteousness of the Law, which thou hast, was pure and perfect without the least flaw, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least mixture of the least sinful thought, yet this would fall far short of presenting of thee blameless in the sight of God. And that I prove by these arguments.</p>
            <p>The first Argument is, That that which is not Christ, cannot redeem souls from the Curse. It cannot compleatly present them before the Lord. Now the Law is not Christ; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Moral Law, cannot (by all our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it) deliver us from the curse that is due to us, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
            <p>The second Argument is, That that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness that is not the righteousness of faith (that is by believing in Jesus Christ) cannot please God. Now the righteousness of the Law as a Covenant of works is not the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of faith; Therefore the righteousness of the Law as acted by us, being under that Covenant, cannot please God. The first is proved in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 6. <hi>But without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to please him,</hi> mark, it is impossible. The second thus, <hi>The Law is not of faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. Rom. 10. 5, 6. compared with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102284:40"/>
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>But that no man is justified in the sight of the Lord by the Law, it is evident; for the just shall live by faith, and the Law is not of faith.</hi> But for the better understanding of those that are weak of apprehension, I shall prove it thus.</p>
            <p>First, That soul that hath eternal life, he must have it by right of purchase, or redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>(Heb.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7.) Secondly, this purchase or redemption, must be through the Blood of Christ. <hi>You have redemption through his Blood. Without shedding of blood there is no remission.</hi> Now the Law is not in a capacity to die, and so to redeem sinners by the purchase of Blood, which satisfaction justice calls for (read the same Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22.) justice calls for satisfaction, because thou hast transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and sinned against it, and that must have satisfaction; therefore, all that ever thou canst do cannot bring in redemption: though thou follow the Law up to the nail-head (as I may say) because all this is not shedding of blood: for believe it, and know it for certain, that though thou hadst sinned but one sin, before thou didst turn to the Law; that one sin will murther thy soul, if it be not washed away by blood, even by the Precious Blood of Jesus Christ, that was shed when he did hang upon the Cross on Mount <hi>Calvary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But (you will say) methinks that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102284:41"/>
up you selves to live a righteous life should make God like better on us, and so let us be saved by Christ, because we are so willing to obey his Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The motive that moveth God to have mercy upon sinners, is not because they are willing to follow the Law, but because he is willing to save them. <hi>Not for thy righteousness, or for thy uprightness of heart doest thou possess the Land,</hi> Deut. 9. 4, 5, 6. Now understand this; if thy will to do righteousness was the first moving cause why God had mercy on thee through Christ, then it must not be freely by grace. (I say freely) but the Lord loves thee and saves thee upon free terms, having nothing before-hand to make him accept of thy soul, but only the Blood of Christ; therefore to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of such a principle, it is to allow, that grace is to be obtained by the works of the Law, which is so gross darkness as lies in the darkest dungeon in Popery, and is also directly opposite to Scripture. <hi>For we are justified free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his grace: through the redemption that is in Christ,</hi> not through the good that is in our selves or done by us <hi>(Rom.</hi> 3. 24 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) No, <hi>But by faith, without;</hi> mark that, <hi>without the deeds of the Law,</hi> verse 28. Again, <hi>not of vvorks, lest any man should boast,</hi> Eph. 2. 9. (No, no, saith he) <hi>Not according to our vvorks</hi> (or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness) <hi>but according to his ovvn purpose;</hi> mark,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102284:41"/>
               <hi>according to his ovvn purpose and grace which was</hi> (a free gift) <hi>given us in Christ Jesus</hi> (not lately, but) <hi>before the world began,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will say, then, why did God give the Law, if we cannot have salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by following of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I told you before, that the Law was given for these following reasons.</p>
            <p>First, That thou mightest be convinced by it of thy sins, and that thy sins might indeed appear very sinful unto thee; which is done by the Law these ways. First, By shewing of thee what a holy God he is that did give the Law; and secondly, By shewing thee thy vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and wickedness, in that thou contrary to this holy God, hast transgressed against, and broken this his holy Law; therefore saith <hi>Paul, The Law was added, that the offence might abound,</hi> Rom. 5. 20. that is, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the creature the holiness of God, and also its own vileness.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That thou mayest know, that God will not damn thee for nothing in the Judgment day.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Because he would have no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling at his just condemning of them at that day.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Because he will make thee to know that he is a holy God, and pure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:102284:42"/>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But seeing you have spoken thus far, I wish you would do so much as to shew in some particulars, both what men have done and how far they have gone, and what they have received, being yet under this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which you call the ministration of condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ansvv.</hi> This is something a difficult que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and had need be not only warily, but also home and soundly answered. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion consists of three particulars. First, What men have done. Secondly, How far men have gone. Thirdly, What they have received, and yet to beunder the Law or Covenant of Works; and so in a state of condemnation.</p>
            <p>As for the first, I have spoken something in general to that already, but for thy better understanding, I shall speak yet more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. First, a man hath, and may be convinced and troubled for his sins, and yet be under this Covenant, and that in a very heavy and dreadful manner; in so much that he may find the weight of them to be intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable and too heavy for him to bear, as it was with <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>My punishment</hi> (saith he) <hi>is greater than I can bear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, A man living thus under a sense of his sins, may repent, and be sorry for them, and yet be under this Covenant, and yet be in a damned state, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 3. <hi>And when he</hi> (Judas) <hi>saw what was done he repeated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:102284:42"/>
Thirdly, Men may not only be convinced, and also repent for their sins; but they may also desire the prayers of the Children of God for them too, and yet be under this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and Curse, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 16, 17. <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh <hi>called for</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>and said, I have sinned; intreat the Lord your God that he may take away from me these plagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, A man may also humble himself for his offences, and disobedience against his God, and yet be under this Covenant, see 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, A man may make restitution unto men for the offence he hath done unto them, and yet be under this Covenant.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, A man may do much work for God in his generation, and yet be under this first Covenant, as <hi>Jehu,</hi> who did do that which God bid him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9, 25, 26. and yet God threatneth even <hi>Jehu,</hi> because, though he did do the thing that the Lord commanded him; yet he did it not from a right principle; for had he, the Lord would not have said, <hi>Yet a little while and I will a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu,</hi> Hos. 1. 4.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Men may hear, and fear the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, and reverence them very highly; yea, and when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, they may not only hear, but hear and do, and that glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, not one or two things, but many;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102284:43"/>
mark, <hi>many things gladly,</hi> and yet be lost, and yet be damned (see <hi>Mar</hi> 6. 20.) <hi>For</hi> Herod <hi>feared</hi> John (why? not because he had any ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil power over him) <hi>but because he was a just man, and holy, and observed him, and when he heard him, he did many things; and heard him gladly;</hi> it may be that thou thinkest, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hearest such and such, therefore thou art better than thy neighbours: but know for certain that thou mayest not only hear, but thou mayest hear and do, and that not with a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will, but <hi>gladly;</hi> mark, <hi>gladly</hi> and yet be <hi>Herod still,</hi> an enemy to the Lord Jesus <hi>still:</hi> consider this I pray you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But Secondly, To the second thing, which is this, <hi>How far may such a one go?</hi> to what may such a one attain? whither may he arrive? and yet be an undone man, under this Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, Such a one may be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fellowship with the <hi>Saints,</hi> as they are in a visible way of walking one with another; they may walk hand in hand together (see <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1. where he saith) <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (that is a visible company of professors of Christ) <hi>is likened to ten Virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the Bridegroom, five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</hi> These in the first place are called Virgins; that is, such as are clear from the pollutions of the world. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They are said to go forth; that is, from the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102284:43"/>
rudiments and traditions of men. Thirdly, They do agree to take their lamps with them; that is, to profess themselves the Servants of Jesus Christ, that wait upon him, and for him; and yet when he came, he found half of them (even them Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins) that had Lamps, that also went forth from the pollutions of the world, and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of men, to be such as lost their precious souls (see verse 10.) which they should not have done, had they been under the Covenant of Grace, and so, not under the Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They may attain to a great deal of honour in the said company of professors (that which may be accounted honour) in so much, that they may be put in trust with Church Affairs, and bear the bag, as <hi>Judas</hi> did. I speak not this to shame the Saints: but being beloved I warn them; yet I speak this on purpose, that it might (if the Lord will) knock at the door of the souls of professors, consider <hi>Demas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, They may attain to speak of the word as Ministers, and become preachers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in so much that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where they dwell, may even take up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb concerning them, saying, <hi>Is he among the Prophets?</hi> his gifts may be so rare, his tongue may be so fluent, and his matter may be so fit, that he may speak with a tongue like an Angel, and speak of the hidden mysteries, yea, of them <hi>all;</hi> mark that (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4.) and yet
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102284:44"/>
be nothing, and yet be none of the Lords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed ones, with the Spirit of grace savingly, but may live and die under the Curse of the Law.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They may go yet further; they may have the gifts of the Spirit of God, which may inable them to cast out Devils, to remove the biggest Hills or Mountains in the World; nay, thou mayest be so gifted as to prephesie of things to come, the most glorious things, even the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to reign over all his enemies, and yet be but a <hi>Balaam,</hi> a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and a mad Prophet, see 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 16. Numb.</hi> 24. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, they may not only stand thus for a while, for a little season; but they may stand thus <hi>till the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with his holy Angels,</hi> I, and not be discovered of the Saints till that very day. <hi>Then all those Virgins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose</hi> (the wise and the foolish) then, when? why, when this voice was heard, <hi>Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go you out to meet him,</hi> (Mat. 25. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.) and yet was out of the Lord Jesus Christ, and yet was under the Law.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Nay, further, they may not only continue in a profession <hi>till then</hi> (supposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be under the Grace of the Gospel, when indeed they are under the Curse of the Law) but even when the Bridegroom is <hi>come,</hi> they may still be so confident of their state to be good, that they will even reason out the case with Christ, why
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102284:44"/>
they are not let into the Kingdom of glory, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not eaten and drunk in thy presence? and hast not thou taught in our streets?</hi> Nay further, <hi>Have not we taught in thy Name? and in thy Name cast out devils:</hi> nay not only this, but, <hi>done many;</hi> mark, <hi>we have done many wonderful works;</hi> nay further, they were so confident, that they commanded <hi>in a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way,</hi> saying, <hi>Lord open to us.</hi> See here I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, how far these went, they thought they had had intimate acquaintance with Jesus Christ, they thought he could not chuse but save them, they had eat and drunk with him, sat at the table with him, received power from him, executed the same power. In thy <hi>Name have we done thus and thus;</hi> even wrought many <hi>wonderful works,</hi> see <hi>Mat. 7. 22. Luke</hi> 13. 25, 26. And yet these poor creatures was shut out of the Kingdom. O consider this (I beseech you) before it be too late, lest you say, Lord, let us come in, when Christ saith, thrust him out, <hi>verse</hi> 28. Hears you cry, <hi>Lord open to us,</hi> when he saith, <hi>Depart I know you not;</hi> lest, though you think of having <hi>joy,</hi> you have <hi>weeping and gnashing of teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But Thirdly, The third thing touched in the question, was this; What may such a one receive of God, who is under the Curse of the Law?</p>
            <p>First, They may receive <hi>an answer to their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102284:45"/>
Prayers from God,</hi> at sometimes, for some things as they do stand in need of. I find in Scripture that God did hear these persons, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith was cast out, see <hi>Gen. 21. 17. And God heard the voice of the Lad</hi> (even of cast out <hi>Ishmael) And the Angel of the Lord called to</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar <hi>out of Heaven</hi> (which was the bond woman, and under the Law, <hi>Gal. 4. 30.) and said unto her, Fear not: for God hath heard the voice of the Lad where he is.</hi> Friends, It may be you may think, because you have your prayers answered in some particular things, therefore you may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that as to your eternal state, your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very good. But you must know that God doth hear the cry of a company of <hi>Ishmaelites,</hi> the sons of the Bond-Woman, who are under the Law as a Covenant of Works. I do not say he hears them as to their eternal state, but he heareth them as to several streights, that they go through in this life, I, and gives them case and liberty from their trouble. Here this poor wretch was almost perished for a little water, and he cryed, and God heard him, yea, he heard him out of <hi>Heaven.</hi> Read also the 107 <hi>Psalm, 23. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. Psal. 106. 15. He gave them their desire, and sent leanness to their souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some may say, methinks this is yet more strange, that God should hear the Prayers, the cries of those that are under the Law, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered them.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> I told you before, he doth not hear them as to their eternal state, but as to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral state; For God as their Creator hath a care of them, and causeth the sun to shine upon them, and the rain to distill upon their substance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. Nay he doth give the Beasts in the field their appointed food, and doth hear the young Ravens when they cry, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 9. which are far inferiour to man. I say therefore, that God doth hear the cries of his Creatures, and doth answer them too, though not as to their eternal state; but may damn them nevertheless when they die for all that.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They may receive promises from the mouth of the Lord. There are many that have had promises made to them by the Lord, in a most eminent manner, and yet (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) are such as are cast out and called the Children of the Bond-woman (which is the Law) see. <hi>Gen. 21. 17, 18. And the Angel of the Lord called out of Heaven to</hi> Hagar (that was the Bond-woman) <hi>saying, fear not: for God hath heard the voice of the Lad where he is. Arise, lift up the Lad, and hold him in thine hand: FOR I WILL MAKE OF HIM:</hi> mark, there is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. <hi>For I will make of him</hi> (of the son of the Bond-woman) <hi>a great Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Nay they may go further; for they may receive another heart than they had before, and yet be under the Law. There is no man
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102284:46"/>
I think, but those that do not know what they say, that will think or say, that <hi>Saul</hi> was under the Covenant of Grace, yet after he had talked with <hi>Samuel,</hi> and had turned his back to go from him, saith the Scripture; <hi>God gave him another heart</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 9.) another <hi>heart;</hi> mark that, and yet an out-cast, a rejected person, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 26, 29. Friends, I beseech you let not these things offend you, but let them rather beget in your hearts an enquiring into the truth of your condition, and be willing to be search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the bottom, and also, that every thing which hath not been planted by the Lords right hand, may be rejected, and that there may be a reaching after better things, even the things that will not only make thy soul think thy state is good now; but that thou mayest be able to look sin, death hell, the curse of the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Judge in the face with comfort, having such a real, sound, effectual work of God Grace in thy soul, that when thou hearest the Trumpet sound, seest the graves flie open, and the dead come creeping forth out of their holes: when thou shalt see the Judgment set, the books opened, and all the world standing before the Judgment seat; I say, that then thou mayest stand, and have that blessed sentence spoken to thy soul, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, wherit the Kingdom prepared for you from before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World,</hi> Mat. 25. 34.</p>

               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:102284:46"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But (you wil say) for all this we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that we are under the Law; for these reasons. As first, because we have found a change in our hearts. Secondly, Because we do deny that the Covenant of Works will save a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Thirdly, Because for our parts, we judge our selves far from legal principles; for we are got up into as perfect a Gospel order, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of practice and discipline in Church Affairs, as any this day in <hi>England,</hi> as we judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, That mans belief that is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any thing done in him, or by him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that mans belief is not grounded upon the death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession of Jesus Christ, for that man that hath indeed good ground of his eternal salvation, his faith is settled upon that object which God is well pleased, or satisfied withal, which is that man that was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> even her <hi>first-born Son;</hi> that is, he doth apply by faith to his soul, the vertues of his death, blood, righteousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and doth look for satisfaction of soul, no where else, then from that, neither doth the soul seek to give God any satisfaction, as to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification any other ways: but doth willingly and chearfully accept of, and embrace the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Christs death, together with the rest of his things, done by himself on the Cross as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and since also as a Priest, Advocate, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And doth so really and effectually,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102284:47"/>
receive the glories of the same, <hi>That thereby;</hi> mark that, <hi>thereby he is changed into the same image, from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. Thus in general: but yet more particular.</p>
            <p>First, To think that your condition is good, because there is some change in you from a loose prophane life, to a more close, honest, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil life and conversation; I say to think this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony sufficient for to ground the stress of thy salvation upon, is very dangerous. First, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such a soul doth not only lay the stress of its salvation besides the man Christ Jesus that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Cross: But Secondly, Because that his confidence is not grounded upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of sinners; but upon his turning from gross sins, to a more refined life (and it may be to the performance of some good duties) which is no Saviour: I say this is very dangerous; therefore read it, and the Lord help you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it; for unless you lay the whole stress of the salvation of your souls upon the merits of another man (namely Jesus) and that by what he did do, and is a doing without you; for certain, as sure as God is in Heaven, your souls will perish: And this must not be notional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neither, as with an assenting of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing only: but it must be by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, invisible, invincible power of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, working in your souls by his Spirit, such a real, saving, holy saith, that can through
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102284:47"/>
the operation of the same Spirit by which it is wrought, lay hold on, and apply these most heavenly, most excellent, most meritorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the man Christ Jesus, not only to your heads and fancles but to your very souls, and consciences, so effectually, that you may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the same faith to challenge the power, madness, malice, rage, and destroying nature, either of sin, the Law, death, the Devil, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with hell, and all other evils, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your souls upon the death, burial, resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and intercession of that man Jesus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, Do you think that there was no change in the five foolish Virgins spoken of in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1, 2, 3. Yes, there was such a change in them very people, that the five wise ones could give them admittance of walking with them, in the most purer ways and institutions of the Gospel of Christ, and yet but foolish; nay, they walked with them, or shall walk with them, until the Lord Jesus Christ shall break down from Heaven; and yet but foolish Virgins, and yet but under the Law; and so under the Curse, as I said before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But (say you) we have disowned the Covenant of Works, and turned from that also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is sooner said than done: Alas, alass, poor souls think because they can say <hi>grace, grace,</hi> it is freely by grace; therefore they are
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102284:48"/>
under the Covenant of Grace. A very wide mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake; you must understand thus much, that though you be such as can speak of the Grace of the Gospel, yet if you your selves be not brought under the very Covenant of Grace, you are yet notwithstanding your talk and profession, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far wide, of a <hi>sense,</hi> and of a <hi>share</hi> in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Grace of God, held forth in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>The Jews were men of a clearer understanding many of them, then to conclude that the Law, and only the Law, was the way to salvation; for they, even they that received not the Christ of God, did expect a Saviour should come, <hi>John</hi> 7. 27, 41, 42, 43. but they were men that had not that Gospel Spirit, which alone is able to lead them to the very life, marrow, or substance of the Gospel in right terms, and so being muddy in their understandings, being between the thoughts of a Saviour, and the thoughts of the Works of the Law, thinking that they must be accomplished for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Saviour, and his mercy towards them; I say, between these, they fell short of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. As many poor souls in these days; they think they must be saved alone by the Saviour: yet they think there is something to be done on their parts, for the obtaining of the good will of the Saviour: as their humiliation for sin, their turning from the same, their promises and vows,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102284:48"/>
and resolutions to become a new man, joyn in Church-fellowship, and what not; and thus they bringing this along with them, as a means to help them, they fall short of eternal salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they convert not; see that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30, 31, 32. The Apostle saith there, that they that sought not did obtain, when they that did seek fell short. <hi>What shall we say then,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the Gentiles which sought not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness</hi> (yea) <hi>even the righteousness of faith;</hi> and what else? Why, <hi>But Israel which followed after the Law of righteousness, have not attained to the Law of righteousness;</hi> how came that to pass? <hi>because</hi> (saith he) <hi>they sought it not by saith, but as it were;</hi> mark, he doth not say <hi>altogether:</hi> no, <hi>but it were,</hi> that is, because as they sought, they did a little by the by lean upon the Works of the Law. And let me tell you, that this is such a hard thing to beat men off of, that though <hi>Paul</hi> himself did take the work in hand, he did find enough to do, touching it; How is he saint to labour in the ten first Chapters of his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the establishing of those that did even profess largely in the Doctrine of Grace? And also in that Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and yet lost many, do what he could. Now the reason why the Doctrine of Grace doth so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down (even with professors) in truth, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; it is because there is a principle natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102284:49"/>
in man, that doth argue against the same, and that thus: why? saith the soul, I am a <hi>sinner,</hi> and God is <hi>righteous, holy,</hi> and <hi>just;</hi> his holy Law therefore having been broken by <hi>me,</hi> I must by all means, if ever I look to be saved; In the first place be sorry for my sins. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Turn from the same. Thirdly, Follow after good duties, and practise the good things of the Law, and ordinances of the Gospel, and so hope that God for Christs sake may forgive all my sins; which is not the way to God, as a Father in Christ, but the way, the very way to come to God by the Covenant of Works or the Law, which things I shall more fully clear, when I speak to the second doctrine.</p>
            <p>Again therefore, those that this day profess the Gospel, for the generality of them, they are such that notwithstanding their professien, they are very ignorant of that glorious influence, and I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stre of the same; I say, they are ignorant of the vertue and efficacy of the glorious things of Christ held forth by and in the Gospel; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. which doth argue their not being under the Covenant of Grace, but rather under the Law or old Covenant. As for instance, If you do come among some professors of the Gospel, in general, you shall have them pretty busie, and ripe; also able to hold you in a very large discourse in, several, points of the same glorious Gospel; but if you come to the same people,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102284:49"/>
and ask them concerning heart-work, or what work the Gospel hath wrought on them, and what appearance they have had of the sweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and vertues on their souls and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; it may be they will give you such an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer as this: I do find by the preaching thereof, that I am changed, and turned from my <hi>sins</hi> in a good measure, and also have learned <note n="*" place="margin">But only in tongue.</note> to distinguish between the Law and the Gospel, so that for the one, that is, for the <hi>Gospel</hi> I can plead, and also can shew the weakness, and unprofitableness of the other; and thus far it is like they may go, which is not far enough to prove them under the Covenant of Grace, though they may have their tongues so largely tipt with the <hi>profession</hi> of the <hi>same,</hi> see 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. where he saith, <hi>For if after they have escaped the pollutious of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> (which was not a saving knowledge) <hi>they are again intangled therein and overcome, the latter end of that man is worse than his beginning.</hi> See also <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. and also <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But (you will say) is not this a fair declaring of the Work of Grace, or doth it not discover that without all gain-saying, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant of Grace, when we are able, not only to speak of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ; but also to tell, and that by experience, that we have been changed from worse to better,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102284:50"/>
from sin to a holy life by leaving of the same, and that by hearing of the Word preached.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> A man may in the first place be able to talk of all the <hi>mysteries</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and that like an <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and yet be no more in <hi>Gods</hi> account, than the <hi>sounding</hi> of a <hi>Drum, Brass,</hi> or the tinkling of a <hi>Cimball,</hi> which are things that notwithstanding their sound and great noise, are absolutely void of life, and motion; and so are accounted with God as nothing, that is, no <hi>Christians,</hi> no <hi>Believers,</hi> not under the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> for all that. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Men may not only do this, but may also be changed in reality for a season, from what they formerly were, and yet be nothing at all in the Lords account, as to an eternal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Read (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20.) the Scripture which I mentioned before; for indeed that one Scripture is enough to prove all that I desire to say, as to this very thing; for if you observe, there is enfolded therein, these following things; first, that reprobates may attain to a knowledge of Christ. Secondly, This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may be of such weight and force, that for the present, it may make them escape the pollutions of the world, and this by hearing the Gospel. <hi>For if after they have escaped the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the world, through the knowled, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain entangled therein, and overcome, the last
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102284:50"/>
end of that man is worse than his beginning.</hi> Now that they are Reprobates, <note n="*" place="margin">Some professors take them at the best, they are but like Dogs, spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their filth for a time.</note> Dogs or Sows. Read fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is happenened to them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true proverb; the Dog is turned to his own vomit again, and the Sow, that was washed to her wallowing in the mire,</hi> verse 21. 22.</p>
            <p>But (say you) our practices in <note place="margin">The last part of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> the worship of God shall testifie for us, that we are not under the Law; for we have by Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness attained to as exact a way of walking in the ordinances of God, and as near the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Apostles, as ever any Churches since the primitive time, as we judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What then? do you think that the walking in the order of the Churches of old, as to matter of outward worship, is sufficient to clear you of your sins at the judgment day? or do you think that God will be contented with a little bodily subjection to that which shall vanish, and fade like a flower, <hi>when the Lord shall come from Heaven in flaming fire, with his mighty Angels,</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 7, 8. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, alis, how will such professors as these are, fall before the Judgment-seat of Christ? then such a question as this, <hi>Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having on thy wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:102284:51"/>
will make them be speechless, and fall down into everlasting burnings, thousands on a heap; for you must know, that it is not then your crying Lord, Lord, that will stand you in stead, nor your saying, We have eat and drunk in thy presence, that will keep you from standing on the left hand of Christ.</p>
            <p>It is the principle as well as the practice, that shall be enquired into at that day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> The principle (you will say) what do you mean by that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> My meaning is, the Lord Jesus Christ will then enquire and examine, whether the Spirit from which you acted, was Legal, or Evangelical; that is, whether it was the spirit of adoption, that did draw you out to the thing you took in hand, or a meer moral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, together with some shallow and common illuminations into the outward way of the Worship of God, according to Gospel rule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But (you will say its like) how should this be made manifest, and appear?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall speak briefly in answer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as followeth. First then, that man that doth take up any of the ordinances of God, namely, as Prayer, Baptism, breaking of Bread, Reading, Hearing, Alms-deeds, or the like; I say, he that doth practice any of these or such like, supposing thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the love of Christ to his own soul, he doth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102284:51"/>
do what he doth from a Legal, and not from an Evangelical, or Gospel Spirit, as thus; for a man to suppose that God will hear him, for his Prayers sake, for his Alms-sake, for his Hamiliation sake, or because he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to make God amends hereafter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is no such thing as a satisfaction to be made to God by our Prayers, or whatever we can do; I say, there is no such way to have reconciliation with God in. And so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, for men to think, because they are got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such and such an Ordinance, and have crouded themselves into such and such a <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that therefore they have got pretty good shelter from the wrath of the Almighty; when alas poor souls there is no such thing; No, but God will so set his face against such professors, that his very looks will make them to tear their very flesh; yea, make them to wish, would they had the biggest Mill-stone in the world hanged about their necks, and they cast into the midst of the Sea. For friends, let me tell you, though you can now content your selves, without the holy, harmless, undefiled, perfect righteousness of Christ; yet there is a day a coming, in which there is not one of you shall be saved; but those that are, and shall be found clothed with that righteousness: God will say to <hi>ALL</hi> the rest, <hi>Take them, bind them hand and foot, and cast them into outer
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102284:52"/>
darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth</hi> (Mat. 22. 13.) for Christ will not say unto men in that day, Come, which of you made a <hi>profession</hi> of me, and walked in <hi>Church-fellowship</hi> with my Saints? no, but then it shall be enquired into, who hath the reality of the truth of grace wrought in their <hi>hearts:</hi> and for certain, he that misseth of that, shall surely be cast into the lake of fire; there to burn with the devils and damned men and women; there to undergo the wrath of the eternal God, and that not for a day, a month, a year; but for ever, for ever, for ever, and ever, there is that which cutteth to the quick; therefore look to it, and consider now what you do, and whereon you hang your souls; for it is not every pin that will hold in the judgment, nor every foundation that will be able to hold up the house against those, mighty, terrible, soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drowning floods, and destroying tempests, which then will roar against the soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a sinner <hi>(Luke</hi> the 6. the three last verses) and if the principle be rotten, all will fall, all will come to nothing. Now the principle is this, not to do things because we would be saved, but to do them from this, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we do really believe that we are and shall be saved; but do not mistake me, I do not say we should slight any holy duties <hi>(God</hi> forbid) but I say, he that doth look for life because he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102284:52"/>
doth do good duties, he is under the Covenant of Works the Law: let his duties be never so eminent, so often, so fervens, so zealous. I, and I say, as I said before, that if any man or men, or multitudes of people, do get into never so high, so eminent, and clear practices, and Gospel-order, as to Church-discipline, if it be done to this end I have been speaking, from this principle; they must and shall have these sad things fall to their share, which I have made mention of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But (you will say) can a man use Gospel-ordinances with a Legal spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes as easily as the Jews could use and practice circumcision, though not the Moral, or Ten Commandments. For this I shall be bold to affirm, that it is not the Commands of the New Testament administration, that can keep a man from using of its self in a legal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for know this for certain, that it is the principle, not the command, that makes the subjecter to the same, either Legal or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, and so his obedience from that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be from Legal convictions, or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical principles.</p>
            <p>Now herein the devil is wonderous subtle and crafty, in suffering people to practice the ordinances and commands of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, if they do but do them in a Legal spirit,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102284:53"/>
               <note n="*" place="margin">I beseeth you, do not think that because I say this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am against the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Gospel, for I do honour them in their pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces: yet would not that any of them should be idolized, or done in a wrong spirit.</note> from a spirit of works; for he knows then, that if he can but get the soul to go on in such a spirit, though they do never so many du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he shall hold them sure enough; for he knows full well, that thereby they do set up something in the room of, or at the least to have some (though but a little) share with the Lord Jesus Christ in their salvation; and if he can but get thee here, he knows that he shall cause thee by thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending a little upon the one, and so thy whole dependance being not upon the other (that is Christ, and taking of him upon his own terms) thou wilt fall short of life by Christ, though thou do very much busie thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in a suitable walking, in an outward conformity to the several commands of the Lord Jesus Christ. And let me tell you plainly, that I do verily believe, that as Satan by his Instruments did draw many of the Galatians by Circumcision (though, I say, it was none of the commands of the moral Law) to be debtors to do upon pain of eternal damnation, the whole of the moral Law: So also Satan in the time of the Gospel, doth use even the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands laid down in the <hi>Gospel</hi> (some of them)
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102284:53"/>
to bind the soul over to do the same Law; the thing being done and walked in, by, and in the same spirit: For as I said before, it is not the obedience to the command, that makes the subjecter thereto Evangelical, or of a <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Spirit;</hi> but contrariwise, the principle that leads out the soul to the doing of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that makes the persons that do thus pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice any command, together with the command by them practised, either Legal or Evangelical.</p>
            <p>As for instance, prayer it is a <hi>Gospel</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; yet if he that prayes, doth it in a Legal spirit, he doth make that which in it self, is a <hi>Gospel command,</hi> an occasion of leading him into a Covenant of Works, in as much as he doth it by, and in that old Covenant spirit.</p>
            <p>Again, giving of <hi>Alms,</hi> is a <hi>Gospel command;</hi> yet if I do give Alms from a Legal principle, the command to me is not <hi>Gospel</hi> but <hi>Legal,</hi> and it binds me over (as aforesaid) to do the whole Law, <hi>For he is not a Jew</hi> (not a Christian) <hi>that is one outwardly,</hi> that is one, only by an outward subjection to the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of prayer, hearing, reading, baptism, breaking of bread, <hi>&amp;c. But he is a Jew</hi> (a Christian) <hi>which is one inwardly,</hi> who is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly principled, and practiseth the ordinances of the Lord from the leadings forth of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord from a true and saving faith in the Lord; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:102284:54"/>
Those men spoken of in the 7. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> for certain, for all their great declaration, did not do what they did from a <hi>right Gospel Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> for had they, no question but the Lord would have said, <hi>Well done good and faithful servants:</hi> but in that the Lord Jesus doth turn them away into Hell, notwithstanding their great profession of the Lord, and of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his name, it is evident that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all that they did do, they were still under the Law, and not under that Covenant as true <hi>believers</hi> are (to wit) the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and if so, then all their duties that they did, of which they boasted before the Lord, was not in, and by a right <hi>Evangelical principle</hi> (or <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, saith the Apostle, <hi>Whatsoever is not of faith is sin,</hi> Rom. 14. 23. but there are some that do even practise baptism, breaking of bread, together with other ordinances, and yet are unbelievers; therefore unbelievers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things, they are not done in faith, but sin: now to do these things in sin, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the faith, it is not to do things in an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical or Gospel Spirit; also they that do these things in a Legal spirit the very practising of them, renders them not under the Law of Christ, as head of his Church but the works they do are of so much contradiction to the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> that they that do them thus, do even set up against

            <p>First, He thinking this or that to be his <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and considering of the <hi>same,</hi> he is also presently <hi>perswaded</hi> in his own <hi>conscience,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> will not accept of him, if he leave it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; he seeing that he is short of his <hi>duty</hi> (as he supposeth) while this is undone by him, and also <hi>judging</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>angry</hi> with him, until the thing be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he in the <hi>second place</hi> sets to the doing of the <hi>duty,</hi> to the end he may be able to pacifie his <hi>conscience</hi> by doing of the same, perswading of <hi>himself</hi> that now the <hi>Lord</hi> is pleased with him for doing of it.

               </gap>ay, it is of something in the man, done by him, that moves God thereunto; then you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that either <hi>Grace is no Grace,</hi> or else that <hi>Works are Grace,</hi> and not <hi>Works.</hi> Do but read with understanding, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6.</p>

Now before I go any further, it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to speak a word or two to some <hi>poor souls</hi> that are willing to close in with <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and would willingly take him upon his own terms, only they being muddy in their minds, and have not yet attained the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the terms and conditions of the two <hi>Covenanss,</hi> they are kept off from closing with Christ; and all is, because they see they can do nothing. As for example, come to some <hi>souls,</hi> and ask them how they do, they will tell you presently, that they are so bad that it is not to be expressed: If you bid them believe in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> they will answer, that they cannot believe; if you ask them why they cannot believe; they will answer, because their hearts are so hard, so dead, so dull, so back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to good duties; and if their hearts were but better, if they were more earnest, if they could pray better, and keep their hearts more from running after sin, then they could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; but should they believe with such vile hearts, and presume to believe in Christ, and be so filthy: Now all this is, because the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> still ruleth in such a soul, and blinds them so that they cannot see the terms of the Gospel. To clear this, take the substance of the drift of this poor soul, which is this: If I was better than I think I could believe, but being so bad as I am, that is the reason that I
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102284:58"/>
cannot; this is just to do something that I may believe, to work that I may have Christ, to do the Law that I may have the Gospel; or thus to be righteoua that I may come to Christ. O man! thou must go quite back again, thou must believe, because thou canst not pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou canst not do; thou must believe, because there is nothing in thee (naturally) that is good, or desireth after good, or else thou wilt never come to Christ as a sinner; and if so, then Christ will not receive thee; and if so, then thou mayest see that to keep off from Christ, because thou canst not do, is to keep from Christ by the Law, and to stand of from him because thou canst not buy him. Thus having spoken something by the way, for the direction of those souls that would come to Christ, I shall return to the former discourse wherein ariseth this objection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you did but even now put souls upon fulfilling the first condition of the Gospel, even to believe in Christ, and so be saved; but now you say, it is alone by Grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condition; and therefore by these words, there is first a contradiction to your former say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and also that men may be saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the condition of faith, which to me seems a very strange thing. I desire therefore that you would clear out what you have said, as to my satisfaction.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Though there be a <hi>condition</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> yet he that commands the <hi>condition,</hi> doth not leave his <hi>children</hi> to their own natural <hi>abilities,</hi> that in their own <hi>strength</hi> they should fulfill them (as the <hi>Law</hi> doth) but the same <hi>God</hi> that doth command that the <hi>condition</hi> be fulfilled, even he, doth help his <hi>children</hi> by his <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> to fulfill the same condition, <hi>For it is God that worketh in you,</hi> mark, <hi>in you</hi> (believers) <hi>both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. <hi>Thou hast wrought all our works in us, and for us, Isa.</hi> 26. 12. So that the <hi>condition</hi> be fulfilled, it is not done in the ability of the <hi>creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Secondly, Faith as it is a gift of <hi>God,</hi> or an act of ours, take it which way you will; If we speak properly of <hi>salvation,</hi> it is not the first, nor the second cause of our <hi>salvation;</hi> but the third, and that but instrumentally neither; that is, it only layeth hold of, and applieth to us that which saveth us, which is the love of God, through the merits of <hi>Christ,</hi> which are the two main causes of our salvation, without which all other things are nothing, whether it be <hi>faith, hope, love,</hi> or whatever can be done by us. And to this, the great <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> speaks fully; for saith he, <hi>God who is rich in mercy loved us, even when we were dead in our sins,</hi> Eph. 2. 4. (that is, when we were without faith) and that was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102284:59"/>
the cause why we believe; for he thereby hath quickned us together, through the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cause, which is <hi>Christ,</hi> and so hath saved us by <hi>Grace,</hi> that is, of his own voluntary <hi>love</hi> and <hi>good will;</hi> the effects of which was this, he gave us <hi>faith</hi> to believe in <hi>Christ,</hi> read soberly that second of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> at the 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 verses. <hi>Faith</hi> as the gift of God is not the Saviour, as our act doth merit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Faith was not the cause that <hi>God</hi> gave <hi>Christ</hi> at the first, neither is it the cause why <hi>God</hi> converts men to <hi>Christ:</hi> but faith is a gift bestowed upon us, by the gracious God, the nature of which is to lay hold on <hi>Christ,</hi> that God afore did give for a Ransom, to redeem sinners; this faith hath its nourishment, and supplies from the same God, that at the first did give it; and is the only instrument, through the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that doth keep the <hi>soul</hi> in a <hi>comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able frame,</hi> both to do and suffer for <hi>Christ;</hi> helps the <hi>soul</hi> to receive <hi>comfort</hi> from <hi>Christ,</hi> when it can get none from it self, beareth up the <hi>soul</hi> in its progress heaven-wards: but that it is the first cause of <hi>salvation,</hi> that I deny; or that it is the second, I deny: but is only the instrument, or hand, that receiveth the benefits that God hath prepared for thee before thou hadst any faith: so that we do nothing for <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> as we are men. But if we speak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, <hi>it was Gods Grace that moved him to give
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102284:59"/>
Christ a Ransom for sinners, and the same God with the same Grace, that doth give to the soul saith to believe, and so by believing to close in with him, whom God out of his love and pity, did send into the world to save sinners; so that all the works of the creature are shut out, as to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and life, and men are saved freely by Grace.</hi> I shall speak no more here, but in my discourse upon the second <hi>Covenant,</hi> I shall answer a hell-bred Objection or two, to forewarn sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, how they turn the Grace of God into wantonness.</p>
            <p>And thus you see I have briefly spoken to you something touching the Law. First, What it is, and when given. Secondly, How sad those mens <hi>conditions</hi> are that are under it. Thirdly, Who they are that be under it. Fourthly, How far they may go, and what they may do, and receive, and yet be under it, which hath been done by way of answers to several questions, for the better satisfaction of those that may stand in doubt of the truth of what hath been delivered.</p>
            <p>Now in the next place, I should come to some application of the truth of that which hath been spoken; but I shall in the first place speak something to the second Doctrine, and then afterwards I shall speak something by way of Use and Application to this first <hi>Doctrine.</hi>

               <head>The second Doctrine now to be spoken to, is to shew, that the People of God are not under the Law but under Grace.</head>

               </q>
               <p>YOu may well remember that from these words, I did observe these two great truths of the Lord. First, That there are some in Gospel times, that are under the Law, or Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>I have spoken something to the former of these truths (to wit) that there are some under the Law, together with who they are, and what their condition is, that are under it. Now I am to speak to the second, and to shew you who they are, and what their condition is, that are under that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:102284:60"/>
But before I come to that, I shall <note place="margin">I touched upon this in the first <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
                  </note> speak a few words, to shew you what the word <hi>GRACE</hi> in this place signifies; for the word <hi>Grace</hi> in the <hi>Scripture</hi> referreth sometimes to favour with men <hi>(Esther 2. 7. Gen.</hi> 39. 4. Chap. 50. 4, 33, 10.) sometimes to holy qualifications of Saints (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 7.) and sometimes to hold forth the condescension of Christ, in coming down from the glory which he had with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before the world was, to be made of no reputation, and a servant to men (2 <hi>Cor. 8. 9. Phil.</hi> 2. 7.) Again, sometime it is taken for the free, rich, and unchangeable love of God to man, through Jesus Christ; that for our cause and sakes, did make himself poor: and so it is to be understood in these words, <hi>For you are not under the Law</hi> (to be cursed, and damned, and sent headlong to hell) <hi>but</hi> (you are) <hi>under Grace,</hi> to be saved, to be pardoned, to be preserved, <hi>and kept by the mighty power of God, through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith</hi> (which alone is the gift of Grace) <hi>unto eternal glory.</hi> This one Scripture alone proves the same, <hi>Eph. 2. 8. For by Grace you are saved,</hi> by free grace, by rich grace, by unchangeable grace. And you are saved from the curse of the Law, from the power, guilt, and filth of sin, from the power, malice, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and rage of the devil, from the wishes, curses, and desires of wicked men, from the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102284:61"/>
hot, scalding, flaming, fiery furnace of hell, from being arraigned, as malefactors, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, judged, condemned, and fettered with the chains of our sins to the devils, to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and all this freely, freely by his grace <hi>(Rom.</hi> 3. 24.) by rich grace, unchangable grace; for saith he, <hi>I am God, and change not: therefore ye sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not consumed,</hi> Mal. 3. 6. This is grace indeed.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>[GRACE]</hi> therefore in this Scripture <hi>(Rom</hi> 6. 14.) is to be understood of the free love of God in Christ to sinners, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the new Covenant, in delwering them from the power of sin, from the curse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power of the Old Covenant, from the destroying nature of sin, by its continual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; as is all evident, if you read with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the words as they lie, <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>sin shall not have dominion over you,</hi> or it shall not domineer, reign, or destroy you, though you have transgressed against the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works (the Law) and the reason is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in these words. <hi>For ye are not under the Law,</hi> that is, under that which accuseth, chargeth, condemneth, and brings execution on the soul for sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>But under Grace;</hi> that is, under that which frees you, forgives you, keeps you, and justifies you from all your sins, adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, or whatever may come in to lay any thing to your charge, to damn you. For that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102284:61"/>
is truly called grace in this sense, that doth set a man free from all his sins, deliver him from all the curses of the Law, and what else can be laid to his charge, freely without any foresight in God to look at what good will be done by the party that hath offended: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that doth keep the soul by the same power through faith (which also is his own proper gift) unto eternal glory.</p>
               <p>Again, that is a pardon not conditional but freely given; Consider first, it is set in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to works. <hi>You are not under the Law.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The promise that is made to them (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Sin shall not have dominion over you)</hi> doth not run with any condition, as on their part to be done; but meerly and alone because they were <hi>(under)</hi> or because they had the Grace of God extended to them. <hi>Sin shall not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over you,</hi> For (mark the reason) <hi>For you are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> The words being thus opened, and the truth thus laid down, how there is never a believer under the Covenant of Works, but under Grade, the free, rich, unchangeable love of God; it remaineth that in the first place we prove the Doctrine, and after that proceed.</p>
               <p>Now in the Doctrine there is two things to be considered and proved. First, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are under Grace. Secondly, Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law as a Covenant of works (for so
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102284:62"/>
you must not understand me) For these two, we need go no further then the very words themselves, the first part of the words proves the first part of the Doctrine, <hi>You are not under the Law;</hi> the second part proves the other, <hi>But</hi> (ye are) <hi>under Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But besides these consider with me a few things for the demonstrating of these truths; as,</p>
               <p>First, They are not under the Law; because their sins are pardoned; which could not be if they were dealt withal according to the Law, and their being under it; for the Law alloweth of no repentance, but accuseth, curseth, and condemneth every one that is under it. <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. But I say, believers having their sins forgiven them, it is because they are under another, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a New Covenant, <hi>Heb. 8. 8. Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with them: For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more,</hi> verse 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are not under the Law; because their sins and iniquities are not only forgiven, but they are forgiven them freely: they that stand in the first Covenant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue there, are to have never a sin forgiven them, unless they can give God a compleat satisfaction; for the Law calls for it at their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102284:62"/>
hands, saying, <hi>Pay me that thou owest.</hi> O but when God deals with his Saints by the Covenant of Grace, it is not so, for it is said, <hi>And when he saw they had nothing to pay, he frankly and freely, forgave them all. I will heal their back-slidings and love them freely. I will blot out thy transgressions for mine own sake,</hi> &amp;c, Luke 7. 42. Hosea 14. 4. Isaiah 43. 25.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Saints are not under the Law, because the righteousness that they stand justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God in, is not their own actual <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> by the <hi>Law,</hi> but by <hi>imputation;</hi> and is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the righteousness of another, namely, of God in Christ, 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>Phil. 3. 8, 9, 10. Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, which is unto all, and upon all</hi> (that is imputed to) <hi>them that believe,</hi> Rom. 3. 22. But if they were under the Old Covenant, the Covenant of Works, then their righteousness must be their own <note n="*" place="margin">But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of man by the Law should save him.</note> or no forgiveness of sins, <hi>If thou do well, shalt not thou be accepted? but if thou transgress, sin lieth at the door,</hi> saith the Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In a word, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they do receive, whether it be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to God, whether it be pardon of sin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be faith or hope, whether it be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, whether it be strength, whether it be the Spirit, or the fruits thereof, whether it be
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102284:63"/>
victory over sin, death or hell, whether it be heaven, everlasting life, and glory unexpressible, or whatsoever it be, it comes to them freely, God having no first eye to what they would do, or should do, for the obtaining of the same. But to take this in pieces. 1. In a word, are they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? God finds them first, for saith he, <hi>I am found of them that sought me not,</hi> Isa. 65. 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Have they pardon of sin? They have that also freely, <hi>I will heal their back-slidings, and love them freely,</hi> Hos. 14. 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Have they faith? It is the gift of God in Christ Jesus, <hi>and he is not only the author</hi> (that is the beginner thereof) <hi>but he doth also perfect the same,</hi> Heb. 12. 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Have they hope? It is God that is the first cause thereof. <hi>Remember thy word unto thy servaut, wherein THOU hast caused me to hope,</hi> Psal. 119. 49.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Have they righteousness? It is the free gift of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Have they strength to do the work of God in their generations? or any other thing that God would have them do, that also is a free gift from the Lord; for without him, we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do, nor can do any thing, <hi>John</hi> 15. 5.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Have we comfort, or consolation? We have it not for what we have done, but from God through Christ; for he is <hi>the God of all our comforts and consolations,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:102284:63"/>
8. Have we the spirit, or the fruits thereof? It is the gift of the Father. <hi>How much more shall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Luke 11. 13. <hi>Thou hast wrought all our works for us,</hi> Isa. 26. 12.</p>
               <p>And so I say, whether it be victory over sin, death, hell, or the devil, it is given us by the victory of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>But thanks be to God which hath given us the victory through our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 57. Rom. 7. 24, 25. Heaven and glory it is also the gift of him <hi>who giveth his richly all things to enjoy,</hi> Mat. 25.</p>
               <p>So that these things, if they be duly and sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, will give satisfaction in this thing. I might have aded many more for the clearing of these things: At first, when God came to man to convert him, he found him a <hi>dead man,</hi> Eph 2. 1, 2. he found him <hi>an enemy to God, Christ, and the salvation of his own soul;</hi> he found him wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in all manner of wickedness, he found him tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleasure therein, with all delight and greediness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He was fain to <hi>quicken him by putting his Spirit into him, and to translate him by the mighty operation thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He was fain to reveal Christ Jesus unto him, <hi>man being altogether senseless, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his blessed Jesus,</hi>  Mat. 11. 25, 27. 1 Cor. 2. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He was fain to break the snare of the devil, and to let poor man, poor bound and fettered man, out of the chains of the enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:102284:64"/>
Now we are to proceed, and the things that we are to treat upon in the second place, are these.</p>
               <p>First, <note n="*" place="margin">Besides the reasons already given.</note> why it is a free and unchangeable grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Who they are, that are actually brought into his free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Covenant of Grace, and how they are brought in.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What are the priviledges of those that are actually brought into this free and glorious grace of the glorious God of heaven, and glory.</p>
               <p>For the first, <hi>Why it is a free and unchangeable grace;</hi> and for the opening of this, we must consider, First, How and through whom this grace doth come to be, first free to us, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly unchangeable. This grace is free to us, through conditions in another; that is, by way of Convenant, or Bargain; for this Grace comes by way of Covenant or Bargain to us, yet made with another, for us.</p>
               <p>First, That it comes by way of Covenant, Contract, or Bargain (though not personally with us) be pleased to consider these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where it is said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 3. <note n="*" place="margin">The word <hi>David</hi> in this place signifieth Christ, as also in these Scriptures.</note> 
                  <hi>I have made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with my chosen: I have sworn unto</hi> David <hi>my servant, And as for thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102284:64"/>
by the blood of thy Covenant</hi> (speaking of Christ) <hi>have I sent forth the prisoners out of the pit, wherein was no water,</hi> Zech. 9. 9, 10, 11. Again, <hi>You have sold your selves for nought, and you shall be bought without money.</hi> Ezek. 34. 23, 24. Chap. 37. 24, 25. <hi>Blessed be the Lord</hi> (therefore saith <hi>Zacharias) for he hath visited and</hi> (also) <hi>REDEEMED his people. And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us, in the house of his servant</hi> David. <hi>As he spake by the mouth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">I might give you more Scriptures, but pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the second thing.</note> 
                  <hi>of his holy Prophets, which have been since the world began: that we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hands of all that hate us: To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his mercy promised to our Fathers, and to remember his holy Covenant,</hi> or Bargain, <hi>Luke</hi> 1, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72. And if any should be offended with the plainness of these words as some poor souls may be through ignorance, let them be pleased to read soberly that 49. Chapter of the the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> from the 1. verse to the 12. and there they may see that it runs as plain a Bargain, as if two should be making of a Bargain between themselves, and concluding upon several conditions on both sides: But more of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now secondly, This Covenant (I say) was made with one, not with many; and also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the conditions of it with one, not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102284:65"/>
with several, First, That the Covenant was made with one, see <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Now to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>and to his seed was the promises made; he saith not to seeds, as of many; but as of one; and to thy seed, which is Christ,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>And this I say, the Covenant which was confirmed before of God in Christ,</hi> &amp;c. The Covenant was made with the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not the seeds, but the seed, which is the Lord Jesus Christ, our head and undertaker in the things concerning the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The condition was made with one, and also accomplished by him alone, and not by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral; yet in the nature, and for the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliverance of many; even by one man Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, as it is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15, 16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in <hi>Zech</hi> 9. 11. the Lord saith to Christ, <hi>And as for thee;</hi> mark, <hi>as for thee also, by the blood of the Covenant,</hi> or as for thee whose Covenant was by blood; that is, the conditions of the Covenant was, that thou shouldest spill thy blood; which having been done in the account of God (saith he) I according to my condition, have let go the prisoners, or sent them out of the pit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was no water; those Scriptures in <hi>Galatians</hi> the 3. at the 16. and 17. verses that are above cited, are notable to our purpose, the sixteenth verse saith, It was made with Christ; and the seventeenth saith, It was also confirmed in, or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102284:65"/>
with God in him, pray read with understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Now</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) the promises were not made unto seeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ.—The Law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anul, that it should make the promise of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Not that the Covenant was with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and Christ together, as two persons that were the undertakers of the same; the promise was made with, or, to <hi>Abraham</hi> afterwards: but the Covenant with Christ before. Further, that the Covenant was not personally made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> no, nor with any of the Fathers, neither so as that they were the persons that should stand ingaged, to be the accomplishers thereof, either in whole or in part, which is very clear.</p>
               <p>First, Because this Covenant was not made with God and the creature; not with another poor <hi>Adam,</hi> that only stood upon the strength of natural abilities: but this Covenant was made with the second person, with the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word of God; with him that was every ways as holy, as pure, as infinite, as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and as everlasting as God <hi>(Prov.</hi> 22. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 11, 17, 22, 13, 16. <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Covenant or Bargain was made indeed and in truth, before man was in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102284:66"/>
being. Oh! God thought of the salvation of man before there was any transgression of man; for then I say, and not since then, was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace made with the undertaker thereof; for all the other sayings are to shew unto us that glorious plot and contrivance that was concluded on before time between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, which may very well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on for a truth from the Word of God, if you consider; First, That the Scripture doth declare that the price was agreed on by the Son before time; the promise was made to him by the Father, that he should have his Bargain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time, and the choice, who they were that should be saved, was made before time, even before the world began.</p>
               <p>For the First, That the price was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the World began; Consider the word which speaketh of the price that was paid for sinners, even <hi>The precious Blood of Christ;</hi> It saith of him, <hi>who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in these last times for you, who by him do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 1. 19, 20. Mark, it was fore-ordained or concluded on between the Father and his Son, before the world began.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The promise from God to the Son was also made in the same manner, as it is clear, where the Apostle saith with comfort to his soul, that he had <hi>hopes of eternal life, which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102284:66"/>
God that cannot lie promised before the World began,</hi> Tit. 1. 2. which could be to none but the Mediator of the New Covenant, because there was none else to whom it should be made but he.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The choice was also made then, even before man had a being in this world, as it is evident where he saith, <hi>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed US with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places IN Christ, according as he hath chosen US in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love,</hi> Eph. 1. 3, 4. Nay, did I look upon it here to be necessary, I should shew you very largely and <note place="margin">Did I think this would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ect with any opposition, I should be in this more large.</note> clearly, that God did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make the Covenant with Christ before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and the conditions thereof: But I could also shew you that the very Saints qualifications as part of the Covenant, was then concluded on by the Father and the Son, according to these Scriptures, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4. Chap. 2. 10. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. which it may be I may touch upon further anon.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, This Covenant was not made with any of the Fathers, neither in whole, nor in part, as the undertakers thereof; for then it must be also concluded, that they are
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102284:67"/>
Co-partners with Christ in our salvation, and so, that Christ is not Mediator alone: but this would be blasphemy for any one to surmize. And therefore by the way, when thou readest of the New Covenant in Scripture, as though it was made with <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> thou art to consider thus with thy self; First, That God spake to them in such a way, for to shew, or signifie unto us, how he did make the Covenant, that he did make with Christ, before the world began, they being types of him. Secondly, That he thereby might let them understand, that he was the same then as he is now, and now as he was then; and that then it was resolved on between his Son and He, that in after ages his Son should in their natures, from their loins, and for their sins be born of a Woman, hanged on the Cross, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for them: for all along you may see that when he speaketh to them of the New Covenant, he mentions their seed, their seed still aiming at Christ; Christ the <hi>Seed</hi> of the Woman, was to break the Serpents head, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. Gen. 17. Psal.</hi> 87. 36. Now to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his <hi>Seed,</hi> was the promise made, his seed shall endure for ever, and his Throne as the days of heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> still pointing at Christ. And Thirdly, To stirup their faith and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations to be constant unto the end, in waiting for that which he and his Son had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102284:67"/>
on before time, and what he had since the conclusion declared unto the world by the Prophets. Fourthly, It appeareth that the heart of God was much delighted therein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, as is evident, in that he was always in every age, declaring of that unto them, which before he had prepared for them. O this good God of Heaven!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But (you will say perhaps) the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures say plainly, that the New Covenant was, and is made with Believers, saying, <hi>The days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a New Covenant with the House of Israel, and the House of</hi> Iudah, <hi>not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers in the day in which I brought them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heb. 8. 10, 11, 12, Jer. 31. 33. So that it doth not run with Christ alone, but with believers also. <hi>I will make a New Covenant with the House of</hi> Israel <hi>and</hi> Judah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Answ.</hi> First, It cannot be meant that the New Covenant was made with Christ, and the House of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker thereof: for so it was made with Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which is clear in that, it was made long before the House of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I shewed before.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Answ.</hi> But Secondly, These words here are spoken, first to shew rather the end of the Ceremonies, then the beginning or rise or
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102284:68"/>
the New Covenant. Mind a little, The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle is labouring to beat the Jews (to whom he wrote this Epistle) off of the Ceremonies of the Law, of the Priests, Altar, Offerings, Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to bring them to the right understanding of the thing and things that they held forth, which was to come, and to put an end to those. If you do but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> it is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course that sheweth, that the Son of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, there is an end put to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; for they were to continue so long and no longer. <hi>It,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>stood in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi> that is, until Christ did come. <hi>But Christ being come an high Priest of good things to come,</hi> &amp;c—puts an end to the things and ordinances of the Levitical Priest-hood, read the 7, 8, 9, 10. Chapters, and you will find this true. So then, when he saith, <hi>The days come in which I will make a New Covenant,</hi> it is rather to be meant a changing of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, a taking away the type, the shadow, the Ceremonies from the House of <hi>Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> and revealing, by the Birth of Christ, and the Death of Christ, and the offering of the Body of him, whom the shaddows and types did point out, to be indeed he, whom God the Father had given for a Ransom by Covenant
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102284:68"/>
for the souls of the Saints; and also to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the truth of that Covenant, which was made between the Father and the Son before the world began: for though the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made before the world began, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so every one in all ages was saved by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Covenant; yet that Covenant was never so clearly made manifest, as at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, death, and resurrection of Christ; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith the Scripture, <hi>He hath brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9, 10. <hi>Who hath saved us, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us with an holy calling, not according to the works of righteousness which we have done: but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ before the world began</hi> (there is the Covenant) <hi>but it was made MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIFEST by the APPEARING of our Saviour Jesus Christ who hath abolished death, and brought life and immortality to LIGHT through the Gospel.</hi> Therefore I say, these words are rather to discover, that the time was come to change the dispensation, to take away the type and bring in the substance, and so manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that more clearly, which before lay hid in dark sayings and figures. And this is usual with God to speak in this manner.</p>
               <p>Again, if at any time you do find in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Covenant of Works is spoken of, as the first Covenant that was manifested,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102284:69"/>
and so before the second Covenant; yet you must understand that it was so only, as to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation, that is, it was first given to man, yet not made before that which was made Christ, And indeed it was requisite that it should be given, or made known first, that thereby there might be a way made for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by its discovering of sin, and the sad state that man was in after the fall, by reason of that. And again, that the other might be made the more welcome to the sons of men. And in this did <note place="margin">Yet the second <hi>Adam</hi> was before the first, and also the second Covenant before the first. This is a Riddle.</note> Christ in time most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously answer <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the figure of Christ <hi>(Rom.</hi> 5.) as well as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: for as the first Covenant was made with the first <hi>Adam,</hi> so was the second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with the second; for these are and were the two great publick persons, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentators of the whole world, as to the first and second Covenants; and therefore you find God speaking on this wise in Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the New Covenant, <hi>My Covenant shall stand fast with HIM,</hi> Psal. 89. 28, 34, 35. <hi>My mercy will I keep for HIM for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> saith God: <hi>my Covenant shall stand fast with HIM</hi> (this <hi>HIM</hi> is Christ, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this with <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.) <hi>My Covenant will I not break,</hi> namely that which was made
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102284:69"/>
with <hi>HIM, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my mouth: Once have I sworn by my Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that I will not lie unto DAVID,</hi> to whom this was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>David</hi> here is to be understood Christ.</note> spoken figuratively in the person of Christ: for that was Gods usual way to speak of the glorious things of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the time of the Law, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The conditions also were conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, and agreed to be fulfilled by him; as it is clear, if you understand his saying in the 12. of <hi>John</hi> at the 27. verse, where he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleth his death, and saith, <hi>Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father save me from this hour; but for this cause came I</hi> (into the world) <hi>unto this hour.:</hi> as if he had said, My business is now not to shrink from my sufferings that are a coming upon me; for these are the things that are a great part of the conditions contracted in the Covenant which stands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my Father and I; therefore I shall not pray that this might be absolutely removed from me. For, <hi>for this cause came I into the vvorld;</hi> even this was the very terms of the Covenant. By this you may say we are under Grace.</p>
               <p>Now in a Covenant there is these three things to be considered.</p>
               <p>First, What it is, that is covenanted for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:102284:70"/>
Secondly, The conditions, upon which the persons, who are concerned in it, do agree.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the conditions on both sides be not according to the agreement fulfilled: then the Covenant standeth not but is made void.</p>
               <p>And this New Covenant in these particulars is very exactly fulfilled, and made out in Christ:</p>
               <p>First, The thing or things covenanted for, was the salvation of man, but made good in Christ. <hi>The Son of man is come to seek and save that which was lost. The Son of Man did not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them. I give my life a ransom for many. And this is the will</hi> (or Covenant) <hi>of him that sent me, that of all which he hath given me, I should lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but should raise it up again at the day,</hi> John 6. 39.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As touchsng the conditions agreed on, they run thus.</p>
               <p>First, On the Mediators side, that he should come into the vvorld; and then on the Fathers side, that he should give him a body. This was one of the <hi>glorious conditions</hi> betwen the <hi>Father</hi> and Christ. <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the vvorld, he saith, Sacrifices and Offerings thou wouldest not,</hi> that is, the Old Covenant must not stand, but give way to another Sacrifice vvhich thou hast prepared, which is the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up my Manhood to the stroaks of thy
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102284:70"/>
                  <hi>Justice, for a body hast thou prepared me,</hi> Heb. 13. 20, 21. This doth prove us under Grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, On the Mediators side, that he should be put to death; and on God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers side, that he should raise him up again; this was concluded on also to be done between God the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ. On Christs side, that he should die to give the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the Father <hi>satisfaction,</hi> and so to take away the curse that was due to us <hi>wretched sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> by reason of our transgressions: and that God his Father being every ways fully and compleatly satisfied, should by his mighty power revive and raise him up again. He hath <hi>brought again—our Lord Jesus,</hi> that is, from death to life, <hi>through</hi> (the vertue or effectual satisfaction that he received from) <hi>the blood</hi> (that was shed according to the terms) <hi>of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, On the Mediators side, that he should be made a curse; and on the Fathers side, that through him sinners should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors of the <hi>blessing;</hi> what wonderful love doth there appear by this in the heart of our Lord Jesus, in suffering such things for our poor bodies and souls, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13, 14. This is Grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That on the Mediators side there should be <hi>by him</hi> a victory over Hell, Death, and the Devil, and the curse of the Law: and on
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102284:71"/>
the Fathers side, that these should be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to sinners, and they set at liberty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>Zech. 9. 12. Turn to the strong hold,</hi> saith God, <hi>ye prisoners of hope, even to day do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that I will render double unto thee:</hi> Why so? It is because of the <hi>blood</hi> of my Sons Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>verse</hi> 11. which made <hi>Paul</hi> (though sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of a body of death, and of the sting that death did strike into the souls of all those that are found in their sins) bold to say, <hi>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? The sting of death is sin,</hi> that is true, and the terrible Law of God doth aggravate, and set it home with unsupportable torment and pain: but shall I be daunted at <hi>this?</hi> No, <hi>I thank my God through Jesus Christ, he hath given me the victory;</hi> so that now, though I be a <hi>sinner</hi> in my self, yet I can by believing in Jesus Christ the Mediator of this New Covenant, <hi>triumph</hi> over the Devil, Sin, Death and Hell; and say, do not fear, my soul, seeing the <hi>victory</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over all my enemies through my Lord Jesus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55, 56, 57. This is the way to prove our selves under Grace.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that on the Mediators side he should by thus doing bring in <hi>everlasting</hi> righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for Saints, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for this should give them an everlasting Kingdom, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3, 4, 5. Eph. 1. 4. 2 Tim. 4. 18. Luke</hi> 22. 28, 29.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102284:71"/>
But in the next place, this <note place="margin">Christ is put into office by the Father to do all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the New Covenant.</note> was not all; that is, the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of Grace, with the conditions thereof, was not only concluded on by both parties to be done: but <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> he must be <hi>authorized</hi> to do what was concluded on, touching this Covenant by way of <hi>Office.</hi> I shall therefore speak a word or two also, touching the <hi>Offices</hi> (at least some of them) that Christ Jesus did, and doth still execute as the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Covenant, which also was typ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by the Levitical Law, for this is the way to prove that we are not under the Law but under Grace.</p>
               <p>And first, His first Office, after <note place="margin">His Surti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> the Covenant was made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ded upon, was, that Jesus should become <hi>bound</hi> as a <hi>Surety,</hi> and stand ingaged upon <hi>Oath</hi> to see that all the conditions of the Covenant, that was concluded on between him and his Father, should according to the <hi>agreement,</hi> be accomplished by him. And secondly, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, he should be the <hi>messenger</hi> from God to the world, for to declare the mind of God, touching the tenor and nature of both the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, especially of the New one; the Scripture saith, that Jesus Christ was not only made a <hi>Priest</hi> by an <hi>Oath,</hi> but also a <hi>surety,</hi> or bonds-man, as in the 7 of <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at the 21. 22.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102284:72"/>
verses; in the 21. verse he speaketh of the priesthood of Christ, that it was with an <hi>Oath,</hi> faith in the 22. verse. <hi>By so much</hi> (also) <hi>was Jesus made the surety of a better Testament,</hi> or Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now the Covenant was not only made on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christs side with an <hi>Oath:</hi> but also on God the Fathers side, that it might be for the better ground of stablishment to all those that are, or are to be the children of the <hi>Promise.</hi> Methinks it is wonderful to consider, that the God and Father of our souls by Jesus Christ, should be so bent upon the salvation of sinners, that he would covenant with his Son Jesus for the <hi>security</hi> of them; and also that there should pass an <hi>Oath</hi> on both sides, for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their resolution to do good: as if the Lord had said, My Son, thou, and I, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e here made a Covenant, that I, on my pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, should do thus, and thus; and that thou on thy part shouldest do so, and so: now that we may give these souls the best <hi>ground</hi> of comfort that may be, there shall pass an <hi>Oath</hi> on both sides, that our children may see that we do indeed love them. <hi>Wherein God willing more ABUNDANTLY to shew unto the heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, the immutability of his counsel</hi> (in making of the Covenant) <hi>confirmed it by an Oath—That we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:102284:72"/>
us; Heb. 6. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Heb. 7. 21. Mark, the sixth Chapter saith God confirmed his part by an <hi>Oath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and the seventh saith, Christ was made, or set on his <hi>Office</hi> also by an <hi>Oath.</hi> Again, <hi>Once</hi> (saith God) <hi>have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto</hi> David, <hi>Psal. 89. 34, 35. nor alter the thing that is gone out of my mouth;</hi> as was before cited.</p>
               <p>Herein you may see that God and Christ was in good earnest about the salvation of <hi>sinners;</hi> for so soon asever the Covenant was made, the next thing was, who should be <hi>bound</hi> to see all those things fulfilled which was <hi>conditioned</hi> on, between the Father and the Son: The <hi>Angels</hi> they would have no hand in it; The <hi>world</hi> could not do it; The <hi>Devils</hi> had rather see them damned, then they would wish them the least good; thus Christ looked, and there was none to help; though the burthen lay never so heavy upon <hi>his shoulder</hi> he must <hi>bear</hi> it himself; for there was none besides himself to uphold, or so much as to step in to be <hi>bound,</hi> to see the conditions (before mentioned) fulfilled, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole, nor in part <hi>(Isa.</hi> 63. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.) So that he must not be only he, with whom the Covenant was <hi>made:</hi> but he must also become the <hi>bonds-man,</hi> or surety thereof; and so stand <hi>bound</hi> to see that all, and every <hi>particular</hi> thing conditioned for, should be both in manner, and matter, at the time,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102284:73"/>
and place, according to the agreement, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and orderly fulfilled. Is not this grace?</p>
               <p>Now as touching the nature of a <hi>surety</hi> and his work (in some things) it is well known to most men; therefore I shall be very brief upon it.</p>
               <p>First, You know a <hi>surety</hi> is at the <hi>bargains</hi> making; and so was Christ. <hi>Then was I by him,</hi> Prov. 8. 30.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A <hi>surety</hi> must consent to the <hi>terms</hi> of the Agreement, or Covenant; and so did Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>Now that which he did ingage, should be done for sinners, according to the terms of the Covenant, it was this.</p>
               <p>First, That there should be a <hi>compleat</hi> satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction given to God for the sins of the world, for that was one great thing that was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Covenant was made, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Jesus Christ should (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid) bring in an everlasting righteousness to cloath (his body) the Saints withal, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24, 25. Here is grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That he should take in <hi>charge</hi> to see all those forth coming without <hi>spot</hi> or <hi>wrinkle,</hi> at the day of his glorious appearing from heaven to judgment, and to quit them before the Judgment-seat.</p>
               <p>Again, Thirdly in the work of a <hi>surety,</hi> there is required by the <hi>creditor,</hi> that the <hi>surety</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:102284:73"/>
should stand to what he is <hi>bound;</hi> and on the <hi>sureties</hi> there is a consenting thereunto.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>creditor</hi> looks that in case the <hi>debtor</hi> proves <note place="margin">However it is in other ingagements, yet it is thus in this.</note> a bankrupt, that then the <hi>surety</hi> should ingage the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Is not this grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>creditor</hi> looks that the <hi>sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> should be an <hi>able man:</hi> now our <hi>surety</hi> was, and is, in this case every way suitable, for he is <hi>heir of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>creditor</hi> appoints the day and also looks that the Covenant should be kept, and the debt paid according to the <hi>time</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and it is required of <hi>sureties</hi> (as well as stewards) that they be found faithful, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to pay the debt according to the <hi>bargain:</hi> and therefore it is said, <hi>When the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son—made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, to redeem them that are under the Law</hi> (according to his suretiship) <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. thus comes grace to Saints.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>creditor</hi> looks that his <hi>money</hi> should be brought into his house, to his own habitation. Jesus our <hi>surety,</hi> in <hi>this</hi> also is faithful; for by his <hi>own</hi> blood, which was the <hi>payment,</hi> he is entred into the holy place, even into heaven it self which is Gods <hi>dwelling</hi> place, to render the <hi>value</hi> and <hi>price</hi> that was <hi>agreed</hi> upon for the salvation of <hi>sinners;</hi> but I shall
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102284:74"/>
speak more of this in another head, therefore I pass it.</p>
               <p>Again fourthly, if the <note place="margin">Though the debtor together with the sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is liable to pay the debt by the Law of man, yet Christ our surety only by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</note> 
                  <hi>surety</hi> stands <hi>bound,</hi> the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is at liberty, and if the Lavv do issue out any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to take any, it vvill be the <hi>surety;</hi> and O! hovv wonderful true was this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, in that when Christ our <hi>surety</hi> came down from heaven, Gods Law did so seize upon the Lord Jesus, and so cruelly handle him, and so exact upon him, that it would never let him alone, until it had accused him, and condemned him, executed him, and scrued his very hearts blood out of his precious heart, and side; nay, and more than this too, as I shall shew hereafter.</p>
               <p>But secondly, in the next place, after that Jesus Christ had stood bound, and was become our <hi>surety</hi> in things pertaining to this <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> his next office was to be the <hi>messenger</hi> of God touching his <hi>Mind,</hi> and the tenour of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> unto the poor world; and this did the Prophet fore-see long before, when he faith, <hi>Behold I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare thy way before thee;</hi> (speaking of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist) <hi>And he shall prepare thy way before thee:</hi> (and then he speaketh of Christ to the people, saying,) <hi>And the Lord whom ye
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102284:74"/>
seek, shall suddenly come to his Temple,</hi> Who is he? <hi>even the messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in:</hi> (that is Christ) <hi>behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts,</hi> Mal. 3. 1.</p>
               <p>Now the Covenant being made before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son, and Jesus Christ becoming bound to see all the conditions ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, this being done, he comes down from Heaven to Earth, to declare to the world what <hi>God</hi> the Father and <hi>He,</hi> had concluded on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and what was the mind of the Father towards the world, concerning the salvation of their <hi>souls:</hi> and indeed who could better come of such an <hi>errand,</hi> then he that stood by when the <hi>Covenant</hi> was made; then he that <hi>shook hands</hi> with the Father in making of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> then he that was become a <hi>surety</hi> in the behalf of poor Sinners, according to the terms of this <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now you know a <hi>messenger</hi> commonly when he cometh, he doth bring some errand to them to whom he is sent, either of what is done for them, or what they would have them, whom they send unto, do for them, or such like. Now what a glorious <hi>message</hi> was that which our Lord Jesus Christ came down from Heaven withal to declare unto poor sinners, and that from God his Father I say, how glorious was it, and how sweet is it to you that have seen your selves lost by nature; and it will also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

a glorious one to you, who are a seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Jesus Christ; if you do but consider these follovving things about vvhat he vvas sent.</p>
               <p>First, Jesus Christ was sent from Heaven, to declare unto the world, from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he was <hi>wonderfully</hi> filled with love to poor sinners. First, In that he would <hi>forgive</hi> their <hi>sins.</hi> Secondly, In that he would <hi>save</hi> their <hi>souls.</hi> Thirdly, In that he would make them <hi>heirs</hi> of his glory. <hi>For God so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son.—For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved,</hi> John 3. 15, 16, 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God sent Jesus Christ to tell the poor world, how that he would do this for poor sinners, and yet be <hi>just,</hi> and yet do his <hi>Justice</hi> no wrong; and that was to be done by Jesus Christ, his <hi>dying</hi> of a <hi>cursed</hi> death in the <hi>room</hi> of poor sinners, to satisfie <hi>justice,</hi> and make way for mercy; to take away the <hi>stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks,</hi> and set open <hi>Heaven-gates;</hi> to overcome <hi>Satan,</hi> and break off from <hi>sinners</hi> his chains; to set <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. open the prison doors, and to let the prisoners go free, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 1, 2, 3. And this was the <hi>message</hi> that Christ was to <hi>deliver</hi> to the world by commandment from his Father; and this did he tell us when he came of his <hi>errand,</hi> where he saith, <hi>I lay
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102284:76"/>
down my life for my Sheep.—No man taketh it a way from me, but I lay it down of my self: I have power to lay it down, and to take it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and this commandment have I reecived of my Father,</hi> John 10. 15, 16, 17, 18. even this commandment hath my Father given me, that I should both do this thing, and also tell it unto you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He was not only sent as a <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> this hit Fathers love; but also how dearly he himself loved sinners, what a heart he had to do them good, where he saith, <hi>All that the Father hath given me, shall come to me</hi> (and let me tell you my heart too, saith Christ) <hi>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi> As my Father is <hi>willing</hi> to give you unto <hi>me,</hi> even so am I, as <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> you. As my Father is <hi>willing</hi> to give you Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, so am I <hi>willing</hi> to make you fit for it, by washing you with my own blood: I lay down my life, that you might have life; and this I was sent to tell you of my Father.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His <hi>Message</hi> was further; he came to tell them how, and which way they should come to enjoy these glorious benefits: also by laying down motives, to stir them up to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the benefits: The way is laid down in <hi>John</hi> 3. 14, 15. where Christ saith, <hi>As</hi> Moses <hi>lifted up the serpent in the wilderness; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</hi> or caused

to be hanged on the Cross, and die the death, <hi>That whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> The way therefore that thou shalt have the benefit and comfort of that which my Father and I have <hi>covenanted</hi> for <hi>thee,</hi> I am come down from heaven to earth on purpose to give thee intelligence, and to certifie thee of it: know therefore, that as I have been born of a woman, and have taken this body upon me, it is on purpose that I might offer it up upon the Cross a Sacrifice to God, to give him satisfaction for <hi>thy sins,</hi> that his <hi>mercy</hi> may be extended to <hi>thy soul,</hi> without any wrong done to <hi>justice;</hi> and this thou art to believe, and not in the notion, but from thy very whole soul. Now the motives are many. First, If they do not leave their sins, and come to Jesus Christ, that their sins may be <hi>washed</hi> away by his blood, they are sure to be <hi>damned</hi> in hell; for the <hi>Law</hi> hath condemned them <hi>already,</hi> John 3. 18, 19. Secondly, But if they do come, they shall have the <hi>bosome</hi> of Christ to lye in, the <hi>kingdom</hi> of Heaven to dwell in, the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> for their companions, shall <hi>shine</hi> there like the <hi>Sun,</hi> shall be there for <hi>ever,</hi> shall <hi>sit</hi> upon the <hi>Thrones</hi> of <hi>Judgment, &amp;c.</hi> Here is Grace.</p>
               <p>Methinks if I had but time to speak fully to all things that I could speak to from these two heavenly Truths, and to make application
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102284:78"/>
thereof; surely, with the blessing of God, I think it might perswade some vile and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wretch to lay down his arms that he hath taken up in defiance against God (and is marching hell-wards, poste haste with the Devil) I say methinks it should stop them, and make them willing to look back, and accept of salvation for their poor condemned fouls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods eternal vengeance is executed upon them. O therefore! you that are upon this march, I beseech you consider a little. What, shall Christ become a <hi>drudge</hi> for you? and will you be <hi>drudges</hi> for the Devil? Shall Christ co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God for the <hi>salvation</hi> of sinners? and shall sinners covenant with Hell, Death, and the Devil, for the <hi>damnation</hi> of their souls? Shall Christ come down from Heaven to Earth to declare this to sinners? and shall sinners stop their ears against this good tidings? Will you not hear the <hi>errand</hi> of Christ, although he <hi>tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi> you <hi>tidings</hi> of peace and salvation? How if he had came, having taken a command from his Father to damn you, and to send you to the Devils in Hell? Sinner hear his <hi>message,</hi> he speaketh <hi>no harm,</hi> his words are eternal life, all men that give ear unto them, they have eternal advantage by them. Advantage, I say, that never hath an end.</p>
               <p>Besides, do but consider these two things, 'tis like they may have some sway upon thy soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:102284:79"/>
First, When he came on his message, he came with tears in his eyes, and did even weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly tender the terms of reconciliation to them; I say with tears in his eyes. And when he came near the City <hi>(i. e.)</hi> with his message of peace, beholding the hardness of their hearts, he wept over it, and took up a lamentation over it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saw they rejected his mercy, which was tidings of peace. (I say) wilt thou then slight a weeping Jesus, one that so loveth thy soul, that rather then he will lose thee, he will with tears perswade with thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not only so, but also when he came, he came all on a goar blood to proffer mercy to thee, to shew thee still how dearly he did love thee; as if he had said, sinner, here is mercy for thee; but behold my bloody sweat, my bloody wounds, my cursed death; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and see what danger I have gone through to come unto thy soul: I am come indeed unto thee, and do bring thee tidings of salvation, but it cost me my heart blood before I could come at thee, to give thee the fruits of my everlasting love. But more of this anon.</p>
               <p>Thus have I spoken something concerning Christ, being the messenger of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but because I am not willing to cut too short of what shall come after, I shall pass by these things, not half touched, and come
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102284:79"/>
to the other which I promised even now; which was to shew you, that as there was Levitical Ceremonies, in, or, belonging to the first Covenant, so these Types, or Levitical Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, did represent the glorious things of the New Covenant. In those Ceremonies, you read of a Sacrifice, of a Priest to offer up the Sacrifice; the place where, and the manner how he was to offer it: of which I shall speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As touching the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> you find that it was not to be offered up of all kind of beasts; as of <hi>Lions, Bears, Wolves, Tigers, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, Serpents,</hi> or such like. To signifie, that not all kind of <hi>Creatures</hi> that had sinned, as <hi>Devils</hi> the <hi>fallen Angels,</hi> should be saved: but the <hi>Sacrifice was</hi> to be taken out of some kind of <hi>Beasts</hi> and <hi>Birds:</hi> to signifie, that some of <hi>Gods Creatures</hi> that had <hi>sinned,</hi> he would be pleased to reconcile them to himself again; as poor fallen <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> those miserable <hi>Creatures:</hi> God, the God of Heaven, had a good look for after their fall: but not for the <hi>cursed Devils;</hi> though more noble Creatures by <hi>Creation</hi> than <hi>We.</hi> Here is grace.</p>
               <p>Now though these <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were offered; yet they were not offered to the end, they should make the comers to, or offerers thereof <hi>perfect:</hi> but the things was to represent to the world, what God had in after ages for to do;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102284:80"/>
which was even the salvation of his Creatures by <hi>that offering</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> of Jesus Christ, of which these were a shaddow and a type for the accomplishing of the second Covenant. For Christ was by Covenant to offer a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and that an effectual one too, if he intended the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of sinners: <hi>A body hast thou prepared me; I am come to do thy will,</hi> Heb. 10.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore shew you, <hi>First,</hi> what was <hi>expected</hi> of God in the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> in the <hi>Type,</hi> and then shew you how it was answered in the <hi>Antitype.</hi> Secondly, I shall shew you the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of the <hi>offering</hi> of the <hi>type;</hi> and so answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereto, to shew you the fitness of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ, by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering some questions.</p>
               <p>For the first of these.</p>
               <p>First, God did expect that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which he himself had appointed, and not another. To signifie that none would serve his turn, but the body and soul of his appointed Christ, the Mediator of the New Covenant, <hi>John</hi> 1. 29.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This <hi>Sacrifice</hi> must not be <hi>lame</hi> nor <hi>deformed;</hi> it must have no <hi>scar, spot</hi> or <hi>blemish;</hi> to signifie, that Jesus Christ was to be a <hi>compleat Sacrifice</hi> by Covenant, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 29.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This <hi>sacrifice</hi> was to be taken out of the <hi>flock</hi> or <hi>herd;</hi> to signifie that Jesus Christ <hi>was</hi> to <hi>come</hi> out of the <hi>race</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:102284:80"/>
But Secondly, As to the manner of it: <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>sacrifice,</hi> before it was offered, was to have the sins of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over it: to signifie, that Jesus Christ must <hi>Isa. 53. 4, 5, 6, 7. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 24. bear the sins of all his children by Covenant. <hi>As for thee, by the blood of thy Covenant, in his own body on the tree,</hi> Zech. 9. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It must be had to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, namely, <hi>without</hi> the Camp of <hi>Israel:</hi> to signifie, that Jesus Christ must be <hi>led</hi> to the Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> Luke 23. 33.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>sacrifice</hi> was to be <hi>killed there;</hi> to signifie, that Jesus Christ must, and did <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> without the City of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the <hi>sacrifice</hi> must not only have its life taken away, but also some of its <hi>flesh burned</hi> upon the <hi>Altar:</hi> to signifie, that Jesus Christ was not only to <hi>dye</hi> a <hi>natural</hi> death, but also that he should <hi>undergo</hi> the <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the damned <hi>in hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Sometimes there must be a <hi>living</hi> offering, and a <hi>dead</hi> offering; as the goat that was killed and the scape goat; the <hi>dead</hi> bird, and the <hi>living</hi> bird, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. 3, 4, 5, 6. To signifie, that Jesus Christ must <hi>dye,</hi> and come to <hi>life</hi> again.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The goat that was to <hi>dye, was</hi> to be the <hi>sin-offering;</hi> that is, to be offered as the rest of the sin-offerings, to make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102284:81"/>
as a type; and the <hi>other goat,</hi> was to have <hi>all the sins</hi> of the Children of <hi>Israel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed</hi> over <hi>him, Levit.</hi> 16. from the 7. verse to the 22. and then to <hi>be let go</hi> into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>never</hi> to be catched again, to signifie that Christs <hi>death,</hi> was to make satisfaction for sin; and his coming to <hi>life</hi> again, was to bring in everlasting <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. justification, from the power, curse, and destroying nature of sin.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The scape goat was to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by a <hi>fit</hi> man into the wilderness. To sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that Jesus Christ should be both <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> to carry our sins quite away from us, so as they should never be laid to our charge again. Here is Grace.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The sacrifices under the Law, commonly part of them must be <hi>eaten,</hi> Exod. 12. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. To signifie, that they that are saved, should spiritually <hi>feed</hi> on the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of Jesus <hi>Christ,</hi> or else they have no <hi>life</hi> by him, <hi>John</hi> 6. 51, 52, 53.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, This sacrifice must be eaten with <hi>unleavened bread:</hi> To signifie, that they which <hi>love</hi> their <hi>sins,</hi> that devilish <hi>leaven</hi> of <hi>wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> they do not <hi>feed</hi> upon Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Now of what hath been spoken, this is the <hi>sum:</hi> that there is a <hi>sacrifice</hi> under the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as there was sacrifices under the Old; and that this sacrifice did every way answer <hi>that,</hi> or <hi>those:</hi> Indeed, they did but suffer for

sin in shew, but he in reality; they as the <hi>sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> but he as the <hi>substance.</hi> O! when Jesus Christ did come to make himself a <hi>sacrifice,</hi> or to offer himself for <hi>sin,</hi> you may understand that our sins was indeed charged to purpose upon him: O how they scared his <hi>soul,</hi> how they brake his <hi>body;</hi> insomuch that they made the blood run down his blessed face, and from his precious side; therefore thou must understand these <note place="margin">As Christ did not suffer in his body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suffering in soul, nor yet in soul without his suffering in body; it was because not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without the soul but both the body and soul of the Saints should be for ever saved.</note> following things. First, that Jesus Christ by Covenant did dye for sin. Secondly, that his death was not a meer natural death, but a cursed death; even such a one as men do undergo from God for their sins (though he himself had none) even such a death, as to endure the very pains and torments of <hi>hell;</hi> O sad <hi>pains!</hi> and in expressible <hi>torments,</hi> that this our <hi>sacrifice</hi> for sin went under. The pains of his <hi>body</hi> was not all; no, but the pains of his <hi>soul;</hi> for his <hi>soul</hi> was made an offering, as well as his body; yet all but one sacrifice, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. To signifie, that the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ was not only a <hi>bodily</hi> suffering, but a <hi>soul</hi> suffering; not only to suffer what man could inflict upon him: but also to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>soul torments,</hi> that none but God can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102284:82"/>
or suffer to be inflicted upon him. O the torments of his soul! they were torment <hi>indeed;</hi> his <hi>soul</hi> was that that felt the <hi>wrath</hi> of God. <hi>My soul</hi> saith he, <hi>is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,</hi> Mat. 26. 38. <hi>My soul is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and what shall I say,</hi> John 12. 27. The <hi>Rock</hi> was not so <hi>rent,</hi> as was his precious <hi>soul:</hi> there was not such a terrible <hi>darkness</hi> on the face of the earth then, as there was on his precious <hi>soul.</hi> O the <hi>torments</hi> of <hi>hell!</hi> and the <hi>eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi> of the divine smiles of God, were both upon him at <hi>once;</hi> the <hi>Devils</hi> assailing of him, and <hi>God</hi> forsaking of him, and all at <hi>once. My God, my God,</hi> saith he, <hi>why hast thou forsaken me,</hi> Mat. 27. 46. now in my greatest extremity; now <hi>sin</hi> is laid upon me, the <hi>curse</hi> takes hold on me, the <hi>pains</hi> of <hi>hell</hi> are clasped about me, and thou hast <hi>forsaken</hi> me. O sad! Sinner, this was not done in <hi>pretence,</hi> but in <hi>reality;</hi> not in <hi>shew,</hi> but in very <hi>deed;</hi> Otherwise Christ had <hi>dissembled,</hi> and had not spoken the <hi>truth;</hi> but the truth of it, his <hi>bloody sweat</hi> declares, his <hi>mighty cries</hi> declares, the things what, and for what he <hi>suffered</hi> declares. Nay, I must say thus much, that all the <hi>damned souls</hi> in <hi>hell,</hi> with all their <hi>damnations,</hi> did never yet <hi>feel</hi> that <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>pain,</hi> that did this <hi>blessed Jesus</hi> in a <hi>little time.</hi> Sinner, canst thou read that Jesus Christ was made an <hi>offering</hi> for <hi>sin,</hi> and yet go on in <hi>sin?</hi> Canst thou hear that the <hi>lead</hi> of thy
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102284:82"/>
                  <hi>sins</hi> did break the very heart of Christ, and spill his <hi>precious Blood?</hi> And canst thou find in thy <hi>heart</hi> to <hi>labour</hi> to lay <hi>more sins</hi> upon his <hi>back?</hi> Canst thou <hi>hear</hi> that he <hi>suffered</hi> the <hi>pains,</hi> the <hi>fiery flames</hi> of <hi>Hell?</hi> and canst thou find in thy heart, to <hi>add</hi> to his <hi>groans,</hi> by <hi>slighting</hi> of his <hi>sufferings?</hi> O hard hearted wretch! How canst thou deal so unkindly with such a sweet Lord Jesus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why did Christ offer himself in <hi>sacrifice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That thou shouldest not be thrown to the very <hi>Devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why did he spill his <hi>precious blood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That thou mightest enjoy the joys of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why did he <hi>suffer</hi> the <hi>pains</hi> of <hi>Hell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That thou mightest not <hi>fry</hi> with the <hi>devil</hi> and <hi>damned souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But could not we have been saved if Christ had not died?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No, for without <hi>shedding</hi> of <hi>blood,</hi> there is no <hi>remission:</hi> and besides, there was no <hi>death,</hi> that could satisfie <hi>Gods justice</hi> but his, which is evident; because there was none in a capacity to dye, or that was <hi>able</hi> to answer an <hi>infinite</hi> God by his so <hi>suffering,</hi> but he.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why did God let him dye?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> He standing in the room of sinners; and that in their <hi>names</hi> and <hi>natures,</hi> Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102284:83"/>
must fall upon <hi>him;</hi> for justice takes ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance for sin wheresoever it finds it, though it be on his dear <hi>Son.</hi> Nay, God favoured his <hi>Son</hi> no more, finding our sins upon him, then he would have favoured any of <hi>us:</hi> For, should <hi>we</hi> have died? so did <hi>he.</hi> Should we have been made a <hi>curse?</hi> so was <hi>he.</hi> Should <hi>we</hi> have undergone the pains or <hi>hell?</hi> so did <hi>he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But did he indeed suffer the torments of hell?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, and that in such an horrible way too, that it is unspeakable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Could he not have suffered without his so suffering? would not his dying only of a <hi>natural</hi> death have served the turn?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ</hi> No, in no wise: The <hi>sins,</hi> for which he suffered, called for the torments of hell; the <hi>condition</hi> in which he <hi>died,</hi> did call for the torments of <hi>hell;</hi> for Christ did not dye the death of a Saint, but the death of a Sinner; of a cursed and damned sinner (because he stood in their rooms, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.) the Law to which he was subjected, called for the torments of <hi>hell;</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of Gods justice could not bate him any thing, the <hi>death</hi> which he was to suffer, had not <hi>lost</hi> its <hi>sting;</hi> all these being put together do irresistibly declare unto us, that he as a sacrifice, did suffer the torments of hell.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, had he not died and suffered the cursed death, the Covenant had been made
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102284:83"/>
void, and his <hi>suretiship</hi> would have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited; and <hi>besides</hi> this, the world <hi>damned</hi> in the Flames of Hell fire: therefore his being a <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> was one part of the Covenant; for the terms of the Covenant was, that he should spill his blood, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 10, 11. O blessed Jesus! O blessed Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why then is his death so slighted by some?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Because they are <hi>enemies</hi> to him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>presumption;</hi> either for want of <hi>knowledge,</hi> or out of <hi>malice;</hi> for surely, did they <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>believe</hi> him, they could not chuse but <hi>break,</hi> and <hi>bleed</hi> at <hi>heart,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and to think of him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Thus, passing this, I shall now speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Christs <hi>Priestly Office:</hi> but by the way, if any should think, that I do here spin my thread too long in distinguishing his <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> from his being a <hi>sacrifice;</hi> they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that for Christ to be a Priest and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is all one and the same thing, and it may be it is; because they have not thought on this so well as they should: Namely, that as he was a sacrifice, he was <hi>passive,</hi> Isa. 53. that is, led, or had away as a lamb to his sufferings: But as a Priest, he was <hi>active;</hi> that is, he did willingly, and freely give up his body to be a sacrifice. <hi>He hath given his life a ransom for many.</hi> This consideration being with some
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102284:84"/>
weight and clearness on my spirit, I was, and am caused to lay them down in two particular heads. And therefore,</p>
               <p>The second thing that I would speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to, it is this; that as there were <hi>Priests</hi> under the first <hi>Covenant,</hi> so there is a Priest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, belonging to this <hi>New Covenant,</hi> a high <hi>Priest,</hi> the chief <hi>Priest:</hi> as it is clear, where it is said, <hi>We having an high Priest over the House of God,</hi> Heb. 10. 21. Chap. 3. 1 Chap. 5. 5, 10. and Chap. 7. 24, 25, 26. Chap. 8. 1, 4.</p>
               <p>Now the things that I shall treat upon are these. First, I shall shew you the <hi>Qualifications</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a <hi>Priest</hi> under the Law. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his Office; and thirdly, how Jesus Christ did according to what was signified by those under the Law: I say, how he did answer the <hi>Types,</hi> and where he went beyond them.</p>
               <p>For his Qualifications.</p>
               <p>First, They must be called thereto of God; <hi>No man take this honour upon him, but he that is called of God, as</hi> Aaron, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. Now <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arons</hi> being called of God to be a <hi>Priest,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is a <hi>Priest</hi> of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, such a one that God hath chosen, likes of, and hath set on work, <hi>called of God an high Priest,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:102284:84"/>
Secondly, The <hi>Priests</hi> under the Law, they must be men <hi>compleat,</hi> not deformed; <hi>Speak unto</hi> Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron saith God to <hi>Moses, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations, that hath any ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God: for whatsoever man he be that hath a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, he shall not approach</hi> (if he be) <hi>a blind man, or a lame man, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous, or a man that is broken footed, or broken handed, or crookt backt, or a dwarf, or he that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken: No man that hath a blemish of the seed of</hi> Aaron <hi>the Priest, shall come nigh to offer offerings of the Lord made by fire; he hath a blemish, he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God,</hi> Levit. 21. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. What doth all this signifie, but that, in the first place, he must not be <hi>lame,</hi> to signifie he must not go <hi>haltingly</hi> about the work of our salvation. 2. He must not be <hi>blind,</hi> to signifie, that he must not go <hi>ignorantly</hi> to work, but he must be <hi>quick</hi> of understanding in the things of God. 3. He must not be <hi>scabbed,</hi> to <hi>signifie,</hi> that the Priest must not be <hi>corrupt,</hi> or <hi>filthy</hi> in his Office. 4. In a word, he must be every ways <hi>compleat,</hi> to signifie to us, that Jesus Christ was to be, and is most <hi>compleat,</hi> and most perfect every way, an <hi>acceptable</hi> high Priest in things pertaining to God, in reference to this second Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:102284:85"/>
Thirdly, The <hi>Priests</hi> under the Law were not to be <hi>hard hearted,</hi> but <hi>pitiful</hi> and <hi>compassionate,</hi> willing and ready, with abundance of bowels to offer for the people, and to make an <hi>atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for them, Heb. 5. 1, 2. To <hi>signifie,</hi> that Jesus Christ should be a <hi>tender hearted</hi> high Priest, <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>simpathize,</hi> and be affected with the <hi>infirmities</hi> of others, to pray for <hi>them,</hi> to offer up for <hi>them</hi> his precious blood; he must be such an one, <hi>who can have compassion on</hi> (a company of poor) <hi>ignorant souls, and on them that are out of the way,</hi> to recover <hi>them,</hi> and to set <hi>them</hi> in safety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. and that he might thus do, he must be a <hi>man</hi> that had experience of the disadvantages that <hi>infirmity</hi> and sin did bring unto these poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The high <hi>Priests</hi> under the Law were not to be shie or <hi>squemish,</hi> in case there was any that had the <hi>plague</hi> or <hi>leprosie, scab</hi> or <hi>blaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> but must look on them, go to them, and offer for them <hi>(Levit.</hi> 13. read that whole Chapter) all which is to <hi>signifie,</hi> that Jesus Christ should not <hi>refuse</hi> to take notice of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral infirmities,</hi> of his poorest people, but to teach them, and to see that none of them be lost, by reason of their infirmity, for want of looking to, or tending of. This priviledge also have we under this second Covenant. This is the way to make Grace shine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:102284:85"/>
Fifthly, The high <hi>Priests</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> they were to be anointed with very <hi>excellent</hi> Oyl, compounded by art <hi>(Exod.</hi> 29. 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 30. 30.) to <hi>signifie,</hi> that Jesus the great high <hi>Priest</hi> of this New Covenant, should be in a most eminent way anointed to his <hi>Priestly</hi> Office by the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The <hi>Priests</hi> food and livelihood in the time of his <hi>Ministry,</hi> was to be the <hi>consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and <hi>holy things,</hi> Exod. 29. 33. to <hi>signifie,</hi> that it is the very <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> of Jesus Christ, to do his <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> and to save and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his poor tempted and afflicted Saints. O what a New Covenant high Priest have we!</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Priests under the Law, were to be washed with water, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 4. to <hi>signifie,</hi> that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> should not go about the work of his <hi>Priestly Office</hi> with the silth of sin upon him, but was <hi>without</hi> sin to appear as our high Priest in the presence of his Father, to execute his Priestly Office there for our advantage. <hi>For such a high Priest became us, who is holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,</hi> Heb. 7. 26.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The high Priests under the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went into the holy place, they were to be clothed with a <hi>curious</hi> garment, a <hi>breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed coat, a mitre, and a girdle,</hi> and these were to be made of <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>blue,</hi> and <hi>purple,</hi> and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102284:86"/>
                  <hi>scarlet,</hi> and <hi>fine linnen;</hi> and in this <hi>garment</hi> and glorious <hi>ornaments,</hi> there must be <hi>precious stones,</hi> and on those <hi>stones</hi> there must be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the <hi>names of the children of</hi> Israel (read the 28. of <hi>Exodus)</hi> and all was to <hi>signifie</hi> what a <hi>glorious</hi> high Priest Jesus Christ should be; and how in the <hi>righteousness</hi> of God, he should <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> before God as our high <hi>Priest,</hi> to offer up the <hi>sacrifice</hi> that was to be offered for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to God his Father: but I pass that.</p>
               <p>Now I shall speak to his Office: The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the high Priest in general was two-fold. First, <hi>To offer</hi> the sacrifice <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> the Camp. Secondly, <hi>To bring</hi> it within the vail, that is, into the holiest of all, which did type out Heaven.</p>
               <p>First, It was the Office of the Priest to offer the sacrifice, and so did Jesus Christ, he did offer his own body and soul in sacrifice. I say, HE did OFFER it, and not another, as it is written, <hi>No man taketh away my life, but I lay it down of my self; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again,</hi> John 10. 17, 18. And again it is said, <hi>When he</hi> (Jesus) <hi>had offered up one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God,</hi> Heb. 10. 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Priests under the Law must offer up the sacrifice that God had appointed, and none else, a compleat one without any blemish: and so did our high Priest, where he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102284:86"/>
saith, <hi>Sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me,</hi> and that will I offer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Priest was to take of the ashes of the sacrifice, and lay them in a clean place: and this signifies, that the body of Jesus after it had been offered, should be laid into <hi>Josephs sepulchre,</hi> as in a clean place, where never any man before was laid, <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. 11. compared with <hi>John</hi> 19. 41, 42.</p>
               <p>This being one part of his office, and when this was done, then in the next place he was to put on the glorious garment, when he was to go into the <hi>holiest,</hi> and take of the blood, and carry it thither, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he was to put on the <hi>holy garment,</hi> which signifieth the <hi>righteousness</hi> of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He was in this <hi>holy garment,</hi> which hath in it the <hi>stones,</hi> and in the <hi>stones</hi> the <hi>names</hi> of the <hi>Twelve Tribes</hi> of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> to appear in the holy place, <hi>Exodus 28. And thou shalt take two Onix stones, and shalt grave on them the names of the children of</hi> Israel. <hi>Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of the rest on the other stone, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their birth,</hi> ver. 9, 10. And this was to signifie, that when Jesus Christ was to enter into the holiest, then he was there to bear the names of his elect, in the tables of his heart, before the <hi>Throne</hi> of God, and the <hi>Mercy-seat,</hi> Heb. 12. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:102284:87"/>
Thirdly, With this he was to take of the <hi>blood</hi> of the sacrifices, and carry it into the holiest of all, which was a type of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and there was he to sprinkle the mercy-seat; and this was to be done by the high Priest on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. To signifie, that none but Jesus Christ must have this office and priviledge, to be the peoples high Priest to offer for them. <hi>Heb. 9. 7. But into the second went the high priest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone once every year, yet not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, He was there to make an <hi>atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for the people with the blood, sprinkling of it upon the mercy-seat; but this must be done with much incense, <hi>Levit. 16. And</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron <hi>shall bring the bullock which is for a sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the Altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail: And he shall put the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense upon the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat, that is upon the testimony; that he dye not. And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mercy-seat east-ward, and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle the blood with his finger seven
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102284:87"/>
times. And then he shall kill the goat of the sin-offering which is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy-seat,</hi> verse 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Now this was for the priest and the people; all which doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that Jesus Christ was after his death, to go into heaven it self, of which this holy place was a figure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. and there to carry the <hi>sacrifice</hi> that he offered upon the Cross into the presence of God, for to obtain mercy for the people in a way of justice. And in that he is said to take his hands full of sweet incense, it signifies, that Jesus Christ was to offer up his <hi>sacrifice</hi> in the presence of his Father, in a way of intercession and prayers.</p>
               <p>I might have branched these things out into several particulars, but I would be brief.</p>
               <p>I say, therefore the office of the Priests was to carry the blood into the holy place, and there to present it before the mercy-seat, with his heart full of intercessions for the people, for <hi>whom</hi> he was a <hi>Priest,</hi> Luke 1. 8, 9, 10, 11. This is Jesus Christs work <hi>now</hi> in the kingdom of glory to plead his own blood, the nature and vertue of it, with a perpetual intercession to the God of mercy, on the behalf of us poor miserable sinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24.</p>
               <p>Now in the intercession of this Jesus, which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102284:88"/>
is part of his priestly office, there is these things to be considered for our comfort.</p>
               <p>First, There is a pleading of the vertue of his blood, <hi>for them</hi> that are already come in; that they may be kept from the <hi>evils</hi> of <hi>heresies, delusions, temptations, pleasures, profits,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of this world, which may be too hard for them. Father, <hi>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil,</hi> John 17. 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in case the devil <hi>should</hi> aspire up into the presence of God, to acuse any of the poor <hi>Saints,</hi> and to plead their back-slidings against them, as he will do if he can; then there is <hi>Jesus,</hi> our <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> ready in the Court of Heaven, at the right hand of God, to plead the <hi>vertue</hi> of his <hi>blood,</hi> not only for the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>general</hi> satisfaction that he did give when he was on the Cross; but also the <hi>vertue</hi> that is in it <hi>now,</hi> for the <hi>cleansing,</hi> and <hi>fresh purging</hi> of his poor Saints, under their several temptations and infirmities; as saith the Apostle, <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son: much more then being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life;</hi> that is, by his intercession, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>maintaining</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> also, is by <hi>Jesus Christs intercession,</hi> being the second part of his Priestly Office. O! had we not a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102284:88"/>
                  <hi>Jesus</hi> at the right hand of God, making inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us, and to convey fresh supplies of Grace unto us, through the <hi>vertue</hi> of his <hi>blood,</hi> being pleaded at Gods right hand; how soon would it be with us, as it is with <hi>those</hi> for whom he prays not at all; <hi>John</hi> 17. 9. But the reason why thou standest, while others fall, the reason why thou goest through the many temptations of the world, and shakest them off from thee, while others are <hi>ensnared,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled</hi> therein; it is because thou hast an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Jesus. I have prayed</hi> (saith he) <hi>that thy saith fail not,</hi> Luke 22. 3, 2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is partly by the <hi>vertue</hi> of <hi>Christs intercession</hi> that the <hi>elect</hi> are brought in; there is many that are to come to Christ, which are not yet brought in to Christ: and it is one part of his work to pray for their salvation too. <hi>Neither pray I for these alone, but for all those that shall believe</hi> (though as yet they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) <hi>on me</hi> (but that they may believe) <hi>through their word,</hi> John 17. 20. And let me tell thee soul for thy comfort, who art a coming in to Christ, <hi>panting</hi> and <hi>sighing,</hi> as if thy heart would <hi>break;</hi> I tell thee soul, thou wouldest <hi>never</hi> have come to Christ, if he had not first by the vertue of his blood and intercession, sent into thy heart an earnest desire after Christ: and let me tell thee also, that it is his business to make intercession for thee; not only that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102284:89"/>
thou mightest come in, but that thou mightest be <hi>preserved,</hi> when thou art come in, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. with <hi>Rom. 8. 33, 34, 35, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is by the <hi>intercession</hi> of Christ, that the <hi>infirmities</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> in their <hi>holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> are forgiven: Alas, if it was not for the <hi>priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office</hi> of Christ Jesus, the prayers, alms, and other duties of the Saints, might be <hi>rejected,</hi> because of the <hi>sin</hi> that is in them: but <hi>Jesus</hi> being our high Priest, he is <hi>ready</hi> to take away the <hi>iniquities</hi> of our holy things, perfuming our prayers with the glory of his own <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:</hi> and therefore it is, that there is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer given to the Saints prayers, and also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of their holy duties, <hi>Rev. 8. 3, 4. But Christ being come an high Priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building. Neither by the blood of goats and calves: but by his own blood he entred in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us. For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh; How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, purge your consciences from dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the Mediator of the New Testament (or Covenant) that by means of death, for the redemption of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102284:89"/>
transgressions that were under the first Testament, they which are called (notwithstanding all their sins) might receive the promise of eternal inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi> Heb. 9. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>The third thing now to be spoken to, it is to shew where, and how <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> out-went, and goes beyond these priests in all their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and offices, for the comfort of poor Saints.</p>
               <p>First, They that were called to the priest-hood under the Law, were but <hi>men:</hi> but he is both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> Heb. 7. 28. 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their qualifications were in them in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>scanty way:</hi> but <hi>Jesus</hi> was every way quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in an infinite and <hi>full way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were consecrated but for a time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 23. but he for ever more, <hi>ver.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They were made without an oath, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21. but he with an oath.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They as <hi>servants:</hi> but he as a <hi>Son,</hi> Heb. 3. 6.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Their garments were but such as could be made with hands, <hi>Ez.</hi> 28. but his the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry righteousness of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Their offerings were but the body and blood of beasts, and such like, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. but his offering was his own body and soul, <hi>Heb. 9. 12, 13. Chap. 10. 4, 5. Isa. 53. 10. Heb.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Those were but at best but a <hi>shadow</hi> or <hi>type, verse</hi> 1. but he the very <hi>substance</hi> and end of all those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> Heb. 9. 10. 11.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:102284:90"/>
9. Their <hi>holy place</hi> was but <hi>made by men, Heb.</hi> 9. 24. but his, or that which Jesus is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, is into <hi>Heaven it self, Heb.</hi> 5. 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When they went to offer their sacrifice, they were forced to offer for <hi>themselves</hi> as men compassed about with <hi>infirmity,</hi> Heb. 7. 26. but he <hi>holy, harmless,</hi> Heb. 10. 11. who did never commit the least transgression, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26.</p>
               <p n="11">11. They, when they went in to offer, they were fain to do it <hi>standing,</hi> Heb. 10. to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that God had no satisfaction therein: but he, <hi>when he had offered one sacrifice for sin, for ever sat down on the right hand of God,</hi> Jer. 12. To <hi>signifie,</hi> that God was very well pleased with his offering.</p>
               <p n="12">12. They were fain <hi>to offer often times the sacrifice that could never take away sin; but he by one offering hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 11, 14.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Their sacrifices at the best could but serve for the cleansing of the <hi>flesh,</hi> Heb. 9. 13. but his for cleansing both body and <hi>soul:</hi> The blood of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> doth purge the <hi>conscience</hi> from <hi>dead works</hi> to live a holy life, verse 14.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Those high Priests could not offer but <hi>once a year</hi> in the holiest of all, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. but our high Priest, he <hi>ever liveth</hi> to make intercession for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24, 25.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Those high Priests, notwithstanding they were Priests, they were not always to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102284:90"/>
were their holy garments; but Jesus never puts them off of him, but is in them <hi>always.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. Those high Priests death would be too hard for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 21, 23. but our high Priest hath <hi>vanquished</hi> and <hi>overcome</hi> that cruel enemy of ours, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. and brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light, through the glorious Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Those high Priests were not <hi>able</hi> to save themselves; but this is able to save himself, and all that come to God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Those high Priests blood could not do away sin; but the blood of Jesus Christ, who is our High Priest, <hi>cleanseth us from all sin,</hi> 1 John 1. 7.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Those high Priests sometimes by sin, caused God to reject their sacrifices; but this high Priest <hi>doth always the things that please him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Those high Priests could never convey the Spirit by vertue of their sacrifices or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; but this high Priest, our Lord Jesus, he can, and doth give all the gifts and graces that are given to the sons of men.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Those high Priests could never by their sacrifices bring the soul of any sinner to glory, by vertue of it self; but Jesus hath by one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering (as I said before) perfected for ever those that he did die for. Thus in brief I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in some particulars, how and wherein Jesus
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102284:91"/>
our high Priest doth go beyond those high Priests: and many more without question might be mentioned, but I forbear.</p>
               <p>A fifth Office of Christ in reference to the second Covenant, it was that he should be the <hi>Fore-runner</hi> again to heaven before his Saints that were to follow after. First, he strikes hands in the Covenant. Secondly, he stands bound as a surety to see every thing in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant accomplished, that was to be done on <hi>his part;</hi> then he brings the <hi>message</hi> from heaven to the world; and before he goeth back, he offereth himself for the same sins that he agreed to suffer for: and so soon as this was done, he goeth post haste to heaven again; not only to exercise the second part of his Priestly Office; but as our <hi>Fore-runner,</hi> to take possession for us, even into heaven it self, as you may see, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 20. where it is said, <hi>Whither the forerunner is for us entered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, He is <hi>run</hi> before to open heaven gates: <hi>Be ye open ye everlasting doors, that the King of Glory may enter in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He is <hi>run</hi> before to take <hi>possession</hi> of glory in our natures for us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He is <hi>run</hi> before to prepare <hi>us</hi> our <hi>places</hi> against we come after, <hi>I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> John 14. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He is <hi>run</hi> thither to make the way easie, in that he hath first trodden the path himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:102284:91"/>
Fifthly, He is <hi>run</hi> thither to receive <hi>gifts for us.</hi> All spiritual and heavenly <note place="margin">These things have I spoken to shew you, that Saints are under Grace.</note> 
                  <hi>gifts</hi> had been kept from <hi>us,</hi> had not Christ so soon as the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed was come, run back to the kingdom of glory to receive them for us. But I cannot stand to enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these glorious things, the Lord enlarge them upon your hearts by meditation.</p>
               <p>Here now I might begin to speak of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical and Kingly Office, and the priviledges that do, and shall come thereby: but that I fear I shall be too tedious, therefore at this time I shall pass them by. Thus you may see how the Covenant of Grace doth <hi>run,</hi> and with whom it was made, and also what was the conditions thereof.</p>
               <p>Now then, this Grace, this evenlasting Grace of God comes to be free to us through the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction (according to the conditions) given by another for us; for though it be free, and freely given to us, yet the obtaining of it did cost our <hi>Head,</hi> our <hi>Publick-man</hi> a very dear price (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.) <hi>For ye are bought with a price, even with the precious blood of Christ</hi> (1 Pet. 1. 9.) So it is by another, I say, not by us; yet it is as sure made over to us, even to so many of us as do, or shall believe, as if we had done it, and obtained the grace of God ourselves: nay surer; for consider, I say
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102284:92"/>
this grace is free to us, and comes upon a clear score, by vertue or the labour and purchase of another for us; mark, that which is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by another for us, is not obtained for us by our selves: Now, <hi>but Christ hath obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal redemption for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 12. <hi>not by the blood of goats and calves</hi> (which was things offered by men under the Law) <hi>but by his own blood</hi> (meaning Christs) <hi>he entred into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It comes to be <hi>unchangeable</hi> through the <hi>perfection</hi> of that <hi>satisfaction</hi> that was given to God through the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary</hi> for <hi>us;</hi> for whatever the divine, infinite, and eternal ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God did call for at the hands of man, if ever he intended to be a partaker of the grace of God, this <hi>Jesus,</hi> this one <hi>man,</hi> this publick person, did compleatly give a satisfaction to it, even so effectually; which caused God not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to say, I am pleased, <hi>but I am well pleased,</hi> Mat. 3. 17. Compleatly and sufficiently satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thee on their behalf; for so you must understand it: Mark there these following words, <hi>And having made peace</hi> (or compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made up the difference) <hi>through the blood of his Cross by him, to reconcile all things unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. And you who were sometimes alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works; yet now hath he reconciled,</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:102284:92"/>
how, <hi>in the body of his flesh, through death, to present you holy;</hi> mark, <hi>holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight,</hi> Colos. 1. 21, 22, 23. And thus it is Grace, unchangeable Grace, to us; because it was obtained, yea compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained for us, by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> God-man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But some may say, how was it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that one <hi>man</hi> Jesus by one offering, should so compleatly obtain and bring in unchangeable grace for such an <hi>innumerable</hi> company of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as are to be saved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, in that he was every ways <hi>fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> for such a work, And secondly, in that, as I said before, he did <hi>every</hi> ways compleatly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that which was offended by our disobedience to the <hi>former</hi> Covenant. And for the clearing of this.</p>
               <p>First, Consider, was it <hi>man</hi> that had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? He was <hi>man</hi> that gave the satisfaction. <hi>For as by man came death, even so also by man did come the resurrection from the dead,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Was it God that was offended, he was God that did give a satisfaction. <hi>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given.—And his name shall be called the mighty God</hi> (Isa. 9. 6.) <hi>He thought it no robbery to be equal with God but</hi> (for our sakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9.) <hi>he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of no reputation,</hi> &amp;c. Phil. 2. 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For the further clearing of this, to shew you that in every thing he was
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102284:93"/>
rightly qualified for this great work; see what God himself saith of him: he calls him in the first place <hi>man;</hi> and secondly he owns him to be his <hi>fellow,</hi> saying, <hi>Awake O sword against my Shepherd, against the man;</hi> mark, <hi>the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of Hosts,</hi> Zech. 13. 7.</p>
               <p>So that now let divine and infinite Justice turn it self which way it will, it finds one that can tell how to match it; for if it say, I will require the satisfaction of man, here is a <hi>man</hi> to satisfie its cry: and if it say, but I am an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> God, and must and will have an <hi>infinite</hi> satisfaction: here is one also that is <hi>infinite,</hi> even fellow with God; <hi>Fellow</hi> in his essence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>Fellow</hi> in his power and strength, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Fellow</hi> in his Wisdom, <hi>see again the same verse. Fellow</hi> in his mercy and grace, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10. compared with ver. 11. together with the rest of the attributes of God; so that, I say, let justice turn it self which way it will, here is a compleat person to give a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat satisfaction: thus much of the fitness of the person.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the compleatness of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction given by him for us. And that is discovered in these particulars.</p>
               <p>First, Doth justice call for the blood of that nature that sinned. Here is the heart blood of Jesus Christ. <hi>We have redemption through his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102284:93"/>
blood,</hi> Ephes. 1. 14. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. Zech. 9. 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Doth justice say, that this blood, if it be not the blood of one that is <hi>really,</hi> and <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> God, it will not give satisfaction to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite justice; then here is God, <hi>purchasing his Church with his own blood,</hi> Acts 20. 28.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Doth justice say, that it must not only have satisfaction for sinners; but they that are saved must be also <hi>washed</hi> and <hi>sanctified</hi> with this blood: Then here is he that so loved us, that he <hi>washed us from our sins in his own blood,</hi> Rev. 1. 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is there to be a <hi>righteousness</hi> to cloath them with, that are to be presented before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine justice; then here is the <hi>righteousness</hi> of Christ, which is, <hi>even the righteousness of God by faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 22. Phil. 3. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is there any sins now that will fly upon this Saviour, like so many Lions, of raging Devils, if he take in hand to redeem <hi>man,</hi> he will be content <hi>to bear them all himself alone, even in his own body upon the tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Is there any <hi>Law</hi> now that will <hi>curse,</hi> and condemn this Saviour for standing in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to give satisfaction to God for the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of <hi>man;</hi> he will be willing to be <hi>cursed,</hi> yea, to be <hi>made a curse for sinners,</hi> rather than they shall be cursed and damned themselves, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:102284:94"/>
7. Must the great and glorious God, whose eyes are so pure that he cannot behold iniquity, I say, must he not only have the blood, but the very life of him that will take in hand to be the deliverer, and Saviour of us poor miserable sinners; he is <hi>willing to lay down his life for his sheep,</hi> John 10. 11.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Must he not only dye a natural death, but must his soul descend into hell (though it should not be left there) he will suffer that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 10. and <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 3.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But is it possible that he should so <hi>soon</hi> give infinite justice a satisfaction, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat satisfaction; for the eternal God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an eternal lying under the Curse; to the end, he may be eternally satisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed that which is <hi>infinite,</hi> must have an <hi>eternity</hi> to satisfie God in; that is, they that fall into the prison and pit of utter darkness, must be there to all eternity, to the end, the justice of God may have its full blow at them. But now he that I am speaking of, is <hi>God (Isa. 9. 6. 2. Tim. 1. 16. Heb. 1. 8, 9.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102284:95"/>
they being not <hi>infinite,</hi> as aforesaid. <hi>But Christ</hi> (that is <hi>God-man) being come an high Priest</hi> (that is to offer and give satisfaction) <hi>of good things to comè: by a greater and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building: Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own;</hi> mark you that, <hi>but by his own blood he hath entered into the holy place, having</hi> (already) <hi>obtained eternal redemption for us:</hi> But how? <hi>For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of an beifer sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purging of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit</hi> (who through the power and vertue of his infinite <hi>Godhead) offered himself without spot to God, purge your consciences from dead works, to serve the living God? And for this cause</hi> (that is, for that he is <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>man,</hi> and so able to give ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice an infinite satisfaction; therefore) <hi>he is the Mediator of the New Covenant, that by the means of his death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance,</hi> Heb. 9. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. as I said before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> This is much; but is <hi>God contented</hi> with this? Is he satisfied now in the behalf of sinners by <hi>this mans</hi> thus <hi>suffering?</hi> If he is, then how doth it appear?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:102284:95"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is evident, yea, wonderful evident, that this hath pleased him to the <hi>full,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by these following Demonstrations.</p>
               <p>First, In that <hi>God</hi> did <hi>admit</hi> him into his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;</hi> yea, receive him with <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>musick,</hi> even with the sound of a <hi>Trumpet</hi> at his ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into Heaven <hi>(Psal.</hi> 47. 5.) and Christ makes it an argument to his Children, that <hi>his righteousness</hi> was sufficient, in that he went to his Father, and they <hi>saw</hi> him <hi>no more, (John 16. 10.) Of righteousness,</hi> saith he; <hi>because I go to my Father, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ye see me no more:</hi> As if he had said, My Spirit shall shew to the world, that I have brought in a sufficient righteousness to justifie sinners withal, in that when I go to appear in the presence of my <hi>Father</hi> on their behalf, he shall give me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and not throw me down from heaven, because I did not do it sufficiently.</p>
               <p>Again, If you consider the high esteem that <hi>God</hi> the father doth set on the death of his Son, you will find that he hath received good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereby. When the Lord Jesus by way of complaint told his Father, that he and his merits were not valued to the worth; his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answered, <hi>It is a light thing that I should give thee O my servant, to bring</hi> Jacob <hi>again; I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth,</hi> Isa. 49. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. As if the Lord

                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:102284:97"/>
had said, My Son, I do value thy death at a higher rate, then that thou shouldest save the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> only; behold the Gentiles, the barbarous Heathens, they also shall be brought in as the price of thy blood. It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant (only) to bring or redeem the Tribes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to restore the preserved of <hi>Israel;</hi> I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation to the ends of the earth.</p>
               <p>Again, You may see it also by the carriage of God the Father to all the great sinners to whom mercy was proffered. We do not find that <hi>God</hi> maketh any objection against them that come to him for the pardon of their sins, because he did want a satisfaction suitable to the greatness of their sins. There was <hi>Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,</hi> who was one that burnt his children in the fire to the devil, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. from 1. to 12. that used witchcraft, that used to worship the host of heaven, that turned his back on the word that <hi>God</hi> sent unto him: nay, that did worse than the very heathen that <hi>God</hi> cast out before the children of <hi>Israel.</hi> Also those that are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 19. that did spend so much time in conjuration and the like, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. (for such I judge they were) that when they came to burn their books, they counted the price thereof to be fifty thousand pieces of Silver.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102284:97"/>
                  <hi>Simon Magus</hi> also that was a Sorcerer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched the whole City, yet he had mercy prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to him once and again: I say, it was not the greatness of the sins of these sinners; no nor of an innumerable company of others that made <hi>God</hi> at all to object against the salvation of their souls, which justice would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained him to, had he not had satisfaction sufficient, by the blood of the Lord Jesus. Nay, further, I do find that because <hi>God</hi> the Father, would not have the merits of his Son to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued, I say, he doth therefore freely by his consent, let mercy be proffered to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sinners in the first place, for the Jews, that were the worst of men in that day for blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my against the <hi>Gospel:</hi> yet the Apostle proffered mercy to them in the first place. <hi>It is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the word of God should first have been spoken unto you,</hi> Acts 13. 46. Acts 3. 26. And Christ gave them commission so to do: for saith he, <hi>Let repentance and remission of sins be preached in my name among all nations, and begin;</hi> mark that, <hi>begin at Jerusalem,</hi> Luke 24. 47. Let them that but the other day had their hands up to the elbows in my heart blood have the first proffer of my mercy. And saith <hi>Paul, For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them that should here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after believe on him to life everlasting,</hi> 1 Tim.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102284:98"/>
15, 16. As the Apostle saith, those sinners that were dead, possessed with the devil, and the children of wrath, he hath quickned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and saved, <hi>Ephes. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. that he might even in the very ages to come shew forth the exceeding riches of his grace in his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards us</hi> (and that) <hi>through Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is evident that that which this man did as a common person, he did it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly and satisfactorily, as appears by the openness (as I may so call it) which was in the heart of God to him at his resurrection and ascension. <hi>Ask of me</hi> (saith he) <hi>and I will give thee the</hi> (very) <hi>heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession,</hi> Psal. 2. 8. And this was at his resurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 33. Whereas, though he had asked, yet if he had not given a full and compleat sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, justice would not have given him any thing; for <hi>justice,</hi> the <hi>justice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is so <hi>pure,</hi> that if it be not compleatly <hi>satisfied</hi> in every particular, it giveth nothing but curses, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is yet far more evident that he hath indeed pleased God in the behalf of sinners, in that God hath given him gifts to distribute to sinners, yea the worst of sinners, as a fruit of his satisfaction, and that at his ascension <hi>(Psal.</hi> 68. 18.) Christ hath so satisfied God, that he hath given him all the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102284:98"/>
treasures both of heaven and earth, to dispose of as he seeth good; he hath so pleased God that he hath given him a <hi>Name,</hi> above every <hi>Name;</hi> a <hi>Scepter,</hi> above every <hi>Scepter;</hi> a <hi>Crown,</hi> above every <hi>Crown;</hi> a <hi>Kingdom</hi> above every <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Phil. 29. Rev.</hi> 19. 16. he hath given him the highest place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n heaven even his own <hi>right hand,</hi> he hath given him all the power of heaven and earth and under the earth in his <hi>own hand,</hi> to bind whom he pleaseth, and to set free whom he thinks meet; he hath in a word, such an high esteem in the eyes of his Father, that he hath put into his hand, all things that are for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his people, both in this world, and that which is to come; and all this as the fruit of his faithfulness in doing of his work, as the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> of the New Covenant. <hi>Thou hast ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on high, thou hast led Captivity Captive, thou hast received gifts;</hi> mark, thou hast received them, <hi>for men, even for the</hi> (worst of men, the) <hi>rebellious also:</hi> And hath sent forth some, being furnished with these gifts; some I say, <hi>For the work of the ministry,</hi> to the edifying of them that are already called, and also for the calling in of all those for whom he covenanted with his Father, <hi>Till all come in the unity of faith;</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It doth still appear far more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident: For will you hear what the Father himself saith for the shewing of his well-pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102284:99"/>
in these two particulars. First, In that he bids poor souls to hear, and to do as <hi>Christ</hi> would <hi>have them, Mat. 3. 17. Luke</hi> 9. 35. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In that he resolves to make them that turn their backs upon him, that dishonour him, (which is done in a very great measure by those that lay aside his merits done by himself for Justification) I say, he that <hi>resolved</hi> to make them his <hi>footstool;</hi> where he saith, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</hi> Are they enemies to thee, saith <hi>God,</hi> I will be even with them? Do they slight thy merits? Do they slight thy groans, thy tears, thy blood thy death, thy resurrection and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, thy second coming again in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory? I will tear them, and rend them, I'll make them as <hi>mire</hi> in the <hi>streets;</hi> I will make thy enemies thy footstool <hi>(Psal. 110. 1. Mat. 22. 44. Heb. 1. 13. Chap. 10. 13.) I,</hi> saith he, <hi>And thou shalt dash them in pieces like a Potters Vessel,</hi> Psal. 2. 9. look to it you that slight the merits of the blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Again further yet; God will make all the world to know, that he hath been, and is well pleased in his Son, in that God hath given (and will make it appear he hath given) the <hi>world to come</hi> into <hi>his</hi> hand, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. And that he shall <hi>raise</hi> the dead, <hi>bring</hi> them before his judgment-seat, <hi>execute</hi> judgment upon them which he pleaseth to execute judgment
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102284:99"/>
on to their damnation; and to <hi>receive</hi> them to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life whom he doth favour, even so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as shall be found to believe in his name and merits <hi>(John</hi> 5. 26, 27, 28.) <hi>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; And he hath given him authority to execute judgment also; because he is the Son of man—For the hour is coming, that all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth: they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. I,</hi> and the worst enemy that Christ hath now, shall come at that day with a <hi>pale face,</hi> with a <hi>quaking heart,</hi> and <hi>bended knees</hi> trembling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>confessing</hi> the glory of his merits, and the vertue there was in them to save, <hi>to the glory of God the Father,</hi> Romans 14. 11. Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Much more might be added to discover the glorious perfection of this mans satisfaction: but for you that desire to be further satisfied concerning this, search the Scriptures, and beg of God to give you faith and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein: and as for you that slight these things, and continue so doing, God hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way to take with you, even to dash you in pieces like a Potters vessel; for this hath Christ received of his Father to do unto you, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:102284:100"/>
Thus I have shewed you in particular, that the Covenant of the grace of God is free and unchangeable to men, that is in that it hath been obtained for men, and that perfectly, to the satisfying of justice, and taking all things out of the way, that were any ways an hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to our salvation, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p>The second thing for the discovering of this freeness, and constancy of the Covenant of the Grace of God, it is manifest thus.</p>
               <p>First, Whatsoever any man hath of the grace of God, he hath it as a <hi>free gift</hi> of <hi>God</hi> through Christ Jesus the Mediator of this Covenant, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when they are in a state of enmity to him (mark that, <hi>Rom. 5. 8, 9. Col.</hi> 1. 21, 22.) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Christ as the <hi>foundation stone,</hi> or <hi>faith</hi> to lay hold on him, <hi>Eph. 2. 8. For by Grace you are saved through Faith, and that not of your selves</hi> (not for any thing in you, or done by you for the purchasing of it) <hi>but it is the free gift of God.</hi> And that bestowed on you, <hi>even when you were dead in trespasses and sins,</hi> Eph. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Nay if thou hast so much as one desire that is right, it is the gift of God; for of our selves, saith the Apostle, <hi>we are not able to speak a good word, or think a good thought,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>Was not grace, <hi>absolute</hi> grace, that God made promise to <hi>Adam</hi> after transgression, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:102284:100"/>
Was it not free grace in <hi>God</hi> to save such a wretch as <hi>Manasseh</hi> was, who used enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, witchcraft, burnt his children in the fire, and wrought much evil, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>Was it not free grace to save such as those were that are spoken of in the 16 of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which no eye pitied.</p>
               <p>Was it not free grace for Christ to give <hi>Peter</hi> a loving look after he had cursed and swore, and denied him.</p>
               <p>Was it not free grace that met <hi>Paul</hi> when he was a going to <hi>Damascus</hi> to persecute, which converted him, and made him a vessel of mercy.</p>
               <p>And what shall I say of such that are spoken of in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. speaking there of <hi>fornicators, idolators, adulterers, effeminates, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busers of themselves with mankind, thieves, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous revilers, drunkards, extortioners,</hi> the basest of sinners in the world, and yet were washed, and yet were justified, was it not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by grace? O Saints! you that are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, cry out, We came hither by grace; and you that are on earth, I am sure you cry, if ever we do go thither, it must be freely by grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place, it appears to be unchangeable in this. First, Because Justice being once satisfied, doth not use to call for the debt again: No, let never such a sinner come
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102284:101"/>
to Jesus Christ, and so to God by him; and <hi>Justice</hi> instead of speaking against the salvation of that sinner, it will say, I am just as well as faithful to forgive him his sins, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. When Justice it self is pleased with a <hi>man,</hi> and speaks on his side, instead of speaking against him, we may well cry out, <hi>Who shall condemn?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Because there is no Law to come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the sinner that believes in Jesus Christ; for he is not under that, and that by right comes in against none, but those that are under it: But Believers are not under <hi>that, that</hi> is not their Lord, therefore that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with them; and besides Christs blood hath not only taken away the curse thereof, but also he hath in his own person compleatly fulfilled it as a <hi>publick</hi> person in our stead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>

8. He hath not only <hi>promised</hi> that he will not leave us, nor forsake us; but he hath also <hi>sworn</hi> to fulfill his promise.

               <p>Again, thirdly, Not only thus: but first, <hi>God</hi> hath begotten. Believers again to himself, to be his <hi>adopted</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> Children, in and through the Lord Jesus, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>prepared</hi> a <hi>Kingdom</hi> for them, before the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> through Jesus Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">These things are more fully laid down in that part of the book which containeth the discourse of the priviledges of the New Covenant.</note> them an <hi>earnest</hi> of their <hi>happiness,</hi> while they live here in this world <hi>(Eph. 1. 13, 14.). After ye believed ye were sealed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102284:102"/>
with the holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased possession to the praise of his glory,</hi> and that through this Jesus.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If his Children sin through <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> or by suddain temptation; they confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it, he willingly forgives, and <hi>heals all their wounds,</hi> reneweth his love towards them, waits to do them good, casteth their sins into the depths of the sea, and all this freely, without any work done by <hi>men</hi> as <hi>men. Not for your sakes do I this, O House of Israel, be it known unto you, saith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 36. 22, 32. but wholly and alone by the blood of Jesus.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In a word, if you would see it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, Gods love was the cause why Jesus Christ was sent to bleed for sinners. Jesus Christs <hi>bleeding</hi> stops the <hi>cries</hi> of divine justice: <hi>God</hi> looks upon them as compleat in him, gives them to him, as his by right of <hi>purchase.</hi> Jesus ever lives to pray for them that are thus given unto him. God sends his holy <hi>Spirit</hi> into them, to reveal this to them; sends his <hi>Angels</hi> to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister for them: and all this by vertue of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Covenant between the Father and the Son. <hi>Thrice happy are the people that are in such a case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, further he hath made them <hi>Brethren</hi> with Jesus Christ, <hi>members</hi> of his <hi>flesh,</hi> and of his <hi>bones:</hi> the <hi>Spouse</hi> of this Lord Jesus; and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102284:102"/>
all to shew you how dearly, how really, how constantly he loveth us, who by the faith of his operation, have laid hold upon him.</p>
               <p>I shall now lay down a few arguments for the superabundant clearing of it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards answer two or three objections, as may be made against it, and so I shall fall upon the next thing.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>God loves</hi> the <hi>Saints,</hi> as he <hi>loves Jesus Christ.</hi> And God <hi>loves Jesus Christ</hi> with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal love; therefore the <hi>Saints</hi> also with the same. <hi>Thou hast loved them, as thou hast loved me,</hi> John 17. 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>love</hi> which is <hi>God himself</hi> must needs be <hi>everlasting love.</hi> And that is the love, wherewith God hath loved his <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Christ Jesus;</hi> therefore his love towards his children in Christ must needs be an <hi>everlasting</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">You must not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that love in God, is a passion as it is in us: but the love of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d is the very es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, or nature of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>love.</hi> There is none dare say, that the love of God is mixed with a <hi>created</hi> mixture: if not; then it must needs be himself, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That <hi>love</hi> which is always pitched upon us, in an object as holy as God, must needs be an <hi>everlasting love.</hi> Now the love of <hi>God</hi> was, and is pitched upon us, through an object as holy as <hi>God</hi> himself, even our <hi>Lord
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102284:103"/>
Jesus:</hi> Therefore it must needs be unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If he with whom the Covenant of Grace was made, did in every thing, and condition do, even what the Lord could <hi>desire</hi> or <hi>require</hi> of him, that his love might be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, and that for ever; Then his love must needs be an everlasting love, seeing every thing required of us, was compleatly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished for us by him: And all this hath our Lord Jesus <hi>done,</hi> and that most gloriously, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on our behalf: therefore it must needs be a love that lasts for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If <hi>God</hi> hath declared himself, to be the <hi>God</hi> that <hi>changeth</hi> not, and hath sworn to be <hi>immutable</hi> in his promise, then surely he will be <hi>unchangeable.</hi> And he hath done so: therefore it is <hi>impossible</hi> for <hi>God</hi> to lie; and so for his eternal love to be unchangeable <hi>(Heb.</hi> 6. 13, 14, 17, 18.) Here is an argument of the <hi>Spirits</hi> own making, who can contradict it? If any object, and say, but still it is upon the condition of <hi>believing.</hi> I answer, the <hi>condition</hi> also is his own <hi>free gift,</hi> and not a qualification arising from the <hi>stock of nature</hi> (Eph. 2. 8. Phil. 1. 28, 29.) So that here is the love unchangeable, here is also the condition given by him whose love is unchangeable, which may serve yet further for a strong argument, that <hi>God</hi> will have his love unchangeable. Sinner this is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>felt</hi> and enjoyed, then talked of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:102284:103"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But if this love of <hi>God</hi> be unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in it self; yet it is not unchangeably set upon the <hi>Saints,</hi> unless they behave themselves the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> As Gods love at the first was bestowed upon the Saints, without any thing <hi>foreseen</hi> by the Lord in them, as done by them <hi>(Deut.</hi> 9. 4, 5, 6.) So he goeth on with the same, saying, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forsake thee,</hi> Heb. 13. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But how cometh it to pass then that many fall off again, from the grace of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> after a profession of it for some time; some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o delusions, and some to their open sins again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> They are fallen away, not from the everlasting love of <hi>God</hi> to them; but from the profession of the love of <hi>God</hi> to them: men may process that <hi>God</hi> loves them, when there is no such matter, and that they are the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> when the <hi>Devil</hi> is their father; (as it is in <hi>John</hi> 8. 40, 41, 42, 43, 44) Therefore they that do finally <hi>fall away</hi> from a profession of the grace of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> It is first, because, they are <hi>Bastards</hi> and not <hi>Sons.</hi> Secondly, Because as they are not <hi>Sons,</hi> so <hi>God</hi> suffereth them to fall, to make it appear that they are not <hi>Sons,</hi> not of the houshold of <hi>God. They went out from us, for they were not of us; for if they had been of us, no doubt,</hi> mark that, <hi>no doubt,</hi> saith he, <hi>they would have continued with us; but they went out from us, that it might be made man
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102284:104"/>
fest that they were not all of us.</hi> (1 John 2. 19.) And though <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> do throw themselves headlong to hell, <hi>Nevertheless the Foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the Scripture saith, that there are some that had <hi>Faith,</hi> yet lost it, and have made shipwrack of it: Now <hi>God</hi> loves no longer than they believe, as is evident; <hi>For he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not shall be damned.</hi> So then, if some may have <hi>Faith,</hi> and yet lose it, and so lose the love of <hi>God,</hi> because they have lost their Faith, it is evident that <hi>Gods</hi> love is not so immutable as you say it is to every one that believeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is more sorts of Faith than one, that is spoken of in <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, There is a Faith that men may have, and yet be nothing, none of the Saints of <hi>God</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4.) and yet may do great things therewith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Faith that was wrought meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the operation of the miracles that was done in those days by Christ and his followers; <hi>And many of the people believed on him.</hi> How came they by their Faith? Why, by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the miracles that be did among them; for said they, <hi>When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than this man hath done?</hi> The great thing that wrought their Faith in them,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102284:104"/>
was only by seeing the miracles that he did <hi>(John 7. 31. John</hi> 2. 23.) which is not that saving Faith, which is called the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> Elect, as is evident: for there must not be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>miracles</hi> wrought upon <hi>outward objects,</hi> to beget that, that being too weak a thing, but it must be by the same power that was stretched out in raising Christ from the dead; yea, the <hi>exceeding greatness</hi> of that <hi>power (Eph.</hi> 1. 18, 19.) So there is a <hi>believing,</hi> being taken with some <hi>marvellous work,</hi> visible appearing to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sense of seeing; and there is a believing that is wrought in the <hi>heart,</hi> by an invisible o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Spirit, revealing the certainty of the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of the <hi>merits</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to the <hi>soul</hi> in a more <hi>glorious way,</hi> both for <hi>certainty</hi> and for <hi>durableness,</hi> both as to the <hi>promise</hi> and the constancy of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 17, 18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>Faith</hi> of a <hi>mans own,</hi> of a <hi>mans self</hi> also; but the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>operation</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (in <hi>Scripture)</hi> is set in opposition to that; for saith he, <hi>You are saved by Grace through Faith, and that not of your selves;</hi> of your own making, but that which is the <hi>free gift</hi> of <hi>God, Eph.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We say there is an <hi>Historical Faith,</hi> that is, such as is begotten meerly by the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> not by the <hi>Co-operation</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> by the <hi>Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. We say there is a <hi>Traditional Faith,</hi> that is, to believe things by <hi>Tradition,</hi> because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102284:105"/>
say they believe them; this is received by <hi>Tradition,</hi> not by <hi>Revelation;</hi> and shall never be able to stand neither at the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> nor at the day of <hi>Judgment;</hi> though possibly <hi>men,</hi> while they live here, may esteem themselves and states to be very good, because their heads are filled full of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is a Faith that is called (in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)</hi> a dead <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> or of the <hi>Devil;</hi> they also that have only this, they are like the Devil, and as sure to be damned as he, notwithstanding their <hi>Faith,</hi> if they get no better into their hearts; for it is far off from enabling of them to lay effectual hold of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and so to put him on for eternal life and sanctification <hi>(Jam</hi> 2. 19, 26.) which they must do if ever they be saved.</p>
               <p>But all these are short of the saving <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Gods elect,</hi> as is <hi>manifest;</hi> I say, First, Because these may be wrought, and not by that power so exceedingly stretched forth. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these are wrought; partly, first, by the sense of seeing, namely the <hi>miracles</hi> (not by hearing) and secondly, the rest is wrought by a <hi>traditional</hi> or <hi>historical influence</hi> of the words in their heads, not by an heavenly, invisible, almighty, and saving operation of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their hearts.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I do suppose also, that there is a <hi>Faith</hi> that is wrought upon men through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102284:105"/>
of those gifts and abilities that <hi>God</hi> gives sometimes to those that are nor his own by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, though by creation: my meaning is some men finding that <hi>God</hi> hath given them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great gifts and abilities; as to the gifts of <hi>preaching, praying, working miracles,</hi> or the like; I say, they therefore do conclude, that <hi>God</hi> is their <hi>Father,</hi> and they his <hi>Children;</hi> the ground of which confidence is still begotten, not by the glorious operation of the spirit, but by a considering of the great gifts that <hi>God</hi> hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon them, as to the things before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>As thus, First, The poor soul considering how ignorant it was, and now how knowing it is. Secondly, Considering how vain it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was, and also now how civil it is, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently makes this <hi>conclusion,</hi> surely <hi>God loves me,</hi> surely he hath made me one of his, and will save me. This is now a wrong faith, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, in that it is placed upon a wrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for mark, this faith is not placed assuredly on <hi>Gods</hi> grace alone, through the blood and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ, being discovered effectually to the soul, but upon <hi>God</hi> through those things that <hi>God</hi> hath given i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; as of <hi>gifts,</hi> either to <hi>preach</hi> or <hi>pray,</hi> or great <hi>works,</hi> or the <hi>like,</hi> which will assuredly come to nought, as sure as <hi>God</hi> is in <hi>Heaven;</hi> if no better faith and ground of faith be found out for thy soul savingly to rest upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:102284:106"/>
As to the second cause of the <hi>Objection,</hi> which runs to this effect. God loves men upon the account of their <hi>believing.</hi> I answer, that <hi>God</hi> loves men before they <hi>believe,</hi> he loves them, he calls them, and gives them faith to believe. <hi>But God who is rich in grace, with his great love, wherewith he loved us</hi> (when? when we belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or before) <hi>even when we were dead in our sins</hi> (and so far off from believers) <hi>hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us together with Christ, by grace you are saved,</hi> Eph. 2. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Now also I suppose that thou wilt say in thy heart, I would you would shew us then, what is saving faith, which thing it may be I may touch upon a while hence, in the next thing that I am to speak unto. O they that have that are safe indeed!</p>

               <p>THe second Thing that I am to speak unto is this: Who they are that are actually brought into this free and unchangable grace; and also how they are brought in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed now we are come to the pinch of the <hi>whole discourse;</hi> and if <hi>God</hi> do but help me to run rightly thorow this, as I do veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe he will, I may do thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> good and bring glory to my <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Question containeth these two branches.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102284:106"/>
First, who are brought in. Secondly, how they are brought in: the first is quickly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. <hi>Christ Jesus came into the world <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Rom. 5. 7, 8, 9, 10. 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. Mat. 21. 31. <hi>Publicans and Harlots,</hi> that is, Whores and Cheaters, Exactors, shall enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>For I came not</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance,</hi> Mark 2. 17.</p>
               <p>A sinner in the Scripture is described in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to be a transgressor of the Law, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth the Law; for sin is the transgression of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But particularly, they are described in a more particular way, as first, such as in whom dwelleth the devil, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 2, 3.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102284:107"/>
inheritance of God, with Christ, with Saints, with Angels, if they do come in, and accept of Grace, as I might prove at large: For Gods grace is so great, that if they do come to him by <hi>Christ,</hi> presently all is forgiven them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never object, that thy sins are too great to be pardoned: but <hi>come taste and see how good the Lord is to any whosoever comes unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second thing is, How are these brought into this everlasting Covenant of Grace?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Answ.</hi> When God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <note place="margin">Come to the touchstons sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> and in truth bring in a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> into this most blessed Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (for so it is) he usually goeth this way.</p>
               <p>First, He slays or kills the party to all things besides himself, and his Son Jesus Christ, and the comforts of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>For the clearing of this, I shall shew you, first, with what God kills: secondly, how God kills; and thirdly, to what God kills those whom he makes alive in Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>For the first, When God brings <hi>sinners</hi> into the Covenant of Grace, he doth first kill them with the Covenant of Works, which is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, or Ten Commandments. This is <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, and also <hi>Pauls</hi> experience. It is his Doctrine where he saith, <hi>The ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of death engraven in stones, the ministration of condemnation</hi> (which is the Law, in that place called the <hi>Letter) kills,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6, 7, 8, 9.

               <p>Secondly, It is his experience, where he saith, <hi>I was alive once</hi> (that is, to my own things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10.) <hi>without the Law</hi> (that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did strike him dead by it) <hi>but when the commandment came</hi> (that is, to do and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise its right Office on me, which was to kill me, then) <hi>sin revived, and I died,</hi> (and I was killed) <hi>and the commandment</hi> (or the Law) <hi>which was ordained to be unto life, I found to be unto death: For sin taketh occasion by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, deceived me, and thereby slew me,</hi> Rom. 7. 9, 10, 11. And indeed to speak my own experience, together with the experience of all the Saints, they can seal with me to this, more or less.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how doth God <hi>kill</hi> with this <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Covenant?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, by opening to the soul the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality of it; <hi>The Law is spiritual</hi> (saith he) <hi>but I am carnal, sold under sin,</hi> Rom. 7. 14. Now the <hi>spirituality</hi> of the Law is discovered this way.</p>
               <p>First, by shewing to the soul, that every sinful thought is a sin against it. I sinner, when
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102284:108"/>
the Law doth, come home indeed upon thy soul in the spirituality of it, it will discover such things to thee to be sins, that now thou lookest over, and regardes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>; that is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable saying of <hi>Paul,</hi> when he saith, <hi>Sin revived, and I died;</hi> sin revived, saith he, as if he had said, those things that before I did not value nor regard, but looked upon them to be trifles, to be dead and forgotten; but when the Law was fastened on my soul, it did so <hi>raise</hi> them from the dead, call them to mind, so muster them before my face, and put such strength into them, that I was over-mastered by them, by the guilt of them. <hi>Sin revived,</hi> by the commandment, or my sins had migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty strength, life, and abundance of force upon me, because of that; insomuch, that it killed me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 28.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It sheweth that every such sin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth eternal damnation (Friends, I doubt there be but few of you that have seen the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> but) this is one thing in which it discovereth its <hi>Spirituality,</hi> and this is the proper work of the Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God with a <hi>discovery</hi> of this doth also discover his own Divine and Infinite <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> (of which the <hi>Law</hi> is a <hi>description)</hi> which backs what is discovered by the Law; and that by discovering of its <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> to be so <hi>divine,</hi> so <hi>pure,</hi> so <hi>upright,</hi> and so far off
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102284:108"/>
from winking at the least sin, that he doth by that Law, without any <hi>favour, condemn</hi> the <hi>sinner</hi> for that <hi>sin,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. Now when he hath brought the soul into this Premunire, into this puzzle: Then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. He sheweth to the soul the nature and condition of the Law, as to its dealing with, or for bearing of the sinner, that hath sinned against it: which is to pass an eternal curse upon both soul and body, of the party so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, saying to him, <hi>Cursed be the man, that continueth not in every thing that is written in the book of the Law to do it:</hi> for saith the <hi>Law,</hi> this is my proper work. First, to shew thee thy sins, and when I have done that, then in the next place to condemn thee for them, and that without all remedy, as from me, or any thing within my bounds; for I am not to save any, to pardon any, nay, not to favour any in the least thing that have sinned against me: for God did not send me to make alive, but to discover sin, and to condemn for the same. Now so soon as this is presented to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in the next place, the Law also by this Law doth shew that now there is no righteous act, according to the tenor of that Covenant, that can replieve him, or take him off from all this horrour and curse that lies upon him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that is not an administration of pardon (as I said before) to forgive the sin; but an
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102284:109"/>
administration of damnation, because of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression. O the very discovery of this, striketh the <hi>soul</hi> into a deadly <hi>swoun,</hi> even above half dead. But when <hi>God</hi> doth do the work indeed; he doth in the next place shew the soul that he is the man that is eternally under this <hi>Covenant</hi> by nature, and that it is thee that hath <hi>sinned</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this <hi>Law,</hi> and doth by right deserve the curse and displeasure of the same; and that all that ever he can do will not give satisfaction to that glorious justice that did give this Law; holy actions, tears of blood, selling all, and giving i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I'll warrant him, he that seeth this, it will kill him to that which he was alive unto before, though he had a thousand lives. Ah sinners, sinners, were you but sensible indeed of the severity and truth of this, it would make you look about you to purpose. O how would it make you strive to stop at that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that now you drink down with delight? How many Oaths would it make you bite asunder? nay, it would make you bite your <hi>tongues,</hi> to think that they should be used as instruments of the Devil, to bring your souls into such an unspeakable misery; then also, we should not have you hang the salvation of your souls upon such <hi>slender pin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

as now you do: no, no, but you would be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mind then. O then we should have you cry out, I must have Christ, what shall I do for Christ? how shall I come at Christ? would I was sure, truly sure of Christ, my soul is gone, damned, cast away, and must for ever burn with the <hi>Devils;</hi> if I do not get pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, when God hath done this, then he the further shews the soul, that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which it is under by nature, is distinct from the Covenant of Grace; and also they that are under it, are by nature without any of the <hi>graces,</hi> which they have that are under the Covenant of Grace: As First, That it hath no faith, <hi>John</hi> 16. 9. Secondly, no hope, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. Thirdly, Nor none of the spirit to work these things first by nature. Fourthly, Neither will that Covenant give to them any peace with God. Fifthly, No promise of safeguard from his revenging <hi>Law,</hi> by that <hi>Covenant.</hi> Sixthly, But lieth by Nature liable to all the <hi>curses</hi> and <hi>condemnings,</hi> and <hi>thunder-claps</hi> of this most <hi>fiery Covenant.</hi> Seventhly, That it will accept of no sorrow, no repentance, no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as from <hi>thee.</hi> Eighthly, That it calls for no less than the shedding of <hi>thy blood.</hi> Ninthly, The <hi>damnation</hi> of <hi>thy soul</hi> and <hi>body.</hi> Tenthly, And if there be any thing prossered to it by <hi>thee,</hi> as to the making of it amends, it
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102284:110"/>
throws it back again as <hi>dirt</hi> in <hi>thy face,</hi> slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that <hi>thou</hi> canst bring.</p>
               <p>Now when the <hi>soul</hi> is brought into this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> then it is indeed dead; <hi>killed</hi> to that, to which it was once alive.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the next place to shew you to what it is, <hi>killed;</hi> and that is first to sin: O it dares not <hi>sin!</hi> it sees hell fire is prepared for them that <hi>sin:</hi> Gods Justice will not spare it if it live in <hi>sin:</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> will damn it, if it live in <hi>sin;</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> will have it, if it follow its <hi>sin:</hi> O I say, it trembles at the very thoughts of <hi>sin;</hi> I, if <hi>sin</hi> do but offer to tempt the <hi>soul,</hi> to draw away the <hi>soul</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> it cries, it sighs, it shunneth the very appearance of <hi>sin,</hi> it is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto it. If God would but serve you thus that love your pleasures, you would not make such a <hi>trifle</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> as you do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is <hi>killed</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> of God, as it is the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works:</hi> O saith the soul, the <hi>Law</hi> hath killed me to its self, <hi>I through the Law am dead to the Law</hi> (Gal. 2. 19.) The <hi>Law</hi> is another thing then I did think it was; I thought it would not have been so <hi>soul-destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> so <hi>damning</hi> a <hi>Law;</hi> I thought it would not have been so <hi>severe</hi> against me for <hi>my little sins,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or <hi>my</hi> playing, for <hi>my</hi> jeasting, for <hi>my</hi> dissembling, quarrelling, and the like: I had some <hi>thoughts</hi> indeed, that it would tew <hi>great sinners,</hi> but let me pass; and though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102284:110"/>
great sinners, yet it would pass me by: but now would I were free from this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, would I were free from this Law. I will tell thee, that a soul thus worked upon, is more afraid of the Covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> then he is of the <hi>Devil;</hi> for he sees it is the Law that doth give him up into <hi>his hands</hi> for <hi>sin:</hi> and if he was but clear from that, he should not greatly need to fear the <hi>Devil.</hi> O now every <hi>particular command</hi> tears the caul of his heart; now every <hi>command</hi> is as a great gun well <hi>charged</hi> against his <hi>soul;</hi> now he sees he had as good run into a <hi>fire</hi> to keep himself from <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as to run to the <hi>Law</hi> to keep himself from <hi>damning;</hi> and this he sees really, I, and feels it too, to his own sorrow and perplexity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The soul also now is <hi>killed</hi> to his own <hi>righteousness,</hi> and counts that but dung, but dross, not worth the dirt hanging on shoes. O then says he, Thou <hi>filthy righteousness</hi> (Isa. 64. 6.) how hast thou deceived me? How hast thou <hi>beguiled</hi> my <hi>poor soul?</hi> How did I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my self with giving of a <hi>little alms?</hi> with abstaining from some <hi>gross polutions?</hi> with <hi>walking</hi> in some <hi>ordinances,</hi> as to the outside of them? How hath my <hi>good words, good think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, good meanings</hi> (as the <hi>world</hi> calls them) deceived my <hi>ignorant soul?</hi> I want the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>righteousness</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> for I see now there is no less will do me any good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:102284:111"/>
Fourthly, It is also <hi>killed</hi> to <hi>its own</hi> faith, <hi>its</hi> notion of the Gospel, <hi>its own</hi> hope, <hi>its own</hi> repentings, <hi>its own</hi> promises and resolutions to <hi>its own</hi> strength, <hi>its own</hi> vertue, or whatsoever it had before: now saith the soul, That faith I thought I had, it is but fancy; that hope I thought I had, I see it is but hypocritical, but vain and groundless hope: now the soul sees it hath by nature no saving faith, no saving hope, no grace at all by nature, by the first Covenant. Now it crieth out, How many <hi>promises</hi> have I broken? and how many times have I resolved in vain? when I was <hi>sick</hi> at such a time, and in such a streight, at such a place. Indeed I thought my self a wise man once, but I see my self a very fool now: O how ignorant am I of the <hi>Gospel now?</hi> and of the blessed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>God</hi> on a <hi>Christians heart?</hi> In a word, it sees it self beset by nature with all evil, and destitute of all good, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to kill the stoutest, hardest hearted sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that ever lived on the earth. O Friends! should you be plainly dealt withal, by this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the dealing of God with a sinner, when he makes him a Saint, and would seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously try your selves thereby (as God will try you one day) how few would there be found of you, to be so much as acquainted with the work of God in the <hi>Notion?</hi> much less in the experimental knowledge of the same. And
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102284:111"/>
indeed God is fain to take this way with sinners, thus to kill them, with the Old Covenant, to all things below a crucified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hrist.</p>
               <p>First, Because otherwise there <note place="margin">Six reasons of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> would be none in the world that would look after this sweet Jesus Christ. There is but a few that go to <hi>Heaven</hi> in all (comparatively) and them few, God is fain to deal with them in this manner, or else his <hi>Heaven,</hi> his <hi>Christ,</hi> his <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happiness</hi> must abide by themselves for all sinners. Do you think that <hi>Manasseh</hi> would have <hi>regarded</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> had he not suffered his <hi>enemies</hi> to have prevailed against him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. from the 1. verse to the 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. Do you think that <hi>Ephraim</hi> would have looked after <hi>salvation,</hi> had not God first confounded him with the guilt of the sins of his youth? What do you think of <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9. 4, 5, 6. What do you think of the Jailour, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30, 31, 32. What do you think of the Three Thousand, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36, 37. Was not this the way that the <hi>Lord</hi> was fain to take to make them close in with <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> Was he not fain to kill them to every thing below a <hi>Christ,</hi> that they were driven to their wits ends? inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they were forced to cry out, <hi>Whbat shall we do to be saved?</hi> I say, God might keep <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> to himself, it he should not go this way to work with <hi>sinners.</hi> O stout hearted rebels! O tender hearted God!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:102284:112"/>
Secondly, Because then, and not till then, will sinners accept of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> on <hi>Gods terms.</hi> So long as <hi>sinners</hi> can make a life out of any thing below <hi>Christ,</hi> so long they will not close with Christ without indenting: but when the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> hath killed them to every thing below himself, and his Son; then <hi>Christ</hi> will down on any terms in the world. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is the very <hi>reason,</hi> why <hi>sinners</hi> when they hear of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet will not close in with him, there is something that they can take content in besides him. The prodigal so long as he could content himself with the husks that the swine did eat, so long he did keep away from his <hi>Fathers House,</hi> but when he could get no <hi>nourishment</hi> any where on this side of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers House,</hi> then (saith he) and not till then, <hi>I will arise and go to my Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I say, Ths is the <hi>reason</hi> therefore why men come no faster, and close no realier with the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but stand <hi>halting</hi> and <hi>indenting</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>terms</hi> they must have <hi>Christ</hi> upon; for saith the <hi>drunkard,</hi> I look on <hi>Christ</hi> to be worth the <hi>having;</hi> but yet I am not willing to lose ALL for him, all but my pot saith the <hi>drunkard,</hi> and all but the world saith the covetous. I will part with any thing but <hi>lust</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> saith the <hi>wanton;</hi> but if Christ will not be had without, I forsake all, cast away all; then it must be with me as it was with the <hi>young man</hi> in the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102284:112"/>
                  <hi>Gospel,</hi> such news will make me sorry at my very heart.</p>
               <p>But now when a man is soundly killed to all his sins, to all his <hi>righteousness,</hi> to all his <hi>comforts</hi> whatsoever, and sees that there is no way but the <hi>Devil</hi> must have him, but he must be <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> in <hi>hell,</hi> if he be not clothed with <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> Oh! then (saith he) give me <hi>Christ</hi> on any <hi>terms</hi> whatsoever he cost: though he cost me <hi>friends,</hi> though he cost me <hi>comforts,</hi> though he cost me all that ever I have; yet like the wise <hi>Merchant</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> they will sell all to get that pearl. I tell you when a <hi>soul</hi> is brought to see its want of Christ aright, it will not be kept back, <hi>Father, Mother, Husband, Wise, Lands, Livings,</hi> nay, <hi>life</hi> and all shall go, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the soul will miss of Christ. I, and the <hi>soul</hi> counteth <hi>Christ</hi> a cheap <hi>Saviour,</hi> if it can get him vpon any terms, now the <hi>soul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents no longer. Now <hi>Lord</hi> give me <hi>Christ,</hi> upon any terms whatsoever he cost; for I am a <hi>dead-man,</hi> a <hi>damned man,</hi> a <hi>cast away,</hi> if I have not Christ. What say you, O you <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sinners?</hi> Is not this true as I have said? would you not give Ten thousand worlds if you had so many, so be you might be well answered, that your sins shall be pardoned, and your <hi>souls</hi> and <hi>bodies justified</hi> and <hi>glorified,</hi> at the coming of the <hi>Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:102284:113"/>
Thirdly, The Lord goeth this way for this reason also, that it might make the soul sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible what it cost Christ to redeem it from death and hell. When a man cometh to feel the sting and guilt of sin, death and hell, upon his <hi>conscience,</hi> then, and not till then, can he tell what it cost <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>redeem sinners.</hi> O! saith the <hi>soul</hi> if a few <hi>sins</hi> are so <hi>terrible,</hi> and lay the soul under such <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>torment,</hi> what did <hi>Christ</hi> undergo? who bare the sins of Thousands, and Thousands, and all at once.</p>
               <p>This also is one means to make <hi>souls</hi> tender of sin (it is the <hi>burned child</hi> that feareth the <hi>fire)</hi> to make them humble in a <hi>sense</hi> of their own <hi>vileness,</hi> to make them count every thing that God giveth them a mercy, to make much of the least glimpse of the love of God, and to prize it above the whole world. O sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were you killed indeed, then <hi>Heaven</hi> would be <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> would be <hi>Hell</hi> indeed; but because you are not wrought upon in this manner, therefore you count the ways of God, as bad as a good man counteth the ways of the devil, and the ways of the devil and hell as good as a Saint doth count the ways of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Again, God is fain to go this way, and all to make sinners make sure of <hi>Heaven.</hi> So long as souls are senseless of sin, and what a <hi>damnable state</hi> they are in by <hi>nature,</hi> so long
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:102284:113"/>
they will even dally with the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and the <hi>Salvation</hi> of their own <hi>poor souls:</hi> but when God cometh and sheweth them where they are, and what is like to become of them if they miss of the <hi>Crucified Saviour;</hi> Oh then, saith the soul, would I were sure of <hi>Jesus;</hi> what shall I do to get assurance of <hi>Jesus?</hi> And thus is God forced, as I may say, to whip <hi>souls</hi> to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> they being so secure, so sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and so much their own enemies as not to look out after their own eternal advantage.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, A fifth reason why God doth deal thus with <hi>sinners,</hi> it is because he would bring <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> together in a <hi>right way. Christ</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi> would never come together in a beloved posture, they would not so suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably suit each other, if they were not brought together this way, the sinner being <hi>killed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O when the sinner is <hi>killed,</hi> and indeed struck dead to every thing below a <hi>naked Jesus,</hi> how suitably then doth the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> suit one with another. Then here is a <hi>naked sinner</hi> for a <hi>righteous Jesus,</hi> a <hi>poor</hi> sinner to a <hi>rich Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> a <hi>weak</hi> sinner to a <hi>strong</hi> Jesus, a <hi>blind</hi> sinner to a <hi>seeing Jesus,</hi> an <hi>ignorant, careless</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>careful</hi> Jesus. O how wise is God in dealing thus with the <hi>sinner,</hi> he strips him of his own knowledge, that he may fill him with <hi>Christs;</hi> he <hi>killeth</hi> him for taking pleasure in <hi>sin,</hi> that he may take <hi>pleasure</hi> in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:102284:114"/>
Sixthly, But sixthly, God goeth this way with <hi>sinners</hi> because he would have the <hi>glory</hi> of their salvation. Should not men and women be <hi>killed</hi> to their own things, they would do <hi>sacrifice</hi> unto them, and instead of saying to the Lamb, <hi>THOU ART WORTHY,</hi> Rev. 5. 9. Job. 40. 14. Rom. 3. 27. Ephes. 2. 8, 9. Tit. 3. 5. they woul say their own <hi>arm;</hi> their own <hi>right hand</hi> hath saved them: but God will cut off <hi>boasting</hi> from ever entring within the <hi>borders</hi> of <hi>eternal glory:</hi> for he is resolved to have the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>beginning,</hi> the <hi>middle,</hi> and the <hi>end,</hi> of the <hi>contriving</hi> and <hi>saving,</hi> and giving <hi>salvation</hi> to them that enter into the joys of everlasting glory. <hi>That they may be called the trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorifyed,</hi> Isa. 61. 3. I might have run thorow many things as to this: but I shall pass them, and proceed.</p>
               <p>Now Secondly, The soul being thus <hi>killed</hi> to it's self, <note place="margin">That soul that hath the right work of God upon its heart, is not only killed to its self: but also made alive to Christ.</note> its sins, its righteousness, faith, hope, wisdom, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, resolutions, and the rest of its things which it trusted in by nature. In the next place, it hath also given unto it a most glorious, perfect, and never-fading life, which is first a life imputed to it: yet so really that the very thought of it in the soul hath so much operation and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102284:114"/>
especially when the <hi>meditation</hi> of it is mixed with faith, as to make it (though <hi>condemned</hi> by the <hi>Law,</hi> to triumph, and to look its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the face with comfort; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatness of the <hi>multitude,</hi> the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their <hi>anger,</hi> and the continuation of their <hi>malice,</hi> be never so hot against it.</p>
               <p>This imputed life (for so it is) is the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Son of God, as his righteousness, in his suffering, arising, ascending, interceding, and so consequently triumphing over all the enemies of the soul, and given to me, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrought on purpose for me. So that, is is there righteousness in Christ? that is mine: Is there perfection in that righteousness? that is mine: did he bleed for sin? it was for mine. Hath he overcome the Law, the Devil, and Hell? the victory is mine, and I am counted the Conqueror; <hi>Nay, more than a conqueror through him that hath loved me:</hi> and I do count this a most glorious life; for by this means it is that I am in the first place proclaimed both in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> guiltless, and such a one, who, as I am in Christ, am not a sinner, and so not under the Law, to be condemned, but as holy and righteous as the Son of God himself, because he himself is my holiness and righteousness, and so likewise having by this all things taken out of the way that would condemn me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:102284:115"/>
Sometimes I bless the <hi>Lord,</hi> my <hi>soul</hi> hath had the life that now I am <hi>speaking</hi> of, not only <hi>imputed</hi> to me, but the very <hi>glory</hi> of it upon my <hi>soul:</hi> For upon a time when I was under many <hi>condemnings</hi> of <hi>heart,</hi> and feared because of my sins, my soul would miss of <hi>eternal glory;</hi> methought I felt in my <hi>soul</hi> such a secret moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this, <hi>Thy righteousness is in Heaven,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>splendour</hi> and <hi>shining</hi> of the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> in my <hi>soul,</hi> which gave me to see clearly, that my <hi>righteousness</hi> by which I should be <hi>justified</hi> (from all that could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn) was the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God himself</hi> in his own person now at the right hand of his <hi>Father,</hi> representing me <hi>compleat</hi> before the <hi>mercy-seat</hi> in his own self: so that I saw clearly, that night and day, where ever I was, or what ever I was a doing, still there was my <hi>righteousness just</hi> before the <hi>eys</hi> of <hi>divine glory;</hi> so that the <hi>Father</hi> could never find fault with me for any <hi>insufficiency</hi> that was in my <hi>righteousness,</hi> being it was <hi>compleat;</hi> neither could he say, where is it? because it was continually at his <hi>right hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also at another time having <hi>contracted guilt</hi> upon my <hi>soul,</hi> and having some <hi>distemper</hi> of <hi>body</hi> upon me, supposed that death might now so seize upon, as to take me away from among men: then thought I what shall I do now? is all <hi>right</hi> with my <hi>soul?</hi> have I the <hi>right work</hi> of <hi>God</hi> on my <hi>soul?</hi> Answering my self, No sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:102284:115"/>
and that because there were so many <hi>weaknesses</hi> in me; yea so many <hi>weaknesses</hi> in my best duties: for thought I, how can such a one as I find mercy, whose heart is so ready to evil, and so backward to that which is good (so far as it is <hi>natural)</hi> Thus musing, being filled with fear to die, these words came in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my soul, <hi>Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ;</hi> as if God had said, Sinner, thou thinkest because thou hast had so many <hi>infirmities</hi> and <hi>weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in thy <hi>soul</hi> whilst thou hast been professing of me, therefore now there can be no hopes of mercy, but be it known unto thee, that it was not any thing done by thee at the first, that moved me to have <hi>mercy</hi> upon thee; neither is it any thing that is done by thee now that shall make me either accept or reject thee; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my <hi>Son</hi> who <hi>standeth</hi> by me, he is <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> he hath <hi>fulfilled</hi> my <hi>Law,</hi> and given me <hi>good satisfaction;</hi> on him therefore do I look, and on thee only as thou art in him, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he hath done, so will I deal with thee: This having stayed my heart, and taken off the guilt through the strength of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my soul, anon after came in that word as a second testimony: <hi>He hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to the works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his own purpose and grace which was
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102284:116"/>
given us in Christ Jesus before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus is the sinner made alive from the dead, being justified by Grace through the <hi>righteousness</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> which is unto all and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all them that believe according to the Scriptures. <hi>And the life that I now live, it is by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>I lay down my life for my sheep,</hi> John 10. 10, 15. <hi>I I am come that you might have life, and that you might have it more abundantly. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more then being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, we shall be saved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5. 10, 21. <hi>That as sin reigneth unto death, even so might Grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This life is not only imputed to him that is wrought on by the spirit of Grace, that is not only counted his; but also there is put into the soul an understanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened on purpose to know the things of God, which is <hi>Christ</hi> and his imputed <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 20.) which it never thought of nor understood before (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11.) which <hi>understanding</hi> being enlightened, and made to see such things that the soul cannot be contented without it lay hold of, and apply <hi>Christ</hi> unto it self, so effectually; I say that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:102284:116"/>
the soul shall be exceedingly revived in a very <hi>heavenly measure,</hi> with the <hi>application</hi> of this imputed <hi>righteousness;</hi> for thereby it knoweth it shall find God <hi>speaking peace</hi> to its <hi>self,</hi> and with a <hi>fatherly affection</hi> say, <hi>Be of good chear, thy sins are forgiven thee,</hi> the righteousness of my Son I bestow upon thee: <hi>For what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the</hi> (thy) <hi>flesh, I have sent forth my only Son, and have condemned thy sins in his flesh,</hi> Rom. 8. 3. 4. And though thou hast gone astray liste a lost sheep, yet on him I have laid thine iniquities; and though thou thereby didst undo and break thy self forever, yet by his stripes I haue healed thee. Thus I say the Lord causeth the soul by faith to apply that which he doth by grace impute unto it (for thus every soul more or less is dealt withal) the soul being thus inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thus quickned, thus made alive from that dead state it was in before (or at least having the beginnings of this life) it hath these several vertuous advantages, which they have not that are dead in their sins and trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and under the Law.</p>
               <p>First, It seeth what a sad <hi>condition</hi> all <hi>men</hi> by <hi>nature</hi> are in, they being in that state which it self was in but a while since: but now by grace it is a beginning to scrable out of it; now it seeth the whole world lieth in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19.) and so liable to <hi>eternal

                  </hi> because of their <hi>wickedness.</hi> Ah friends, let me tell you, though you may be ignorant of your <hi>state</hi> and <hi>condition,</hi> yet the poor <hi>groaning, hungering</hi> Saints of God do see what a sad, woeful, miserable state you are in, which sometimes makes them tremble to think of your most lamentable latter end (you dying so) and also to <note n="*" place="margin">Like as the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> who fled for fear, when the ground o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened its mouth to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, <hi>Ps.</hi> 103. 1, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>flie</hi> the faster to their Lord Jesus, for very fear that they also should be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that most dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful doom: and this it hath by vertue of its own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, knowing it self was but a while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go in the same <hi>condition,</hi> under the same <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi> O! there is now a hearty blessing of God that ever he should shew to it its sad <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and that he should incline its heart to seek after a better condition. O blessed be the Lord! saith the soul, that ever he should awaken <hi>me,</hi> stir up <hi>me;</hi> and bring <hi>me</hi> out of that sad <hi>condition,</hi> that I once with them was in. It makes also the soul to wonder to see how foolishly and vainly the rest of its <hi>neighbours</hi> do spend their precious time, that they should be so void of <hi>understanding,</hi> so forgetful of their latter end, so senseless of the <hi>damning nature</hi> of their sins: O that their eyes was but inlightned to see whereabouts they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> surely they would be
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102284:117"/>
of another mind then they are now in. Now the soul wonders to see what slender pins those poor <hi>creatures</hi> do hang the stress of the <hi>eternal salvation</hi> of their souls upon. O methinks! saith the soul, it makes me <hi>mourn</hi> to see that some should think that they were Born <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> and others that their <hi>Baptisme</hi> makes them so, others depending barely upon a <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, historical faith,</hi> which will leave their souls in the midst of plerplexity. O that they should trust to such <hi>fables, fancies,</hi> and wicked slights of the <hi>Devil,</hi> as their good doings, their good thinkings, their civil walking, and living with the world. O miserable profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the end thereof will be a miserable end.</p>
               <p>But now, vvhen the soul is thus vvrought upon, it must be sure to look for the very gates of hell to be set open against it, vvith all their force and might to destroy it. Novv hell rageth, the devil roareth, and all the world resolved do be the best they can, to bring the soul again into bondage and ruine. Also the soul shall not want enemies, even in its own hearts lust, as covetousness, adultery, blasphemy, unbelief, hardness of heart, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, half-heartedness, ignorance, with an innumerable company of attendants, hanging like so many blocks at its heels, ready to sink it into the fire of hell every moment, together
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102284:118"/>
with strange apprehensions of God and Christ, as if now they were absolutely turned to be its <hi>enemies,</hi> which maketh it doubt of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of its <hi>salvation:</hi> For you must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that though a soul may in reality have the <hi>righteousness</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> imputed to it, and also some <hi>faith</hi> in a very strong man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to lay hold upon it: yet at another time, through <hi>temptation</hi> they may fear and doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; insomuch that the <hi>soul</hi> may be put into a very great fear, lest it should return again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the condition it once was in, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32 40. O saith the soul when I think of my former state, how <hi>miserable</hi> it was, it makes me tremble; and when I think that I may fall into that <hi>condition</hi> again, how sad are the thoughts of it to me? I would not be in that <hi>condition</hi> again for all the world: and this fear riseth still higher and higher, as the soul is sensible of <hi>Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> or of its <hi>working</hi> of its own <hi>corruptions.</hi> Ha! these filthy lusts, these filthy corruptions. O that I was rid of them, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed in a moment, that I could be quite rid of them, they do so disturb my soul, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour my God, so defile my conscience, and sometimes so weaken my hands in the way of God, and my comforts in the Lord; O how glad should I be, if I might be stripped of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. Which fear puts the soul upon flying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Lord by prayer, for the covering

of his imputed <hi>righteousness,</hi> and for <hi>strength</hi> against the <hi>Devils temptations</hi> and its own <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions;</hi> that God would give down his <hi>holy spirit</hi> to strengthen it against the things that do so anoy its soul, and so discourage it in its way, with a resolution through grace, never to be contented, while it doth find in it self a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over it by faith in the blood of a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Jesus.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The soul that hath been thus <hi>killed</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi> to its things it formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in; now, O now it cannot be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that slender groundless faith and hope that once it contented it self withal. No, no, but now it must be brought into the right sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge of Jesus Christ, now it must have him discovered to the soul by the spirit, now it cannot be satisfied, because such and such do tell it is so. No, but now it will cry out, <hi>Lord shew me continually in the light of thy Spirit through thy word, that Jesus that was born in the days of</hi> Cesar Augustus <hi>(when</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>a Daughter of</hi> Judah <hi>went with</hi> Joseph <hi>to be taxed at</hi> Bethel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Lord let me see it in the light of thy spirit, and in the operation thereof, and let me not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented without such a faith that is so wrought: even by the discovery of his birth, crucifying, death, blood, resurrection, ascension, intercession, and second</hi> (which is his personal) <hi>coming again, that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102284:119"/>
the very faith of it may fill my soul with comfort and holiness:</hi> and O how afraid the soul is, lest it should fall short of this faith, and of the hope that is begotten by such discoveries as these are? For the soul knoweth, that if it hath not this, it will not be able to stand neither in death nor judgment: and therefore saith the soul, <hi>Lord, whatever other poor souls content themselves withal, let me have that which will stand me instead, and carry me through a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous world, that may help me to resist a cunning Devil, that may help me to suck true soul satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying consolation from Jesus Christ through thy promises by the might and power of thy Spirit.</hi> And now when the poor soul at any time hath any discovery of the love of God through a bleeding, dying, risen, interceding Jesus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not willing to be deceived; O how <note n="*" place="margin">But this may be its temptation taking place through the timerousness of the soul.</note> wary is it of closing with it, for fear it should not be right, for fear it should not come from God? Saith the soul, <hi>Cannot the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil give one such comfort tro? Cannot he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himself thus into an Angel of light?</hi> So that the soul (because it would be upon a sure ground) cries out, <hi>Lord shew me thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that not once or twice: but Lord let me have thy presence continually upon my heart, to day and to morrow, and every day;</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:102284:119"/>
for the soul when it is rightly brought from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant of Works, and planted into the Covenant of Grace, then it cannot be (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be under some desperate <hi>temptation)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented without the presence of God, teaching, comforting, stablishing, and helping of the soul to grow in the things of the Lord Jesus Christ: because it knoweth, that if God hath but with-drawn his presence in any way from it (as he doth do sometimes for a while) that then the Devil will be sure to be near at hand, working with his temptations, trying all ways to get the soul into slavery and sin again; also the corrupt principle that will be joyning and combining with the wicked one, and will be willing to be a Co-partner with him, to bring the soul into mischief, which puts a soul upon an earnest, continual panting after more of the strengthening, preserving, comforting, and teaching presence of God, and for strong sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of faith, that it may effectually lay hold on him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The soul is quickned so, that it is not satisfied now without it do indeed and in truth partake of the peace of Gods Elect; now it is upon the examination of the reality of its joy and peace: Time was indeed that any thing would serve its turn, any false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts of its state to be good: but now all kind of peace will not serve its turn, all kind of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102284:120"/>
joy will not be accepted with it; now it must joy in God through <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> now its peace must come through the vertue of the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> speaking <hi>peace</hi> to the <hi>conscience,</hi> by taking away both the guilt and the filth of sin by that blood, also by shewing the soul its free <hi>acceptance</hi> with <hi>God</hi> through <hi>Christ,</hi> he having compleatly fulfilled all the <hi>conditions</hi> of the first <hi>Covenant,</hi> and freely placed it into the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of what he hath done, and so presents the <hi>soul</hi> compleat and spotless in the sight of <hi>God</hi> through his obedience. Now I say, he hath <hi>peace through the blood of his Cross,</hi> and sees himself <hi>reconciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> Col. 1. 20, 21. or else his comfort will be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned by him. It is not every promise as cometh now upon his heart that will serve his turn: no, but he must see whether the <hi>Babe Jesus</hi> be presented to the soul, in and through that promise; now if the <hi>Babe</hi> leap in his <hi>womb,</hi> as I may say, so say, it is because the Lords promise sounds aloud in his heart, coming to him big with the love and pardoning grace of God in <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> I say, this is the first and principle joy that the soul hath, that is quickened and brought into the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Now the man finds Heavenly sanctification wrought in his soul, through the most precious blood of the man whose name is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:102284:120"/>
Jesus Christ. <hi>Jesus that he might sanctifie the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate</hi> Now the soul finds a change in the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> in the <hi>will,</hi> in the <hi>mind,</hi> in the <hi>affections,</hi> in the <hi>judgment,</hi> and also in the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi> through th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>inward man</hi> a <hi>change,</hi> and through the <hi>outward man</hi> a <hi>change,</hi> from head to foot, as we use to say. <hi>For he that is in Christ,</hi> and so in this <hi>Covenant of Grace, is a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. or hath been twice made, made, and made again. O now the soul is resolved for Heaven and Glory, now it crieth out, Lord if there be a right eye that is offensive to thee, pluck it out; or a right foot, cut it off; or a right hand, take it from me; now the <hi>soul</hi> doth begin to studdy how it may <hi>honour God,</hi> and bring <hi>praise</hi> to him. Now the <hi>soul</hi> is for a <hi>preparation,</hi> for the <hi>second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> endeavouring to lay aside every thing that may hinder: And for the closing in with those things that may make it in a <hi>belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed posture</hi> against that day.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And all this is from a <hi>Gospel Spirit,</hi> and not from a Legal natural principle, for the soul hath these things as the <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of its being separated unto the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and so now <hi>possessed</hi> with that spirit that doth attend, yea, and dwell in them that are brought into the <hi>Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102284:121"/>
things do spring forth in the <hi>soul,</hi> from another root and stock, then any of the <hi>actings</hi> as other <hi>men</hi> do; for the <hi>soul</hi> that is thus wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is as well dead to the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> thereof (as the <hi>first Covenant)</hi> as well as to its <hi>sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Now the <hi>soul</hi> begins to have some <hi>blessed experience</hi> of the things of <hi>God,</hi> even of the <hi>glorious mysteries</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Now it knoweth the meaning of those words. <hi>My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,</hi> John 6. 55. and that by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; for the <hi>soul</hi> hath received <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>conscience</hi> through that <hi>blood,</hi> by the effectual <hi>application</hi> of it to the soul.

hath, that is under this Covenant of Grace, over they have that are under the Covenant of the Law and Works.</p>
               <p>As first, the Covenant of Grace is not <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> upon our <hi>obedience,</hi> but upon <hi>Gods love,</hi> even his <hi>pardoning love</hi> to us through <hi>Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi> The first <hi>Covenant</hi> it stood to be broken or kept by us, and <hi>Gods love</hi> or <hi>anger,</hi> to be lost, or enjoyed hereafter, as we, as creatures behaved our selves: but now the very <hi>ground</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> is <hi>Gods</hi> love, 'tis meer love through <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> Deut. 7. 8, 9. <hi>The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor chuse you; because you were more in number then other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for you were the fewest of all people: but because the Lord loves you, and because he will keep the oath which he swore to your fathers.</hi> Again, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>In his love and in his pitty he redeemed them, and the Angel of his presence saved them,</hi> that is Jesus Christ. And again, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Who hath saved us.—Not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the works of righteousness which we have done; but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the world began.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This love is not conveyed to us through what we have done (as is afore proved) but through what he hath done, with whom the Covenant was made, <hi>which was given us in Christ. According as he hach chosen us in Christ,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102284:126"/>
Who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. God for Christs sake hath loved you</hi> (2 Tim 1. 9. Eph 1. 3, 4. Eph. 4. 32.) That is through Christs doings, through Christs sufferings. Now if this be but rightly understood, it doth discover abundance of comfort to them that are within the bounds of the Covenant of Grace. For</p>
               <p>First, Here a believer seeth he shall stand, if Christs doings and sufferings stand (which is a sure Foundation) for God dealeth with him through Christ. And so Secondly, He shall not fall, unless the sufferings and merits of Christ be thrown over the bar, being found guilty (which will never be) before the eyes of divine justice. For with him the Covenant was made, and he was the surety of it, <hi>Zech. 9. 11. Heb.</hi> 7. 22. That is, as the Covenant was made with him, so he stood bound to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the same. For you must understand that the Covenant was made between the Father and the Son, long before it was accomplished, or manifestly sealed with Christs blood, it was made before the world began, <hi>(Tit. 1. 2. Ephes. 1. 4. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19, 20.) But the conditions thereof was not fulfilled, until less than Two Thousand Years ago; and all that while did Jesus stand bound as a surety (as I said before) is used to do, till the time in which the payment should be made. And it was by vertue of his
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102284:127"/>
suretiship (having bound himself by Covenant to do all things agreed on, by the Father and him) that all those of the election that were born before he came, that they might be saved, and did enter into rest. For the forgiveness of sins that was past, though it was through the blood of Christ; yet it was also through the for bearance of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. That is, Christ becoming surety for those that died before his coming, that he would indeed and in truth, at the fulness of time (or at the time appointed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4.) give a compleat and full satisfaction for them according to the tenour, or condition of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Again Secondly, The second Covenant, which Believers are under, as the ground and foundation if it is safe; so the promises thereof are better, surer, freer and fuller, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, They are better, if you compare the excellency of the one with the excellency of the other. The first hath promised nothing but an earthly paradise, <hi>Do this and thou shalt live.</hi> Namely, here in an earthly paradise. But the other doth bring the promise of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly paradise.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the Covenant of Works doth promise an earthly Paradise; yet it is a Paradise or Blessing, though once obtained, yet might be lost again (for no longer than thou doest well, no longer art thou accepted by that)

O but the Promises in the New Covenant, do bring unto us the benefit of eternal inheritance, <hi>(Heb. 9. 15.) That they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</hi> O rare! it is an eternal inheritance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The other, as it is not so good as this, so neither is it so sure as this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he calls the one, such a one as might be, and was shaken <hi>(Heb.</hi> 12. 27.) but this is said to be such a one that cannot be shaken. <hi>And this word,</hi> saith he, treating of the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants from verse the 18. to the 24 <hi>And this word, yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are</hi> (or may be) <hi>shaken, as of things that are made, that those things that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be shaken</hi> (which is the second Covenant) <hi>may remain;</hi> for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith he, verse the 28. <hi>which cannot be moved.</hi> Therefore ye blessed Saints, seeing you have received a Kingdom which cannot, <hi>which cannot be moved:</hi> (therefore) <hi>Let us have grace whereby we may serve</hi> (our) <hi>God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.</hi> Thus in general, but more particular.</p>
               <p>First, They are surer, in that they are founded upon Gods love also, and they come to us without calling for those things at our hands, that may be a means of putting of a stop to our certain enjoying of them. The promises under or of the Law, they might easily be stopped by our disobedience: but the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102284:128"/>
promises under the Gospel saith, <hi>If heaven above can be measured, and the foundation of the earth searched out, then</hi> (and not till then) <hi>will I cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done.</hi> Again, <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for my own Names sake, and will not remember thy sins,</hi> Isa. 43. 25. I will make thee a Partaker of my Promise; and that I may so do, I will take away that which would hinder; <hi>I will cast all your sins into the depths of the sea,</hi> that my promise may be sure to all the seed. And therefore saith the Apostle, when he would shew us that the New Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises was more sure then the Old; he tells us plainly that the Law and Works are set aside, and they are meerly made ours through the righteousness of faith, which is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ. <hi>For the promise that</hi> Abraham <hi>should be heir of the world</hi> (saith he) <hi>was not to him, or to his seed through the Law,</hi> (or Works) <hi>but through the righteousness of faith. For if they which are of the Law</hi> (or of Works) <hi>be heirs, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith is made void, and the promise made of none effect. Therefore it is of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith—to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed,</hi> Rom. 4. 13, 14, 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly surer, because that as that is taken away that should hinder, so they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a faithful friend of ours in keeping: <hi>For all the promises of God are in Christ; not yea
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102284:128"/>
yea and nay, but yea and amen;</hi> certain and sure; sure because they are in the hand of our head, our friend, our brother, our husband, our flesh and bones, even in the heart and hand of our precious Jesus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Because all the conditions of them are already fulfilled for us by Jesus Christ, as aforesaid, every promise that is a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant promise, if there be any condition in it, our undertaker hath accomplished that for us, and also giveth us such grace as to receive the sweetness as doth spring from them through his obedience to every thing required in them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, surer, because that as they are grounded upon the love of God; every thing taken out of the way, in the hand of a sure friend: And as Christ hath fulfilled every condition as to justification that is contained therein; so the Lord hath solemnly sworn with an oath for our better confidence in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <hi>For when God made promise to</hi> Abraham (and so to all Saints) <hi>because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, saying; Surely, blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee: and so after he had patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, he obtained the promise. For men veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swear by the greater, and an oath for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is to them an end of all strife</hi> (that there might be no more doubt or scruple concerning the certain fulfilling of the promise) <hi>wherein
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102284:129"/>
God willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel,</hi> or certain, constant, unchangeable decree of God in making of the promise, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his children) <hi>confirmed it by an Oath that by two immutable things,</hi> his promise (back'd with an Oath) <hi>wherein it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us,</hi> Heb. 6. 13, 14. 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That they are better it appears al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, in that they are freer and fuller; that they are freer, it is evident, in that the one saith, no works no life: Do this, and then thou shalt live, if not, thou shalt be damned. But the other saith, we are saved by believing in what another hath done, without the works of the Law; <hi>Now to him that worketh not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness,</hi> Rom. 4, 4, 5. The one saith pay me that thou owest; the other saith, I do frankly and freely forgive thee all. The one saith, because thou hast sinned thou shalt die; the other saith, <hi>because Christ lives thou shalt live also,</hi> John 15</p>
               <p>Secondly, And as they are freer, so they are fuller; fuller of encouragement, fuller of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; the one (to wit the Law) looks like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> seven ill favoured k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e, more ready to eat one up, then to afford us any food. The
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102284:129"/>
other is like the full grape in the cluster, which for certain hath a glorious blessing in it. The one saith, if thou hast sinned, turn again; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saith, if thou hast sinned, thou shalt be damned, for all I have a promise in me.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They that are of the second, are better then they that are of the first; and it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so appeareth in this. The promises of the Law, through them we have neither faith, nor hope, nor the Spirit conveyed: But through the promises of the Gospel there is all these, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 4. Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these we might be partakers of the Divine nature.</hi> O therefore <hi>let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering; for he is faithful that promised,</hi> Heb. 10. 23. <hi>In hope of eternal life</hi> (who so) <hi>because God that cannot lie, promised it before the world began,</hi> Tit. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They that are in this Covenant are in a very happy state; for though there be several conditions in the Gospel to be done, yet Christ Jesus doth not look that they should be done by man, as man, but by his own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in them, as it is written, <hi>Thou hast wrought all our works in us and for us.</hi> Is there that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they must believe; why then, he will be both the <hi>Author and finisher of their faith,</hi> Heb. 12. 2, 3. Is there also hope to be in his Children, he also doth, and hath given them
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:102284:130"/>
                  <hi>good hope through his grace,</hi> 2 Thes. 2. 26. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, are the people of God to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the glory of God the Father? The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he will work in them <hi>both to will and to do of his own good pleasure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Again, as he works all our works in us and for us, so also by vertue of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, we have another nature given unto us. Whereby, or by which we are made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be glorifying of God both in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and in our spirits, which are his, <hi>Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 20. Psal. 110. 3.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, In the next place, all those that are under this second Covenant, are in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful safe condition: For in case they should slip or fall, after their conversion into some sin or sins, (for who lives and sins not, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 16.) yet through the merits and intercession of Christ Jesus, who is their undertaker in this Covenant, they shall have their sins pardoned, their wounds healed, and they raised up again; which priviledge the children of the first Covenant have not, for if they sin, they are never afterwards regarded by that Covenant. <hi>They break my Covenant, and I regarded them not,</hi> Heb. 8. 9. But when he comes to speak of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, speaking first of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick person under the name of <hi>David,</hi> he
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102284:130"/>
saith thus, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. from the 26. verse to the 37. <hi>He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Also I will make him my first-born: higher then the kings of the earth. My mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will I keep for him for evermore, and my Covenant shall stand fast with him. His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. If his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren forsake my Law, and walk not in my judgment: If they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments; then will I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless my loving kindness will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie unto</hi> David, <hi>His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the Sun before me; it shall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished for ever as the Moon, and as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful witness in heaven. My Covenant shall stand fast with him,</hi> mark that, As if God had said, I did not make this Covenant with man, but with my Son, and with him I will perform it; and seeing he hath given me compleat satisfaction, though his Children do through infirmity transgress, yet my Covenant is not therefore broken, seeing he with whom it was made, standeth firm, according to the desire of my heart;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102284:131"/>
so that my justice that is satisfied, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Law hath nothing to say; for there is no want of perfection in the sacrifice of Christ.</p>
               <p>If you love your souls and would have them live in the peace of God, to the which you are called in one body, even all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; then I beseech you seriously to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and labour to settle in your souls this one thing, that the New Covenant is not broken by our transgressions, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not made with us. The reason why the very Saints of God have so many ups and downs in this their travel towards heaven; it is because they are so weak in the faith of this one thing; for they think that if they fail of this or that particular performance, if their hearts be dead and cold, and their lusts mighty and strong; therefore now God is angry, and now be will shut them out of his favour, now the New Covenant is broken, and now Christ Jesus will stand their friend no longer; now also the devil hath power again, and now they must have their part in the resurrection of damnation; when alas the Covenant is not for all this never the more broken, and so the Grace of God no more straightned then it was before. Therefore I say, when thou findest that thou art weak here, and sailing there, backward to this
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102284:131"/>
good, and thy heart forward to that evil; then be sure thou keep a steadfast eye on the Mediator of this New Covenant; and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that it is not only made with him, and his part also fulfilled, but that he doth look upon his fulfilling of it, so as not to lay thy sins to thy charge, though he may as a father chastise thee for the same. <hi>If his children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake my Law, and walk not in my judgments. If they break my statutes, and keep not my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; then will I visit their transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions with a rod, and their iniquities with stripes. Nevertheless,</hi> mark, <hi>nevertheless my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my faithfulness to fail My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my mouth.</hi> And what was that? why, that <hi>his seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the days of Heaven,</hi> Psal. 89. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Another priviledge that the Saints have by vertue of the New Covenant, is, that they have part of the poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssion, or hold of heaven and glory already: and that two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways. First, the divine nature is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from heaven into them. And Secondly, the humane nature <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the nature of man is received up, and entertained in, and hath got possession of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have the first-fruits of the spirit (saith
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102284:132"/>
the man of God) we have the earnest of the spirit which is instead of the whole. <hi>Which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory,</hi> Rom. 8. 8, 9, 10, 11. Eph. 1. 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The nature of man, OUR nature is got into glory as the <hi>first fruits of man-kind,</hi> as a <hi>fore-runner</hi> to take <hi>possession</hi> till we <hi>all come thither,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20. For the man born at <hi>Bethlem</hi> is ascended (which is part of the lump of mankind) into glory, as a publick person, as the <hi>first-fruits,</hi> representing the whole of the Children of God. So that in some sense it may be said, that the Saints have already taken possession of the Kingdom of Heaven, by their Jesus, their publick person; he being in their room entred to prepare a place for <hi>them,</hi> John 14. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>I beseech you consider, When Jesus Christ came down from glory, it was that he might bring us to glory; and that he might be sure not to fail, he clothed himself with our nature, as if one should take a piece out of the whole lump instead of the whole, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the other comes) and investeth in that glory which he was in before he came down from Heaven: and thus is that saying to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, speaking of Christ and Saints, which saith, <hi>And</hi> (he) <hi>hath raised us up together, and made us fit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus,</hi> Eph. 2. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:102284:132"/>
Eighthly, Again, not only thus, but all the power of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. together with the rest of his glorious attributes, are on our side, in that they dwell in our nature, which is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Mark how they are joyned together, <hi>In whom dwelleth the fulness of the God-head. And ye are compleat in him.</hi> God dwelleth compleatly in him, and you also are compleatly implanted in him, which is the head of all principality and power, and all this by the consent of the Father. <hi>For it hath pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell.</hi> Now mark, the God-head doth not dwell in Christ Jesus for himself only, but that it may be in a way of righteousness conveyed to us, for our comfort and help in all our wants. <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth,</hi> saith he, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. And then followeth, <hi>And lo I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world,</hi> Psal. 68. 18. 20. <hi>He hath received gifts for men, even for the rebellious,</hi> John 1. 16. <hi>Of his fulness have we all received, and grace for grace,</hi> Col. 1. 9. And this the Saints cannot be deprived of, because the Covenant made with Christ, in every tittle of it was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102284:133"/>
fulfilled as to righteousness, both active and passive, that justice cannot object any thing, holiness now can find fault with nothing; nay, all the power of God cannot shake any thing that hath been done for us by the <hi>Mediator of the New Covenant;</hi> so that now there is no Covenant of Works to a Believer, none of the commands, accusations, condemnations, or the least tittle of the Old Covenant to be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on any of those that are the Children of the Second Covenant, no sin to be charged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no Law to be pleaded, but all is made up by our middle man Christ Jesus. O blessed Covenant! O blessed Priviledge! Be wise therefore O ye poor drooping souls that are the sons of this second Covenant. And <hi>stand fast in the liberty wherewith CHRIST hath made you free, and be not again intangled</hi> (not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in your consciences) <hi>with the yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bondage;</hi> neither the commands, accusations, or condemnations of the Law of the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1, 2.</p>

What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ is a Saviour, thou wilt be a sinner;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:102284:133"/>
because his grace abounds, therefore thou wilt abound in in. O wicked wretch! rake hell all over, and surely I think thy fellow will scarce be found: And let me tell thee this before I leave thee, as Gods Covenant with Christ for his Children (which are of faith) stands sure, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, unrevokable, and unchangeable; so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hath God taken such a course with thee, that unless thou can'st make God forswear himself, it is impossible that thou shouldest go to heaven, dying in that condition. <hi>They tempted me, proved me,</hi> and turned the grace of God into lacivious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (Compare <hi>Heb. 3. 9. 10, 11. ver.</hi> with the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.

Therefore we must and will tell of the truth of the nature of the Covenant of the grace of God to his poor Saints, for their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and for their comfort, who would be glad to leap at Christ upon any terms: yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we can tell how through grace, to tell the

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Rebell, rebell, there are some in Christ, and some out of him; they that are in him have their sins forgiven, and they themselves made new creatures, and have the spirit of the Son, which is a holy, loving, self-denying spirit. And they that are thus in Jesus Christ are so far off from delighting in sin, that sin is the greatest thing that troubleth them; and O how willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would they be rid of the very thoughts of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 113. It is the grief of their souls (when they are in a right frame of spirit) that they can live no more to the honour and glory of God, then they do; and in all their prayers to God, the breathings of their souls is as much for sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace as pardoning grace, that they might live a holy life; they would as willingly live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here, as they would be happy in the world to come, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. they would as willingly be cleansed from the filth of sin, as to

               <p>Thus have I <hi>(Reader)</hi> given thee a brief dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, touching the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace, also of the nature of the one, together with the nature of the other. I have also in this Discourse, endeavoured to shew you the condition of them that are under the Law, how sad it is, both from the nature of the Covenant they are under, and also by the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of God unto them by that Covenant. And,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:102284:135"/>
now because I would bring all into as little a compass as I can, I shall begin with the Use and Application of the whole in as brief a way as I can, desiring the Lord to bless it to thee.</p>
               <p>And first of all, let us here begin to examine a little touching the Covenant you stand before God in, whether it be the Covenant of Works, or the Covenant of Grace; and for the right do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, I shall lay down this proposition. Namely, that all men naturally come into the world under the first of these, which is called the Old Covenant, or the Covenant of Works, which is the Law. <hi>And were all by nature the children of wrath, even as others;</hi> which they could not be, had they not been under the Law; for there are none that are under the other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that are still the Children of the wrath but the Children of faith, the Children of the promise, the accepted Children, the Children not of the Bond-man, but of the free, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. the 4. last verses.</p>
               <p>Now here lieth the question. Which of these two Covenants art thou under, soul?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I hope I am under the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what ground hast thou to think that thou art under that blessed Covenant? and not rather under the Covenant of Works, that strict, that soul-damning Covenant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> What ground, Why, I hope I am.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:102284:135"/>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what ground hast thou for this thy hope? For a hope without a ground is like a Castle built in the air, that will never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do thee any good, but will prove like unto that spoken of in the eighth of <hi>Job, Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be</hi> (like) <hi>a spiders web. He shall lean upon his House but it shall not stand, he shall hold it fast</hi> (as thou wouldest thy hope 'tis like) <hi>but it shall not endure,</hi> Job. 8. 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> My hope is grounded upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, what else should it be grounded upon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed to build my hope upon Christ Jesus, upon God in Christ, through the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and to have this hope rightly, by the shedding abroad of the love of God in the heart, it is a right grounded hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what promises in the Scripture do you find your hope built upon? And how do you know whether you do build your hope upon the promises in the Gospel, the promises of the New Covenant: and not rather on the promises of the Old Covenant, for there are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in that as well as in the other?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I hope that if I do well I shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; because God hath said I shall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> O soul, if thy hope be grounded there, thy hope is not grounded upon the Gospel promises, or the New Covenant, but verily upon the old; for these words was spoken to <hi>Cain,</hi> a Son of the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102284:136"/>
Old Covenant; and they themselves are the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and scope of that, for that runs thus. <hi>Do this and thou shalt live. The man that doth these things shall live by them. If thou do well, thou shalt be accepted,</hi> Levit. 18. 5. Ezek. 20. 11. Rom. 10. 5. Gal. 3. 12. Gen. 4. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> Why, truly if a mans doing well, and living well, and his striving to serve God as well as he can, will not help him to Christ, I do not know what will; I am sure sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God will not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest,</hi> Did you never read that Scripture, which saith, <hi>Israel which followed after the Law of righteousness, hath not attained to the Law of righteousness?</hi> Rom. 9. 30, 31, 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But doth not the Scripture say, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they that keep his Commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life,</hi> Rev. 22. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is first therefore to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, whether to keep his <hi>Commandments,</hi> be to strive to keep the Law, as it is a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of <hi>Works;</hi> or whether it be meant of the great <hi>Commandments</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which are cited, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 22, 23. <hi>And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his Commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</hi> But what do you mean <hi>John?</hi> do you mean the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> or the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the <hi>Gospel?</hi> Why, <hi>This is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi> (saith he) <hi>that we should believe on the

name of his Son Jesus Christ, and to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (as the fruits of this faith) as he gave us Commandment. If it be the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> as a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> then the <hi>Gospel</hi> is but a lost thing. If it were of <hi>Works,</hi> then no more of <hi>Grace;</hi> therefore it is not the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> as the <hi>Old Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what do you mean by these words, the <hi>Gld Covenant,</hi> as the <hi>Old Covenant?</hi> explain your meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> My meaning is, that the Law is not to be looked upon for life, so as it was handed out from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> if ever thou wouldest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be saved, though after thou hast faith in Christ, thou mayest and must solace thy self in it, and take pleasure therein, to express thy love to him, who hath already saved thee by his own blood, without thy obedience to the Law, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Sinai,</hi> or elsewhere.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Ah poor soul, this is the wrong way too, for this is to make Christ but a piece of a Saviour, thou wilt do something, and <hi>Christ</hi> shall do the rest, thou wilt set thy own things in the first place, and if thou wantest at last, then thou wilt borrow of Christ, thou art such a one
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102284:137"/>
that doest <hi>Christ</hi> the greatest injury of all. First, in that thou doest undervalue his merits, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of thy own works before his. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by mingling of his works, thy dirty ragged righteousness with his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Why, would you have us do nothing? would you have us make Christ such a drudge as to do all, while we sit idling still?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Poor soul thou mistakest Jesus Christ, in saying thou makest him a drudge, in letting him do all: I tell thee he counts it a great glory to do all for thee, and it is a great dishonour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, for thee so much as to think otherwise. And this the Saints of God that have experienced the work of Grace upon their souls do count it also the same, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Saying, thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing, And</hi> why so? read again the 9. ver. <hi>For thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy</hi> (own) <hi>blood.</hi> See also Ephes. 1. 6, 7. <hi>To the praise of the glory of his grace: In whom we have redemption through his blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> All this we confess that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us: but he that thinks to be saved by <hi>Christ,</hi> and liveth in his sins, shall never be saved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant that. But this I say again, a man must not make his good doings the lowest
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102284:137"/>
round of the ladder, by which he goeth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that is, he that will, and shall go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, must wholly and alone, without any of his own things, venture his precious soul upon <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi> and his <hi>merits.</hi>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What, and come to Christ as a sinner?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But is not this the way to make <hi>Christ</hi> to loath us? You know when <hi>Children</hi> fall down in the dirt, they do usually before they go home, make their cloaths as clean as they can, sor fear their Parents should chide them, and so I think should we?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This comparison is wrongly applied, if you bring it to shew us how we must do when we come to Christ. He that can make himself clean, hath no need of Christ; for the whole, the clean, and righteous, have no need of <hi>Christ,</hi> but those that are foul and sick Physicians you know if they love to be honoured, they will not bid the Patients first make themselves whole, and then come to them: no, but bid them come with their sores all running on them, as the woman with her bloody issue, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. And as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> with her Belly full of Devils, and the Leppers all scabbed, and that is the right coming to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Well, I hope that <hi>Christ</hi> will save me, for his promises and mercy is very large, and as
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102284:138"/>
long as he hath promised to give us life, I fear my state the less.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is very true, <hi>Christs</hi> promises are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, blessed be the Lord for ever, and also so is his mercy; but notwithstanding all that, there is many go in at the broad gate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say your business is seriously to enquire whether you are under the first or second <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> for unless you are under the second, you will never be regarded of the Lord, for as much as you are a sinner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 89. And the rather, because if God should be so good to you as to give you a share in the second, you shall have all your sins pardoned; and for certain have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, though you have been a great sinner.</p>
               <p>But do not expect that thou shalt have any part or share in the large promises and mercy of God, for the benefit and comfort of thy poor soul, whilst thou art under the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> because, so long thou art out of <hi>Christ,</hi> through whom God conveyeth his mercy, grace, and love to sinners. <hi>For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him, Amen.</hi> Indeed his mercy, grace and love, is very great, but it's treasured up in him, given forth in him, through him. <hi>But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us—that he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace:</hi> But which way? <hi>In his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus.</hi> But out of <hi>Christ</hi> thou shalt find God, a just
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102284:138"/>
God, a sin revenging God, a God that will by no means spare the guilty; and be sure, that every one that is found out of Jesus Christ, will be found guilty in the Judgment day, upon whom the wrath of God shall smoke to their eternal ruine.</p>
               <p>Now therefore consider of it, and take the counsel of the Apostle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. Which is to <hi>examine thy self whether thou art in the faith,</hi> and to prove thy own self, whether thou hast received the Spirit of Christ in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> thy soul, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou hast been converted, whether thou hast been born again, and made a new creature, whether thou hast had thy sins washed away in the blood of Christ, whether thou hast been brought from under the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> into the <hi>New;</hi> and do not make a slight examination, for thou hast a precious soul, either to be saved or damned.</p>
               <p>And that thou mayest not be deceived, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that it is one thing to be convinced, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to be converted; one thing to be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and another to be killed; and so to be made alive by the faith of Jesus Christ. When men are killed they are killed to all things they lived to before, both sin and righteousness, as all their old faith, and supposed grace, that they thought they had. Indeed the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> will shew thee that thou art a sinner, and that a great one too; but the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> the Law,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102284:139"/>
will not shew thee without the help of the spirit that thou art without all grace by nature: no, but in the midst of thy troubles thou wilt keep thy self from coming to <hi>Christ,</hi> by perswading thy soul, that thou art come already, and hast some grace already. O therefore be earnest in begging the spirit, that thy soul may be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the wickedness of thy heart discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thou mayest see the miserable state that thou art in, by reason of sin and unbelief, which is the great condemning sin: and so in a sight and sense of thy sad condition (if God should deal with thee in severity according to thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servings) do thou cry to God for faith in a <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Christ,</hi> that thou mayest have all thy sins washed away in his blood, and such a right work of grace wrought in thy soul, that may stand in the Judgment-day.</p>
               <p>Again secondly, In the next place, you know I told you that a man might go a great way in a profession, and have many excellent gifts, so as to do many wondrous works, and yet be but under the Law; from hence you may learn, not to judge your selves to be the children of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. because you may have some gifts of knowledge or understanding more than others: no, for thou mayest be the knowingest man in all the Countrey, as to head-knowledge, and yet be but under the Law, and so consequently under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urse, notwithstanding that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:102284:139"/>
Now seeing it is so, that men may have all this and yet perish; then what will become of those that do no good at all, and have no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, neither of their own sadness, nor of Christs mercy. O sad! Read with understanding, <hi>Isa. 27. 11. Therefore he that made them will have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will shew them no favour.</hi> See also 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Now there is one thing, which for want of, most people do miscarry in a very sad man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and that is because they are not able to distinguish between the nature of the Law, and the Gospel. O people, people, your being blinded here, as to the knowledge of this, is one great cause of the ruining of many: As <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>While Moses is read,</hi> or while the Law is discovered, <hi>the vail is over their hearts,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 15. that is, the vail of ignorance is still upon their hearts, so that they cannot discern either the nature of the Law, or the nature of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, they being so dark and blind in their minds, as you may see, if you compare it with Chap. 4. 3, 4. And truly I am confident, that were you but well examined, I doubt many of you would be found so ignorant, that you would not be able to give a word of right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer concerning either the Law, or the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Nay my Friends, set the case one should ask you what time you spend, what pains you take, to the end you may understand
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102284:140"/>
the nature and difference of these two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; would you not say (if you should speak the truth) that you did not so much as regard whether there was two or more? would you not say, I did not think of <hi>Covenants</hi> or study the nature of them? I thought that if I had lived honestly, and did as well as I could, that God would accept of me, and have mercy upon me, as he had on others. Ah friends, this is the cause of the ruine of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, for if they are blinded to this, both the right use of the Law, and also of the Gospel, is hid from their eyes; and so for certain they will be in danger of perishing most miserably, (poor souls that they are) unless God of his meer mercy and love, doth rend the vail from off their hearts; the vail of ignorance, for that is it which doth keep these poor souls in this besetted and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded condition, in which if they dye, they may be lamented for, but not helped; they may be pittied, but not preserved from the stroak of Gods everlasting vengeance.</p>
               <p>In the next place, if you would indeed be delivered from the first into the second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. I do admonish you to the observing of these following particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:102284:140"/>
First, Have a care that you do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your selves, though you do good works (that is, which in themselves are good) in, and with a Legal Spirit, which are done these ways as followeth.</p>
               <p>First, If you do any thing commanded in Scripture, and in your doing of it, do think that God is well pleased therewith, because you, as you are religious men do do the same: upon this mistake was <hi>Paul</hi> himself in danger of being destroyed; for he thought because he was zealous, and one of the strictest sect for Religion, therefore God would have been good unto him, and have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his doings, as it is clear, for he counted them his gain, <hi>Philipians</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Now this is done thus. When a man doth think, that because he thinks he is more sincere, more liberal, with more difficulty, or to the weakning of his estate; I say, if a man because of this, doth think that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth his labour, it is done from an <hi>Old Covenant Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Some men they think that they shall be heard, because they have prayer in their families, because they can pray long, and speak expressions, or express themselves excellently in prayer, that because they have great enlargements in prayer: I say, that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102284:141"/>
therefore to think that God doth delight in their doings, and accept their works, this is from a Legal Spirit.</p>
               <p>Again, Some men think, that because their Parents have been religious before them, and have been indeed the people of God, they think if they also do as to the outward observing of that which they learned from their fore-runners, that therefore God doth accept them: but this also is from a wrong spirit; and yet how many are there in <hi>England</hi> at this day, that think the better of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, meerly upon that account, I, and think the people of God ought to think so too; not understanding that it is ordinary, for an <hi>Eli</hi> to have an <hi>Hophni</hi> and a <hi>Phin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>has,</hi> both sons of <hi>Belial:</hi> Also a good <hi>Samuel</hi> to have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse off-spring; likewise <hi>David</hi> an <hi>Absalom.</hi> I say, their being ignorant of, or else negligent in regarding this, they do think that because they do spring from such and such, as the Jews in their <hi>generations</hi> did, that therefore they have a priviledge with God more than others, when there is no such thing, <hi>John</hi> 8 33, 34, 35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9. but for certain, if the same faith be not in them, which was in their fore-runners, to lay hold of the <hi>Christ</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in the same spirit as they did, they must utterly perish, for all their high conceits that they have of themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:102284:141"/>
Secondly, When People come into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, without having their eye upon their Divine Majesty, through the flesh and blood of the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Son of God; then also do they come before God, and do whatsoever they do from a Legal Spirit, an old Covenant Spirit. As for instance, you have some people, 'tis true, they will go to Prayer (in appearance very fervently) and will plead very hard with God, that he would grant them their desires, pleading their want, and the abundance thereof; they will also plead with God his great mercy, and also his free promises: but yet they neglecting the aforesaid Body, or Person of Christ, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lamb of God, to appear before him in: I say, in thus doing, they do not appear before the Lord, no otherwayes then in an old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Spirit; for they go to God only as a merciful Creator, and they themselves as his Creatures: not as he is their Father in the Son, and they his children by Regeneration through the Lord Jesus. I, and though they may call God their Father in the Notion (not knowing what they say, only having learned such things by tradition) as the Pharisees did; yet Christ will have his time to say to them, even to their faces, as he did once to the Jews, Your father (for all this your profession) is
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:102284:142"/>
the Devil, to their own grief and everlasting misery, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44.</p>
               <p>The third thing that is to be observed, if we would not be under the Law, or do things in a Legal Spirit is this: to have a care that we do none of the works of the holy Law of God, for life, or acceptance with him; no, nor of the Gospel neither. To do the works of the Law, to the end we may be accepted of God, or that we may please him, and to have our desires of him, is to do things from a Legal or old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Spirit, and that is expresly laid down, where it is said, <hi>To him that worketh, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward not reckoned of grace, but of debt;</hi> that is, he appears before God through the Law, and his obedience to it, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 4. 4, 5.) And again, though they be in themselves Gospel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as baptism, breaking of bread, hearing, praying, meditating, or the like: yet, I say, if they be not done in a right Spirit, they are thereby used as a hand by the Devil, to pull thee under the Covenant of Works; as in former times he used circumcision, which was no part of the Covenant of Works, the ten Commands, but a Seal of the righteousness of Faith; yet, I say, they being done in a Legal Spirit, the Soul was thereby brought under the Covenant of Works, and so most miserably destroyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares to it self, and that because there was not a right understanding of the nature and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102284:142"/>
terms of the said Covenants. And so it is now. Souls being ignorant of the nature of the old Covenant, do even by their subjecting to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Gospel-ordinances, run themselves under the old Covenant, and fly off from Christ, even when they think they are a coming closer to him: (O miserable!) If you would know when or how this is done, whether in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or more, I shall shew you as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That man doth bring himself under the Covenant of Works, by Gospel-Ordinances, when he cannot be persuaded that God will have mercy upon him, except he do yield obedience to such or such a particular thing commanded in the Word: this is the very same spirit that was in the false brethren spoken of, <hi>(Asts</hi> 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> the whole Epistle) whose judgement was, that unless such and such things were done <hi>they could not be saved.</hi> As now a days we have also some that say, unless your Infants be baptized, they cannot be saved; and others say, unless you be rightly baptized, you have no ground to be assured that you are believers, or members of Churches; which is so far off from being so good as a Legal Spirit, that it is the Spirit of Blasphemy; as is evident, because they do reckon that the Spirit, Righteousness, and Faith of Jesus, and the confession thereof, is not sufficient to declare men to be members of the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102284:143"/>
Lord Jesus; when on the other side, though they be rank hypocrites, yet if they do yield an outward subjection to this or that, they are counted presently communicable members; which doth clearly discover, that there is not so much honour given to the putting on the righteousness of the Son of God, as there is given to that which a man may do, and yet go to hell within an hour after; nay, in the very doing of it, doth shut himself for ever from Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men may do things from a Legal or Old Covenant-Spirit, when they content themselves with their doing of such and such a thing; as prayers, reading, hearing, baptism, breaking of bread, or the like; I say, when they can content themselves with the thing done, and sit down at ease and content, because the the thing is done. As for instance, some men, they being persuaded that such and such a thing is their duty, and that unless they do do it, God will not be pleased with them, nor suffer them to be heirs of his kingdom; they from this spirit do rush into, and do the thing, which being done, they are content, as being persuaded, that now they are without doubt in a happy condition, because they have done such things, like unto the Pharisee, who because he had done this and the other thing, said there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in a bragging way, <hi>Lord, I thank thee
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102284:143"/>
that I am not as this Publican; for I have done thus and thus:</hi> when alas, the Lord gives him never a good word for his labour, but rather a reproof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That man doth act from a Legal Spirit, who maketh the strictness of his walking the ground of his assurance for eternal life. Some men, all the ground they have to believe that they shall be saved, it is, because they walk not so loose as their neighbours, they are not so bad as others are, and therefore they question not but that they shall do well; now this is a false ground, and a thing that is verily Legal, and savours only of some slight and shallow appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of the Old Covenant (I call them shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low apprehensions,) because they are not right and sound, and are such as will do the Soul no good, but beguile it, in that the knowledge of the nature of this Covenant doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the Soul, only some commanding power it hath on the Soul, which the Soul endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give up it self unto, it doth find some peace and content, and especially if it find it self to be pretty willing to yield it self to its commands; and is not this the very ground of thy hoping that God will save thee from the wrath to come? If one should ask thee what ground thou hast to think thou shalt be saved; wouldst thou not say? truly because I have left my sins and because I am more inclinable
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102284:144"/>
to do good, and to learn, and get more knowledge, I endeavour to <note place="margin">Do not think that I am against the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</note> walk in Church order (as they call it) and therefore I hope God hath done a good work for me, and I hope will save my soul. Alas, alas, this is a very trick of the Devil, to make Souls build the ground of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon this their strictness, and abstaining from the wickedness of their former lives, and because they desire to be stricter, and stricter. Now if you would know such a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, you shall find them in this frame; namely, when they think their hearts are good then they think also that Christ will have mercy upon them: but when their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons work, then they doubt and scruple, untill again they have their hearts more ready to do the things contained in the Law and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Gospel. Again, such men do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly chear up their hearts, and encourage themselves still to hope all shall be well, and that because they are not so bad as the rest, but more inclinable than they, saying, <hi>I am glad I am not as this Publican, but better than he, more righteous than he,</hi> Luke 18. 11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That is a Legal and Old Covenant-Spirit, that secretly persuades the Soul, that if ever it will be saved by Christ, it must first be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

heart and good intentions to do this and that for Christ: I say, that the Soul when it comes to Christ may not be rejected, or turned off, when indeed and in truth, this is the very way for the Soul to turn it self from Jesus Christ, instead of turning to him; for such a Soul looks upon Christ, rather to be a painted Saviour or a Cipher, then a very, and real Saviour. Friend, if thou canst fit thy self, what need hast thou of Christ? If thou canst get qualifications to carry to Christ, that thou mightest be accepted, thou doest not look to be <hi>accepted in the beloved.</hi> Shall I tell thee? thou art as if a man should say, I will make my self clean, and then I will go to Christ that he may wash me; or like to a man possessed, that will first cast the Devils out of himself, and then come to Christ for cure for him. Thou must therefore, if thou wilt so lay hold of Christ, as not to be rejected by him, I say thou must come to him as the basest in the world, more fitter to be damned, if thou hadst thy right, then to have the least smile, hope, or comfort from him: come with the fire of hell in thy conscience; come with thy heart hard, dead, cold, full of wickedness and madness against thy own Salvation; come as renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all thy tears, prayers, watchings, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; come as a blood-red sinner; do not stay from Christ, till thou hast a greater sense
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:102284:145"/>
of thy own misery, nor of the reality of Gods mercy; do not stay while thy heart is softer, and thy spirit in a better frame, but go against thy mind, and against the mind of the Devil and Sin, throw thy self down at the foot of Christ, with a halter about thy neck, and say, Lord Jesus, hear a sinner, a hard-hearted sinner, a sinner that deserveth to be damned, to be cast to hell; and resolve never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, or to give over crying unto him, till thou do find that he hath washed thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science from dead works with his blood ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and clothed thee with his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and made thee compleat in himself; this is the way to come to Christ.</p>

               <p>Now a few words to the second Doctrine, and so I shall draw towards a conclusion; The Doctrine doth contain in it very much comfort to thy Soul, who art a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant man, or one of those who art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Covenant.</p>
               <p>There is first pardon of sin. And secondly, the manifestation of the same. And thirdly, a power to cause thee to persevere through Faith to the very end of thy life.</p>
               <p>There is first pardon of sin, which is not in the Old Covenant; for in that there is nothing but commands, and if not obeyed, condemned. O, but there is pardon of sin, even of all thy

sins, against the first and second Covenant, under which thou art, and that freely, upon the account of Jesus Christ the righteous, he having in thy name, nature, and in the room of thy person, fulfilled all the whole Law in himself for thee, and freely giveth it unto thee: O, though the Law be a ministration of death and condemnation, yet the Gospel, under which thou art, is the ministration of life and salvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8 9. Though they that live and dye under the first Covenant, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth them not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9.

2. The Covenant that thou art under doth allow of Repentance, in case thou chance to slip or fall, by sudden Temptation, <hi>(Rev.</hi> 2. 5.) but the Law allows of none, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 3. 10.) The Covenant that thou art under allows thee strength also: but the Law is only a sound of words, commanding Words, but no Power is given by them to fulfill the things commanded, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 19. Thou that art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this second, art made a Son; but they that are under that first, are Slaves and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 12.

But they under the other, their Mediator is turned an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and speaketh most bitter things against their Souls, <hi>John</hi> 5. 45. Again, the way that thou hast into Paradise, is a new and living way; mark, a living way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 20.

But they under the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant have nothing but the Righteousness of the Law, which <hi>Paul</hi> counts dirt and dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8. Thou hast that which will make thee perfect; but the other will not do so, <hi>Heb. 7. 19. The Law makes nothing perfect; but the bringing in of a better Hope</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The New Covenant promiseth thee a new Heart, (as I said before) <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. but the Old Covenant promiseth none; and a new Spirit, but the Old Covenant promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth none.

               <p>Secondly, As all these, and many more Priviledges, do come to thee through, or by the New Covenant; and that thou mightest not doubt of the Certainty of these glorious Priviledges, God hath so ordered it, that they do all come to thee by way of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase being obtained for thee, ready to thy hand, by that one Man Jesus, who is the Mediator, or the Person that hath principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do, both with God and thy Soul, in the things pertaining to this Covenant: so

that now thou mayest look on all the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things that are spoken of in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and say, all these must be mine; I must have a share in them; Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased them for me, and given them to me.

for his victory I give to them, his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I give to them, his merits I bestow on them, and look upon them holy, harmless, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and for ever comely in my Eye, through the victory of the Captain of their Salvation.</p>
               <p>And that thou mayest indeed and in truth, not only hear and read this glorious Doctrine, but be found one that hath the life of it in thy heart, thou must be much in studying of the two Covenants; the nature of the one and the nature of the other, and the conditions of them that are under them both. Also thou must be well grounded in the manner of the Victory and Merits of Christ, how they are made thine. And here thou must in the first place believe, <hi>that the Babe that was Born of</hi> Mary, <hi>lay in a Manger at</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>in the time of</hi> Caesar Augustus; <hi>that he, that Babe, that Child, was the very Christ.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, thou must believe that in the days of <hi>Tibereas Caesar,</hi> when <hi>Herod</hi> was <hi>Tetrarch</hi> of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> Governour of <hi>Judea,</hi> that in those days he was crucified, or hanged on a tree between two Thieves, which by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, or according to the best account, is above sixteen hundred years since. Thirdly, thou must also believe, that when he did hang upon that Cross of Wood, on the Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> that then he did dye there
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:102284:148"/>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">This is the Doctrine that I will live and dye by, and be willing to be damned if it saves me not. I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore I preach Christ Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness. <hi>Rom. 1. 1 Cor.</hi> 1.</note> for the sins of those that did dye before he was Crucified, also for their sins that were alive at the time of his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that he did by that one death give satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to God for all those that should be born and believe in him after his death, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Worlds end. I say, this thou must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve upon pain of eternal Damnation, that by that one death, that when he did dye, he did put an end to the curse of the Law and Sin, and at that time by his death on the Cross, and by his Resurrection out of <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Sepulchre, he did bring in a sufficient Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to clothe thee withall compleatly. <hi>For by one offering he hath for ever perfected them that are sanctified, not that he should often offer himself; for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the World: but now ONCE in the end of the World hath he appeared to put</hi> (or do) <hi>away Sin by the sacrifice of himself.</hi> Namely, when he hanged on the Cross. <hi>For it is by the offering up of the Body of</hi> (this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) <hi>Jesus Christ ONCE for all.</hi> Indeed, <hi>other Priests may offer oftentimes Sacrifices and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:102284:148"/>
which can never take away Sins; but this Man</hi> (this Jesus, this <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 14. Heb. 9. 24, 25.</note> annointed and appointed sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) <hi>when he had offered ONE sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But because thou in thy pursuit after the faith of the Gospel wilt be sure to meet with devils, hereticks, particular corruptions, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, ignorance, the spirit works, animated on by suggestions, false conclusions, with dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrines, I shall therefore briefly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what hath been already said, speak a word or two more before I leave thee, of further advice, especially concerning these two things.</p>
               <p>First, How thou art to conceive of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How thou art to make applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him.</p>
               <p>First, For the Saviour, thou must look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be very God and very Man; not man only, nor God only, but God and Man in one Person, both natures joyned together, for the putting of him in a capacity to be a suitable Saviour: suitable, I say, to answer both sides and parties with whom he hath to do in the office of his Mediatorship, and being as a Saviour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thou must not only do this, but thou must also consider and believe, that
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:102284:149"/>
even what was done by Jesus Christ, <hi>it was not done by one nature without the other: but thou must consider that both natures, both the God-head and the man-hood did gloriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur and joyn together in the undertaking of the Salvation of our Bodies and Souls; not that the God-head undertook any thing without the Man-hood, neither did the Man-hood do any thing without the Vertue and Union of the God head; and thou must of Necessity do this, otherwise thou canst not find any sound ground and footing for thy Soul to rest upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if thou look upon any of these asunder, that is to say, the God-head without the Man-hood, or the Man-hood without the God-head, thou wilt conclude that what was done by the God-head, was not done for man, being done without the Man-hood; or else, that that which was done with the Man-hood could not answer Divine Justice, in not doing what it did, by the Vertue and in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the God-head; for it was the God-head that gave Vertue and Value to the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the Man-hood, and the Man-hood being joyned therewith, that giveth us an interest into the heavenly glory and comforts of the God-head.</p>
               <p>What ground can a man have to believe that Christ is his Saviour, if he do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he suffered for Sin in his Nature.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:102284:149"/>
And what ground also can a man have to think that God the Father is satisfied, being infinite, if he believe not also that he who gave the satisfaction was equal to him who was offended.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Beloved, when you read of the offering of the Body of the Son of Man for our Sins, then Consider, that he did it in Union with, and by the help of the eternal God-head. <hi>How much more shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay further, God did look upon him, and account him the Sin of Man. <hi>He hath made him to be Sin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>is God made his Son Jesus Christ our Sin, or <hi>reckoned</hi> him to be, not only a Sinner; but the very bulk of Sin of the whole World, and condemned him so severely as if he had been nothing but Sin. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent forth his Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for Sin condemned Sin in the flesh.</hi> That is, for our Sins condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Son Jesus Christ: as if he had indeed and in truth been our very Sin, and yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without Sin, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21. Rom.</hi> 8. 3. Therefore, as to the taking away of thy Curse, thou must reckon him to be made Sin for thee. And as to his being thy Justification, thou must reckon him to be thy Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for, saith the Scripture, <hi>He</hi> (that is God) <hi>hath made HIM to be SIN for us, though he knew no Sin, that WE might be made the RIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEOUSNESS of God in HIM.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Consider for whose sake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all this glorious design of the Father and the Son was brought to pass, and that you shall find to be for Man, for sinful Man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:102284:150"/>
Thirdly, The terms on which it is made ours; and that you will find to be a free gift, meerly arising from the tender-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God. <hi>You are justified freely by his Grace through the Redemption that is in Christ, whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, How men are to reckon it theirs, and that is upon the same terms which God doth offer it, which is freely, as they are worthless and undeserving Creatures, as they are without all good, and also unable to do any good. This, I say, is the right way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the merits of Christ to thy Soul, for they are freely given to thee a poor Sinner, nor for any thing that is in thee, or done by thee; but freely, as thou art a Sinner, and so standest in absolute need thereof.</p>
               <p>And Christian, thou art not in this thing to follow thy sense and feeling: but the very Word of God. The thing that doth do the People of God the greatest injury, it is their too little hearkning to what the Gospel saith, and their too much giving credit to what the Law, Sin, the Devil, and Conscience saith: and upon this very ground to conclude, that because there is the certainty of guilt upon the Soul, therefore there is also for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by Sin. Damnation to be brought upon the Soul. This is now to set the Word of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:102284:151"/>
God aside and to give credit to what is sorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the contrary: but thou must give more credit to one syllable of the written Word of the Gospel, than thou must give to all the Saints and Angels in Heaven and Earth; much more than to the Devil and thy own guilty Conscience.</p>
               <p>Let me give you a Parable. There was a certain man that had committed Treason against his King; but, for as much as the King had Compassion upon him, he sent him by the hand of a faithful Messenger, a Pardon under his own Hand and Seal: but in the Countrey where this poor man dwelt, there was also many that sought to trouble him, by often putting of him in mind of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the Law that was to be executed on the Offender. Now which way should this man so honour his King, but as believing his Hand-writing, which was the Pardon: certainly he would honour him more by so doing, than to regard all the Clamours of his Enemies continually against him.</p>
               <p>Just thus it is here, thou having committed Treason against the King of Heaven, he, through Compassion for Christs sake, hath sent thee a Pardon: but the Devil, the Law, and thy Conscience, do continually seek to disturb thee; by bringing thy Sins afresh into thy remembrance: But now, wouldest thou
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:102284:151"/>
honour thy King, why then, <hi>He that believeth the RECORD that God hath given of his Son, hath set to his SEAL that God is true. And this is the Record, that God hath given to US eternal Life: and this Life is in his Son.</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 11, 12. And therefore, my Brethren, seeing God our Father hath sent us damnable Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors a Pardon from Heaven (even all the Promises of the Gospel) and also hath sealed to the certainty of it with the heart-blood of his dear Son: let us not be daunted, though our Enemies with terrible Voices do bring our former life never so often into our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But, saith the Soul, how if after I have received a Pardon I should commit Treason again? What should I do then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Set the case thou hast committed abundance of Treason, he hath by him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Pardons. <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes I my self have been in such a straight, that I have been (almost) driven to my Wits ends with a sight and sense of the greatness of my sins: but calling to mind that God was God in his Mercy, Pitty, and Love, as well as in his Holiness, Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:102284:152"/>
And again, considering the ability of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that was given to Holiness and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to the end there might be way made for Sinners to lay hold of this Mercy; I say, I considering this, when tempted to doubt and despair, I have answered in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Lord, here is one of the greatest Sinners that ever the the ground bare. A Sinner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law, and a Sinner against the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. I have sinned against Light, and I have sinned against Mercy; and now Lord, the guilt of them breaks my heart, the Devil also he would have me despair, telling of me that thou art so far from hearing my Prayers in this my distress, that I cannot anger thee worse, then to call upon thee; for, saith he, thou art resolved for ever to damn and not to grant me the least of thy favour: yet Lord. I would fain have forgiveness. And thy word, though much may be inferred from it against me; yet it saith, <hi>If I come unto thee thou wilt in no wise cast me out.</hi> Lord, shall I honour thee most by believing thou canst pardon my Sins, or by believing thou canst not? Shall I honour thee most by believing thou wilt pardon my Sins, or by believing thou wilt not? Shall I honour the Blood of thy Son also by despairing, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof is not sufficient, or by believing that it is sufficient to purge me from all my
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102284:152"/>
blood-red and crimson Sins surely, thou that couldest find so much Mercy as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>Manasseh, Mary Magdalen,</hi> the three thousand Murderers, persecuting <hi>Paul,</hi> Murderous and Adulterous <hi>David,</hi> and blaspheming <hi>Peter,</hi> thou that offeredst Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> a Witch, and didst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Astrologers and Conjurers in the nineteenth of <hi>Acts,</hi> thou hast Mercy enough for one poor sinner. Lord, set the case my Sins were bigger than all these, and I less deserved Mercy than any of these: yet thou hast said in thy word, that he that <hi>cometh to thee, thou wilt, in no wise cast out.</hi> 
                  </q>And God hath given comfort to my Soul, even to such a Sinner as I am: and I tell you, there is no way so to honour God, and to beat out the Devil, as to stick to the truth of Gods Word, and the merits of Christs Blood by believing. <hi>When Abraham believed</hi> (even against hope and reason) <hi>he gave Glory to God,</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>And this is our Victory, even our Faith. Believe, and all things are possible to you. He that believeth shall be saved. He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth on the Son hath everlasting Life, and shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my Fathers Hands</hi> 1. Joh. 5. 4.</p>
               <p>And if thou dost indeed believe this, thou wilt not only confess him as the Quakers do; That is, that he was born at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:102284:153"/>
                  <hi>Mary,</hi> suffered on Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> under <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate,</hi> was Dead and Buried, Rose again, and Ascended, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For all this they confess, and in the midst of their confession they do verily deny that his Death on that Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> did give satisfaction to God for the Sins of the World; and that his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of <hi>Josephs</hi> Sepulchre, is the cause of our Justification in the sight of God, Angels, and Devils: But, I say, if thou dost believe these things indeed, thou dost believe that then, so long ago, even before thou wast born, he did bear thy Sins in his own Body, which then was Hanged on the Tree, (and never before nor since) that thy old Man was then Crucified with him, namely, in the same Body then Crucified, (see 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6.) This is non-sense to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not: but if thou do indeed believe, thou seest it so plain, and yet such a Mystery, that it makes thee wonder.</p>
               <p>But in the third Place, this glorious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the New Covenant, and the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator thereof, will serve for the comforting, and the maintaining of the comfort of the Children of the New Covenant this way also; that is, that he did not only dye and rise again, but that he did ascend in his own Person in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, to take possession thereof for <hi>me,</hi> to prepare a Place there for <hi>me,</hi> standeth there

               <p>My Brethren, I would not have you ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this one thing, that though the <hi>Jews</hi> had the promise of a sacrifice, of an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high Priest that should deliver them, yet they had but the Promise; for Christ was not sacrificed, and was not then come an High Priest of good things to come: only the Type, the Shadow, the Figure, the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies they had, together with Christs engaging

as Surety to bring all things to pass that was promised should come, and upon that account received and saved.</p>
               <p>It was with them and their dispensation as this similitude gives you to understand. <q>Set the case that there be two men who make a covenant, that the one should give the other ten thousand Sheep, on condition the other give him two thousand pound: but for as much as the Money is not to be paid down presently; therefore if he that buyeth the Sheep will have any of them before the day of payment, the Creditor requesteth a Surety, and upon the engagement of the Surety there is part of the Sheep given to the Debtor, even before the day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the other at and after.</q> So it is here, Christ covenanted with his Father for his Sheep, <hi>(I lay down my Life for my Sheep,</hi> saith he) but the Money was not to be paid down so soon as the bargain was made, (as I have already said I yet some of the Sheep were saved, even before the Money was paid, and that because of the suretiship of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is written, <hi>Being justified</hi> (or saved) <hi>freely by his Grace, through the Redemption</hi> (or purchase) <hi>of Jesus Christ, whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood to declare himself righteous, in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving the Sins that are past,</hi> (or the Sinners

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:102284:158"/>
his bleeding Wounds so much in them, as that the Fruits thereof should be the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Soul? Of my sinful Soul? As to save me sinful, me rebellious, me desperate, me, what then? Shall not I now be holy? Shall not I now study, strive, and lay out my self for him that hath laid out himself Soul and Body for me? Shall I now love ever a Lust or Sin? Shall I now be ashamed of the Cause, Wayes, People, or Saints of Jesus Christ? Shall I not now yield my Members as Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Righteousness, seeing my end is everlasting Life? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Shall Christ think nothing too dear for me? And shall I count any thing too dear for him? Shall I grieve him with my foolish Carriage? Shall I slight his Counsel by following of my own Will? Thus therefore the Doctrine of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant doth call for Holiness, engage to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and maketh the Children of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to take Pleasure therein. Let no man therefore conclude on this, that the Doctrine of the Gospel is a licentious Doctrine: but if they do, it is because they are Fools, and such as have not tasted of the Vertue of the Blood of Jesus Christ; neither did they ever feel the Nature, and Sway that the Love of Christ hath in the Hearts of his. And thus also you may see that the Doctrine of the Gospel is of great Advantage to the People of God, that

               <p>1 <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, yet doubtless every willing Sin is not that; for then <hi>David</hi> had sinned it, when he lay with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi> when he fled from the Presence of the Lord, and <hi>Solomon</hi> also when he had so many Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Answ.</hi> But that Sin is a Sin that is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, which is this; <hi>For a man after he hath made some Profession of Salvation to come alone by the Blood of Jesus, together with some Light and Power of the same upon his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: I say, for him after this, knowingly, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and despitefully, to trample upon the Blood of Christ shed on the Cross, and to count it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy thing or no better then the Blood of another man; and rather to venture his Soul any other way, then to be saved by this precious Blood.</hi> And this must be done I say, after some light, <hi>(Heb. 6. 4, 5.)

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Beg of God for strength against them, and if at any time thou findest thy wicked Heart to give way in the least thereto, (for that is likely enough) and though thou find it may on a sudden give way to that hell-bred Wickedness that is in it: yet do not despair, for as much as Christ hath said, <hi>All manner of Sins and Blasphemies shall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Sons of Men.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> For certain this Sin and the commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it, doth lie in a knowing, wilfull, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, or despiteful, together with a final trampling the Blood of sweet Jesus under foot, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it seems to be rather a resisting of the Spirit, and the motions thereof, than this which you say; for first, its proper Title is the Sin against the Holy Ghost. And again, <hi>They have done despite unto the Spirit of Grace.</hi> So that it rather seems to be, I say, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the Spirit, and the movings thereof is that Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:102284:161"/>
1 <hi>Answ.</hi> For certain the Sin is committed by them that do as before I have said, that is, by a final, knowing, wilful, malicious trampling under foot the Blood of Christ, which was shed on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> when Jesus was there crucified. And though it be called the Sin against the Spirit, yet (as I said before) every Sin against the Spirit is not that: for if it was, then every Sin against the Light and Convictions of the Spirit would be unpardonable: but that is an evident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, for these Reasons. First, because there be those who have sinned against the movings of the Spirit, and that knowingly too, and yet did not commit that. As <hi>Jonah,</hi> who when God had expresly by his Spirit bid him go to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> he runs thereupon quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. Secondly, because the very People that have sinned against the movings of the Spirit, are yet, if they do return, received to Mercy. Witness also <hi>Jonah,</hi> who though he had sinned against the movings of the Spirit of the Lord, in doing contrary thereunto, <hi>Yet when he called</hi> (as he saith) <hi>to the Lord, (out of the Belly of Hell) the Lord heard him, and gave him deliverance, and set him again about his work.</hi> (Read the whole story of that Prophet.)</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Answ.</hi> But secondly, I shall shew you that it must needs be wilfully, knowingly, and a
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:102284:161"/>
malicious rejecting of the man Christ Jesus as the Saviour: That is, counting his Blood, his Righteousness, his Intercession in his own Person (for he that rejects one rejects all) to be of no value, as to salvation. I say, this I shall shew you is the unpardonable Sin. And then afterwards in brief shew you why it is called the Sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>First, That man that doth reject, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, the Blood, Death, Righteousness, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, Ascension, and Intercession of the man Christ, doth reject that Sacrifice, that Blood, that Righteousness, that Victory, that Rest, that God alone hath appointed for Salvation, (John 1. 29.) <hi>Behold the Lamb</hi> (or sacrifice) <hi>of God. We have Redemption through his Blood,</hi> (Ephes. 1. 7.) <hi>That I may be found in him,</hi> (to wit) in Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with Christs own personal obedience to his Fathers Will, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10. By his Resurrection comes Justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. His Intercession now in his own Person in the Heavens, now absent from his Saints, is the cause of the Saints Perseverance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 7, 8. also <hi>Rom. 8. 33, 34, 35, 36, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, They that reject this Sacrifice, and the Merits of this Christ, which he by himself hath brought in for Sinners, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him through whom alone all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the New Testament, together with
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:102284:162"/>
all the Mercy discovered thereby, doth come unto poor Creatures; <hi>For all the promises in him are Yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. And all spiritual Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings are made over to us through him, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 3, 4. That is, through, and in this Man (which is Christ) we have all our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Heavenly, and eternal Mercies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He that doth knowingly, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and despitefully reject this man for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, doth sin the unpardonable Sin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is never another sacrifice to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, Heb. 10. 26. <hi>There is no more offering for Sin; there remaineth no more sacrifice for Sin,</hi> Heb. 10. 18. (namely, than the offering of the body of Jesus Christ a Sacrifice <hi>once for all,</hi> Heb. 10. ver. 10. and 14. compared with ver. 18. and 26.) No, but they that shall after light, and clear conviction, reject the first offering of his Body for Salvation, do Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him the second time, which irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly merits their own Damnation: <hi>For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for those who were once enlightned, and have tasted of the Heavenly Gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost; and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the good Word of God, and the powers of the World to come: If they shall fall away to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them again unto Repentance, seeing they Gru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open Shame. If they fall away to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102284:162"/>
renew them again unto Repentance:</hi> And why so? seeing, saith the Apostle, they do cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to themselves the Son of God afresh, and do put him to open shame. O then! how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably hath the Devil deceived some? In that he hath got them to reject the merits of the first offering of the Body of Christ; (which was for Salvation) and got them to trust in a fresh Crucifying of Christ, which unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly brings their speedy Damnation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they that do reject this Man, as aforesaid, do sin the unpardonable Sin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in rejecting him, they do make way for the Justice of God to break out upon them, and to handle them as it shall find them: which will be in the first place, Sinners against the first Covenant, which is the Soul-dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Covenant; and also despising of (even the Life, and Glory, and Consolations, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Grace, and Love, that is discovered in) the second Covenant, forasmuch as they reject the Mediator and Priest of the same, which is the Man Jesus. And the Man that doth so, I would fain see how his Sins should be pardoned, and his Soul saved, seeing the means (which is the Son of Man, the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> and his Merits) is rejected. For saith he, <hi>If you believe not that I am he, you shall,</hi> mark, <hi>you shall,</hi> do what you can, <hi>you shall,</hi> appear where you can, <hi>you shall,</hi> follow <hi>Moses,</hi> Law or any
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102284:163"/>
holiness whatsoever, <hi>you shall dye in your Sins,</hi> Joh. 8. 24. So that, I say, the Sin that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the unpardonable Sin, is a knowing, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and despiteful rejecting of the sacrificing of the Son of Man the first time for Sin. And now to shew you why it is called the Sin against the Holy Ghost, as in these Scriptures, <hi>Mat. 12. Heb. 10. Mark</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>First, Because they Sin against the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest light of the Spirit, (as I said before) it is a Sin against the light of the Spirit: That is, they have been formerly enlightened into the nature of the Gospel, and the Merits of the Man Christ, and his Blood, Righteousness, Intercession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And also professed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the same, with some life and comfort in, and through the profession of him: Yet now against all that Light, maliciously, and with despite to all their former Profession, turn their backs, and trample upon the same.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is called the Sin against the Holy Ghost, because such a Person doth (as I may say) lay violent hands on it; one that sets himself in opposition to, and is resolved to resist all the motions that do come in from the Spirit to persuade the contrary. For I do verily believe, that men, in this very reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of God, after some knowledge of him, especially at their first resisting and refusing of him, they have certain motions
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102284:163"/>
of the Spirit of God to disswade them from so great a Soul-damning Act. But they, being filled with an over-powering measure of the Spirit of the Devil, do do despite unto these Convictions and Motions, by studying and contriving how they may answer them, and get from under the convincing nature of them; and therefore it is called a doing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite unto the Spirit of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. And so,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In that they do reject the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seechings of the Spirit, and all its gentle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatings of the Soul, to tarry still in the same Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In that they do reject the very Testimony of the Prophets and Apostles, with Christ himself: I say, their Testimony through the Spirit, of the Power, Vertue, Sufficiency, and Prevalency, of the Blood, Sacrifice, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and Intercession of the man Christ Jesus, of which the Scriptures are full both in the Old and New Testament, as the Apostle saith, <hi>For all the Prophets from</hi> Samuel, <hi>with them that follow after, have shewed of these days.</hi> That is, in which Christ should be a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for Sin, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 24. compared with Ver. 6. 13, 14, 15, 18, 26. Again, saith he, <hi>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:102284:164"/>
1 Thes. 4. 8. That is, he rejecteth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth the very Testimony of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is called the Sin against the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, because he that doth reject and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the Doctrine of Salvation by the man Christ Jesus, through believing in him, doth despise, resist, and reject the Wisdom of the Spirit; for the Wisdom of Gods Spirit did never more appear, than in its finding out a way for Sinners to be reconciled to God, by the death of this man; and therefore Christ, as he is a Sacrifice, is called <hi>the Wisdom of God.</hi> And again, when it doth reveal the Lord Jesus, it is called <hi>the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of him,</hi> Ephes. 1. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But (some may say) the slighting, or rejecting of the Son of Man, (Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary)</hi> cannot be the Sin that is unpardonable, as is clear from that Scripture in the twelfth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where he himself saith, <hi>He that shall speak a Word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall sin against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this World, nor in the World to come,</hi> Ver. 32. Now by this it is clear that the Sin that is unpardonable is one thing, and the sin against the Son of Man another; that Sin that is against the Son of Man is pardonable: but if that was
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:102284:164"/>
the Sin against the Holy Ghost it would not be pardonable; therefore the Sin against the Son of Man is not the Sin against the Holy Ghost, the unpardonable Sin:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, I do know full well that there are several Persons that have been pardoned, yet have sinned against the Son of Man: and that have for a time rejected him, as <hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14. Also the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36, 37. But there was an ignorant reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him without the Enlightning, and Taste, and Feeling of the Power of the things of God, made mention of in the sixth of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the 3, 4, 5, 6, Verses.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is, and hath been a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er manner of sinning against the Son of Man, which also hath been, and is still pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; as in the case of <hi>Peter,</hi> who in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent temptation, in a mighty hurry, upon a sudden denied him, and that after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Spirit of God from Heaven to him, that he (Jesus) was the Son of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 16, 17, 18. This also is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, if there be a coming up again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: (O rich Grace! O wonderful Grace! that God should be so full of Love to his poor Creatures, that though they do sin against the Son of God, either through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or some sudden violent charge breaking loose from Hell upon them) but
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:102284:165"/>
yet take it for certain, that if a Man do slight and reject the Son of God, and the Spirit, in that manner as I have before hinted, that is, for a Man after some great measure of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning by the Spirit of God, and some Profession of Jesus Christ to be the Saviour, and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that was shed on the Mount without the Gates of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to be the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement; I say, he that shall after this, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, wilfully, and out of malice and despite, reject, speak against, and trample that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine under foot, resolving for ever so to do: And if he there continue, I will pawn my Soul upon it, he hath sinned the unpardonable Sin, and shall never be forgiven neither in this World nor in the World to come; or else those Scriptures that testifie the Truth of this must be scrabled out, and must be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon for meer Fables; which are these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. <hi>For if after they have escaped the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the World, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> (which is the Son of Man, <hi>Matth. 16. 13.) and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain intangled therein, and overcome;</hi> (which must be by denying this Lord that bought them, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 1.) the latter end is worse with them than the beginning, 2 Pet. 2. 20. For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly Gift.—And have tasted the good Word of God, and the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:102284:165"/>
powers of the World to come: If they shall fall away</hi> (not only fall, but fall away; that is, finally, <hi>Heb. 10. 19.) it is impossible to renew them again unto Repentance;</hi> and the Reason is rendred, <hi>seeing they have crucified to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Son of God</hi> (which is the Son of Man) <hi>afresh, and put him to an open shame,</hi> Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. Now if you would further know what it is to Crucifie the Son of God afresh: it is this. For to undervalue and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under foot the Merits and Vertue of his Blood for Remission of Sins, as is clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the tenth of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 26, 27, 28, Verses, where it's said, <hi>For if we Sin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully after we have received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sins; But a certain fearful looking for of Judgment, and the fiery Indignation, which shall devour the Adversaries. He that despised</hi> Moses <hi>Law died without Mercy; of how much sorer Punishment suppose ye shall be thought worthy, that have trodden under foot the Son of God,</hi> (there is the second Crucifying of Christ which the Quakers think to be saved by) <hi>and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was sanctified, an unholy thing.</hi> And then followeth, <hi>And hath done despite unto the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Verse the twenty ninth. All that <hi>Paul</hi> had to keep him from this Sin, it was his ignorance in persecuting the Man, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:102284:166"/>
Merits of Jesus Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. But I obtained Mercy (saith he) because I did it ignorantly, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14. And <hi>Peter,</hi> though he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him knowingly, yet he did it unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in a sudden and fearful Temptation, and so by the Intercession of Jesus escaped that Danger. So, I say, they that commit this Sin, they do it after Light, knowingly, wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and despitefully, and in the open view of the whole World, reject the Son of Man for being their Lord and Saviour, and in that it is called the Sin against the holy Ghost. It is a Name most fit for this Sin to be called the Sin against the Holy Ghost, for these Reasons but now laid down; for this Sin is immediately committed against the Motions and Convictions, and Light of that Holy Spirit of God, that makes it its business to hand forth, and manifest the Truth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the Merits and Vertues of the Lord Jesus, the Son of Man. And therefore beware Ranters and Quakers, for I am sure you are the nearest that Sin by profession (which is indeed the right committing of it) of any Persons that I do know at this day under the whole Heavens; for as much as you will not venture the Salvation of your Souls on the Blood shed on Mount <hi>Calvary, Luke</hi> 23. 33. out of the side of that Man that was offered up in Sacrifice for all that did believe, in
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102284:166"/>
that his offering up of his Body at that time (either before he offered it, or that have, do, or shall believe on it for the time since, together with that time that he offered it) though formerly you did profess that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was wrought out that way, by that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice then offered, and also seemed to have some comfort thereby; yea, insomuch that some of you declared the same in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many, professing your selves to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of the same. O therefore! it is sad for you that were once thus enlightned, and have tasted these good things; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all your Profession, you are now turned from the simplicity that is in Christ to another Doctrine which will be to your destruction, if you continue in it; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blood there is no Remission, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22.</p>
               <p>Many other Reasons might be given, but that I would not be too tedious: yet I would put in this Caution, that if there be any Souls that be but now willing to venture their Salvation upon the Merits of a Naked Jesus, I do verily for the present believe, they have not sinned that Sin; because there is still a promise holds forth it self to such a Soul, where Christ saith, <hi>He that comes to me, I will in no wise</hi> (for nothing that he hath done) <hi>cast him out, John</hi> 6. 36. That promise is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be written in Letters of Gold.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That is a good sign that thy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are more than bare words, and have some prevalence at the Throne of Grace through Christ Jesus, or else the Devil would never seek to labour to beat thee off from Prayer, by undervaluing thy Prayers, telling thee they are Sin; for the best Prayers he will call the worst, and the worst he will call the best, or else how should he be a Liar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But, I am afraid the day of Grace is past, and if it should be so, what should I do then?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:102284:168"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Truly, with some men indeed it doth fare thus, that the day of Grace is at an end before their Lives are at an end. Or thus, the day of Grace is past before the day of Death is come, (as Christ saith) <hi>If thou had'st known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things that belong unto thy Peace, (that is, the word of Grace or Reconciliation) but now it is hid from thine Eyes,</hi> Luke 19. 41, 42. But for the better satisfying of thee, as touching this thing, Consider these following things.</p>
               <p>First, doth the Lord knock still at the door of thy Heart by his Word and Spirit? If so, then the day of Grace is not past with thy Soul; for where he doth so knock, there he doth also proffer, and promise to come in and Sup, (that is, to Communicate of his things unto them) which he would not do, was the day of Grace past with the Soul, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
               <p>But how should I know whether Christ do so knock at my heart, as to be desirous to come in? That I may know also whether the day of Grace be past with me or no?</p>
               <p>Consider these things.</p>
               <p>First, doth the Lord make thee sensible of thy miserable state, without an interest in Jesus Christ? and that naturally thou hast no share in him, no faith in him, no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, no delight in him, or love in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:102284:168"/>
the least to him? If he hath, and is doing of this, he hath, and is knocking at thy Heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, doth he, together with this, put into thy Heart an earnest desire after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, together with holy Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions not to be satisfied without real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, doth he sometimes give thee some secret persuasions (though not scarcely discernable) that thou mayest attain, and get an interest in him?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, doth he now and then glance in some of the promises into thy Heart, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to leave some heavenly savour (though but for a very short time) on thy Spirit?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, dost thou at some time see some little Excellency in Christ? and doth all this stir up in thy Heart some breathings after him? If so, then fear not, the Day of Grace is not past with thy poor Soul; for if the day of Grace should be past with such a Soul as this, then that Scripture must be broken, where Christ saith, <hi>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wise</hi> (for no thing, by no means, upon no terms whatsoever) <hi>cast out,</hi> John 6. 37.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But surely if the day of Grace was not past with me, I should not be so long without an answer of Gods love to my Soul;
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:102284:169"/>
that therefore doth make me mistrust my state the more, is, that I wait and wait, and yet am not delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Hast thou waited on the Lord so long as the Lord hath waited on thee; it may be the Lord hath waited on thee this twenty or thirty, yea forty years, or more, and thou hast not waited on him seven years; cast this into thy Mind therefore when Satan tells thee, that God doth not love thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast waited so long without an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance; (for it is his temptation) for God did wait longer upon thee, and was fain to send to thee by his Ambassadors, time after time: And therefore say thou, <hi>I will wait to see what the Lord will say unto me;</hi> and the rather, because <hi>he will speak Peace,</hi> for he is the Lord thereof.</p>
               <p>But secondly, Know that it is not thy being under trouble a long time, that will be an Argument sufficient to prove that thou art past hopes; Nay contrariwise; for Jesus Christ did take our Nature upon him, and also did undertake deliverance for those, and bring it in for them <hi>who were all their Life Time subject to Bondage,</hi> Heb. 2. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But alas, I am not able to wait, all my Strength is gone, I have waited so long I can wait no longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:102284:169"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It may be thou hast concluded on this long ago, thinking thou shouldest not be able to hold out any longer; no not a year, a month, or a week, nay, it may be not so long. It may be in the morning thou hast thought thou shouldest not hold out till night, and at night till morning again: yet the Lord hath supported thee, and kept thee in waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him many Weeks, and Years; therefore that is but the Temptation of the Devil to make thee think so, that he might drive thee to despair of Gods Mercy, and so to leave off following the ways of God, and to close in with thy Sins again. O therefore do not give way unto it; but believe that thou shalt <hi>see the Goodness of the Lord in the Land of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Wait on the Lord, be of good Courage, and he shall strengthen thine Heart; wait, I say, on the Lord,</hi> Psal. 27. 23, 24. And that thou mayest so do, consider these things.</p>
               <p>First, If thou, after thou hast waited thus long, shouldest now give over, and wait no longer, thou wouldest lose all thy time and pains that thou hast taken in the way of God hitherto, and wilt be like to a man that because he sought long for Gold, and did not find it; therefore turned back from seeking after it, though he was hard by it, and had almost found it: and all because he was loth to look and seek a little further.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:102284:170"/>
Secondly, Thou wilt not only lose thy time, but also lose thy own Soul; for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no where else but in Jesus Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thou wilt sin the highest sin that ever thou didst sin before, in drawing (final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) back, insomuch, that God may say, my Soul shall have no pleasure in him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38.</p>
               <p>But secondly, consider, thou sayest all my strength is gone, and therefore how should I wait? why at that time when thou feelest, and findest thy strength quite gone, even that is the time when the Lord will renew, and give thee fresh strength. <hi>The youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon the Lord, shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with Wings as Eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not be faint,</hi> Isa. 40. 30, 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But though I do wait, yet if I be not elected to eternal Life, what good will all my waiting do me? <hi>For it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but of God that sheweth Mercy.</hi> Therefore I say, if I should not be elected, all is in vain.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Answ.</hi> Why, in the first place, to be sure thy backsliding from God will not prove thy election, neither thy growing weary of waiting upon God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:102284:170"/>
2 <hi>Answ.</hi> But secondly, Thou art it may be troubled to know whether thou art elected: And sayest thou; if I did but know that, that would encourage me in my waiting on God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I believe thee; but mark, thou shalt not know thy election in the first place, but in the second. That is to say, thou must first get acquaintance with God in Christ, which doth come by thy giving credit to his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Records which he hath given of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, his Blood and Righttousness, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the rest of his Merits.</p>
               <p>That is, before thou canst know whether thou art elected, thou must believe in Jesus Christ so really, that thy faith laying hold of, and drinking and eating the Flesh and Blood of Christ, even so, that there shall be life begotten in thy Soul by the same. Life from the condemnings of the Law, Life from the guilt of Sin. Life over the filth of the same. Life also to walk with God in his Son and wayes; the Life of Love to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Jesus Christ his Son, Saints, and Wayes; and that because they are Holy, Harmless, and such that are altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Iniquity.</p>
               <p>For these things must be in thy Soul as a forerunner of thy being made acquainted with the other. God hath these two ways to shew to his Children their election.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:102284:171"/>
First, by Testimony of the Spirit. That is, the Soul being under trouble of Conscience, and grieved for Sin, the Spirit doth seal up the Soul by its comfortable Testimony; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading of the Soul, that God for Christs sake hath forgiven all those Sins that lye so heavy on the Conscie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce, and that do so much perplex the Soul, by shewing it that that Law which doth utter such horrible curses against it, is by Christs Blood satisfied, and fulfilled, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By consequence; that is, the Soul finding that God hath been good unto it, in that he hath shewed it its lost state and miserable condition: and also that he hath given it some comfortable hope that he will save it from the same: I say, the Soul, from a right sight thereof, doth, or may, draw this conclusion, that if God had not been mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have saved it, he would not have done for it such things as these. But for the more surer dealing with thy Soul, it is not good to take any of these apart; that is, it is not good to take the Testimony of the Spirit, (as thou supposest thou hast) from the fruits thereof, so as to conclude the Testimony thou hast received, to be a sufficient ground without the other; (not that it is not, if it be the Testimony of the Spirit) but because the Devil doth also deceive Souls by the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:102284:171"/>
of his Spirit in them, pretending that it is the Spirit of God. And again, thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not satisfie thy self, though thou do find some seekings in thee after that which is good, without the testimony of the other, that is to say, of the Spirit; for it is the Testimony of two that is to be taken for truth: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore say I, as thou shouldest be much in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Spirit to testifie assurance to thee, so also thou shouldest look to the end of it when thou thinkest thou hast it; which is this, to shew thee that it is alone for Christs sake that thy sins are forgiven thee, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so thereby a constraining of thee to advance him, both by Words, and Works, in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and righteousness all the Dayes of thy Life. From hence thou mayest boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thy Election, 1 <hi>Thes. 3: 4, 5, 6. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring without ceasing your Work of Faith, and Labour of Love, and Patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God our Father: Knowing, Brethren</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>beloved, your Election of God.</hi> But how? why by this, <hi>For our Gospel came not to you in word only, but also in Power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance.—And ye became fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of us, and of the Lord, having received the Word in much affliction, with Joy of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost: So that you were ensamples to all that believe in</hi> Macedonia <hi>and</hi> Achaia. <hi>And to wait
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:102284:172"/>
for his Son from Heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus which</hi> (hath) <hi>delivered us from the wrath to come,</hi> ver. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But alas, for my part, instead of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in me any thing that is good, I find in me all manner of Wickedness, Hard-heartedness, Hypocrisie, coldness of Affection to Christ, very great unbelief, together with every thing that is Base, and of an ill Savour. What hope therefore can I have?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If thou wast not such a one, thou hadst no need of Mercy. If thou wast whole, thou hadst no need of the Physician; doest thou therefore see thy self in such a sad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as this? Thou hast the more need to come to Christ, that thou mayest be not only cleansed from these Evils, but also that thou mayest be delivered from that Wrath they will bring upon thee (if thou do not get rid of them) to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how should I do? and what course should I take to be delivered from this sad and troublesome Condition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Dost thou see in thee all manner of Wickedness? The best way that I can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a Soul in such a case, is, to pitch a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast Eye on him that is full, and to look so stedfastly upon him by Faith, that thereby thou mayest even draw down of his fulness into thy Heart; for that is the right way, and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:102284:172"/>
the way that was typed out (before Christ came in the Flesh) in the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> when the Lord said unto him, <hi>Make thee a Serpent of Brass</hi> (which was a Type of Christ) <hi>and set it upon a Pole; and it shall come to pass that when a Serpent hath bitten any Man, that he may look thereon and live,</hi> Numb. 21. 8.</p>
               <p>Even so now in Gospel times, when any Soul is bitten with the fiery Serpents (their Sins) that then the next way to be healed, is, for the Soul to look upon the Son of Man, who, as the Serpent was, was hanged on a Pole, (or Tree) that whosoever shall indeed look on him by Faith, may be healed of all their Distempers whatsoever, <hi>John</hi> 3. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>As now to instance in some things. First, is thy Heart hard? why then, behold how full of Bowels and Compassion is the Heart of Christ towards thee, which may be seen in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down from Heaven to spill his Heart-Blood for thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is thy Heart slothful and idle? then see how active the Lord Jesus is for thee, in that he did not only die for thee: but also in that he hath been ever since his Ascension into Heaven, making Intercession for thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Dost thou see and find in thee Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Unrighteousness? Then look up to Heaven, and see there a Righteous Person,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:102284:173"/>
even thy righteous Jesus Christ, now present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee in his own Perfections before the Throne of his Fathers Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Dost thou see that thou art very much void of right Sanctification? then look up and thou shalt see that thy Sanctification is in the presence of God a compleat Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, representing all the Saints as (Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, so) sanctified ones in the Presence of the great God of Heaven. And so whatsoever thou wantest, be sure to strive to pitch thy Faith upon the Son of God, and behold him stedfastly, and thou shalt by so doing find a mighty change in thy Soul. <hi>For when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, as in a Glass, even the Glory of the Lord, we are changed</hi> (namely by beholding) <hi>from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. This is the true way to get both Comfort to thy Soul, and also San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and right Holiness into thy Soul.</p>
               <p>Poor Souls that are under the Distemper of a guilty Conscience, and under the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of much Corruption, do not go the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way to Heaven, if they do not in the first place look upon themselves as cursed Sinners by the Law; and yet at that time they are blessed, for ever blessed Saints, by the Merits of Jesus Christ. <hi>O wretched Man that I am,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet O blessed Man that I am through my Lord Jesus Christ: for
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:102284:173"/>
that is the Scope of the Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24, 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But alas, I am blind and cannot see, what shall I do now?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Why truly thou must go to him that can make the Eyes that are blind to see (even to our Lord Jesus) by Prayer, saying as the poor blind Man did, <hi>Lord, that I might receive my Sight,</hi> and so continue begging with him, till thou do receive Sight, even a sight of Jesus Christ, his Death, Blood, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, Ascension, Intercession, and that for thee, even for thee.</p>
               <p>And the rather, because first, he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited thee to come and buy such Eye-salve of him that may make thee see. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3: 18. Secondly, because thou shalt never have any true comfort till thou dost thus come to see, and behold the Lamb of God that hath taken away thy Sins. <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. Thirdly, because that thereby thou wilt be able (through Grace) to step over, and turn aside from the several stumbling-blocks that Satan, together with his Instruments hath laid in our way, which otherwise thou wilt not be able to shun, but wilt certainly fall when others stand, and grope and stumble, when others go upright, to the great Prejudice of thy poor Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But alas I have nothing to carry with me, how then should I go?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:102284:174"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Hast thou no Sins? If thou hast, carry them, and exchange them for his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; because he hath said, <hi>Cast thy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon the Lord, and he will sustain thee; Psal.</hi> 55. 22. and again, because he hath said, Though thou be heavy laden, yet if thou do but come to him, he will give thee rest, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But (you will say) Satan telleth me that I am so cold in Prayers, so weak in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, so great a Sinner, that I do go so slothfully on in the way of God, that I am so apt to slip at every Temptation, and to be entangled therewith, together with other things, so that I shall never be able to attain those blessed things that are held forth to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by Jesus Christ: and therefore my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is much upon this account also, and many times I fear that will come upon me which Satan suggesteth to me; that is, I shall miss of eternal Life.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Answ.</hi> As to the latter part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that thou shalt never attain to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life. That is obtained for thee alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, without thy doing, either thy praying, striving, or wrestling against sin. If we speak properly, it is Christ that hath in his own Body abolished Death on the Cross, and brought Light, Life, and Glory to us, through this his thus doing. But this is the thing that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:102284:174"/>
thou aimest at, that thou shalt never have a share in this Life already obtained for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as do come by Faith to Jesus Christ: and all because thou art so slothful, so cold, so weak, so great a Sinner, so subject to slip and commit Infirmities.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, Didst thou never learn for to out-shoot the Devil in his own Bow, and to cut off his Head with his own Sword, as <hi>David</hi> served <hi>Goliah,</hi> who was a Type of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> O how should a poor Soul do this? this is rare indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Why truly thus, Doth Satan tell thee thou prayest but faintly, and with very cold Devotion; answer him thus, and say. I am glad you told me, for this will make me trust the more to Christs Prayers, and the less to my own; also I will endeavour henceforward to groan, to sigh, and to be so fervent in my crying at the Throne of Grace, that I will, If I can, make the Heavens rattle again, with the mighty Groans thereof. And whereas thou sayest that I am so weak in believing, I am glad you mind me of it, I hope it will hence forward stir me up to cry the more heartily to God for strong Faith, and make me the more restless till I have it. And seeing thou tellest me that I run so softly, and that I shall go near to miss of Glory;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:102284:175"/>
this also shall be through Grace to my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and cause me to press the more earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the mark, for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. And seeing thou doest tell me that my Sins are wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous great; hereby thou bringest the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the unsupportable Vengeance of God into my mind, if I dye out of Jesus Christ, and also the necessity of the Blood, Death, and Merits of Christ to help me; I hope it will make me fly the faster, and press the harder after an interest in him; and the rather because (as thou tellest me) my state will be unspeakable miserable without him. And so all along, if he tell thee of thy Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Dulness, Coldness, or Unbelief, or the greatness of thy Sins; answer him, and say, I am glad you told me, I hope it will be a means to make me run faster, seek earnestli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to be the more restless after Jesus Christ. If thou didst but get this art, as to out run him in his own Shooes, (as I may say) and to make his own Darts to pierce himself, then thou mightest also say, now doth Satans Temptations, as well as all other things, work together for my Good, for my Advantage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But I do find so many weaknesses in every Duty that I do perform, as when I pray, when I read, when I hear, or any other
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:102284:175"/>
Duty, that it maketh me out of conceit with my self, it maketh me think that my Duties are nothing worth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, It may be it is thy Mercy that thou art sensible of Infirmities in thy best things thou doest, I, a greater Mercy then thou art aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Can it be a Mercy for me to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with my Corruptions? Can it be a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge for me to be annoyed with Infirmities, and to have my best Duties infected with it? How can it possibly be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Verily thy Sins appearing in thy best Duties, do work for thy Advantage these wayes. First, in that thou findest ground enough thereby to make thee humble; and when thou hast done all, yet to count thy self but an unprofitable Servant. And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thou by this means art taken off from leaning on any thing below a naked Jesus for eternal Life. It is like, if thou wast not sensible of many by-Thoughts and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in thy best Performances, thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est go near to be some proud, abominable Hypocrite, or a silly, proud, dissembling Wretch at the best, such a one as would send thy Soul to the Devil in a bundle of thy own Righteousness: but now thou, through Grace, seest that all and every thing thou doest, there is sin enough in it to condemn thee. This in
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:102284:176"/>
the first place makes thee have a care of trusting in thy own doings. And secondly, sheweth thee that there is nothing in thy self which will do thee any good, by working in thee, as to the meritorious cause of thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: No, but thou must have a share in the Birth of Jesus, in the Death of Jesus, in the Blood, Resurrection, Ascension, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession of a crucified Jesus? And how say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou? doth not thy finding of this in thee, cause thee to flie from a depending on thy own doings? And doth it not also make thee the more earnestly to groan after the Lord Jesus? Yea, and let me tell thee also, it will be a cause to make thee admire the freeness and tender-heartedness of Christ to thee, when he shall lift up the light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon thee, because he hath regarded such a one as <hi>thou,</hi> sinful <hi>thou:</hi> And therefore in this sense it will be a mercy to the Saints, that they do find the reliques of sin still strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling in their Hearts; But this is not simply the nature of sin, but the Mercy and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, who causeth <hi>all things to work together for the good of those that love and fear God, Rom.</hi> 8. And therefore whatever thou findest in thy Soul, though it be sin of never so black a Soul-scaring nature, let it move thee to run the faster to the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt not be ashamed, that is, of thy running to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:102284:176"/>
But secondly, When thou doest apprehend that thou art defiled, and also thy best Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties annoyed with many Weaknesses, let that Scripture come into thy Thoughts, which saith, <hi>Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Redemption.</hi> And if thou shalt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that, what thou canst not find in thy self, thou shalt find in Christ. Art thou a Fool in thy self, then Christ is made of God thy Wisdom. Art thou Unrighteous in thy self, Christ is made of God thy Righteousness? Doest thou find that there is but very little sanctifying Grace in thy Soul? still here is Christ made thy Sanctification; and all this in his own Person without thee, without thy Wisdom, without thy Righteousness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy Sanctification, without in his own Person in thy Fathers presence, appearing there perfect Wisdom, Righteousness, and Sanctification in his own Person, I say, as a publick Person for thee: So that thou mayest believe and say to thy Soul, My Soul, though thou doest find innumerable Infirmities in thy self, and in thy Actions; yet look upon thy Jesus, the man Jesus, he is Wisdom, and that for thee, to govern thee, to take care for thee, and to order all things for the best for thee. He is also thy Righteousness now at Gods right Hand alwayes shining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:102284:177"/>
the Eyes of his Glory: So that there it is unmovable, though thou art in never such a sad Condition, yet thy Righteousness, which is the Son of God, God-man, shines as bright as ever, and is as much accepted of God as ever: (O this sometimes hath been Life to me) And so, whatever thou, O my Soul, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est wanting in thy self, through Faith, thou shalt see all laid up for thee in Jesus Christ, whether it be Wisdom, Righteousness, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or Redemption. Nay, not only so: but as I said before, he is all these in his own Person without thee in the presence of his Father for thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But now, if any should say in their Hearts, O, but I am one of the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-men I doubt; that is, I doubt I am not within this glorious Covenant of Grace. And how if I should not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Well, thou fearest that thou art one of the Old Covenant, a Son of the Bond-woman. In the first place, know that thou wast one of them by Nature; for all by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are under that Covenant: but set the case that thou art to this day under that, yet let me tell thee in the first place, there is hopes for thee; for there is a gap open, a way made for Souls to come from under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, by Christ, <hi>For he hath broken down the middle Wall of Partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:102284:177"/>
us and you.</hi> Ephes. 2. 14. And therefore if thou wouldest be saved thou mayest come to Christ. If thou wantest a righteousness (as I said before) there is one in Christ. If thou wouldest be washed, thou mayest come to Christ, and if thou wouldest be justified, there is justification enough in the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. And secondly, thou canst not be so willing to come to Christ, as he is willing thou shouldest come to him; witness his coming down from Heaven, his Humiliation, his spilling of his Blood from both his Cheeks, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 44. by sweat, under the burden of sin, and his shedding of it by the Spear, when he hanged on the Cross. It appears also by his Promises, by his Invitations, by his send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his Messengers to preach the same to poor Sinners, and threatneth Damnation upon this very account, namely, the neglect of him; and declares that all the thousands, and ten thousands of sins in the World, should not be able to damn those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him; that he would pardon all, forgive and pass by all if they would but come unto him: moreover, promiseth to cast out none, no, not the poorest, vilest, contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Creature in the whole World. <hi>Come unto me all</hi> (every one, though you be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so many, never so vile, though your
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:102284:178"/>
Load be never so heavy and intollerable, though you deserve no help, not the least help, no Mercy, not the least compassion) yet <hi>cast your Burthen upon me, and you shall find rest for your Souls.</hi> Come unto me, and I will heal you, love you, teach you, and tell you the way to the Kingdom of Heaven: Come unto me and I will succor you, help you, and keep you from all Devils and their Temptations, from the Law and its Curses, and from being for ever overcome with any evil whatsoever. Come unto me for what you need, and tell me what you would have, or what you would have me do for you, and all my Strength, Love, Wisdom, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest that I have with my Father shall be laid out for you. Come unto me, your sweet Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, your loving and tender-hearted Jesus, your everlasting and sin-pardoning Jesus. Come unto me, and I will wash you, and put my Righteousness upon you, pray to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for you, and send my Spirit into you that you might be saved. Therefore,</p>
               <p>Consider besides this, what a priviledge thou shalt have at the day of Judgment above thousands, if thou do indeed and in truth close in with this Jesus and accept of him; for thou shalt not only have a Priviledge in this Life only, but in the Life Everlasting, even at the time of Christs second coming from
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:102284:178"/>
Heaven; for then when there shall be the whole World gathered together, and all the good Angels, bad Angels, Saints, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, when all thy Friends and Kindred with thy Neighbours on thy Right-hand and on the left shall be with thee, beholding of the wonderful Glory and Majesty of the Son of God; then shall the Son of Glory, even Jesus, in the very view and sight of them all, smile and look kindly upon thee; when a smile or a kind look from Christ shall be worth more then ten thousand Worlds, then thou shalt have it. You know it is counted an honour for a poor man to be favourably looked upon by a Judge, or a King in the sight of Lords, Earls, Dukes, and Princes; why thus it will be with thee in the sight of all the Princely Saints, Angels, and Devils, in the sight of all the great Nobles in the World: then even thou that closest in with Christ, be thou rich or poor, be thou bond or free, wise or foolish, if thou close in with him, he will say unto thee, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant,</hi> even in the midst of the whole World; they that love thee shall see it, and they that hate thee shall all to their shame behold it; for if thou fear him here in secret, he will make it manifest even at that day upon the House top.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:102284:179"/>
Secondly, not only thus; but thou shalt also be lovingly received, and tenderly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced of him at that day, when Christ hath thousands of gallant Saints, as old <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the Prophets and Apostles, and Martyrs, attending on him; together with many thousands of glittering Angels minister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him: besides, when the ungodly shall appear there with their pale Faces, with their guilty Consciences, and trembling Souls, that would then give thousands and ten thousands of Worlds, (if they had so many) if they could enjoy but one loving look from Christ. I say then, then shalt thou have the hand of Christ reached to thee kindly to receive thee, saying, Come thou blessed, step up hither; thou wast willing to leave all for me, and now will I give all to thee; here is a Throne, a Crown, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, take them; thou wast not ashamed of me when thou wast in the World among my Enemies, and now will not I be ashamed of thee before thine Enemies, but will in the view of all these Devils and damned Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates promote thee to Honour and Dignity. <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World:</hi> Thou shalt see that those who have served me in truth, shall lose nothing
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:102284:179"/>
by the means: No, but ye shall be as Pillars in my Temple, and Inheritours of my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and shall have a place to walk in among my Saints and Angels, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 7. O! Who would not be in this Condition? Who would not be in this Glory? It will be such a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravishing Glory, that I am ready to think the whole reprobate World will be ready to run mad, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 34. to think that they should miss of it; then will the vilest Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, Swearer, Liar, and unclean Person wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly cry, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us;</hi> yet be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied of entrance, and thou in the mean time embraced, entertained, made welcome, have a fair Mitre set upon thy Head, and clothed with immortal Glory, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 5. O therefore let all this move thee, and be of weight upon thy Soul to close in with Jesus, this tender-hearted Jesus. And if yet for all what I have said, thy Sins do still stick with thee, and thou findest thy hellish Heart loath to let them go, think with thy self in this manner. Shall I have my Sins, and lose my Soul? Will they do me any good when Christ comes? Would not Heaven be better to me then my Sins? And the Company of God, Christ, Saints, and Angels be better then the Company of <hi>Cain, Judas, Balaam,</hi> with the Devils in the Furnace of Fire. Canst thou now that readest or hearest these Lines, turn
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:102284:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thy Back, and go on in thy Sins? Canst thou set so light of Heaven, of God, of Christ, and the Salvation of thy poor, yet precious Soul? Canst thou hear of Christ, his bloody Sweat and Death, and not be taken with it, and not be grieved for it, and also converted by it? If so, I might lay thee down several Considerations to stir thee up to mend thy pace towards Heaven; but I shall not, there is enough written already to leave thy Soul without excuse, and to bring thee down with a Vengeance into Hell-fire, devouring Fire, the Lake of Fire, eternal, everlasting Fire; O! to make thee swim and roul up and down in the Flames of the Furnace of Fire.</p>
