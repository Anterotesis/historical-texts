         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WILLIAM BROMLEY, <abbr>Esq</abbr>
One of the Knights of the Shire for the County
of WARWICK.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THAT which I here present you is Originally the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of yovr own Country, since the Great Artist from
whose elaborate and curious hand I Coppy this Peice
in little, owed his Birth and Habitation to <hi>Warwickshire.</hi> I
know not therefore to whom (in the number of my Friends)
more properly to dedicate these Collections than to your self:
for thus it is an act of Justice to restore to the proper County
(in your Person who represent it) what came from thence at
first.</p>
                  <p>Nothing deterr'd my Presumption in this more than to think
I should expose the Imperfections of my Pen to so accurate
and excellent a Judgment. A Judgment that has taught you
the true use of Foreign Travails, by which you have brought
home from the politest Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> all their Virtues and
Accomplishments, and left behind their Fopperies and Vice.
It is this Judgment that has so signalized your Merit in the
Eye of your Country, that she has justly fixt her choice on
you for one of her Representatives in our Great Senate; and
it is the same Judgment that you have since most worthily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in that High and Honourable Assembly, by assisting,
and complying with the best Methods and Endeavours for the
Publick Good: Or, to use the words of <hi>Horace,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>—Quid expediat, communiter, aut melior pars,</l>
                        <l>Malis carere quaeritis laboribus.</l>
                     </q>
Yours are the Publick Cares; that's your noble Province.
While I, and those in my inferiour and unactive Station, can
only wish Success to the Proceedings of such Good Patriots as
your self; Our thoughts are best imploy'd with our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Business, and inoffensive Studies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49408:3"/>
Concerning this Book, Sir, it is a Subject that gives Posterity
such a View of the decays of Time, and the Inconstancy of
Fortune, as the like cannot, perhaps, be produced in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of any other Nation Since of all that stupendious number
of Monastick Foundations in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> the
continued Work of many Ages, by which the greatest Kings,
Princes, and Noblemen of this Island were once thought to
have eternized their names, and in those magnificent and costly
Structures to have built themselves so many Monuments as lasting
as the Earth they stood on, not one remains at this day; nay
the very Ruines of many are become invisible. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
(tho' on a different occasion) a modern <hi>French</hi> Poet hath
well exprest himself in these Lines,
<q>
                        <l>Aussi le temps a fait sur ces Masses hautaines</l>
                        <l>D'ilustres chastimens des Vanitez humaines.</l>
                        <l>Ces Tombaux sont tombez, and ces superbes Rois</l>
                        <l>Sous leur chute sont morts une seconde fois.</l>
                     </q>
And yet their Memory still lives in our History and Records;
so much more durable and lasting is Paper than Brass and
Marble. For this we are heholding to the Labours of your
Sir <hi>William Dugdale,</hi> a Person so highly meritorious in the study,
and discovery, of our <hi>English</hi> Antiquities, that his Reputation
can never die among the learned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Warwickshire</hi> has certainly produced two of the most famous
and deserving Writers, in their several ways, that <hi>England</hi> can
boast of; a <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and a <hi>Shakespear,</hi> both <hi>Williams;</hi> a name
that has been of eminent Grace to this County in many Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
nor will it ever cease to be so while you are living.</p>
                  <p>I might here enlarge in your just Encomium, but I fear to
displease you even with truth, when it must be so very much to
your Commendation. I know your Modesty as well as Merits,
and I have ever observed that Praise is most uneasie to those who
best deserve it. I will therefore only add that I am,</p>

lively Idea of the manner of our Forefathers way of Living, their Zeal
for Gods Publick Worship, as then profest, and the Simplicity of their
Devotions; and of the great Charity to the Poor, and Hospitality and
Beneficence to all Comers, maintain'd and exercised in the Monasteries.
But these things have been thought faults, and therefore I will mention no
more of that; but observe in the last place, that this Book is of great use in
matters of Heraldry and Genealogies; there being few or none among
the Great Families, and old Nobility, of <hi>England,</hi> who have not
been Founders or Principal Benefactors to some Monastery or Religious
House, and the Monks and Canons have for the most part taken spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Care to record in the Leiger Book of their respective Houses
<pb facs="tcp:49408:4"/>
the History of their Founder's and Patron's Family, setting down
their several Matches, and Issue, and often-times the day of their
Births and Deaths, with the most remarkable Circumstances of their
Lives, and where buried; which seems also to be done at the time when
every thing happen'd or soon after, and is therefore of greater Credit. In
this Work we must note that the Author saies nothing of the four Orders
of Fryers, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Franciscans</hi> or Gray-Friers, the <hi>Dominicans</hi>
or Black-Friers, the <hi>Carmelites</hi> or White-Friers, and the <hi>Augustine</hi>
Friers; the Reason was, I suppose, because their Houses, generally
speaking, were not endow'd with Lands and Revenues, but they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
for the most, part by daily and accidental Charities.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the Book at large, now as to this Abridgment or Epitome,
I have only this to say; It gives you a short view in <hi>English</hi> of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
and (as I thought,) most material Passages of what is contain'd
in <hi>Latin,</hi> and sometimes old <hi>French,</hi> in the three great and copious Tomes
of the <hi>Monasticon Anglicanum:</hi> The Names of Persons and Places,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ing variously written according to the different Orthography of several
Ages, and Writer, I have not thought convenient to alter the ancient
way of spelling, but have transcribed them here in the same variety as
I found 'em there: In the Margin I have exactly observed and markt
out the Pages successively in order, that so the Reader may have a ready
recourse to the Book at large for a fuller and more particular Information.
And in my opinion this is the best use that can be made of any Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
namely to serve as a larger and better sort of Table, which not
only represents the substance of a voluminous Author in little, but refers and
directs the Reader to the place where the Subjects is more expresly
handled. On the whole, you have here a short Historical Account of the
Foundation of all the Principal Churches and Religious Structures in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Wales,</hi> as well those that were demolisht at the Suppression of
the Monasteries, as those that are still in being (except Parish Churches.)
And here we must note that of all those Cathedral Churches and Episcopal
Seats, whose venerable Fabricks we behold at this day, some were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Abbies, where the Prior and Convent of Monks were the Bishops Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb facs="tcp:49408:5"/>
such were <hi>Canterbury, Rochester, Winchester, Ely, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,
Worcester, Durham, Carlile;</hi> (and in such Churches where
there was a Bishop, the Superior of the Monks was always call'd a Prior,
the Bishop being in effect the Abbot) others never were Abbies, but the
Chapter did always consist of a Dean and Secular Canons (or Prebendaries)
as at present; such were <hi>York, London, Lincoln, Salisbury, Exeter,
Wells, Litchfield, Herefored, Chichester,</hi> and in <hi>Wales,</hi> St. <hi>Davids,
Landaff, Bangor,</hi> and St. <hi>Asaph.</hi> Besides these, there were five
new Bishopricks erected by King <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> in certain Ahbies, after
their dissolution, <hi>viz. Peterborough, Oxford, Chester, Glocester,</hi>
and <hi>Bristol,</hi> whose Churches were left standing, with some of their old
Buildings for the Habitation of the Bishop, Dean and Chapter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for
which see the Statutes, 31 <hi>H. 8. ch. 9. 34 H. 8. ch.</hi> 17.) West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister-Abby
was also made an Episcopal Seat, but that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
so but a while. Some other Monastick Churches were made
Parochial, and are still in being, as St. <hi>Albans,</hi> St. <hi>Mary Overies,
Royston,</hi> &amp;c. to conclude, I think I may, not unfitly, apply to my present
undertaking the words used on the like occasion, in the Second Book of
<hi>Maccabees,</hi> ch. 2. v. 23. <hi>All these things</hi> (I say) <hi>being declared
by</hi> Iason <hi>of</hi> Cyrene <hi>in five Books, we will essay to abridge in
one Volum. For considering the infinite number, and the
difficulty which they find that desire to look into the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Story, for the variety of the Matter, we have
been careful that they that will read might have delight,
and they that are desirous to commit to memory might
have ease, and that all into whose hands it comes might have
profit.—To stand upon every point, and to go over things
at large, and to be curious in particulars, belongeth to the
first Author of the Story. But to use Brevity, and avoid much
labouring of the Work, is to be granted to him that will
make an Abridgment. Here then will we begin the story:
only adding thus much to that which hath been said, that it is
a foolish thing to make a long Prologue and to be short in the
Story it self.</hi>

stood, and twelve Hides of Land, and built there the first

                           <p>THE History of the Foundation of this Abby was writ at large by
<hi>Phillip</hi> the third Abbot of this House; and is in short as follows,
In the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the I. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1134. After the Foundation
of the Abby of <hi>Furnes,</hi> whose Monks came from <hi>Savigny</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> an
Abbot and Convent of twelve Monks went from the Abby of <hi>Furnes,</hi> to
<hi>Cald</hi> in <hi>Copland,</hi> then newly erected, the Abbots name was <hi>Geraldus;</hi> here
they remained for about four years, till in the year 1137. being plunder'd
and their House almost wholly destroy'd, they were forced to return
back to <hi>Furnes,</hi> but being refused entrance there, and distrest for want of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1028"/>
Habitation, they were partly through the recommendation of <hi>Thurstan</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> and partly out of pitty to their Condition, relieved
by <hi>Gundrea</hi> relict of <hi>Nigellus de Albeney,</hi> and <hi>Roger de Molbray</hi> her Son;

Tithe of all the Provision spent in his House, for the collecting of which
they had a Lay-brother <hi>(Conversus)</hi> always remaining in his House, who
collected the said Tithe, and sent it to the Monastery; but this being found,
in time, inconvenient, was not long after chang'd into an Endowment of
Land, <hi>An.</hi> 1140. After this Abbot, <hi>Geraldus</hi> seeing the Estate of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery

a kind of filial Relation, tho' they were since refused assistance from
thence, when in distress, hereupon he made a Journey to <hi>Savigny,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Chapter of the whole Order <hi>(An.</hi> 1142.) to be discharged of all subjection

dying in his return home, <hi>Roger</hi> then Master of the Novices, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animously
chosen Abbot, and so confirm'd by the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> at
the Presentation of <hi>Roger Molbray</hi> their Patron. After this the Abbot of <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
placed another Abbot and Convent at <hi>Cald. An. 1143. Roger de Molbray</hi>
gave to these Monks the Town and Church of <hi>Bellalanda,</hi> or <hi>Biland,</hi> with

                              <pb n="123" facs="tcp:49408:74"/>
The <hi>Augustine</hi> Confession, says, That Monasteries were heretofore
Schools of sacred Learning, advantagious to the Church, and that
Pastors and Bishops came from thence. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Institutions, says,
Monastick Colledges were then as Seminaries of the <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> Order;
and gives a very great Encomium of their manner of Life and Piety, Charity
to the Poor, and Humanity, out of St. <hi>Augustines</hi> Epistles.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Hyperius</hi> says, That Monasteries at their Institution were no other than
Convents of Good men, and Students; Schools where the Elder did teach
the younger Religion, where they did spend their time in writing, and
disputing, and instituting those who afterwards arrived to eminent places
in the Church, as to be Bishops or Priests, <hi>&amp;c. William Perkins,</hi> says, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1048"/>
the Monasteries of the Ancients were for the most part Publick Schools,
that is, Communities of Teachers and Learners.</p>

the King's behalf, That no King or Kingdom was safe but where the King
had ability to live of his own, and to defend his Kingdom upon any sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Invasion or Insurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was therefore projected, that if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
would give unto him all the Abbies, Priories, Nunneries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
for ever in time then to come, he would take order that the same should
not be converted to private use, but first that his <hi>Exchequer</hi> for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
aforesaid should be enriched. <hi>2dly.</hi> The Kingdom strengthened by
a continual maintenance of forty thousand well trained Souldiers with
skillful Captains and Commanders. <hi>3dly.</hi> for the Benefit and Ease of the
Subject, who should never afterwards in any time to come, be charged
with Subsidies, Fifteenths, Loans, or other common Aides. <hi>4thly,</hi> Least
the honour of the Realm should receive any diminution (there being nine
and twenty Lords of Parliament among the Abbots and Priors, who held
of the King <hi>per Baroniam)</hi> the King would create a number of Nobles. The
said Monasteries and their Possessions were given to the King, his Heirs
and Successors. Now observe the Catastrophe; not long after the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the Monasteries, the said King demanded and had two Subsidies,
and exacted divers Loans.</p>
                           <p>There were in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. 645. Monasteries and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Houses, forty of which being granted to Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> for the
Endowment of his two Colledges: Soon after, as the Pope had given
these to the Cardinal, the King with the Parliaments assent took the rest.
<hi>An.</hi> 1536. those under 200 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> were granted, amounting to 376,
and soon after the Remainder, being in all 605 Monasteries. Besides them,
were given 96 Colledges, 110 Hospitals, and 2374 Chantries and
free Chappells. The Revenue of all which, is wisht to have been bestow'd
for the Advancement of the Church, Relief of the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> rather than
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49408:75"/>
conferr'd with such a prodigal Dispensation on those who stood ready to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1050"/>
                              <hi>devour what was sanctified.</hi> To this purpose one <hi>Henry Brinklow</hi> a Merchant
of <hi>London,</hi> made a Complaint to the Parliament of the Abuse that follow'd
in relation to Appropriations, which as he said were the best Benifices,
and did amount to the third part of all the Parish Churches in <hi>England.</hi>
Touching the Alms <hi>(says he)</hi> that they dealt, and the Hospitality that
they kept, every man knoweth that many thousands were well received
of them, and might have been better, if they had not so many Great
mens Horses to feed, and had not been overcharged with such idle Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
as were never out of the Abbies. But now that all the Abbies with
their Lands and Impropriated Parsonages are in Temporal mens hands,
where 20 <hi>l</hi> was given formerly to the poor yearly, in more than one hundred
places in <hi>England,</hi> is not one meals meat given; where they had always
one or other Vicar that either preached or hired some to preach, now
there is no Vicar at all, but the Farmer is Vicar and Parson too.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1051"/> The Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> in his History of <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. says, That the King was
petition'd that some of the Houses, both for the Vertue of the Persons in
them, and for the Benefit of the Country, (the Poor receiving thence
great Relief, and the richer sort good Education for their Children) might
be left for pious Uses; Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> also moved that two or three might
for those ends be left in every Shire. But <hi>Cromwell</hi> (by the King's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission)
invaded all. However the King thought fit to have this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
confirm'd by Act of Parliament. But the Christian World (says
my Lord <hi>Herbert</hi>) was astonisht at these doings. Beside the Houses
and Lands taken away, there was much mony made of the present Stock
of Cattle and Corn, of the Timber, Lead, Bells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and chiefly of the
Plate and Church Ornaments, which is not valued, but may be conjectured
by that one Monastery of St. <hi>Edmunds Bury,</hi> whence was taken five thousand
Marks of Gold and Silver, besides divers Stones of great Value.</p>

<hi>Walter</hi> the Constable, being the chief Officer in the King's Court, and one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="62"/>
of the Greatest Men of the Kingdom, took on him a Religious Habit, and
spent the remainder of his days in this House. On the death of <hi>Ernisius,
Robert de Retun</hi> was chosen Prior, but he being afterwards made Bishop
of <hi>Hereford, Robert de Braci</hi> was chosen to succeed him. After the death <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="63"/>
of <hi>Henry</hi> the I. the Canons of this House were much afflicted and disturb'd

Constable (and Son of that <hi>Walter</hi> who became a Religious man among

was solemnly dedicated by the Bishops of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> in honour
of the blessed <hi>Mary,</hi> yet still this House retain'd the name of <hi>Lanthony.</hi>

better pleased with their new Habitation, which was much braver and
richer than their old Seat in <hi>Wales,</hi> chose to inhabit at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> removing
and spoiling what they had at <hi>Lanthony.</hi> They became also very licentious
in their way of living. During this <hi>William</hi> their Prior falling into

of Jerusalem.</head>
                     <p>THE Patron of this Order of Knights was St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="489"/> whom they took their Denomination. The Hospital of St. <hi>Iohn
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="490"/> Baptist</hi> and the Poor at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is said to be first built in the
time of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> Prince of <hi>Antioch,</hi> with
certain Treasure which one <hi>Melchiar,</hi> a Priest in the <hi>Temple,</hi> had taken out
of the Sepulcher of <hi>David;</hi> here the Poor and Infirm were kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="491"/> and entertain'd from all parts of the World. The same Author
delivers that when our Saviour Christ became incarnate and conversed on
Earth, when he came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he resorted frequently to this House,
and that it was in this House that he appear'd to his Apostles after his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="492"/> and Resurrection, the Doors being all shut. After his Ascension, St.
<hi>Steven</hi> and others of his Disciples served the poor in this Hospital house ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our Lord's Precept. When the Christians were expell'd from
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the City was possest by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> one <hi>Conradus,</hi> or
<hi>Gerardus,</hi> a devout Servant of God, lived here and served the Poor in like
manner, who at such time as <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was besieg'd by <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi>
and the Christian Pilgrims, and a great Famine being in the Christian
Camp, was accustomed to go upon the Walls and throw over Loaves, which
he carried secretly about him for that purpose, as if he were eager in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stones against the Besiegers. This <hi>Gerard</hi> was the first Master of this
Hospital, which after the City was taken by the Christians was very
much favour'd, and its Revenues augmented by the Kings of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp;c.
After the death of this <hi>Gerard,</hi> Frier <hi>Raymund de Puy</hi> became Master, who
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="493"/> establisht a Rule for the Hospitallers, confirm'd by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the II.
and Pope <hi>Boniface.</hi> This Rule consists of nine and twenty Articles, among
which it is ordain'd that every Brother or Frier, at his admission to the
Service of the Poor here, is to profess these three things, Chas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="495"/> shall not go alone, but two or three together, that if any be publickly guilty
of Fornication, he shall be publickly whipt, and then expell'd the Society.
The Infirm at their first Reception into the Hospital, shall be consest, and

Lords and Masters of the House, That all the Brothers shall wear a Cross

built a Monastery and Church in honour of the blessed Virgin,
placing therein an Abbot and Monks: After that they built another little
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49408:116"/>
Church in honour of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> for the Reception of Women Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims,
and placed therein certain Nuns, and lastly considering the danger
of those who came in Pilgrimage to the holy places, who were often robbed
by the Turks, they built an Hospital or <hi>Domus Dei</hi> for the Reception of
Men, whether Well or Sick, who arrived here in Pilgrimage, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Church for them, dedicated to St <hi>Iohn Elemon, Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi>
These three Houses subsisted only by Alms, collected for them,
yearly, by the said Merchants of <hi>Malfy,</hi> till the Christians conquer'd <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
and expelled the <hi>Saracens:</hi> At which time lived in the Abby of
Monks, the before-mention'd <hi>Girald</hi> to whom the Abbot committed the

flourisht daily more and more, procuring to it self great Revenues, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="499"/>
be discharged from its subjection not only to the Abbot, but Patriarch
also. These and the like mighty Priviledges granted them by the Court
of <hi>Rome,</hi> were the occasion of great Troubles and Disorders between
the Hospitallers and the Patriarch of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> These Hospitallers on

of hainous Crimes, he issued out his Commission to certain Cardinals to
examine the Matter in <hi>France,</hi> before whom the Master and Preceptors of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="560"/>
this Order for that Kingdom appeared, and being sworn, confest themselves
guilty of the Crimes whereof they were accused, and shewing great signs
of Repentance, were absolved. After which the same Pope sent out his
Bull into <hi>England</hi> to commissionate the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and divers
other Bishops to make the like enquiry in this Kingdom. <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1309.
The Articles exhibited against these Knights were principally these; That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="561"/>
at their Reception into the Order they are caused by those who receive
them, to deny Christ crucified, and sometimes God; That they affirm
and teach that Christ is not true God; That they hope not to have Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
through him; That they spit, and piss against the Cross and Image
of Christ thereon, and tread it under foot; that they used to assemble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for that purpose on <hi>Good Friday</hi> it self; That they do not believe
the Sacrament of the Altar, nor any other Sacraments of the Church;
that they injoyn the Priests of their Order not to say the words of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
in the Canon of the Mass; That they affirm and believe that the
Great Master of their Order can absolve them from their Sins, so their
Visitor, and Preceptors, tho' Laymen; That they use several obscene and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="562"/>
wicked actions at their admission <hi>(deosculabantur in ano seu spina dors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one another, and affirm it to be no Crime but lawful; that they adore
Idols, especially in their great Chapters and Assemblies, as their God and
Saviour; that such Admissions are therefore private, none suffer'd to be
present but those of the same Order; that they are sworn not to reveal
the manner of their Reception under pain of Death or Imprisonment;
and that these things are reported by publick same, common opinion,
and also confest for the most part by many of their own Order in full
Consistory before the Pope and Cardinals. The abovesaid Inquisitors

things, yet nothing appear'd for which the Order deserved in Justice to
be suppressed <hi>(nihil inventum est quod de jure videretur statum illorum anul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare.)</hi>
However they were all in one day seized on throughout <hi>England,</hi>
and imprison'd. And in the Council of <hi>Vienna, An. Dom.</hi> 1312. the whole
Order of the Templers was condemn'd and perpetually annull'd; with an
Inhibition that none for the future should take that Order, profession or
Habit, under pain of the greater Excommunication. After which the
Knights Hospitallers of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> obtain'd most part of their Possessions.
At this time <hi>William</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> moved with Charity to consider
the helpless condition of the Templers in his Diocess, placed them in several
Monasteries in that County, and order'd them maintenance during Life.

Offices, and more given to hunting, and the Pleasures of the Forrest,
than to the Church and Prayer, for which being in danger to be removed,
they by way of Prevention refigned all they had here into the hands of
their Patron, and return'd to the place from whence they came, except
<hi>Humfrey</hi> their Prior who retired to a place call'd the <hi>Magdalen,</hi> and became
a Hermit. But this House became not hereby desolate, but afterwards
rise to a greater degree of honour, (<hi>Ludit in adversis divina potentia rebus</hi>)
for after this there came hither six Canons of the Order of <hi>Praemenstratenses</hi>
from <hi>Tupholme,</hi> invited by the Patron. But these also misbehaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and were recall'd to <hi>Tupholme.</hi> Hereupon <hi>William de Grendhom,</hi> then

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="669"/> THe Life of this St. <hi>Gilbert</hi> is writ very largely, out of which I shall
here observe only the most Remarkable Passages, as breifly as may
be. He was born at <hi>Sempringham</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire</hi> his Fathers name was
<hi>Iocelinus.</hi> of <hi>Norman</hi> Extraction, but having large Possessions in this
County. In his youth he was sent into <hi>France</hi> for the Improvement of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="670"/> his Learning. At his return to the place of his Nativity, he instructed
the Country Children, Boys and Girls, in the Rudiments of Learning
and the Methods of a Religious Life. And the Churches of <hi>Sempring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and <hi>Tirington</hi> being void, his Father Presented him Parson of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="671"/> same. After this he became a Domestick Clerk in the Family of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="672"/> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> by whom he was made Priest. All this while he
was of such Exemplary Piety that he became of great note for Sanctity of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="673"/> life. Worldly Honours and Riches he despised, and refused to be an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon
in the Church of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> which was offered him with considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="674"/> Advantages. This was in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> I. At which time he
begun his Order after this Manner; Seven young Virgins, who voluntarily
left the World, shut themselves up in a solitary Habitation adjoyning to the
North wall of the Church of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> at <hi>Sempringham,</hi> and submitted
to his Government and direction in Spirituals. Their Apartment had but
one Door kept Lockt, Their Diet and Releif they received in at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="675"/> For the Assistance of these he appointed certain Lay Sisters, and for
the outward Service of the House certain Lay Brothers. From this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="676"/> this Order encreased to many Monasteries, built, endow'd, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="677"/> encouraged by the great Men of this Kingdom. Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> gave
him the headship or Government of this Order. To assist him in his
Office of Superspection he Collected Clerks who might take part of the
Care of the Government of his Nunneries off of him, and this was the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of the Canons of this Order. These Canons were to live in a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="678"/> Separate habitation, and never to have any access to that of the Nuns,
unless for the administration of some Sacrament, and that before many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
but the same Church to serve for both. Yet had they two Rules;
the Nuns that of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> the Canons that or St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> with some
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="681"/> pecial Orders. St. <hi>Gilbert</hi> tho' Chief of this Order yet lived with as much
hardship in fasting. Watching, and all other Austerities as the meanest of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="682"/> them all. He abstain'd wholly from flesh, unless in Sickness, and from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="684"/> Fish also in Lent and Advent. In the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> II. he fell
into great Troubles by reason of his siding with <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> and his releiving him with monies when he fled into <hi>France,</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="685"/> but at length he was freed from them, and set at Liberty. After this he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="686"/> had new Afflictions from the malicious Scandals of some lay Brothers of
his own Order, but his patience brought him out of these Troubles also,
and his Innocency and merit was certified by almost all the Bishops of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="687"/>
                        <hi>England,</hi> and by King <hi>Henry</hi> II. himself. In his old Age he was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

or spiritual Discourses; he heard nothing with patience but what related
to God and a good life, and himself spoke little, and that only what was
holy and useful. He lived to be above one hundred years of age, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="690"/>
