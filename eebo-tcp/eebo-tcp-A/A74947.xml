         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Leave this God once, leave this God <hi>ſtill,</hi> (whom if you do enjoy, you muſt enjoy in Ordinances, <hi>Job.</hi> 22. 21, 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 4.) and aſſure your ſelves you ſhall never meet with ſuch a God again. The Lord make you to know it, and thereupon make all to know that he hath <hi>turned your heart back again.</hi> 1 Kings 18. 37.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>prayer</hi> is (after I have been ſo long in this fifth canſideration)</p>

                  <p>In concluſion, I ſhall advertiſe the Reader, that whereas I write more roundly in this Rejoynder, than I uſe to do, and than I have ever done, (and wherein, if in any thing, I have exceeded in the judgment of wiſe and godly men, I am ready to be reproved)
<pb facs="tcp:118630:12"/>
that manner of writting I have been drawn into, not only becauſe the things are ſo groſſe which this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent holds, and the ſpirit ſo inſulting with which he holds them forth (a temptation which I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to reſiſt) but more particularly for theſe reaſons,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Apoſtle directs in ſome caſes <note n="*" place="margin">Neque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim ſic cum proter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domitis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum ut cum man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetis doci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus Calv. in loc.</note> to cutting rebukes, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 13. which I write with fear, leaſt I ſhould take my ſelf, or incourage any other to take a liberty to walk in ſuch a way, unleſſe with a deſire to cure thoſe that are corrupt; or to deter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are ſuch; or to confirm thoſe the better that are not ſuch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet (ſure) all men are not to be dealt with alike, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 22. 23. and with theſe men both wayes are tryed.

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould not have been thus long, but that I account the anſwering of one that declaimes (or exclaimes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their diſputes far leſs conſiderable than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of ſomething upon this occaſion, (which) (as God hath enabled) I have endeavoured to doe) for the information and conformation of humble, ſincere, and ordinance obſerving Chriſtians.</p>

                  <p>BE pleaſed to underſtand that ſince the writing of this Epiſtle, I find that there is a ſober anſwer made to the angry Epiſtle of <hi>T.S.</hi> by my Reverend Bretheren the Miniſters of Redding, which I doubt not will give very good ſatisfaction to the underſtanding and indifferent Reader; yet I ſhall not deſiſt from publiſhing my ſelfe what I intended before, but ſhall goe on in my purpoſe, both becauſe the Booke (the Epiſtle wherefore they have anſwered) is directed to my ſelfe by name, and becauſe God hath in mercy ſo directed mine and my Bretherens meditations, that we ſhall walk in ſomething a different way in one and the ſame worke, and yet not onely without difference and diſagreement, but I hope with a more full and cumulative aſſiſtance, to ſuch ſelfe-knowing and ſincere Chriſtians, as ſee they need, and deſire to profit by our labours, which we pray God to bleſſe unto them for their greateſt good.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall further advertiſe the Reader of two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> That my purpoſe at firſt was to anſwer at once the whole Booke of <hi>T. S.</hi> And in order thereunto I framed the precedent Epiſtle which reflects more properly upon all of it then upon a part. But in regard of my many occaſions and inability of body for ſtudy, it will require ſome longer
<pb facs="tcp:118630:15"/>
time to goe through the whole; &amp; yet I am ſo importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd upon by divers godly Perſons, to whoſe ſpirits that booke is extreamly diſpleaſing, that I cannot deferre the doing of ſomething for ſome preſent ſatisfaction. I have reſolved therefore for this time (eſpecially conſidering that the pleading of my own perſonall cauſe is of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in regard of the general intereſt of the Miniſtry) to apply my ſelfe to his Epiſtle onely, but with a purpoſe (God aſſiſting) to adjoyne my anſwer to the reſidue. of the Booke, which I hope will be in a very ſhort time.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> I deſire the Reader to obſerve that experience hath ſo much inform'd me of the little likelihood of prevailing with him that is become mine Adverſary (to whom my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires have been to doe good) that I have reſolved, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared, that I would not have further to doe with him: and the truth is, that a ſpeciall end in this my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, after my endeavour to cleare the truth and ſervants of God, is the informing and confirming of teachable Chriſtians. Thence it is that I am more large in the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeverall places of Scripture; and thereupon alſo I ſpeak (not in the ſecônd, but) in the third Perſon to the Writter, and direct my diſcourſe to the reader, deſiring God that thoſe Providences that adde to the work of his Miniſters, may adde alſo to the ſpiritual welfare of his people.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I go further, I ſhall obſerve in anſwer to this Inſcription, theſe four things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That this Author thinks it not enough (I know not whether he ſcorne or no) to lay hands on <hi>Mordecai</hi> alone, and to oppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt my poor ſelf, whom he might with more eaſe, and leſſe ſinne, have troden under foot; but his deſigne is to diſgrace the publick Teachers throughout the whol Nation, unto whom therefore he gives the odious name of Chief-Prieſts, (which they never owned, and by which never any Saint, that we read, or know of, called them) the better thereby to faſten upon them his monſtrous and fictitious accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he that prefixed this Title cannot but know, that himſelf hath heard, not only the world, but many Saints al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, call the Teachers of this Land by the name of Miniſters, unleſſe he be come to that paſſe to think that none are Saints but Quakers, and that he was none himſelf, till he was one of them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the people of this Nation, and he among the reſt, whether they and he hear, or whether they will forbear, ſhall know one day that there have been Prophets and Miniſters among them <hi>Ezeck.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 A fourth thing which I obſerve, and offer to the Reader to take notice of is this, that he that caſts all that dirt, that is in this foule Epiſtle upon publick Teachers, was lately a publick Teacher himſelf, though not by the world no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r of it as to forbear without a due Call, or a true heart to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be tampering about it; he gave a Say to that calling, and it might have been thought that he would have been a ſtar to have lead others to Jeſus Chriſt, but he he is proved a Comet, and is now not only fallen to the earth, but (which I am ſorry to ſpeak, but this Book will ſpeak it) falls foul upon heaven, which I cannot but preſent as a very conſiderable warning to all others that take the boldneſſe to be publick Teachers without any minde and meaning to be Miniſters of Chriſt in the way of Chriſt, leaſt God not only give them over to teach erroneous things (which they often do) but leave them at laſt to fall off from preaching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without a calling, to be bitter enemies to thoſe that preach with a calling, as this miſerable man declares himſelf to be; who notwithſtanding hath nothing to defend himſelf from the dint of his own ſword-like words, but only this, that he is no Miniſter, and making us none neither, the caſe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and ſo all fals on himſelf in reference to the time wherein he was a publick Teacher, and no better (ſure) than other publick Teachers, whom in this Satyr he ſo much enveighs againſt.</p>

                     <p>But the other ſcripture, to wit, <hi>John</hi> 8. 12. is of another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as being delivered by Chriſt as God manifeſted in the fleſh, and appearing in the world in perſon and in Goſpel-preaching; and ſo it directly intends his enlightening of the world, that is both Jews and Gentiles (for he doth not ſay, as in the other place, I am the light of <hi>every one that comes into the world)</hi> with the ſaving knowledge of the Goſpel, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this its true, that whoſoever follows Chriſt enlightening them by his voice (which ſome doe <hi>through grace,</hi> many do not, and none can without it) ſhall not walk in darkneſſe, but have the light of eternall life, <hi>John</hi> 10. 27, 28.</p>

Were his meaning fair and honeſt, and he intended no more when he ſaith, he that followeth that light; but that he that follows Chriſt the great light of the world, as he directeth by his Word &amp; Spirit ſhould have the light of life; or that Chriſt Jeſus the light were ſufficient to teach and guide to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I ſay, if he meant thus, we ſhould not gainſay him, and the Charge in ſuch a ſenſe is his own, not ours: But if his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be that Chriſt puts a ſufficient light within every man that comes into the world to guide him unto the Father and unto life.

Its true, that Chriſt or the light <hi>[lightning]</hi> is ſufficient to guide to the Father every one that comes into the world, but not every light of Chriſt <hi>[lighted]</hi> Let him ſhew any Scripture that ſaith, that Chriſt ſo enlightens every man as that that light is ſufficient to guide him to the Father, that explication is his addition; nay the light that all men have, though it ſeem to make them know God <hi>as God,</hi> yet it ſufficeth not to make them know that there is a <hi>Father,</hi> that is, to informe them that there is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt, or that there is any Goſpel: Since natural light inſiſts only on the moral Law and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; for there cannot be more written in the heart of fallen man without further revelation than there was in the heart of innocent man which was only the Law of works, not the law of faith. There is nothing known of the Goſpel but by report and tidings from God <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>But let all Chriſtians marke the poiſon that lyes under theſe lips; every man hath a light, that is, a light within him; (for ſo they ſtill expreſſe it) to help him to life and guide him to the Father.

The Apoſtle therefore addes, but let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay; that is, in common diſcourſe let there be no oath at all: But a conſtant and candid expreſſing your ſelves, in ſimple and ſtable affirmations and negations. In brief, that which Chriſt ſpeaks is not againſt all ſwearing (wherein the Name of God is ſo much advanced in his Omniſcience and Juſtice) but againſt <hi>creature-ſwearing</hi> and <hi>common ſwearing:</hi> we may therefore put our Saviour and his Apoſtle together and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that both Chriſt and <hi>James</hi> (whoſe words we may call a comment upon our Saviours words) do not take away the uſe, but eſtabliſh the reverence of an Oath, by prohibiting the prophane and trivial taking of it up in mens common talke.</p>

                     <p>But this man ſits and laughs at this neceſſary and effectual aſſiſtance for the adminiſtration of Juſtice, and ſpeaks as if he would let the world know, that he will neither ſwear himſelf, nor get any body elſe to ſwear for him to obtaine that which is duel to him; for if it be not thus, but he will ſeek his own as Miniſters ſeek their own, then he himſelf will be accounted one of thoſe <hi>Orthodox</hi> men among whom he is ſo loath to be numbred.</p>

                     <p>Now to apply this: In this nature we take Tithes, that is, as they ſerve to make up a fit maintenance, for the ſupport of the ſervants of Chriſt, in the ſervice of Chriſt for the people of Chriſt who partaking of ſpiritual things from us, ought in equity to miniſter carnal things to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15 27.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118630:33"/>
adjoyning and offering (only) ſome Arguments for this kinde of maintenance by laying out the Tenth, that being the thing that in theſe times is in ſo much queſtion.</p>
                     <p>I ſay therefore,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That this kinde and proportion of maintenance is to be <note place="margin">1.</note> reverenced, as having upon it a divine ſtamp, by being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God in the old Teſtament, without any repeal in the New. Nor is it reaſonable to reckon Tythes among Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and Ceremonial things, belonging to the Pedagogy of <hi>Moſes,</hi> conſidering that the Apoſtle gives this conſtruction of that Old-Teſtament-maintenance, that they who miniſtred holy things, who waited and ſerved at the Altar, were <hi>in that reſpect,</hi> partakers with it, and lived upon it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. 14. whence therefore he collects, that they who preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſhould live on the Goſpel. Now it is a Ceremonial thing or is a Moral thing, that a man that labours ſhould live of his labour? And into that the Apoſtle reſolves the <hi>Altar-maintenance</hi> in the Old Church.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Its a way of maintenance that hath been reverenced <note place="margin">2.</note> and approved in all Ages of the Church, for whence is it that Tythes have ſo long ſtood in the Churches of Chriſt, and under the Government of Chriſtian States? But becauſe wiſe and godly men, ſaw there was no other way ſo like to fulfil the minde of God, for a competent and a convenient main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as by ordering it to be laid out in that particular way of Tythes? I offer this as an Argument drawn from the judgment of diſcretion in the Chriſtian world Its true that in ſome Proteſtant Churches there hath been an alteration, but followed (as I have heard credibly reported) with lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the ſtraitneſſe, falling upon Miniſters by ſuch change of maintenance <note n="l" place="margin">
                           <hi>A ſad complaint of this was made by</hi> Pareus <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor in</hi> Hiedleberg <hi>to Dostor</hi> Twiſſe, <hi>when he was there with him, as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by D.</hi> Twiſſe <hi>himſelf to a friend of his</hi>
                        </note>.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I propound this way of maintenance as <hi>moſt rational,</hi> and that in divers reſpects,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>equal,</hi> and though reproacht as oppreſſive, yet cannot be proved ſo, nor poſſible be ſo, For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. People have nine parts and do but lay forth the Tenth, <note place="margin">1.</note> and is it hard when God gives men ten parts of the Fruites of the earth that they ſhould give him one again? But <note place="margin">1.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now man can be oppreſſed by laying that out to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <note place="margin">2.</note>

no further to depart from the Church of Rome, than in thoſe things wherein they had departed from Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall leave what I have written (which had it been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht by the Author himſelf would have been much more like himſelf) to the judgment of ſuch who have purpoſely ſtudied this ſubject, and to whom God hath given a larger light, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting my ſelf and reſuming that which I have already ſpoken, that is, that I reach not ſo high as to preſſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right of Tythes in a ſtrict ſenſe, but (keeping my ſelf to my own meaſure) that which I inſiſt upon is this: That whereas there is clearly a divine Right for maintenance in the generality, that general Law hath a ſpecial influence into this particular way of maintenance (I mean, by laying out the Tenth) inaſmuch as no other way is like to be found, in all reſpects ſo expedient, for the fulfilling of the will of God in the maintaining of thoſe that do the work of God as this is.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118630:36"/>
I leave it to conſideration therefore, whether it be not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially</hi> divine; for a maintenance is due by divine right; if ſo, then it is Gods minde alſo that it ſhould be made out one way or other, and if in ſome way then in the fitteſt way. I ſhall adde only that there are two great ordinances of God, the one of the Miniſtry, the other of their maintenance; for ſo hath the Lord <hi>ordained,</hi> that they which Preach of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſhould live of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. and there is much in the latter of theſe for the ſupporting of the former, I mean, in the ſupporting of the maintenance, for the ſupporting of the Miniſtry, which is eaſely confirmed, while it cannot but be obſerved, that they that plead againſt Tythes, do through the ſides and upon the account of Tythes, ſtrike at the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of <hi>England,</hi> and transferre the plea thither. The great eye-ſoare is not Tythes, but the Perſons concerned in the Tythes, that is, the Miniſtry. The Lord keep it in the thoughts of the hearts of our Governers to eſtabliſh the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and that maintenance by which the Miniſtry may be beſt eſtabliſht I ſhall conclude this with two Scriptures, 1. The old Prayer, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>Bleſſe Lord his ſubſtance, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the work of his hands.</hi> I am loath to write (but would have Quakers and Anti-miniſterial men to read) the reſt. 2.

                     <p>Now let us judge how juſt this charge of Hypocriſy is, and withall whether it may not be juſtly retorted upon him by whom it is publiſhed, who (if you look to the bottome of this Epiſtle) ſubſcribes himſelf <hi>a cordial lover of our ſoules,</hi> when he ſhewes himſelf by his bitter invectives, a cordial hater of our Miniſtry, in the exerciſe whereof <hi>we ſave our own ſoules, and the ſoules of thoſe that hear us.</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 16.
