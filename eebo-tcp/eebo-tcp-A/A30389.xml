            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following History being a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Your Royal Fathers Counsels and Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I hope for an easy Pardon of my Presumption in offering it to Your Majesty. Your Concern in a Work that relates so much to the King, Your Blessed Father, moved You to look on it, and read some parts of it; and after You had honoured it with a Character too advantageous for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, You were Graciously pleased to allow me Your Royal Licence, not only to Publish it, but to Address it to Your Self: and therefore I hope Your Majesty will favourably Accept this tribute of my Duty, which with an humble Devotion I lay down at Your Feet.</p>
            <p>My Zeal for Your Majesties Honour and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice engaged me first in this Work, and the same Passion which I derived from my Education, and still governs my Heart and Life, makes me now Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish it. For nothing does more clear the Prospect of what is before us, than a strict Review of what is past; which I have laboured to make with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Fidelity and Diligence. I know I shall not escape Censures, since few can bear a true and
<pb facs="tcp:65282:3"/>
free History; but as I have set down nothing for which I have not Authentick Vouchers, so I have observed Your Majesties <hi>Acts of Oblivion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity,</hi> as much as could consist with the Laws of History, and have avoided the naming of Persons upon Ingrateful Occasions. But no Precaution can secure one from severe Challenges that writes so near those Times, while many Persons concerned are yet alive: yet if Your Majesty continues to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour these <hi>Memoires</hi> with Your Royal Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I shall easily bear them.</p>
            <p>SIR, You have here a true Account of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Sufferings of two of Your Subjects, who dedicated themselves to Your Majesties Interests, and became Sacrifices for them. The Elder of these Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had not the honour of being known to Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, yet he lost his life in Your Reign. The Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er survived as long as he could serve Your Majesty: but when he saw his Life like to be unprofitable to Your Service, it became uneasy to himself, which made him so prodigal of it in Your own sight. And Your Majesty does his Memory the Honour of remembring him still with the highest expressions of Esteem and Acknowledgment which a King can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on a Subject.</p>
            <p>They had that Unblemished Loyalty conveyed to them from their Ancestors as the Entail of their Family, which has always payd an Uninterrupted Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the Crown, and they have transmitted it as an Inheritance to those who have succeeded them, who have already given great Demonstrations of most sincere and Loyal Duty to Your Majesty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65282:3"/>That God of his Infinite Mercy may preserve Your Majesty, and bless you with Wise Counsels, Obedient Subjects and Prosperous Undertakings, and after a long and happy Reign on Earth, may Crown You with an Incorruptible Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is the daily Devotion of,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Istories are of all Books the most universally read: the wiser find matter of great Speculation in them, and improve their Knowledg by the Experience these give them; and weaker Persons make them their Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and entertain Discourse with them. But most Writers of History have been men that lived out of business, who took many things upon trust, and have committed many and palpable Errours in matters of Fact, and either give no account at all of the secret Causes and Counsels of the greatest Transactions, or when they do venture upon it, it is all Romance, and the effect of their Imagination or Interest.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Authors of all the Histories that were written for near a thousand years together, being for the most part Monks, there is no great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to think they were either well informed, or ingenuous in what they deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Posterity, though there is perhaps no Nation that is more beholding to their Labours than <hi>England</hi> is.</p>
            <p>Of all men those who have been themselves engaged in Affairs, are the fittest to write History, as knowing best how matters were designed and carried on, and being best able to judge what things are of that Importance to be made Publick, and what were better suppressed. And therefore <hi>Caesars</hi> Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are the most Authentick, and most generally valued pieces of History; and in the next Form to these <hi>Philip de Comines, Guicciardine, Sleidan, Thuanus,</hi> and <hi>Davila,</hi> are the best received, and most read Histories, (only the last hath failed in some particulars:) for these men wrote of things in which they were considerable Actors, and had great Interest and good Information. Next to these, those that have had the perusal of the Cabinets of great Ministers, and of Publick Records, are the best qualified for giving the World a true Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Affairs. This makes the most celebrated History of the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> be received over all the World as a Pattern of History. <hi>Strada</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> are also highly valued upon the same account.</p>
            <p>But it has been commonly found, that Historians being generally of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and having Ends to serve, or being under the curb of procuring Licences, have accommodated their Relation to the tast of those they intended to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so have corrupted the Truth with the concealment of many things fit to be known; and to make amends for that, have added as many Sophistica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Colours to make the best things look ill, and to give some fair appearances to the worst things. And this has generally detracted so much from the value of History, that most people begin to neglect such Books, for they do not believe that they write Truth. And it is no wonder many are full of such prejudices at Ancienter Histories, for they reckon that men in all Ages were pretty near the same temper they find them to be of at this day, and there is such foul deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Histories of our own Time, and things that are so eminently false are positively asserted, that from thence many conclude all other Writings of that nature are likewise to be suspected: only Forgery and Impudence has not now
<pb facs="tcp:65282:5"/>
so much Art to conceal or disguise it with, as it had in former Ages, since most of our late Histories are written either in the style and strain of <hi>Panegyricks</hi> or <hi>Satyrs,</hi> which of all things an Historian that would be believed ought to avoid most carefully; for naturally all people are apt to suspect Interest or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, when they find much Flattery, or Passion in a History.</p>
            <p>Too much Art does but disgrace it, for though Father <hi>Paul</hi> has written his History of the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> in as flat and plain a style as was possible, and Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini</hi> has adorned his with all the Beauty of Art and Wit; yet there appears somewhat so native in the one, and so laboured in the other, that it does much prepossess the Reader with an inclination to believe the one, and disbelieve the other.</p>
            <p>A short and concise style, though it succeeded wonderfully with <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and not ill with <hi>Grotius;</hi> yet by the common Verdict of all men is judged not so proper for a History, which should open up things fully, so as to be easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by every Reader.</p>
            <p>These common failings of Historians have in this last Age made people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to see Papers; Records, and Letters published at their full length. <hi>Livy</hi> begun the making of Speeches in Councils, and at the heads of Armies, for States-men and Generals, and was much followed till within this Age, that these things became Vniversally distastful; and instead of that which was but the issue of the Writers brain, the World desires nothing so much as to see the Truth of things as they were really designed and acted, rather from some Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Papers, than from the Collections or Extracts of persons of whose Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity or Iudgment they are not well assured.</p>
            <p>Of all Nations in the world the <hi>French</hi> have delighted most in these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, so that the <hi>Memoires</hi> written in that Nation and Language since the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>,</hi> would almost make up a Library: and every year we get over new <hi>Memoires</hi> of some one Great Person or another. And though there are great Indiscretions committed in publishing many Secrets and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, not fit for Publick View; yet this way of Writing takes now more in the World than any sort of History ever did. There is but one in this Island that hath hitherto written in that Method, and his <hi>Collections</hi> are so well received that it gives great encouragement to any who will follow him in it.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is a much easier thing to write in this way than any other, for when a man undertakes a <hi>History,</hi> he ought to be well informed of all that passed on both sides, and is obliged to publish every thing that is of Importance for opening up the secretest Causes and Beginnings of great Changes or Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; this being the chief Instruction that men receive from History, by which they are most enabled to provide against, and prevent mischief for the future. But he that writes <hi>Memoires</hi> from a Collection of Papers that are in his hands, has no such ties on him, being only obliged to give a faithful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of such things as are in his Papers; and where these fail, he is at no loss, but may well pass over such Particulars as occur not to him.</p>
            <p>For the Lives of Great Persons, though it might have been expected that after the many excellent Patterns <hi>Plutarch</hi> had left the World, those should have been generally well written; yet there is no sort of History worse done, they being so full of gross Partiality and Flattery, and often swelled with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and impertinent things, so that it is no great wonder if this kind of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting be much decried and neglected.</p>
            <p>I had all these Considerations before me when I designed and drew this Work, and therefore will be more guilty if I transgress the Laws of Writing History without Partiality and Passion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65282:5"/>The late Civil Wars of this Island deserve a good and full History, as much as any Transaction in any part of the World. For it was a strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of thing to see a Prince, whose Title was unquestioned, and who had great Virtues and eminent Piety; and was of the same Religion with His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and had never put any of them unjustly to Death, so oppressed by a preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Faction; and that a Party which was not headed by any new Pretender, nor under the united Authority of any one Person, but on the contrary was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the very beginning into two great Factions, should become so successful, as to defeat Him in the Field, take all His Garrisons, imprison His Person, and in end put Him to Death openly, with a Form and shew of His Iustice, many thousands of His lamenting Subjects looking on; and that all this was done near so great and populous a City, which did universally pity His Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and abhor the Crime, and yet not so much as one Person made a Tumult to oppose it.</p>
            <p>The Rise and Progress of such a War is a thing which every one desires to be particularly informed about: for though many have published Relations of those times on both sides, yet there is scarce any body satisfied either with the Truth of Matters of Fact, or with their way of Writing. But the first beginning and rise of the Civil Wars having been in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whence they moved Southwards, there can be no clear Vnderstanding of what followed until these first Disorders be truly stated.</p>
            <p>This made me oft wish that some Moderate Pen were employed in giving a just and true Relation of the Reign of the late King. I was my self pretty early ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a great deal more of the Truth of these Affairs than is generally known, having had the blessing of my Father's Conversation for many years, who had been a very exact Observer of all that passed. He was also much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by men of all sides to write the History of those distempered Times, being esteemed a Person of great Moderation and Candour; who, as he had his breeding in the Law, so lived in great Friendship with the most eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of both Perswasions: for before the Troubles began he was accounted a Male-content, but he did afterwards give such signal demonstrations of his Loyalty, that he was put from his Employment, and made to take a voluntary Exile on him, which was granted him as a great Favour by the Covenanters, who generally had much kindness for him, for all his being so contrary to their way. And <hi>Warriston,</hi> his Brother-in-Law, in whose hands were all the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Papers of the Covenanters side, offered them to him for his Assistance, if he would undertake it; but he was over-grown with Age and Infirmities, and so could not set about so difficult a Work. But I received from him such Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, as made me look on most of the Writers of those Times with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who were either utterly ignorant, or so basely partial, that Matters of Fact are falsly represented, and the whole Counsels and Secret Contrivances either quite passed over, or so palliated that there is very little truth in the Relations they have made.</p>
            <p>And particularly, I wondred to find <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the World, with such foul and base Characters, as if he had been a Monster both for Ingratitude and Treachery, though he had laid down his Life for the King, and involved his Estate in vast Debts for His Service. It seemed to me the greatest Injustice in the World, that one who served his Prince and his Country so long, and so faithfully, and sealed all with his Blood, should not only be deprived of the Honour due to his Memory, but that a company of ignorant and impudent Slanderers should do what they could to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint
<pb facs="tcp:65282:6"/>
his Blood and Family, by the black Imputations they have cast on him, and that this should pass current without any Vindication.</p>
            <p>This made me resolve, if ever I could meet with such Instructions as might direct me well to write an account of the late Troubles, and in particular to give a true and clear Relation of that Duke's Concerns, to set about it. I knew well the Temper of those who were most severe in their Censures on him, to be a violent and hot-headed sort of People, who were for nothing but Fire and Sword, and yet knew not how to do much more than to drink and swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and therefore, as I was naturally inclined to disregard their Blusterings, so I was apt to think his Counsels must have been moderate for tempering the eagerness of other mens Passions, which did enrage them so much against him; so that they having dispersed many false Stories of him, these were easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by our Scribling Historians, and have been made use of to poyson the Truth of the History.</p>
            <p>It is such a natural and constant effect of Passion to carry men to Extreams, that it is no wonder if those who had more temper and fore-sight, and studied to heal the Breaches, and followed more moderate Counsels, were hated on both sides; for in all times the Moderate Party is the weakest, and has most obloquie cast on it from all hands.</p>
            <p>I also thought that I could not do a greater Service to my Country, than to enquire into the whole Course of the late Civil Wars. And I knew there were none so eminently Employed as the two Dukes of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the one having been the Kings <hi>High-Commissioner</hi> in the beginning of them, and the other the <hi>Secretary of State</hi> in the sequel of them: therefore it was certain, that if their Papers had not been destroyed in the common fate of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I could not find a clearer thread to direct me than from them.</p>
            <p>I shall not deny that I had many pre-engagements on me to have a high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of that Family, both from the Great Worth of those who now represent it, and from the Vnblemished Fidelity their Ancestours have always payed the Crown, and their constant Affection to their Country; so that since the first Greatness of it in King <hi>James</hi> the third his days, who gave his Sister in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> they were never in any Rebellion against their King, nor did they ever abuse their Prince's Favour to be a Grievance to their Country.</p>
            <p>And though they stood next the Crown for fifty years together, from the year <hi>1543,</hi> that King <hi>James</hi> the fifth died, till the year <hi>1593</hi> that Prince <hi>Henry</hi> was born, during all which time there was none but Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> of the Royal Blood: yet all that while their Deportment shewed, that they had no other design but to serve those Princes with all possible Fidelity and Zeal. And though <hi>Scotland</hi> was then much distracted with Intestine Broyls and Disorders, yet they never set themselves at the head of any Faction, nor departed from the Interests of the Crown.</p>
            <p>When King <hi>James</hi> the fifth died, he left his only Daughter Queen <hi>Mary</hi> but a few days old, and the Government of <hi>Scotland</hi> fell by Right to the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> being her nearest Kinsman; and if such an Ambition, as the Enemies of that Family have pretended was hereditary to it, had been lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, he would never have let such an Opportunity of raising himself slip out of his hands. But he was a Person of great Iustice and Candour, and set nothing before his eyes but the Publick Good: so that Archbishop <hi>Spotswood</hi> tells of him in his History, <hi>that in his Court there was nothing seen that the severest eye could censure or reprove. In the Publick Government
<pb facs="tcp:65282:6"/>
such a Moderation was kept, as no man was heard to complain: the Governour was reverently obeyed, and held in as great respect as any King's of preceding Times.</hi> It is true, he was of too easie a nature, and his base Brother, who was afterwards Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> had great power over him, which did much prejudice his Reputation.</p>
            <p>In the disposing of the Queen in Marriage, he had much to have said for himself, if he had married Her to his own Son, who was but a few years old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Queen: but he shewed, he designed Her Greatness more than his own, and perhaps more than the true Interest of his Country, for I am far from thinking that he carried himself wisely in that, when he consented to send Her to the Dolphin of <hi>France,</hi> afterwards <hi>Francis</hi> the second: in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of which, he was made Duke of <hi>Castle-herald</hi> (or as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the <hi>French, Chastle-herault)</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>After the Death of <hi>Francis</hi> the second, when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Castle-herald</hi> had again great advantages, if any such desire of Power had governed him: for the Reformation had then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and he and all his Family, except his youngest Son, Lord <hi>Claud</hi> (from whom descended the Earls of <hi>Abercorn)</hi> were Protestants; so that to have put himself at the head of that, was the likeliest way to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced his own Designs: but it appeared that he and his Sons embraced the Religion, not for Faction but out of Conscience, for he continued true and faithful to the Queen to the last; of which She was so sensible, that (beside many Publick Testimonies of Her confidence in them, such as the naming the Duke of <hi>Castle-herald</hi> her <hi>Adopted Father,</hi> and calling him still by that Name, and the referring Her whole Concerns, when She was a Prisoner in <hi>England,</hi> to his Care) when that severe and unparalelled sentence of Death was to be executed on Her, She took a Ring off Her finger, and gave it to one of Her Servants, and ordered him to carry it to Her Cousin, Lord <hi>John Hamilton,</hi> who then represented his Father that was dead, (his elder Brother being sick of a Frenzy) and tell him, that that was all She then had to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness her great sense of his and his Families constant Fidelity to Her, and of their suffering for Her Interests; and desired that it might be still kept in the Family, as a lasting Evidence of Her kindness to it, which is preserved to this day.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>MY LORD, if my constant Trust had not been in you of your great Love towards me, I had not thus employed you upon such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; therefore I assure my self you will not frustrate my Expectation.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:65282:7"/>He also called him to Christen one of his Children, and continued to the last to put great Confidence in him.

And when that old Lord was dying, as he was giving his Blessing to his Son, and reckoning up the most signal Favours of God to him, he named three more particularly. <q>The first was, That du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all his Troubles, and notwithstanding the great Offers were made him in <hi>France</hi> by the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> if he would change his Religion; yet God had never left him to do so base a thing, though he lost his Interest in that Court by refusing it. The other was, that he had never oppressed any of his Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals and Tenants. And the third was, that he had never entertained one thought contrary to the Duty he owed the Crown, and that no hard Vsage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>All this I thought needful to be said for the Honour of that Family, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Buchanan</hi> studied with much Art and Industry to cast an eternal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace upon it. For as he from being a great Flatterer of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> (which may be seen in his Dedication of his Incomparable Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> to Her) became Her mortal Enemy, and partly by Lies, partly by his cruel aggravating of some unjustifiable things, has written the History of Her Reign with so much Malice, that his Work stands condemned as a base Libel, by an Act of Parliament in <hi>Scotland:</hi> so being provoked by an Injury which a Servant of the Duke of <hi>Castle-herald</hi>'s youngest Son did him, of which he thought he got not sufficient Reparation, and carrying a spite to them because they adhered to the Queen's Interests, he wrote of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily with the most impudent and virulent Malice that was possible. And his admirable stile of Latine, in which he is inferiour to none that wrote since the days of <hi>Augustus,</hi> has made all Forreigners take their Informations wholly from him; and the Collectors of the General History of that Age, do for the most part draw all the Account they give of <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs out of him; by which that Family hath suffered much in the opinions of Forreign Nations: so dangerous it is to provoke one that has much Malice, and can write <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But that Writer contradicts himself so often in what he says of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that small regard is to be had to it. And <hi>Lesly</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> Privy-Counsellour to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who wrote the History of that time, and bore no great good will to the Duke of <hi>Castle-herald</hi> and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for being such Promoters of the Reformation, speaks always of them with a great deal of Honour and Iustice.</p>
            <p>For the Father of those Dukes, he was, as Archbishop <hi>Spotswood</hi> truly calls him, <hi>a Nobleman of rare gifts, and fitted for the greatest Affairs,</hi> and was most Vniversally beloved by all his Countrymen: he was a very Graceful and Gallant Person, and of a most agreeable Conversation, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t him to Court, where he made a great Figure the rest of his Life.</p>
            <p>All these things concurred to make me very desirous to see whether the late Dukes had continued in those steps their Progenitors went in, or had departed from them; therefore I told the Duke and Dutchess of <hi>Hamilton</hi> that now are, that if I might have the favour and trust of perusing such Papers as remained in their hands, I should do my endeavours to make the best use of them I could, upon which they were pleased to send them all to me. The Collection was great, and in as great disorder; yet by a little care I brought them into some Order, and found I had very authentical and full Materials for a greater Work than I had at first designed: but having read many scandalous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, that had charged these Dukes in divers particulars with an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Injustice and Malice, I found it necessary to enquire, as far as their Papers could carry me, into the Truth of these Reports, which forced me to be more particular than had been otherwise needful. And yet I hope the Reader shall have no great cause to complain of my tediousness, but that he shall find an Entertainment through the whole Work that shall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant to him.</p>
            <p>I have opened the Intrigues and Counsels of those Times as clearly as I could. This, some that perused the Work have censured much, as a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closing the Secrets of Government; and because in some places errours of Government are neither concealed nor pallia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, some advised me to pass these over, and not insist on them: but with this I could-by no means comply, for I know no good that History does the World so much as the making Posterity the wiser, both by shewing the Faults of Ministers that raised the Discontents, and the Follies and Madness of those who put all in confusion to get Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces redressed. For the Iealousies that were conceived, either from the ill opinion of Ministers, or the consciousness of their own Guilt, made the Fomenters of those Troubles think, that neither Concessions nor Pardons were a sufficient Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but that assoon as the Country and Government was settled, what they had done would be remembred and punished, and did drive the Faction much further than it seems they intended at first.</p>
            <p>All this I wrote with the more Assurance, after I had presumed to tell His Majesty, that since I was writing of the late Times, I sound it necessary to set down some Errours, that were committed even by some of the Ministers of the King, his Blessed Father, and I could give no true account of matters if these were not likewise related: upon which His Majesty most graciously told me, <hi>That such things were unavoidable in a History;</hi> and therefore He allowed me <hi>to tell the Truth freely.</hi>

               </gap> so gracious a Permission, I was the more emboldened to lay open things clearly, and to trace the Troubles of <hi>Scotland</hi> to their first Beginnings. It is true, there were some things that had much influence on Peoples Minds, of which I have given no Account, having found no Papers in this Collection to direct me in them: and these were the whole Progress of the Design for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Resumption of the Tithes into the Crown, and the restoring them to the Church, with all the steps that were made in it; which was so nice a point, and had so much of the subtilties of Law in it, that I did not think fit to meddle with it, especially it not lying before me in these Papers, nor having any Relation to the Concerns of these two Brothers. The other was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in Parliament <hi>Anno 1633,</hi> when His late Majesty was Crowned, with the Petition that was afterwards drawn, for which the Lord <hi>Balmerino</hi> was tried, and found Guilty, and had Sentence of Death passed on him. Then
<pb facs="tcp:65282:8"/>
did the Party begin to be more united, and secret Engagements were given either to rescue him by Force, or to revenge his Death, upon which the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> procured a Pardon for him; but from that time the date of the Confederacy of that Party is to be reckoned, and though it lay quiet for some years, yet it was still fermenting, which made it burst forth upon the <hi>Crisis</hi> that afterwards appeared. They were also much encouraged to all that followed, by the Informations they had of the Malecontents in <hi>England;</hi> for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Quality of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, who was afterwards a great Parliament-man, went, and lived some time in <hi>Scotland</hi> before the Troubles broke out, and represented to the men that had then greatest Interest there, that the business of the Ship-mony and the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> with divers other things, of which there was much noise made afterwards, had so irritated the greatest part of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, that if they made sure work at home, they needed fear nothing from <hi>England.</hi> And of this the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who had lived so many years in <hi>England,</hi> could not be ignorant: for so great a disease in the Body Politick, as a Civil War, does not break out on a sudden, but there go before it many Symptomes, which are well discerned by men of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Fore-sight; the matter must be brought to the nature of Tinder or Gun-powder, before a Spark can set it on Fire. And it was the Prospect he had of what was like to follow in <hi>England</hi> if once a War begun, that made him employ all his Endeavours to carry the King to as full Concessions as he could possibly obtain. This, to such as do not reflect on the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at that time, may perhaps appear mean, or Malice may give it a worse Character. But as no sort of provocation will justifie any man, though of the clearest Courage, that will go and fight with a Sword loose in the hilt, but he must be concluded rash and inconsiderate; so the Duke knowing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted condition of <hi>England,</hi> and apprehending that by all appearance the War would be unsuccessful, and that the Demands of the Faction would then grow higher, did as became a Wise and Faithful Minister, in trying all the ways he could think of to settle Matters before there should be any Breach; since the keeping the Kingdom in quiet, though upon terms which had been hard to the King, and derogatory to His Authority, was much to be preferred to a War that was like to prove fatal to the King and Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>For all that while the Affection of the <hi>English</hi> to the Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> did discover it self in many high Expressions, which others could not but see, and the King sadly, but too late, felt afterwards; for Princes most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see such things last of all their People, their pretending Flatterers, who are in truth their greatest Enemies, keeping up such Advertisements from them as long as can be, as if one out of fear to awaken his Master, should let him sleep when his House is on fire, till it were scarce possible for him either to quench, or escape the Flames. All these things concurred to set on the hot Zealots, to begin the Troubles that ended so tragically in the Murder of the King, and Slavery of the Nations.</p>
            <p>And therefore nothing seems more needful in our present circumstances, than to represent those things truly, That Ministers on the one hand, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ill effects that followed on a stretched Prerogative, and the People on the other hand apprehending the dismal consequences of Tumults, Iealousies, and Civil War, there may be such an Vniversal Harmony between the King and his Subjects, as may rejoyce all good men, and disappoint and confound all the Enemies of our Peace and Happiness.</p>
            <p>But all those things not being yet so fully clear to me, and not lying in the Papers that were in my hands, I have given no account of them in
<pb facs="tcp:65282:8"/>

Nor have I written any thing of the Affairs of <hi>England,</hi> further than was necessary by their Relation to, and Intermixture with those of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and though there are very considerable Papers in that Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that were sent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> both from the Committee of both Kingdoms, and from some Eminent men of both Houses; yet there is not a continued thread in them, and therefore I have published none of them. Nor have I drawn down my Relation farther than <hi>Worcester</hi>-Fight, where the younger of these Brothers lost his Life: for though I have been much pressed to write a full History of <hi>Scotland</hi> from K. <hi>James</hi> his Death, where the most Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dr. <hi>Spotswood</hi> ended his so much, and so justly valued History, and to bring it down to the present Time; yet I will see how the World is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with what I now publish, before I give my self and others more trouble of this sort.</p>
            <p>At first I wrote this Work Historically, and only drew the most materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al heads and passages out of the Papers that lay before me: but that Noble and Iudicious Gentleman, Sir <hi>Robert Murray,</hi> to whose Memory I owe the most Grateful Acknowledgments that can be payed by a Person infinitely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him, and that did highly value his extraordinary Parts, and rare Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, gave me such reasons to change the whole Work, and to insert most of the Papers at their full length, that prevailed on me to do it; and when it was written over again, as I now offer it to the World, he was so much pleased with it, that though I know the setting down his words would add a great value to it among all that knew him, yet they are so high in the Commendation of it, that I cannot but conceal them. Some have wondered to find sewer of the Duke's Letters here than of other Persons; but the truth is, these are so full, and so particular, in the Advices and Advertisements he wrote to the King, that it was by no means thought fit to publish too many of them, though the Originals of them are yet extant, being written on the back by the King's hand.</p>
            <p>The Vouchers of this whole Work lie at <hi>Hamilton,</hi> where Curious Persons may both be satisfied about the truth of what is now published, and about many other very important things, from which I drew these MEMOIRES: only in a few particulars, for supplying some defects, I was forced to seek Informations from Persons of great Honour and Worth.</p>
            <p>My writing from such Vouchers was the cause, that sometimes the angry Language I found in Letters did slip into my pen. I know there is nothing that does more misbecome an Historian than to mix Passion with the Account he gives; and so I studied to cleanse this Work from it all I could, and read it over once or twice to throw out all those angry words which I had mixed in it carelesly, having among other things Copied them from the Letters that were in my hands. But upon a further Review, I find that some of these Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do still remain, for which I am very sorry; but I can assure the Reader, I had no design to leave needless Imputations on any Persons, for I took great care to write with all possible Respect and Caution, even of those who were the greatest Enemies that both these Dukes had: and those that know the present circumstances of that Family, and of the Writer himself, will find that no Resentments for any hard Vsage they have met with, has biassed him from what becomes an honest Man, and a faithful Historian.</p>
            <p>I thought it unworthy of my pains to set down and confute those base and malicious Calumnies, which fill many Books that pass for the Histories of the late Times. The Truth of this Work is a fuller Confutation than any other could
<pb facs="tcp:65282:9"/>
be. These Writings indeed made me examine all the Duke's Papers more carefully, particularly the Copies of their Letters to their nearest and most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured Friends, with the Letters they received from them: most of these were written in C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pher, and the decyphering of them was no small trouble; yet I resolved to spare no pains that might give me a full satisfaction about their most secret Correspondencies. But after all that search, I was still more and more confirmed of the great Integrity of their Professions, and of their constant Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the Crown.</p>
            <p>I publish these MEMOIRES with the more confidence, because they having been seen and perused by divers of the most Considerable and most Intelligent Persons of both Kingdoms, either they went very far with their Civility and Complement, or were well satisfied with them.</p>
            <p>I shall enlarge this Preface no further, but desire that all the faults in the Style, or way of Writing, may be charged only on my self, and may leave no Imputation on those Worthy Persons whose Actions I relate, nor on those w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o now represent them, since they deserved a far better Pen to be employed in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their History. All that is good in this Work is only from them, and all that is evil in it must fall entirely to my share, and I alone must bear it. They have suffered too much already from the Malice of their Enemies, it will therefore be very unjust to make them suffer more for the Indiscretion or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of an ill Writer. I shall not stand longer on laboured and formal Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, which are more used to shew the Wit of the Writer, in making them gracefully, than from any humble opinion they have of their own Performances who make them. If I have not done this to the best advantage, it is because I could do it no better; for the Importance of these Transactions, the Merit of the Persons, and the great Honour I pay the Family, and the Duke and Dutchess of <hi>Hamilton</hi> that now are, made me judge it very well worth all the Application and Industry I could bestow upon it.</p>

            </head>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">J</seg>AMES</hi> Marquis of <hi>Hamilton</hi> died at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> 1625.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1625.</note> and was succeeded in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Fortune by his Eldest Son and Heir <hi>Iames,</hi> afterwards created Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Marquis succeeded his Father.</note> whom his Father had brought with him to <hi>England</hi> some years before, and was then in the Eighteenth year of his Age, and sent to prosecute his Studies at <hi>Oxford</hi>; from whence he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to see his Father die, and came in time to receive his last advices and blessings. Thus died that Great and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Person in the flower and vigour of his Age, being then but 36 years old.</p>
            <p>He was in great Esteem in both Kingdomes,<note place="margin">His Fathers Character<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> equally dear to the Soveraign and the Subjects; and it was certain no person could have disputed with him the Kings Affection and Confidence, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> onely excepted. His serving as Commissioner for the King in the Parliament 1621. had much lessened his Interest in <hi>Scotland</hi>; for these five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> (where the Assembly of the Church that set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled them was held) commonly called the <hi>Five Articles,</hi> were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so odious, that his carrying the Settlement of these in Parliament drew much dislike from all that Party, which was then called <hi>Puritan:</hi> but his carriage in that Parliament, gained him as much trust and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the King as ever man had. The King created him Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> a Title that was never conferred on any, but such as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65282:11"/>
were of the Royal Blood; he made him also Knight of the Garter, and Lord-Steward of the Houshold. King <hi>Iames</hi> was likewise glad to see his Friendship for my Lord Marquis and his Family like to prove Hereditary, by the kindness he saw growing up with the Prince for his Son; in whose youth there was an agreeable Sweetness, which gained an early room in the Princes Affections, and took so deep rooting there, that nothing was ever able to deface it: and as he had the Honour to be the Princes nearest Kinsman by the Royal Blood of <hi>Scotland,</hi> so he spent several of his younger and more innocent years in his company; and when the Prince was in <hi>Spain,</hi> he made one of that honourable Train that went to wait on his Highness.</p>
            <p>But since the following Narration is to be filled with great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Transactions, wherein this Marquis was so eminently engaged, I shall dismiss such Particulars as were of less concernment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at one step shall leap over the whole tract of his Youth; neither shall I interrupt my Narration of Publick Matters with Accounts of his Personal and Domestick Affairs, which shall be referred to one place, in which, as I give his Character, such of those as are fit to be made publick shall be mentioned: neither will I here offer any further Account of his Father, but what shall be the matter of the whole fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing History, which is, that he was the Father of two such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sons.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> as he received the tidings of his Death with much grief,<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> his Death.</note> so he Prophetically apprehended, that as the Branches were now cut down the Root would quickly follow; for the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> died about the same time likewise. This Marquis his Death was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an universal regrate, and I sind divers of the English Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in their Letters to his Son, expressing their Affection and Esteem for the Father, in terms beyond the cajolery of Civility or Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The loss of so great and such a tenderly affectionate Father, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sweet Disposition and dutiful Love of the Son, could not but prove very afflicting to him: but this private Grief was followed by a publick Calamity, brought upon these Kingdoms by the Death of King <hi>Iames,</hi> on whose Character I shall not adventure, since it is without the lines of my Work.</p>
            <p>The Marquis sent down his Fathers Corps to <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Marquis leaves the Court.</note> where it was nobly interred in the Burial-Place of that Family; but could not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it himself, being obliged to wait and assist at the Coronation of King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, which shortly followed, where he carried the Sword of State before the King; and he found the Crown had rather heightned than lessened the new Kings Affection for him. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little he resolved to return to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to look to his own Affairs, which were in great disorder by his Fathers magnificent Nobleness, who notwithstanding his being Lord Steward, and the benefit of other Places he enjoyed, had far outrun himself at Court. But indeed his Son had too much of his own Temper, and was too Generous to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Frugal. During his absence from Court, his Majesties Affection for him appeared not only in his ready granting of every thing was moved for his advantage, but in the kind Letters which upon different occasions he wrote to him with his own Hand, (not to mention the many publick ones he got upon all occasions.) In one of them the King writes:</p>

            <p>The Earl of <hi>Denbigh</hi> brought also with him from his Majesty the offer of the Master of the Horse his place,<note place="margin">He goes to Court, and is made Master of the Horse.</note> which was fallen by the murther of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> This earnest and noble Message, brought and enforced by such a Bearer, could be no longer refused; therefore in the end of the year he went to Court, where he was presently made Master of the Horse, and Gentleman of the Kings Bed-chamber, and Privy Counsellour in both Kingdomes: and the King used him with so much tender kindness, that his carriage to him spoke more of the affection of a Friend than of the power of a Master; he called him always <hi>Iames,</hi> both when he spoke to him and of him,<note place="margin">His usage at Court,</note> as an expression of his familiarity with him; and it was presently observed by all, that none had more of the Kings heart than he pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>essed. But as high favour with a Prince is ever attended with envy and jealousie;<note place="margin">and behaviour there.</note> so he missed not his share of it, from those who were looking on him as the rising Favourite; though as he bore that Character worthily, he managed it prudently, for he neither studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to engross things to himself nor his kindred: he grew not inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent upon favour, nor impatient of Competitours; neither did he obtrude himself upon the management of particular Affairs, but did rest satisfied with the Royal marks of his Masters favour, which upon all occasions were poured on him liberally.</p>
            <p>The great Design which at this time possest the King wholly, was about the affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Affairs of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </note> and the recovery of the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> with the rescue of his Sister and her Posterity, from the ruine which was not only hanging over them, but had already overwhelmed them.</p>
            <p>I need not here resume the too-well-known occasions of these Troubles, nor tell how the Wars of <hi>Boheme</hi> first began, nor how the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> being chosen their King, did by accepting that Crown involve himself and all <hi>Germany</hi> in a tract of the most lasting and bloody Wars that have been heard of. The new-elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King was scarce well-settled on his Throne, when it was not only

shaken but overturned; and the Emperour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1629.</note> with the assistance of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who was thirsting after his Cousins Dignities and Dominions, was not content with the recovery of his own Dominions, but carried his conquering Eagles into the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi>; which not being able to resist so powerful an Invasion, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under his obedience, and the Electoral Dignity was by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour afterwards translated to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> was very much displeased with his Son-in-law for engaging in the affair of <hi>Boheme,</hi> but could not be unconcerned when he saw the ruine of his Family following upon it; yet his inclinations to Peace overruled his other resentments, and his hopes to prevail by Treaties made him still delay entring into Action; for at that time the Treaty of the match with <hi>Spain</hi> was on foot, and the King was abused by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and made believe the <hi>Palatinat</hi> should be again restored: but his slowness in that missed not the severe censures of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> left his Crowns and Designs to his Son, who judged himself bound by all Ties divine and humane, to see to the recovery of the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> and the stopping of the Imperial success, which by a great Torrent of victories was become formidable, and burthensome to all the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi>; yet the opposition the King met in some Parliaments, which were dissolved soon after their meeting made his Designs go on slowly. But to ravel no further into matters without the lines of this Narration,</p>
            <p>The Marquis was no sooner at Court, but the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> recommended the care of her Affairs to him,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends the care of her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to the Marquis.</note> as the person (being her nearest kinsman and best known to her) in whom of all that were about her Brother she confided most; and as during the King her Fathers life she had employed none so much as his Father, so she did entail that trust upon the Son: and indeed in all her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to him (hundreds of which remain) she continued such expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions of genuine and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rank kindness, as shew, she never thought she had misplaced her trust.</p>
            <p>At this time the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> being provoked with a desire of glory,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> invites the King to his assistance.</note> and led on by the aspirings of a great and generous mind, resolved to adventure on that which had been fatal to all who had attempted it, and to oppose the Emperours designs, declaring, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions were to deliver <hi>Germany</hi> from the yoke of Tyranny, which was beginning to be twisted about their Necks; but fearing his own strength was not able to compass so great a design, much of his confidence was grounded on the assistance he expected from the King. Therefore as by his own Ambassadour the Lord <hi>Spence</hi> he solicited his aid, so he employed the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to interpose with his Majesty for his assistance in the prosecution of that great Affair; who pressed it with much earnestness by his Agent <hi>Curtius,</hi> representing, that now or never was the time that it should appear to the World, what effects he might look for from his Alliance: and the King was resolved in good earnest to advance that design, but judged it not fit for himself to own it in his own name at first, for some reasons of State; a chief one being, that his Ambassadour in <hi>Germany,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Anstrother,</hi> was entertained at that time with some hopes of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> though that was judged to be without any other intentions but to cajole the King, and so keep him from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65282:13"/>
in the <hi>Swedish</hi> designs. His Majesty finding it not convenient to appear in it himself, resolved it should pass for the voluntary assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his Subjects, to which he should only give way, and made choice of the Marquis for the person in whom he had the greatest confidence of his zealous pursuing his designs upon the <hi>Palatinat.</hi>
               <note place="margin">who appoints the Marquis to enter in Treaty with that King.</note> Whether this motion came originally from the King or not, I do not see, or if it was the desire of the King or Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which seems more probable; for the <hi>Swedish</hi> Ambassadour did first move it, and pressed it with much earnestness: others suggest that it came from some of the Marquis his enemies, who envying and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting his rising greatness, and seeing no possibility of lessening his interest in the Kings affection that was daily growing, judged this honourable Proposition would once set him a good way from the Court. There was too much of honour in this Proposition to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Marquis, and his age being at that time pronest to a thirst of glory, he could not but be hearty in the undertaking, though the ruine of all, who had hitherto imbarked in that Design, gave but small encouragement to any who should engage in it; yet the great renown of the <hi>Swedish</hi> King, together with the fears into which all the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were now driven, which rendred them almost desperate, made the Attempt look more promising than formerly: but the Marquis his duty to his Master, and his affection to all his interests, chiefly those of his only Sister, made him with alacrity accept that Employment. One thing was certain, that which way soever the first Proposition of this was made, it came not from himself; for if the King had known or suspected it to have flow'd from him, it would have appeared afterwards when the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to be related were under examination, or when the Marquis was a prisoner: but no such thing ever dropt from his Majesty.</p>
            <p>In the end of the year 1629. the Marquis according to the Kings Orders sent Colonel <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Marquis sends Col. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> to treat,</note> brother to the Earl of <hi>Hadington,</hi> to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> with a general offer of his service, and his resolution to come in person with a considerable force, to joyn with him in his noble enterprize for the Liberty of <hi>Germany.</hi> This had a very kind recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for at that time the valour of the <hi>Scots</hi> was so great, and that Kings value of them so high, that he welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Proposition with a sincere heartiness; and as he wrote a very kind Answer to the Marquis, (which with many others of his Letters is yet preserved;) so he sent him a Commission to be General of what Army he should raise for his assistance.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Marquis sent one <hi>David Ramsay</hi> a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber,<note place="margin">and after him <hi>David Ramsay.</hi>
               </note> to agree the Conditions upon which he should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark in the <hi>Swedish</hi> design. This <hi>Ramsay</hi> was one in whom he had no interest at all, neither can any account be given what he was, save that there is a Letter from the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> in my hands, wherein he recommends him to the King as one who had served him faithfully in <hi>Germany</hi>; he therefore as being acquainted with the <hi>German</hi> language and affairs, and zealous for the King of <hi>Bohemia's</hi> service, was made choice of for this Negotiation: but for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis to have made this man, who could be no longer known to him than since he came last to Court, a Confident in so great and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate a resolution, as was afterwards fastned on this Employment, it

To all and sundry whom it concerns, make it known and certain, That whereas the Illustrious and Our sincerely beloved Lord <hi>James</hi> Marquis of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Master of the Horse to the most Serene King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> out of his zeal for the publick good; and for acquiring eternal fame, hath resolved to dedicate himself and the fortunes and forces of all he is concerned in, for restoring Our oppressed Friends in <hi>Germany,</hi> and for that end hath offered to Vs by the Illustrious and Our sincerely faithful Colonel, <hi>Alexander Hamilton,</hi> his fidelity and service, and that he will on his own expence gather a strength of six thousand men, and bring them over, as soon as may be, to any place We shall appoint, either against the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> or any other of Our Enemies, and maintain them on his own charge, and do Vs all faithful and vigorous service with them, till this great Affair be brought to a good issue, provided We shall authorize this his design with Our protection, and give him the underwritten Assistance; Therefore, there being nothing dearer to Vs, than to make all vigorous resistance to the common enemies of Liberty, and having in high estimation the brave under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of generous men, We not onely would not reject, but have heartily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the nobleness of so good Resolutions: We have therefore admitted, like-as by the vigour of these presents We admit, the said Lord Marquis into Our service, Armies and Military Counsels, on the following Conditions.</p>
                        <p>First, when ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e shall signifie to Vs, that he is ready to bring over his Forces, We shall assign him a place for his landing, either to come and joyn with Our Armies, or to make an impression elsewhere, as We shall think fit.</p>
                        <p>Next, if We appoint him to land in any place from whence he shall not come streight to Vs, We shall for strengthening his Forces, send to the place We shall assign for his landing four thousand Foot out of Our Armies, whom We shall furnish with all necessaries, and maintain on Our charges a whole year.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, because the said Marquis thinks two thousand Horse are necessary for his Foot, for whose levy and pay he promises all assistance; We shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think of all ways and means for raising and maintaining these.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, We not onely give the said Illustrious Marquis the absolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of this Army in our absence, but shall also joyn to him a Counsellour with whom he may consult in all things, that so his Deliberations be more expedite and clear.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>Sixthly, that the Marquis may more effectually perform what he hath brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolved, and may sooner make those warlike Instruments of his own inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65282:14"/>
on which he relies much in his Expedition,<note place="margin">

                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>Eighthly, when-ever the Marquis shall advertise Vs of his needing Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, We shall assign him Bills of Exchange in <hi>Holland</hi> for buying seventy two Ship-pounds of Gunpowder.</p>
                        <p>Ninthly, if any other Kings or States shall concur with Vs, all they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute shall be at Our disposal; but if the Marquis his necessities require further assistance, We shall not abandon him, but faithfully assist him, as much as Our Affairs shall permit.</p>
                        <p>Tenthly, for all which the said Illustrious Lord Marquis with all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hath promised Fidelity to Vs, and shall be bound to it as well as Our men, and these who receive Our Pay, are, for which both he and all his Captains shall be particularly engaged.</p>
                        <p>But because there is to be a Treaty betwixt Our Commissioners and the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists</hi> at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> therefore if a Peace shall be there concluded, so that We shall not need the Service of the Marquis and his Army, he hath obliged himself to pay for the foresaid Materials at their entire value.</p>
                        <p>All which things being thus concluded, and to be firmly observed by Vs, We have subscribed these Articles with Our Hand, and commanded Our Royal Seal to be put to them.</p>

                        <p>To the first, if the most Serene King assign me a place for landing, I vow and promise by the grace of God to doe it, betwixt and the day of the next <hi>June.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To the second, if the most Serene King of <hi>Sweden</hi> send me the agreed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Souldiers out of his Own Forces, at the place and time appointed, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that by furnishing them with all necessaries, a full and entire Pay without any deductions be laid down for a whole year, according to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of His Majesty with his Own Officers.</p>
                        <p>Besides, if the most Serene King cannot allow of so great a diminution of His Forces, it will be necessary that He not only settle a Fond, for such a summe as may levy, arm, and pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as many Souldiers, but there will be need of some more; for the odds will be vastly great betwixt His Majesty's trained Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and a sudden Levy of raw Novices.</p>
                        <p>To the third, since the Article of the Horse is conceived in general terms, on both sides, nothing being certainly fixed on either, it will be expedient that Your Sacred Majesty declare Your mind in it plainly, how far You oblige Your self: and what shall be agreed for me, betwixt Your Majesty and these to whom this Affair is trusted by me, I bind my self to ratifie.</p>
                        <p>To the fifth, since the reasons of my Expedition to <hi>Germany</hi> are the same with Your Majesties, I have firmly resolved to help and relieve the oppressed Princes and States of <hi>Germany,</hi> with the ease of all these burdens with which they are now pressed, and therefore shall do every thing in order, and decently, as becomes most friendly Auxiliaries; and if any thing be taken by me from the common Enemy, I shall desire nothing more than that the right of it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and inviolably Your Majesties.</p>
                        <p>To the ninth, since I have devoted my whole fortune with all my interests for promoting this our Design, I promise that whatever any shall contribute for it, shall all be laid out for this War, which I shall with my whole Forces manage and carry on, till either it please God that You obtain a desired Peace, or that the Liberty of <hi>Germany,</hi> which is now oppressed, be restored.</p>

               <hi>Ramsay</hi> had in Commission to deal with any <hi>Scotish</hi> or <hi>English</hi> Officers who served beyond Sea, to come and serve under the Marquis; and finding <hi>Mackay</hi> the Lord <hi>Reay</hi> in good reputation,<note place="margin">

               </note> he dealt with him to engage in his Service, who cordially undertook it, and some moneths after that wrote to the Marquis, (which Letter is preserved:) That though the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had given him the Command of three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and made him Captain of his Guards; yet he was so desirous to put life in his noble designs, that he would serve him, were it but to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Pike in his Army: and thus <hi>Ramsay</hi> returned, and Colonel <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> with him. Whereupon the Marquis went about the executing of his designs, and the levying of his men, but all was according to the Kings Orders and Instructions; yet His Majesty seemed onely a consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to it. The Levies went on all this Winter, in which many were backward, because the King owned them so little. As for Money, the King advanced a good summe, though far short of what was necessary: but he gave the Marquis a Lease of the Customs of the Wines in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for 16 years, upon which Security he and all his friends raised as much Money as the design required. Many of the Marquis his friends did in the beginning dissuade him from the undertaking, apprehending the hazards both of his person and fortune, which were visible from an attempt that was full of dubious success; but when they saw him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, they did all very frankly concur, mortgaging their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes for raising such summes of Money as were necessary for the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Next Spring the Marquis sent <hi>Ramsay</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> to see what assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he might expect from the States,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ramsay</hi> is sent over to the States, and <hi>Elphinston</hi> to the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi>

Upon this the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> sent the Lord <hi>Reay</hi> first to <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and then to <hi>Holland,</hi> for carrying on of those Levies; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the levying of 3000 Foot and 1000 Horse to Colonel <hi>Farens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65282:15"/>
chiefly from the Kings resolutions. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> also desired a League with the King, and that the King should send over ten thousand men, whom the King of <hi>Britain</hi> should maintain during the Wars,<note place="margin">and desires a League with the King.</note> and that Army, with the other twelve thousand, should be under the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis his Command as General: upon which the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> should oblige himself, never to make Peace with the Emperour till the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi> were restored. To this the King gave a good hearing, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to send over an Embassadour to finish the Agreement; and in the mean time the Marquis his dispatch was hasted forward with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. His Army was partly <hi>Scots,</hi> partly <hi>English,</hi> and they were to be transported in the Kings Ships; the <hi>Scotish</hi> Forces were to be shipped at <hi>Leith,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and <hi>Yarmouth-Road</hi> was to be their Rendezvous.</p>
            <p>In the end of <hi>May</hi> both <hi>Reay</hi> and <hi>Ramsay</hi> came out of <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>England. Ramsay</hi> got nothing done with the States, who would give no assistance to the Marquis, till the King formally engaged himself; yet he got some Officers to come over, and in particular that gallant <hi>English</hi> Gentleman, Sir <hi>Iacob Ashly,</hi> who had acquired much reputation in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars: but <hi>Ramsay</hi> drew much trouble on himself, for being a man of an intemperate tongue, he had talked loosly of the Court of <hi>England</hi> to the Lord <hi>Reay.</hi> At this time the Marquis was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> drawing the Souldiers together, and having made all ready there, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Court, having nothing more to doe but to kiss His Majesties Hand, and receive his last Commands: but there was then at Court the Lord <hi>Ochiltree,</hi>

                  <hi>Reay</hi> acccuseth <hi>Ramsay,</hi> and <hi>Ochiltree</hi> the Marquis.</note> a man of a subtil spirit and good parts, had not those endowments of his mind been stain'd with some ill qualities. He had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired some interest in Court by the service he did the Earl of <hi>Niddis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> in the matter of the Kings Revocation and the Commission of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renders, (which to explain were too long a digression here, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to all who understand how the Rights of the Titles were at that time unsettled in <hi>Scotland.</hi>) His malice against the Marquis was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary, he being the Son of Captain <hi>Iames Stewart,</hi> who in King <hi>Iames</hi> his Minority, when the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were groundlesly and in a mock-Parliament attainted, carried the Title of Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>; and possessed their Fortunes. Lord <hi>Reay</hi> (upon what irritation I know not) alledged to him, that Mr. <hi>Ramsay</hi> had told him, that the Marquises designs were not upon <hi>Germany</hi> but <hi>Britain,</hi> and that when this Army was once gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he purposed to pretend to the Crown of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This lye was so ill told, that it could take with none but those whose Judgments were blinded through malice: for as that Army was very small, and in no manner of capacity to prosecute such a design, so it was made up of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English</hi>; and most of the Officers were persons of whom the Marquis had no acquaintance. <hi>Reay</hi> alledged likewise the testimony of one Mr. <hi>Cleazar Borthwick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Borthwick</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a witness clears the Marquis.</note> to whom Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> should have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the same design: but this testimony turned to his shame, for that person, who was of known integrity, being brought from <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and examined upon what <hi>Meldrum</hi> had said to him, desired liberty to send his Deposition to the King sealed, since the particulars were not fit to be publickly heard; to which the King yielding, he sent it. The summe of it was, that <hi>Meldrum</hi> had never communicated any such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to him; that he had indeed spoken abominably of the King and Court, but all was in his own name; and that he brought no credence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65282:16"/>
with him from the Marquis, for his errand to the <hi>Swedish</hi> Court was onely to solicit the payment of some Arrears due to his Uncle, who had served that Crown; and he had no Employment from the Marquis, onely he got from him Letters of recommendation for the dispatch of his business, so that whatever he said was understood as his own sense, and not as a message from the Marquis.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reay</hi> also alledged the testimony of Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Lindsay,</hi> for a great part of that he charged on <hi>Ramsay.</hi> This <hi>Lindsay</hi> indeed was a brave Gentleman, and <hi>Reay</hi>'s Lieutenant Colonel, but was killed two or three moneths before <hi>Reay</hi> met with <hi>Ochiltree</hi> at <hi>London.</hi> He was in new <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> with other <hi>Swedish</hi> Officers, when <hi>Tilly</hi> took it in, and all <hi>Reay</hi>'s Regiment was cut to pieces except a very few; which turned to his eternal disgrace, who in such a hot time of Action left his Command to come over to <hi>England</hi> and forge lyes: and after that <hi>Reay</hi> was in no esteem neither with <hi>Scots</hi> nor <hi>Swedes,</hi> and irrecoverably lost himself in the K. of <hi>Swedens</hi> opinion. But <hi>Reay</hi> kept himself from charging any thing on the Marquis, fixing all he said on <hi>Ramsay</hi>; which Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not observed by <hi>Ochiltree,</hi> who drew a representation of the Marquis his interest in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to shew what probabilities might be of such a design, and reckoned up all his Kindred and Allyes, by which he drew in most of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so fastned suspicions on them all; a madness onely incident to those of <hi>Bedlam,</hi> to which his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice drove him though he was no fool.</p>
            <p>With this account of <hi>Reay</hi>'s and his own he went to the Lord <hi>Weston,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Weston</hi> carries the Accusation to the King,</note> then Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> and personating great zeal for the safety of King and Kingdoms, revealed this alledged Treason to him; adding, that it was probable, all things being now ready to be put in execution, that the Marquis upon his return, to put things in the more fearful disorder, might (if admitted to wait in the Kings Bed-chamber) murder him. This was a Calumny than which Hell could not have forged a fouler; for Lord <hi>Ochiltree</hi> judged that this would have infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced one of two effects, either raised such a Jealousie in the Kings thoughts as to have quite ruined the Marquis, since few Princes are proof against such whispers; or at least it would have stopt his voyage for a while, till he were tried, and the smallest delay in that would have scattered his Souldiers; so that this design failing, in which his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was now so far engaged, a stain should lie on him through all <hi>Europe.</hi> Lord <hi>Weston</hi> carried this Story to the King, whether provoked to it out of hatred to the Marquis, or moved from his zeal and duty to the King, shall not be determined; though the last was pretended by him, and in many of his Letters to the Marquis, when he was in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> he expressed much friendship for him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">who gives it no good hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</note>But His Majesty knew the Marquis too well, and understood all his motions, and the progress of this Affair too exactly, to give any credit to this Forgery: and indeed he rejected listening to it, in terms so full of affection for the Marquis, as discovered he was incapable of any Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, either of him, or any of his actions; neither would he hearken to those who onely desired that upon his return he might not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Presence, at least not to lie in his Bed-chamber. Within a very little while the Marquis came to Court, utterly ignorant of the execrable designs of his Adversaries: His Majesty welcomed him with an air of kindness beyond what he ordinarily gave him, and drawing

him apart, immediately told him all that villainous story which had been whispered against him. The Confusion this raised in his thoughts was unspeakable,<note place="margin">and opens the whole matter to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis;</note> being amazed to find himself so horridly misrepresent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, knowing his heart to be full of duty and affection to his Soveraign; he wondered how malice could be so impudent, as at a time when he was hazarding Life, Honour, Friends, and Fortune, for the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to fasten such a devillish gloss on his actions: but this surprize was overcome with a greater, when he saw His Majesty with an unheard-of, and truly Royal generosity, express his confidence in him in such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging terms, as scarce to allow him to speak in his own Justification; which seeming to insinuate, he thought he needed to be vindicated, the Marquis begged he might be presently tried, and offered himself to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint till he were cleared. But His Majesty would not hear of that, on the contrary commanded him to lie in the Bed-chamber that night;<note place="margin">and made him lie in the Bed-chamber that same night.</note> and he expressed his confidence and kindness for him, in such a strain both of behaviour and discourse, that the Marquis frequently said, he looked on the kindness of that night, as that which obliged him more than all the other publick testimonies of the Kings favour and bounty he ever met with; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> His Majesty embraced him with such tender affection, that he had been a monster of ingratitude, if he had been ever capable of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting it: and indeed the Marquis used to say, that never were his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments for any usage he afterwards met with so great, but the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that night stifled them quite; and it must be confessed to be a passage without example in History, since the days of the conquering King of <hi>Macedon.</hi> But the Marquis was not able to lie under such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible imputations, wherefore he pressed that <hi>Ochiltree</hi> might be put to it to prove what he had alledged: but all he offered against <hi>Ramsay</hi> was onely a presumption, which <hi>Ramsay</hi> denied and <hi>Reay</hi> affirmed; so that they were both put under Bail, and nothing appeared that did touch the Marquis: for, though <hi>Ramsay</hi> had been as guilty as the Lord <hi>Reay</hi> called him, that left no imputation on him, since none can be made answerable for those they imploy, unless it appear that they followed the Instructions given them. So the Marquis was dispatched to <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Lord <hi>Ochiltree</hi> had charged the Marquis with Treason,<note place="margin">

               </note> and he continued there for twenty years. But that all this matter may be ended at once, ten years after this, when His Majesty was in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the year 1641, the Marquis was prevailed on, by the addresses <hi>Ochiltree</hi> made to him, to procure his liberty from the King; which he was to have done, but at that time one Captain <hi>Stewart,</hi> who had married his daughter, was amongst these who discovered the alledged Plot, commonly called the <hi>Incident,</hi> (whereof an account shall be given in its due place:) and this bound up the Marquis from interposing for <hi>Ochiltree</hi>'s liberty, lest it should have been supposed that he had done it as a kindness to his Son-in-law for that discovery, which might have raised some Jealousies.</p>

That King welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these tidings with much joy, and appointed him to go into <hi>Silesia</hi> for the reducing of that Country, promising that the Army he was engaged to give for his assistance should meet him on his way; and with this he sent him a Commission to be his General in <hi>Silesia.</hi>

But the Country they landed in was totally wasted, both by the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army, which had been led through it the former year, and by the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> Army that had lately passed it; so that they met nothing before them, but Vastation, Plague, and Famine.</p>
            <p>A little after that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> desired the Marquis to come to him,<note place="margin">The Marquis goeth to the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>

The Marquis discovered in that noble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour an air of Majesty and Courage which could not be equalled, neither was his Prudence in Affairs inferiour to his Conduct of Armies: but those rare excellences were much soiled with unsupportable Pride and Ambition, which grew with his success to an intolerable degree. He pressed the Marquis to solicit his Master earnestly for a more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous supply, both of men and money; and he excused his not sending the Forces he had promised to meet him, since his design was presently to give <hi>Tilly</hi> Battel, so that he could not weaken his Army; but he bade him levy what <hi>Germans</hi> he could, whose Pay the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> said he should advance; and so he sent him away to keep <hi>Custrin, Frankfurt</hi> and <hi>Lansberg,</hi> and other Passes on the <hi>Oder,</hi>

            <p>Whereupon the Marquis marched with his Army from <hi>Stetin</hi> up to <hi>Frankfurt,</hi> but the Famine was so great in this wasted Country that it was scarce possible for them to subsist. The Plague was also at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furt,</hi> which broke in upon their Army so hotly,<note place="margin">where the Plague broke in on his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> that in a few days it swept away above a third part of them, and came so near the Marquis himself, that one of his Pages died of it: yet so tender and so equally divided was his care of the Souldiers, that notwithstanding of all the straits they were in none of them mutined or complained of him.

            <p>At this time the Marquis had notice from the Governour of <hi>Crossen,</hi>

The taking of this Frontier Town put much courage in his little Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and from this he was setting forward to <hi>Glogow,</hi> the second Town of <hi>Silesia,</hi> with good hopes of carrying it: but as he was to march, he received Letters from the <hi>Swedish</hi> King, telling him, that by his Agreement with the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> that Elector had undertaken to reduce <hi>Silesia</hi>; wherefore he appointed the Marquis to follow him into the lower <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xony.</hi> The Marquis regrated extremely, that after he had marched so many days through a desert Country, and was now come to a plentiful one, where there were fair hopes of good success, he should be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called back into those barren and wasted Fields. But he began to find the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was blown up with Success, and neglected those he had formerly caressed; and <hi>Silesia</hi> being united to the Crown of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> he understood that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> would never trust him in any.

            <p>His Army was strangely diminished, for he was forced to leave a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand behind him with the Plague upon them, and about another thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand were divided in Garrisons, and so he had but a thousand and five hundred of his own men, and about three thousand <hi>German</hi> Foot,

whom he had raised; whereupon with these, and a thousand <hi>Swedish</hi> Horse, he came and blocked up <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> which being the chief Town of the lower <hi>Saxony,</hi> had a great Garrison of about 3000 within it, commanded by one of the Counts of <hi>Mansfield.</hi> That great and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing City had been besieged and taken by <hi>Tilly</hi> the same year, where the Inhabitants were cut down, and the City burnt all to ashes, except 80 or a 100 houses about the great Cathedral, by a cruelty which had not been practised by the <hi>Goths</hi> or <hi>Vandals</hi>; for neither Age nor Sex was spared, nor was there any cessation till all were butchered down: and here it was, that <hi>Tilly</hi> had brought together the whole plunder had been taken in all his Victories, so that it was full of riches, besides the great importance of the place.

            <p>The Ambassadour desired him to name any place where he might come and speak with him, before he saw the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for he had no mind to begin his Treaty till he had spoke with him; and at the same time the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> desired him to come to his Camp for a few days, in order to the carrying on the Treaty, which he knew the <hi>British</hi> Ambassadour was coming to propose.</p>
            <p>Whereupon he left his Army under the Command of <hi>Lesley</hi> and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier,</hi> and went to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This, which is yet to be seen under his Hand and Signet, was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual Complement from that high-spirited King; but the Marquis thought not fit to put it to the Test, how much of it was meant for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. He pressed the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> for more Auxiliaries, but was sent back by him to his Army, loaded onely with hopes and fair words. So he came again to <hi>Magdeburg</hi> about the end of <hi>December,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Magdeburg</hi> comes to a Parley;</note> where he found that they within were much straitned, and (as another Historian acknowledgeth) had <hi>Bannier</hi> been as forward as the Marquis was, the Town might have been rendred. On Christmass-Eve they came to a Parley, and would have in few days rendred it: but on the second day of their Treaty they had notice that <hi>Papenheim</hi> was coming with an Army to their relief, whereupon the Treaty broke up,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1632.</note> and <hi>Bannier</hi> would have been retiring. The Marquis pressed his stay, but he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his Orders to command all the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces, and not to hazard an Engagement. This the Marquis looked on as a great breach of Agreement, that any should have Command in his Army but himself, but he must be patient; whereupon he retired to <hi>Saltsa,</hi> two leagues from the City, where he expected Duke <hi>Weimar</hi> with 5000 men, and resolved on his arrival to have given <hi>Papenheim</hi> battel: but <hi>Weimar</hi> came not, and <hi>Bannier</hi> drew his men yet further away to <hi>Kalbe,</hi> a league and a half off, and passed the River <hi>Sala,</hi> pressing the Marquis to pass with him, so afraid was he of <hi>Papenheim</hi>; but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65282:20"/>
sent Sir <hi>Iacob Ashley</hi> to view the Pass, who told him it was so good, that he might safely march away in a quarter of an hours warning, in spite of <hi>Papenheim</hi> and his Army, upon which he would not stir. Meanwhile <hi>Papenheim</hi> advanced with his Army,<note place="margin">but is relieved by <hi>Papenheim,</hi>
               </note> which he gave out to be ten or twelve thousand, though it was onely 4700 men; but, to make the fame of it greater, the Purveyors who went before him made provision for near thrice so many: his men were drawn out of Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and brought up in all haste; and if <hi>Bannier</hi> had not been stiff, it had been easie to have fought him, and the least foil given him had made <hi>Magdeburg</hi> their own. <hi>Papenheim</hi> getting to <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and finding that it could not be kept,<note place="margin">who leaves it.</note> marched away with the Garrison, and every thing worth carrying with them; but when he came out of the Town, the Marquis and he fac'd one another in a Plain betwixt <hi>Kalbe</hi> and <hi>Saltsa,</hi> and the Marquis, though very much weaker than he, yet had a great mind to have engaged: but <hi>Bannier</hi> would not think of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had <hi>Papenheim</hi> any mind to provoke them, and so he marched away: thus Duke <hi>Weimar</hi>'s slowness, and <hi>Bannier</hi>'s carefulness, lost them that occasion. After <hi>Papenheim</hi> was gone the Marquis entred <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> where he found they had left about 40 peece of Cannon, and great store of Ammunition, with plenty of Corns: he staid there till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>February,</hi> that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ordered him to lie about <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berstadt:</hi> but his Souldiers were ill-entertained, and those he had le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied in <hi>Germany</hi> were pressing for Pay, which should have been advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>; therefore in the middle of <hi>February</hi> he went to that King, who received him with his former kindness: and by other Letters from His Majesty he found, he was still so happy as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the room he had in his Heart, which appeared by the two following he found there from His Majesty.</p>

            <p>But there were great rubs in the Treaty with <hi>England:</hi> the main thing pressed by the Ambassadour was, that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> should give the Marquis an Army,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable terms to the King.</note> with which and the Forces and Moneys to be sent from <hi>England,</hi> he should fall in on the <hi>Palatinat.</hi> But the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> proposed unreasonable Conditions, demanding greater Assistance from the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> than the whole <hi>Palatinat</hi> could have given in its most flourishing Condition, and some Cities of the <hi>Palatinat</hi> to be put into his hands till the Wars were ended; with many other hard Conditions, almost as severe as these which had been proposed by the Emperour: so that the Marquis did clearly perceive, <hi>Gustavus</hi> was beginning to reckon on all <hi>Germany</hi> as his Conquest, and that he was to give what Laws he pleased in it. Thus the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and he were in very ill terms, but he continued to use the Marquis with great civility; yet he still declined to give him a Commission to levy a new Army, neither would he pay him those Summes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he had laid out in his Service; and his Chancellour said to him, they knew very well he had spent none of his own Money, having gotten 100000 <hi>l.</hi> from his Master. He answered, though that were true, he and his Master were to reckon, but that must not be set to their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</p>
            <p>In <hi>April</hi> the Marquis desired, that some order should be taken with the remainders of his Army till he got a new one, for their number at that time could onely have made him a Colonel, but not a General; so they were reduced into two Regiments,<note place="margin">The Marquis's Army is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to two Regiments.</note> the one of <hi>English,</hi> and the other of <hi>Scots:</hi> the <hi>English</hi> were commanded by Colonel <hi>Bellandin,</hi> since made Lord <hi>Bellandin,</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> by Colonel <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and they were put in Duke <hi>Weimar</hi>'s Army.</p>
            <p>The Marquis sent over Sir <hi>Iacob Ashley</hi> to give the King accounts of what passed, who was quickly dispatched back with the following Letter.</p>

For the first, it were very Honourable to doe (in the timis of Action) if you had an Employment, but neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, nor likely to have any hereafter, it were dulness, not patience, to stay any longer; yet it is fit to come off handsomly, neither shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impatience nor discontentment, if may be, although I think you have cause for both: therefore I have commanded <hi>Henry Vane</hi> to propose a new Employment f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This varying wholly from the former Treaty, wherein they had onely treated about the Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> and whereby no Peace could be

without the Kings consent, the Ambassadour and he broke up in very ill terms; and on the back of this, the Marquis pressing the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to assign him a Country for levying a new Army,<note place="margin">The Treaty breaks up.</note> His Majesty answered him with a new delay: but he told that King, that he had been now fifteen moneths from his own Country, and though he had been at a vast expence he had received nothing in that Service, and that his Heart was too great to be a perpetual Volunteer, as he had been these divers moneths past; wherefore he pressed for a present Answer. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> confessed he had reason to be weary, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the great obligation he had to him, and that he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look upon him as one of his best Friends; but said the blame of all the delays he met with fell on the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour, on whom he fell a-railing with the greatest passion that the Marquis had ever seen him in;<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Marquis shunned the Discourse, since as he could not condemn the Ambassadour, so he would not irritat the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> by an ill-timed Justification of him: but the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his passion was, that many of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to talk, that their Deliverer was like to prove a greater Tyrant than the Emperour had ever been, and he suspected the Ambassadour was Caballing with them.</p>
            <p>But the Marquis seeing nothing but delays, desired liberty to return to <hi>England,</hi> that he might levy a new Army, and remove any Misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings were betwixt his Master and the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position was so fair that it could not be refused; so on the 8th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> the King signed a Commission to him for bringing over a new Army,<note place="margin">The Marquis returns to <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> and gave him Instructions for ending the Treaty with the King: and a little after that he took leave of him, and was dismissed by the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and all about him with very high expressions of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that King telling him, that in whatsoever place of the World he were, he would ever look upon him as one of his own.</p>

            <p>And thus ended the Marquis his Expedition into <hi>Germany,</hi> wherein if he missed that Success which himself or others had expected, it was no

miscarriage nor neglect of his own; nor could it be said that he had failed in a jot of what he undertook, though almost in every particular the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> failed to him; neither was any thing so much the occasion of these neglects he met with in <hi>Germany,</hi> as the firm affection he bore his Masters Service: yet though this lessened his Confidence in him, yet it could not but increase his Esteem of him. 'Tis true, he did not survive this long, to give any expressions of it; for in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> next at <hi>Lutzen</hi> was that great and conquering King brought to the end of his days,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> is killed.</note> and so all his thoughts and grasping designs did perish with him; onely the Renown of his never-dying Fame sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives.</p>
            <p>But both <hi>Oxenstern</hi> and his other Counsellours in their Addresses to the <hi>English</hi> Court, during the Minority of their young Queen, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend all their Affairs to the Marquis, as to one of their own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the highest expressions of Esteem and Friendship; and divers of the Electors and Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were much taken with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, having seen him in the <hi>Swedish</hi> Camp, and continued their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with him both by Correspondence and Presents.</p>
            <p>When he returned to Court,<note place="margin">The Marquis is well recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> his reception with the King was as affectionate as his parting had been, and he continued about His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in the highest Characters of Favour; but he kept himself much out of business, medling little in <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs, except it had been to procure a particular kindness to his Friends, in which he was so sparing, that many were dissatisfied with him for it.</p>
            <p>Next year the King went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to receive the Crown of that his ancient and native Kingdom, and held a Parliament there;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1633.</note> thither did the Marquis follow him, assisting at that Ceremony according to his Rank with much joy.<note place="margin">He waits on the King to his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Scotland</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> But his Expedition to <hi>Germany</hi> had involved him and all his Friends in vast Debts; yet his Lease of the Customs of the Wines was a good Security, and fully able to free him of that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and was ratified in that Parliament. But the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi> who was then Treasurer-Deputy, suggested to the King, that these Customs were the readiest and surest Moneys that the King had, and that the Treasury would signifie little without them: wherefore he moved that some other way might be fallen upon, for refunding the Expence the Marquis had been at for his Army in <hi>Germany,</hi> that so these Customs might return to the Treasury. All the Marquis his Friends having got a hint of <hi>Traquair</hi>'s Proposition, pressed him to oppose it with all his Interest; since the Security he had was good, and well-settled on him by Law, and any new Project could be fallen on, would neither prove so sure, nor so speedy Payment. But <hi>Traquair</hi>'s Proposition pleased the King well, and he moved it to the Marquis, who without either mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring or reluctancy offered back his Lease of the Customs of the Wines, and submitted his whole pretension to the King.</p>
            <p>But His Majesty was both just and generous, and so would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to be ruined by those Burdens which had been contracted by his own Commands; wherefore a Taxation being laid on the Country by the Parliament for the Kings supply, together with another Imposition of two of the ten, which was then the Interest of Money, the Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these was put in the Marquis his hands till he should be paid all was due to him by His Majesty for the Expedition to <hi>Germany,</hi> and for some other great Summes His Majesty was owing, which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65282:23"/>
took to pay; and for the rest he was to be accomptable to the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, upon which he yielded up his Lease of the Customs of the Wines.</p>
            <p>In the end of that year His Majesty sent down the Marquis to settle, with the several Shires and Burroughs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> both for the Taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Two of the ten: and though his Power in that was full, so that he might have acted singly; yet he would do nothing without the consent of the Lords of Exchequer and Session. He spent some moneths in these Agreements, and after he had settled with the greatest part, he returned to his attendance at Court, having devolved the management of his Fortune and private Affairs on his Friends: and thus his Fortune was in a few years recovered from the burdens it lay under.</p>
            <p>A year after that he was sent down again to examine the Earl of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Accompts, who was Treasurer, and then he gave a new Instance of his being against the ingrossing of Power; for though his Trust war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted him to have acted singly, yet he carried along with him in all his procedure the whole Exchequer.</p>
            <p>And this is all the medling that (for ought I find) he had in publick Affairs till the Year 1638.</p>

            <p>But because this year gave the rise to those dismal Troubles, whose tragical Catastrophe we have all felt so sensibly, and since the Affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi> were wholly and onely trusted to the Marquis his Conduct for this year, the account of it shall be enlarged, perhaps to tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: but it is hoped that the importance of the Narration shall more than compense the pain of its length.

            <p>It is well known that in <hi>Scotland</hi> the first Reformation from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Popery was Popular, without the concurrence or allowance of Supreme Authority, though the Nobility for the most part joyned in it; and the Preachers being the chief actors and prosecutors of it, came to have great power over the People and interest with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Ministers were popular and factious.</note>It continued thus during King <hi>Iames</hi> his Minority; but no sooner came he to assume the Government, and to consider the state of the Kingdom, than he found the power the Ministers had with the People was swelled to such insolence, that it was more than necessary to limit it to its just bounds: for nothing passed in the Court or Council but their Pulpits did ring with it, and no favour was shewed to any that were Popishly affected, but Jealousies were infused into the minds of the People, as if Religion had been in hazard; and the People being then in their first fervours against Popery, were apt to take those Alarms pretty hot; neither did the King cherish any who was not devoted to them, but they did represent him a Favourer of Popery. They also held Opinions which savoured too much of that Church which was so odious to them, concerning the power of their Assemblies, and their not being accountable for what they preached, how Treasonable soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, till it were first judged by the Church-Judicatory; where all such things were sure of a mild Censure, to say no worse: divers other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets they held, which were judged inconsistent with good Government. But many of them being popular Preachers, and of insinuative tempers, they were much depended upon by the People, who looked on all their Excesses as holy zeal.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> bent all his thoughts to the regulating of this,<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> brought in Episcopacy,</note> and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the onely course to effectuate it was, to have some few of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er temper and discretion to be set over the rest, he studied by all means to get Episcopacy introduced in <hi>Scotland</hi>; promising himself, by that means, an infallible remedy of all these Evils, of which he was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sensible, though his great Gentleness made him very slow in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: but they foreseeing well the Kings Intentions, and the effects they might produce, did as cautiously resist all his attempts that way.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">though not without great and long op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note>I shall not tell what endeavours that wise and peaceable King used for compassing of his designs, nor with what hindrances they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed: but no sooner was he happily settled on the Throne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but he went more roundly to work; and yet it was not without opposition that he got Episcopacy settled and ratified in Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1612. But though great art was used to get Assemblies framed to the Kings designs, he could never compass it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:65282:24"/>Episcopacy being settled, King <hi>Iames</hi> also erected a High Commission Court, for punishing such as offended against that Constitution of the Church. This Court was made up of Bishops, and other Noblemen and Gentlemen; but the Bishops being those who kept the Diets of it best, most of the Secular persons absenting themselves often on design, and the Bishops leading all matters in it, it was counted their Court, and the <hi>odium</hi> of all that passed there fell to their share.</p>
            <p>This step being made, King <hi>Iames</hi> advanced towards an Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with <hi>England</hi> in Worship and other Ceremonies; moved to it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he might thereby make way for the Union of both Kingdoms, which of all things he most desired, or that he might root the seeds of Puritanism out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But in this he met greater opposition, and all the progress he made in it was, that in one Assembly it was decreed, there should be a Liturgy drawn for the use of the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and in another at <hi>Perth</hi> the Five Articles, that bore the name of that place, were settled not without great contradiction: and these were the <hi>Confirmation of Children, Private Baptism, Private Communion in cases of necessity, Kneeling in Communicating, the Observation of the Holy days of the Nativity, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, and Pentecost.</hi> Those were also established in Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1621. where the Marquis his Father was Commissioner, and managed that Affair so dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously, that it gained him an equal share of esteem and hatred, these things being generally very odious. As King <hi>Iames</hi> was going on warily in this design, he died,<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames</hi> dies.</note> lamented and admired by all the World; and even those who had irritated him most when alive, did bewail his Death with deep and just regrates.</p>
            <p>He was succeeded in his Throne by his onely Son CHARLES the First, who was zealously conscientious for Episcopacy;<note place="margin">King <hi>Charles</hi> goes on in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Bishops therefore were cherished by him with all imaginable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of kindness and confidence; but they lost all their esteem with the People, and that upon divers accounts. The People of <hi>Scotland</hi> had drunk in a deep prejudice against every thing that savoured of Popery.<note place="margin">Prejudices are conceived against the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>hops;</note> This the Bishops judged was too high, and therefore took all means pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to lessen it, both in Sermons and Discourses, mollifying their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and commending their Persons, not without some reflections on the Reformers. But this was so far from gaining their design, that it abated nothing of the zeal was against Popery,<note place="margin">they are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</note> but very much height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the rage against themselves, as favouring it too much.</p>
            <p>There were also subtile Questions started some years before in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> about Predestination and Grace; and <hi>Arminius</hi> his Opinion,<note place="margin">and Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</note> as it was condemned in a Synod at <hi>Dort,</hi> so was generally ill reported of in all Reformed Churches, and no-where worse than in <hi>Scotland:</hi> but most of the Bishops, and their Adherents, undertook openly and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously the defence of these Tenets.<note place="margin">and breach of Sabbath.</note> Likewise the <hi>Scotish</hi> Ministers and People had ever a great respect to the Lords Day, and generally the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of it is reckoned an Article of Faith among them: but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops not onely undertook to beat down this Opinion, but by their Practices expressed their neglect of that Day; and after all this they declared themselves avowed Zealots for the Liturgy and Ceremonies of <hi>England,</hi> which were held by the Zealous of <hi>Scotland</hi> all one with Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Upon these accounts it was, that they lost all their esteem with the People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:65282:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>Neither stood they in better terms with the Nobility,<note place="margin">The Nobility became jealous of them.</note> who at that time were as considerable as ever <hi>Scotland</hi> saw them; and so proved both more sensible of Injuries, and more capable of resenting them. They were offended with them, because they seemed to have more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest with the King than themselves had, so that Favours were mainly distributed by their recommendation; they were also upon all Affairs, nine of them were Privy Counsellours, divers of them were of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, <hi>Spottiswood</hi> Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> was made Chancellour, and <hi>Maxwell</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> was fair for the Treasury, and engaged in a high rivalry with the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi> then Treasurer, which tended not a little to help forward their Ruine. And besides this, they began to pretend highly to the Tithes and Impropriations, and had gotten one <hi>Learmonth</hi> a Minister presented Abbot of <hi>Lindoris,</hi> and seemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident to get that State of Abbots, with all the Revenue and Power belonging to it, again restored into the hands of Churchmen; design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also, that according to the first Institution of the Colledge of Justice, the half of them should be Churchmen. This could not but touch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nobility in the quick, who were too large sharers in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the Church, not to be very sensible of it.</p>
            <p>They were no less hateful to the Ministry, because of their Pride, which was cried out upon as unsupportable.<note place="margin">Their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters dislike them.</note> Great complaints were also generally made of Simoniacal pactions with their Servants, which was imputed to the Masters, as if it had been for their advantage, at least by their allowance. They also exacted a new Oath of Intrants, (besides what was in the Act of Parliament for obedience to their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary) in which they were obliged to obey the Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> and submit to the Liturgy and Canons. They were also making daily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads upon their Jurisdiction, of which the Ministers were very sensible; and universally their great rigour against any that favoured of Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, together with their medling in all Secular Affairs, and relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Dioceses to wait on the Court and Council, made them the object of all mens fury.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Liturgy is appointed for <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> But that which heightned all to a <hi>Crisis</hi> was, their advising the King to introduce some Innovations in the Church by his own Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things had prospered so ill in General Assemblies, that they thought of these no more. And in the Parliament 1633. that small addition to the Prerogative, that the King might appoint what Habits he pleased to the Clergy, met vigorous opposition, notwithstanding the King seemed much concerned for it; those who opposed it being sharply taken up, and much neglected by His Majesty, which stuck deep in their hearts, the Bishops bearing all the blame of it.</p>
            <p>At this time a Liturgy was drawn for <hi>Scotland,</hi> or rather the <hi>English</hi> reprinted with that Title, save that it had some Alterations which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it more invidious and less satisfactory; and after long consulting about it and another Book of Canons, they were at length agreed to, that the one should be the form of the <hi>Scotsh</hi> Worship, and the other the Model of their Government, which did totally vary from their former Practices and Constitutions: and as if all things had conspired to carry on their Ruine, the Bishops not satisfied with the general High Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Court, produced Warrants from the King for setting up such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions in their several Dioceses, in which with other Assessors, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and Gentlemen, all of their own nomination, they might punish offenders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65282:25"/>That was put in practice onely by the Bishop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> who though he was a pious and learned man, yet was fiery and passionate, and went so roundly to work, that it was cried out upon as a yoke and bondage which the Nation was not able to bear.</p>
            <p>And after all this the King (advised by the Bishops) commanded the Service-book to be received through <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to be read according to the new book at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> on Easter-day in the year 1637. yet by the Council it was delayed till the 23th of <hi>Iuly:</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Tumult at reading Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service.</note> but then it met with a tumult from Women and the meaner sort of people, whom though none owned in that Attempt, yet there wanted not enough who suspected them to have been set on by others. However certain it was, that the constant Discourse of the discontented Ministers and Noblemen was, that Popery was to be introduced, and Liberties like to be destroyed, and the Bishops to blame for all. By such Insinuations it was, that the People were animated unto an unparallelled Fury, so that they threw Stools at the Dean of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> when he begun to read the Service, and interrupted it often, notwithstanding all the means used by the Lords of Council and Magistrates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to hinder it. The Lords of Council, as they complained to the King of this Disorder, so they spared not to lay the greatest blame of it upon the Bishops, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the following Letter, written by the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> to the Marquis.</p>

                     </note> we found so much appearance of Trouble and Stir like to be amongst people of all qualities and degrees, upon the urging of this new Service-book, that we durst no longer forbear to acquaint His Majesty therewith, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to represent both our Fears, and our opinions how to prevent the Danger; at least our opinions of the way we would wish His Majesty should keep there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or before he determine what course to take for pacifying of the present Stir, or establishing of the Service-book hereafter; wherein all I will presume to adde to what the Council hath written, is to intreat your Lordship to recommend to His Majesty, that if he be pleased to call to himself any of the Clergie, he would make choice of some of them, of the wisest and most calm Dispositions; for certainly some of the leading men amongst them are so violent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and many times without ground or true judgment, that their want of right understanding how to compass business of this nature and weight, does often breed us many difficulties, and their rash and foolish Expressions, and sometimes Attempts, both in private and publick, have bred such a Fear and Iealousie in the hearts of many, that I am confident, if His Majesty were rightly informed thereof, he would blame them, and justly think, that from this and the like proceedings arises the ground of many Mistakes amongst us. They complain that the former Ages have taken from them many of their Rents, have robb'd them of their Power and Iurisdiction, and even in the Church it self and Form of Gods Worship have brought in some things that require Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: but as the deeds of these Times, at least the beginnings thereof, were full of notour and tumultuary disorder, so shall I never think it will prove for the good either of Gods Service or the Kings, by the same ways or manner of dealing to press to rectifie what was then done amiss. We have a wise and judicious Master, who will (nor can) urge nothing in this poor Kingdom, which may not be brought to pass to his contentment: and I am most confident,

            <p>After all inquiry was made, it did not at all appear that any above the meaner sort were accessory to that Tumult, the sequel where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the Afternoon had almost been Tragical, not onely to the Bishop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but to the Earl of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> for having him in his Coach. But His Majesty, though he was willing to be gentle to the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, yet continued firm to his former Resolutions, of having the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy and Book of Canons established. In <hi>October</hi> thereafter a new Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult fell out in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> against the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> and some of the Bishops, whom the People in their fury went about to have killed: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which by Proclamation the Council and Session, and other Courts, were removed from <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon the Earl of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> who was then Lord Privy-Seal, went to Court, to give the King an account of Affairs: for all this time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers had petitioned the Council against these Books, complaining, they were contrary to Religion in the matter of them, and the Laws of the Land in the manner of bringing them in: but all he could procure was a Pardon for what was past, to such as should thenceforth live quietly, and that was proclaimed in <hi>December,</hi> but was far from giving satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for by this time the Malecontents were become considerable, and had formed themselves into a Body.</p>
            <p>It was also studiously infused in the minds of all through <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the Bishops were introducing Popery, that many points of Popery were in these Books, and that the whole of them was both superstitious and illegal. This took mightily with the Vulgar, and the malecontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ministers began every-where to talk high in their Pulpits against the Bishops; they also formed themselves into a Body called the <hi>Table,</hi> where there were Deputies from the Shires and Burroughs, and a great many Noblemen and Ministers.</p>
            <p>That which they pretended was the Security of Religion,<note place="margin">They pretend the Security of Religion, and swear the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> with the preserving the Fundamental Laws and Liberties of the Land, the Honour of the King, and the defence of his Authority: and for this end it was judged fit and necessary to renew the Covenant made in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time against Popery, and signed by that King, with his Council and Family; which, according to the new draught, was made up first of King <hi>Iames</hi> his Covenant, next of a long Narrative of all Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby the Reformed Religion was ratified; thirdly, of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65282:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wherein the late Innovations were sworn against, till they were judged in a free General Assembly, and declared also to be abjured in the old Covenant, as formally as if they had been expresly named in it: and all ended with a Bond of Defence for adhering to one another, in pursuing the ends of the Covenant. This was no sooner moved, but the advice took as if it had been an Oracle; so the Covenant was sworn, first at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the moneth of <hi>February,</hi> and then sent every-where through the Country, to get the example of those in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> imitated; which was accordingly done, not without great appearances of Devotion among all sorts of People, they pretending it was nothing but the preservation and purity of Religion they aimed at.</p>
            <p>For the Covenant I judge it needless to insert it here, both because of its length, and that it is in the large <hi>Manifesto</hi> of the Affairs of this year, published in His Majesties Name: and therefore, that Book being both common, and of great Authority, I do not insert Papers at their length that are to be found there, and shall onely adde, that the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, and other authentick Justifications of that Declaration, are in my hands.</p>
            <p>The Session or Term was held that Winter at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> but the Council sate often at <hi>Dalkeith</hi> within four miles of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; which being then so full of People, it was not judged fit for the Council to withdraw too far from it. Petitions were often offered to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, encouraged from the <hi>Table,</hi> full of Complaints against the Bishops and the late Innovations; but they were as often rejected. Upon this the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> went to Court, and gave a full account both of the Petitions, the Humours, and the Strength of the Malecontents: and that all was occasioned by the Bishops misgovernment, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the lately-authorized Books, with which scarce a Member of the Council (the Bishops onely excepted) was well satisfied; neither were all these cordially for them, for the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> from the beginning had withstood these designs, foreseeing how full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the executing of them might prove. The Archbishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> was worse pleased; but the Bishops of <hi>Ross, Dumblane, Brechin,</hi> and <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi> were the great Advancers of them. <hi>Traquair</hi> represented also, that the Body of all <hi>Scotland</hi> was staggering, if not wholly alienated, from their Duty to the King, and that nothing could recover them out of this distemper, but assurances of His Majesties affection to the Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Religion, and of his aversion from Popery, together with the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside of these Books, at least till better Times. At this time also the Covenanting Lords wrote to the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> who were then at Court, representing their Grievances, and desiring they would offer their Petition to His Majesty, which was humble enough, though full of Complaints against these Books; desiring they might be heard to object against them, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering under the highest pains to prove, they contained things both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Religion and the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>But all the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> said was suspected, his prejudices against the Bishops being known. The opposition he had made the Bishops had rendered him hitherto very Popular in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there want not grounds to suspect him a secret worker in this opposition to these Books, though he seems to have been far from cherishing any further designs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:65282:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>All he could procure from the King was a Proclamation,<note place="margin">The King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims his firmness to the Protestant Re-Religion.</note> 
               <hi>Giving as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of His Majesties firmness to the Protestant Religion, and that great care was used in drawing the Liturgie; so that not onely it was not contrary to, but would prove a ready mean to preserve, the true Religion already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and beat down all Superstition. Withall the King considering the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Conventions had been to form Petitions against these Books, though they deserved a high Censure; yet His Majesty willing to impute that rather to a preposterous Zeal, than to any Disloyalty, therefore dispensed with them to all such as should thence forth retire, and return to their Obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon these Conventions were in all time coming discharged under pain of Treason.</hi>

               <note place="margin">The Tumults grow.</note>This was proclaimed at <hi>Sterlin</hi> the nineteenth of <hi>February,</hi> but was so far from giving satisfaction, that it proved a <hi>crisis</hi> to greater Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for it met with a Protestation as it was proclaimed, sent from those of the <hi>Tables,</hi> who notwithstanding continued to sit in that <hi>Iunto.</hi> An Answer also came from the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> and the other Lords at Court, directed only to three of the Lords of the Covenant in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Rothes, Cassils,</hi> and <hi>Montrose,</hi> wherein they wrote, that they had communicated their desires to His Majesty, who answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that as hitherto he had received all the Petitions they had offered to the Council; so he had considered them, and would declare His Royal Intentions about them. The Combustions continuing and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Council appointed a solemn Meeting to be the first of <hi>March</hi> at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> for a full examining of things that they might send their joint Advices to Court.

                        <p>And if His Majesty (as God forbid) shall dislike of what we have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved most conducing to His Majesties Service, and Peace of the Kingdom, you are to urge by all the arguments you can, that His Majesty do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine upon any other course, until some at least of His Council from this, be heard to give the reasons of their Opinions; and in this case you are likewise to represent to His Majesties Consideration, if it shall not be fitting and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to call for His Informers, together with some of His Council, that in His Own presence, he may hear the Reasons of both Informations fully debated.</p>

the present Combustion within the Kingdom, and dissipating of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Gatherings within the same, seeing Proclamations are already made and published, discharging all such Convocations and unlawful Meetings, the Lords, after debating, find they can do no further than is already done herein, until His Majesties pleasure be returned to this our humble Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance.</p>

                     </note>ALthough the miserable Estate of this poor Kingdom will be sufficiently understood by Your Majesty from this Gentleman, Sir <hi>John Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Relation; yet we conceive our selves in a special manner bound and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to represent what we conceive does so nearly concern Your Majesties Honour and Service; and therefore give us leave truly and faithfully to tell Your Majesty, that since the last Proclamation, the fear of Innovation of Religion is so apprehended by all sorts of Subjects from all corners of this Kingdom, that there is nothing to be seen here but a general Combustion, and all men strengthening themselves by subscribing of Bonds, and by all other means for resisting of that which they seem so much to fear. This is come to such a height, and daily like to encrease more and more, that we see not a probability of Force or Power within this Kingdom to repress this Fury, except Your Majesty may be graciously pleased, by some Act of Your Own, to secure them of that which they seem so much to apprehend, by the inbringing of the Books of Common-Prayer and Canons.</p>
                  <p>The way which the Subjects have taken and daily go about in the prosecution of their business is inexcusable, and no ways agreeable to the duty of good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but Your Majesty is wisely to consider what is the best and safest course for Your Own Honour and Peace of Your Government; and since Religion is pretended to be the cause of all, if it shall not be a safe course to free them at this time of Fears, by which means the wiser sort will be satisfied, and so Your Majesty enabled with less pain or trouble to overtake the Insolencies of any, who shall be found to have kicked against Authority.</p>
                  <p>We are the rather moved at this time to be of this opinion, that having found it the opinion, not only of those to whom Your Majesty wrote in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,

(except of the Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> who as yet is not come from the North:) but of most of the Noblemen, and men of respect within this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: we find few or none well-satisfied with this business, or to whom we dare advise Your Majesty to trust in the prosecution thereof; and if any hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> His Majesty having ordered him to write often to himself, and to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he being the onely <hi>English</hi> person trusted with the secrets of that business. The Earl of <hi>Sterlin</hi> was then Secretary of State for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65282:36"/>
               <hi>Scotland</hi>; but as the Copper-coyn made him at that time odious there, so he was little esteemed in the Court, and not at all imployed in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, except in matters of course. Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> and the Marquis had contracted a Friendship in the <hi>Swedish</hi> Camp, and so did keep a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence; yet that was most about accounts of the posture the King was in in <hi>England,</hi> and what he could do by Force if Treaty could not prevail. But with my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> he kept a constant and free Intercourse; and whatever that Archbishop might have been formerly in <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs, being abused by persons who did not truly represent them to him, he was certainly a good Instrument this year, which appears from his Letters to the Marquis, with the Copies of his Returns, which are extant.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">where there were great Jealousies of him.</note>My Lord Commissioner begun his Journey about the end of <hi>May,</hi> and on his way he met Letters from <hi>Scotland,</hi> telling him that great Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies were raised and vented upon his advertising so many to meet him, as if he had some strange design; and that his Vassals in <hi>Cliddisdale</hi> were under high pains discharged, to come and pay the duty they owed the Kings Commissioner and their own Superiour. On the third of <hi>Iune</hi> he came to <hi>Berwick,</hi> and there the Earl of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> met him, who told him in what fury all People were, and how small hopes there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of prevailing upon the grounds he was to go on; he answered he was resolved to follow his Instructions, and be at his hazard. Next day the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> with my Lord <hi>Lindsay,</hi> came to him; and from the later he learned, that they would never give up the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that they would have the five Articles of <hi>Perth</hi> abolished, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy limited, so that it should be little more than a Name: and if these things were not granted them, and a General Assembly and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament not called quickly, they would call them themselves, before the great Crouds at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were scattered.</p>
            <p>There was also no small Disorder in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> at this time, for they had notice that there was a Ship in the Road loaded with Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition; from which they took the Alarm, having it represented much beyond the truth, 200 Musquets and as many Pikes, with a small quantity of Powder, being all the Arms that were in the Ship. They resolved to go out the next day, and seize the Ship, which had been ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily done, it being onely a Merchant-Vessel; but the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> apprehending the hazard, caused all the Arms to be sent down in a Boat that night to <hi>Fisher-raw,</hi> and got Carts, and presently transported them to <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> which was then the Kings House. This enraged the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters, when known by them next day; and some of the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward moved that they should presently go to <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and take them out by force; but the wiser of them stopped this: yet they set sure Guards around the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and at all the Ports of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that none of them might be carried thither. This meeting with the Marquis his coming down, was made use of by the Incendiaries to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade the People, that he designed mischief by these Arms; and by the Advertisements he had formerly given: another hellish report was also spread, that he designed to call a Meeting of the chief Covenanters of all Ranks to <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and there to blow them up; whereupon they resolved not to go out, nor treat with him there at all. All this was done to irritate the People into a prejudice against him, of which he gave Advertisements to the King, and held on his Journey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:65282:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>The first thing he did was to inform himself exactly of all Matters and Persons, that he might accordingly apply himself to his business; but he found things in a greater disorder than he could have imagined.<note place="margin">He finds the Country in a very ill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</note> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the whole Council did favour the Covenant, and the Bishops were hated by all, so that there were few or none whom he durst trust: the Earls of <hi>Traquair, Roxburgh,</hi> and <hi>Southesk,</hi> were the men he found best af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, yet even their Limitations vexed him.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Lorn,</hi> who about the end of the year by his Fathers death was Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> seemed to go on with the Kings Service; but he was suspected both by the King and the Marquis to favour the Covenant. In a word, those of the Council who were best set were yet overawed by the fury and threats of the other Party. The Marquis of <hi>Huntley</hi> was forward in His Majesties Service, but the Marquis was obliged to send him North, to keep that Country (which was yet peaceable) in order. Many Lawyers were of the Covenanters side, and chiefly the Kings Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Sir <hi>Tho. Hope,</hi> which was one of the greatest troubles the Marquis met with; for he being a stranger to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Law, (in which the other was skilled as much as ever any was) was often at a great loss; for he durst advise with him in nothing, and often the Kings Advocate alledged Law at the Council-Board against what he was pressing. Of this he complained frequently to the King, and intended to have discharged him the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; but he durst scarce adventure on it, lest others should have removed with him. He tried what he could doe to get some Lawyers to declare the Covenant to be against Law; but that was not to be done. Sir <hi>Lewis Stewart</hi> promised private assistance, but said, that if he appeared in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in that matter, he was ruined. Sir <hi>Thomas Nicolson,</hi> who was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man fit to be set up against the Kings Advocate, though he had never all his life before pretended to a nicety in these matters, yet begun now to alledge Scruples of Conscience.</p>
            <p>Next to this the Marquis dealt with the Covenanters, who were chiefly the Earls of <hi>Rothes, Cassils, Montrose, Lowdon, Lothian,</hi> my Lords of <hi>Lindsay, Yester, Balmerino,</hi> and <hi>Cranston</hi>; these were the chief Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Actors, though they had many followers and abettors of all Qualities. With these he dealt by all means possible; but neither could Reason convince them, nor Assurance satisfie them, nor Promises or Cajolery prevail with them, nor Threats overrule them.</p>
            <p>He quickly saw that nothing could be obtained from the Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by way of Treaty; and therefore before he left <hi>Berwick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He puts the King on his guard to look for mischief from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters,</note> he adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised the King to prepare himself for teaching them their Duty by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, since milder ways were like to prove ineffectual. He also found the Country very destitute of Arms, and that the Covenanters were beginning to give order for furnishing themselves from several places; of which he also advertised the King, desiring him to send in all haste Expresses to his Agents in <hi>Holland, Hamburgh, Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to stop any Arms might be bought up by <hi>Scotish</hi> men.</p>
            <p>At first when the Marquis came to <hi>Dalkeith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">who fortifie themselves and are inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</note> he heard that 1500 men were set to guard the Ports of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and that they of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> had taken the Keys of the City from the Magistrates, and had some thoughts of securing the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; which had been easily done if attempted, there being neither Arms nor Ammunition within it. But the wiser of them thought it fitter onely to set Guards about it, by which it was rendred useless, rather than make so hasty a Rupture; and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65282:37"/>
the more violent threatned they would force both Commissioner, Council, and Session, to take the Covenant. All this the Marquis heard, but he might well regrate it, but had no power to curb it; for they were resolved to hear of no Proclamation, unless with the discharge of the Service-book and Book of Canons; the Articles of <hi>Perth</hi> were also promised to be abrogated, Episcopacy promised to be limited, and an Assembly and Parliament presently called. But his Instructions being so far short of this, he durst not adventure on publishing His Majesties Declaration, knowing it would meet with a Protestation; and as for that part of it which concerned the Covenant, my Lords of <hi>Traquair</hi> and <hi>Roxburgh</hi> told him, he was the ruine of the Country if he did not divide the Declaration, and wholly leave out what concerned the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: this he said he would yield to, and put his Head in the Kings Mercy, if they could assure him that thereby matters might be settled.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Marquis gives a clear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> representation of the state of Affairs.</note> Of all this he advertised the King, and told him he must resolve either to yield to all they demanded, or haste down his Fleet quickly with 2000 Land-souldiers in it, and send down Arms to the Northern Counties of <hi>England</hi>; advising him also to send Souldiers for Garrisoning of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> and <hi>Carlisle,</hi> 1500 for <hi>Berwick,</hi> and 500 for <hi>Carlisle</hi>; and that His Majesty would resolve to follow these Orders in Person with a Royal Army, and there was no doubt of Victory, if the matter were well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged: but he represented withall, that His Majesty would consider how far in His Wisdom He would connive at the madness of His own poor People, or how far in His Justice He would punish their folly; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring Him their present madness was such, that nothing but Force would make them quit their Covenant, and that they would all lay down their Lives ere they would give it up.</p>
            <p>But that which he applied himself first to, was the dispersing of the Multitudes. After he held a Council at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> where His Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was onely read and registred, he received Addresses from the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
               </note> humbly inviting him to come to <hi>Holyroodhouse,</hi> which he refused, unless the extraordinary Guards about their Ports and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle were dismissed. But this being done, he went thither on the ninth of <hi>Iune:</hi> they were guessed to be about 60000 that met him, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est number that Nation had seen together of a great while, among whom there were about 500 Ministers, and four of the most zealous had resolved to entertain him with Speeches: but this he shunned not without great difficulty, so earnest were they to be disburdened of their Harangues; but they came to him in private, and with great vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not without tears in their eyes, represented the danger Religion was in, but kept themselves within bounds.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">and mollifies some of the Covenanters.</note>And now he came to have access to their ears, and this was followed by that which always attended the engaging sweetness of his Converse, for he began to gain ground on their affections: he shewed them how firm the King was to the Protestant Religion, and how ready to hazard Life and Crown in the defence of it; that if any error had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the way of introducing the late Books, His Majesty did more than correct that by His gracious Condescensions; that he was resolved (as soon as the Country was settled) to call both an Assembly and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, if they themselves obstructed it not: but withall he represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them the madness of hazarding on a Rupture with the King: they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65282:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knew it would not be uneasie to engage <hi>England</hi> against them, the Kings Navy was in good case, and it would be no trouble to the King to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy their Trade, which would quickly impoverish the Country; therefore he desired they would follow such courses, as might redeem themselves and their Country from Ruine and Infamy. This prevailed with divers, and all acknowledged there was that strength of reason in his Discourse, that it was not easie to resist him long and see him much; but there were rough and wild Spirits, who could neither be tamed nor tuned right by it; yet the Multitudes began to disperse: but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was so dear to them that it was the endangering of all, to speak of delivering it up. On the 15th of <hi>Iune</hi> he received the following An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer from His Majesty to the Accounts he had sent him.</p>

I thank you for the clearness of your Advertisements, of all which none troubles me so much, as (that in a manner) they have possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and likewise I hold <hi>Sterlin</hi> as good as lost. As for the dividing of my Declaration, I find it most fit (in that way you have resolved it;) to which I shall adde, that I am content to forbear the latter part thereof, until you hear my Fleet hath set sail for <hi>Scotland.</hi> In the mean time your care must be how to dissolve the Multitude, and (if it be possible) to possess your self of my Castles of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Sterlin,</hi> (which I do not expect.) And to this end I give you leave to flatter them with what hopes you please, so you engage not me against my Grounds, (and in particular that you consent neither to the calling of Parliament nor General Assembly, untill the Covenant be disavowed and given up;) your chief end being now to win time, that they may not commit publick Follies untill I be ready to suppress them: and since it is (as you well observe) my own People, which by this means will be for a time ruined, so that the loss must be inevitably mine; and this if I could eschew, (were it not with a greater) were well. But when I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that not onely now my Crown, but my Reputation for ever, lies at stake, I must rather suffer the first, that Time will help, than this last, which is irreparable. This I have written to no other end, than to shew you I will rather die than yield to those impertinent

and damnable Demands, (as you rightly call them;) for it is all one as to yield to be no King in a very short time. So wishing you better success than I can expect, I rest</p>

A Protestation was also resolved on, whenever the Declaration should be published, which made it be delayed a little longer; and it was told him by the Kings Advocate, that a Protestation might be legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, and that it had been done so in the year 1621.

He tried what assurance he might have of the Lords of the Session being fixed to their Duty. Divers of them, who were no ill-wishers to the Kings Authority, yet durst not own it, being threatned by the Covenanters; of some he had all reason to hope well, yet the greater part of that Court, what through fear, what through inclination, was so biassed, that he saw little hope of prevailing with the Colledge of Justice, whether Judges or Lawyers, to declare the Covenant seditious or treasonable; and he was secure of none who sate on the Bench, save Sir <hi>Robert Spottiswood</hi> President, Sir <hi>Iohn Hay</hi> Clerk-Register, and Sir <hi>Andrew Fletcher</hi> of <hi>Innerpeffer, Halyburton</hi> of <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance,</hi> and one or two more: the first of these was among the most accomplished of his Nation, equally singular for his Ability and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but he was the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> his Son, and so his Decision in that would have been of the less weight.</p>
            <p>On the 16th of <hi>Iune</hi> the Covenanters came and presented their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Marquis, craving a present redress of their Grievances,<note place="margin">The Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters press spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they said they would be put off no longer by delays; and they desired he would propose the matter to the Council, and give them a speedy Answer. He told them that His Majesty did resolve to call both an Assembly and Parliament for the redress of all Grievances; but if this was not yet done, they had nothing but the Disorders of the Country to blame for it, which should be no sooner composed but all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires should be fully examined. They went away no way satisfied with this Answer; but the Marquis found all the Lords of Council inclined to the granting of what they demanded, so that he durst call no Council
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65282:39"/>
about it, lest they should have avowedly sided with the Covenanters: of which he advertised His Majesty, shewing him, that persons of all ranks pressed him, to represent to him that the Covenant was not ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and that if His Majesty would allow of the Explication of the Bond of mutual Defence,<note place="margin">Many move that an Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Covenant might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> which they offered, (that they meant not thereby to derogate any thing from the Kings Authority, for whom they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hazard their Lives,) all might be settled without more trouble, either to the King or Country; and that otherwise it must needs end in Blood. He desired His Majesty would consider well in what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness his Preparations were, before he hazarded on a Rupture; lest if they had the start of him, all his faithful Servants in <hi>Scotland</hi> should be ruined ere he could come to their rescue. <hi>England</hi> wanted not its own Discontents, and they in <hi>Scotland</hi> seemed confident that they had many good Friends there; <hi>France</hi> had not forgot the Isle of <hi>Rhea,</hi> and had certainly a hand in cherishing those Broils in <hi>Scotland.</hi> He also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Covenanters resolution was upon the first Rupture to march into <hi>England,</hi> and make that the seat of the War. Upon all this he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved His Majesties Pleasure, which he would punctually obey; and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, begging pardon for the fair hopes he had given him in his last, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing, that his desire of seeing Royal Authority again settled, without a bloody Decision (for which he was gladly willing to sacrifice his Life) made him too easie sometimes to believe what he so earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
            <p>Thus I give the most material Heads of the Marquis his Dispatches to His Majesty; for though the Originals of them be in my hands, yet they are not inserted, both because of their being too long and too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for publick view; as also that the substance of them may be seen in the Kings Answers, which for many reasons are set down at their full length.

There be two things in your Letter that require Answer, to wit, the Answer to their Petition, and concerning the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of their damnable Covenant; for the first, the telling you that I have not changed my mind in this particular, is Answer suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, since it was both foreseen by me, and fully debated betwixt us two before your down-going; and for the other, I will onely say, that so long as this Covenant is in force, (whether it be with, or without Explanation) I have no more Power in <hi>Scotland</hi> than as a Duke of <hi>Venice;</hi> which I will rather die than suffer: yet I commend the giving ear to the Explanation, or any thing else to win Time, which now I see is one of your chiefest cares, wherefore I need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to you. Another I know is, to shew the World clearly, that my taking of Arms is to suppress Rebellion, and not to impose Novelties, but that they are the seekers of them; wherefore if upon the publishing of my Declaration a Protestation should follow, I should think it would rather doe right than wrong to my Cause: and for their calling a Parliament or Assembly without me, I sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, my resolution is to come my self in person,

But the true reasons that moved him to desire permission to go up, were, that hereby he gained so much more time, as also he would more fully inform the King of the state of Affairs, and see in what forwardness the Kings Preparations were; but chiefly, to try what he could prevail about establishing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, which had passed in Parliament 1567: for he judged if His Majesty did sign and authorize that Confession with a Bond for defending it in subordination to the Kings Authority,<note place="margin">The Marqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </note>WE are exceeding sorry to hear that the success of your Lordships Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels in this difficult Business; is otherwayes than good Christians and Subjects do wish, and heartily pray for; but on the other part, are glad to hear from our Friends there, that, whereof we were ever confident, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is omitted by your Lordship to effectuate what is necessary for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Honour, and expedient for the good and quiet of that poor distracted and distempered Kingdom. For my own part give me leave, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flattery or presumption, to say ingenuously, that the Course your Lordship keeps, seemeth to be such as all good and wise men must approve your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships wisdom and Loyalty. Infallibly the fruit will be, besides the Warrant your Lordship hath in your own Conscience by this Noble and Wise carriage, your Lordship must be more (if any accrewment can be to former Deserts) beloved of your Master: it will indear your Lordship more to all good, wise, and well-affected Patriots, and oblige all, especially honest Church-men, to be your Servants. It cannot seem strange to any wise heart, who looks on the Distemper of that Kingdom, wherein is the concourse of so many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and divers Distempers, where so many of all sorts of different Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and no less variety of Affections, are so strongly engaged, and where many have their own private ends; that the best, wisest, and most powerful Agents, are not able on a sudden to rectifie their Iudgements, cure their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and by disappointing the private intentions of some, to reduce all to Order, Peace, and Quiet. In any great Work of this strain, we must all rely somewhat more on the wise and gracious Providence of God, than in other ordinary accidents: He is able to work good out of ill, light out of darkness, and order out of confusion, which I pray God heartily, we may see to His Glory, the Kings Honour, and Peace of the Church and State, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other effect upon any author or abetter of these Disorders, but of

Gods Mercy, and His Majesties Royal Clemency. In this I fear I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded more, possibly, than becomes me with your Grace; but as I humbly beg pardon, so I trust your Lordships Goodness will easily pardon the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of a poor Heart surcharged with grief, not so much flowing from, or follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fear of any Personal or Private evil can befall it, as fearing the danger the Publick is in, because of our Sins, which are calling for Vengeance. God of his Mercy give us Repentance, and be merciful to that Church and State.</p>
                  <p>We can return nothing for your Lordships care and kindness to us but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hearty thanks, and earnestly pray God Almighty for all Honour, Wealth, and Happiness to your Lordship here and hence.</p>
                  <p>As your Lordship hath commanded us we shall go from hence, and where we pitch our abode, with the first opportunity shall acquaint your Lordship. We were ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>All that kind respect which is above our desert and condition, and tender care your Lordship hath expressed to us, for our safety, and that which your Lordship hath superadded out of your noble Bounty, desiring us to be so bold as to shew your Lordship what Money, or any thing else necessary we stand in need of, that your Lordship may supply our necessity in this, hath so perplexed us for a time, that we knew not what to choose; on the one part being asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to doe it, both because it seemeth impertinent, and incongruous to trouble one of your Lordships Honour, Place, and Imployment, with matters of this kind, and especially so unreasonably at such a time, when your Lordship is at such charge for the Honour of His Majesties Service; as also that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and cannot be useful to your Lordship in any kind, and so how should we to other troubles we make your Lordship, adde this to be chargeable: yet your Lordships noble and generous offer, and the necessity we are cast into at this present, that what is our own or due to us we cannot command, and know as little who will do us the favour at this time to trust us, hath made us (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obedience is better than Sacrifice) to cast our selves upon your Lordships Bounty and Favour; fearing on the one part your Lordship may be offended if we doe it not, and on the other, that otherwise we cannot be provided: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly intreat your Lordship, to let me have with the Bearer a hundred and fifty Pieces, payable at <hi>Whitsunday</hi> next with the Interest, or <hi>Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass,</hi> as your Lordship pleases; for which your Lordship shall receive from the Bearer my own personal Bond. Here and at this time I cannot give better Security, but by Gods Grace your Lordship shall be in no danger, come the world as it will.</p>
                  <p>I have more than need to beg humble pardon for my unmannerly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent importunities, in troubling your Lordship at this time, taken up with weighty Affairs, if it were but to read this long Paper; and that I offend no more in this kind, I shut up all with my hearty Prayers to God Almighty for all Honour and Happiness to your Lordship, and an effectual blessing upon your Travels.

               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:65282:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Marquis had Orders from His Majesty to see the Bishops or other Churchmen, who suffered for their Duty, relieved out of the Treasury, but that was exhausted; yet the Marquis was careful that none of them should want, and therefore supplied them liberally out of his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, even without taking from them any Legal Security for repayment, as appears by the Accompts of his Trustees at that time.</p>
            <p>Upon the Kings Pleasure that was signified by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> the Marquis emitted a Proclamation for the Sessions sitting down on the second of <hi>Iuly</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Session sits again at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </note> and thither he went that day to intimate to them His Majesties Goodness for them, in no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> putting them to the trouble and expence of removing their Families elsewhere; wherefore he recommended His Majesties Service to them, and that if any thing came from the <hi>Tables,</hi> they should not fail to pass that Censure on it which was according to Law. Next he called for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters Petitions, which he promised to present to His Majesty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them an Answer betwixt that and the fifth of <hi>August,</hi> with which they were satisfied for that time.</p>
            <p>On the fourth of <hi>Iuly</hi> he held a Council, and presented the Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to the Councellours, and having before-hand prepared most of them with a great deal of industry, he got it signed by them all, &amp; an Act passed,<note place="margin">The Kings Proclamation is published, and protested against.</note> that the Subjects ought to rest satisfied with it. It was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately sent to the Market-cross, and proclaimed; but notwithstanding all the Grace it contained, it met with a Protestation from the <hi>Tables.</hi> But upon the back of this the Marquis met with one of the most trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some passages of his whole Negotiation. There were some Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours who were not satisfied with the Declaration, and those he got to be absent from Council that day: but divers of thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> who had signed the Act, (that the Subjects ought to rest satisfied with the Declaration) came afterwards to him, telling him, that he had pressed them to what they had not well considered when they did it, but upon second thoughts they found they had wronged their Consciences; wherefore they desired he would call a new Council,<note place="margin">The Council is inconstant.</note> that they might retract what they had done. This he studied to divert by all means, representing how contrary it would be to their Honour, and to the Kings Service, and Good of the Country, and so he shook them off that night: but next day those and many more came to him with the same Desires, and say or do what he could, nothing would prevail with them; for they told him plainly, if he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not a Council, they would find another way to make their Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion well enough known, and that was to subscribe the Covenant. The Marquis having spoken with the whole Council apart, found that three parts of four would immediately fall off, if he gave them not satisfaction; and judging that such a visible breach with the Council would ruine the Kings Affairs, therefore since the Act was not registred, but onely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, he thought the Course that had least danger in it was to tear it before them: by this means he got that storm calmed.</p>
            <p>All this while that he had been in <hi>Scotland</hi> he had not forgot the Kings Orders about his Castles.<note place="margin">The Marquis takes care of the Kings Castles.</note> 
               <hi>Dumbriton</hi> was secured, though it run a risque, the Constable being at <hi>London,</hi> and the Under-keeper taking the Covenant: but he called home Sir <hi>William Stewart,</hi> who was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable under the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> to wait on his Charge; and this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him from that hazard.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Edinburgh</hi>-Castle which was then in the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi>'s hand, it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65282:42"/>
cost him more trouble. Divers of the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi>'s friends, who had much credit with him, being not well inclined, and much being trusted to the Constable, he durst not in the Kings Name require him to yield it up, lest that had hasted on a Rupture; and he could not prevail by fairer ways at first: but the issue of this shall be told in its due place.</p>
            <p>This being done, the Marquis took his Journey,<note place="margin">He takes Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</note> and on the way he had the following Letter from His Majesty.</p>

                        <p>You must labour that Bishops may have Votes in Assemblies, which if you cannot obtain, then you are to protest in their Favours in the most formal manner you can think of.</p>
                        <p>As for the Moderator in the Assembly, you are to labour that he may be a Bishop, which though you cannot obtain, yet you must give way to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                        <p>You are to labour, that the Five Articles of <hi>Perth</hi> be held as indifferent; strive that the admissions of Ministers may continue as they are; you may condescend, that the Oaths of their Admission be no other than is warranted by Act of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>You are, if you find that it may any wise conduce to Our Service, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and publish the Order made at <hi>Holyroodhouse</hi> by Our Council the fifth of <hi>July</hi> last, for discharging the use of the Service-Book, Book of Canons, and the practice of the High Commission.</p>
                        <p>You are to protest against the abolishing of Bishops, and to give way to as few restrictions of their power as you can; as for the Bishops not being capable of Civil Places, you must labour what you can to keep them free.</p>
                        <p>You may give way that they shall be accountable to the General Assembly, which you shall indict at the rising of this against that time twelve month.</p>
                        <p>As for the Bishops Precedence, you are not to admit them of the Assembly to meddle therewith, it being no point of Religion, and totally in the Crown.</p>
                        <p>If the Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> or any other, be accused of any crime, you are to give way to it, so they may have a free Trial; and likewise the same of whatsoever person or Officer of State.</p>
                        <p>It is left to your discretion what course Bishops shall take, that are for the present out of the Country.</p>
                        <p>You are to advise the Bishops to forbear sitting at the Council, till better and more favourable times for them.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding all these Instructions abovementioned, or any other accident that may happen (still labouring to keep up Our Honour so far as possibly you can) you are by no means to permit a present Rupture to happen, but to yield any thing though unreasonable, rather than now to break.</p>

               <hi>But while the Marquis was busie at Court, procuring this Gracious Answer to their Demands, and while His Majesty was condescending to such extraordinary Favours to them, the Covenanters in <hi>Scotland</hi> were going on,<note place="margin">The Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are very busie in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> posting up and down the Country for more Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions to the Covenant: and because the North continued firm to their Duty, some Noblemen and Ministers went thither to draw them to their Party, and on the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> they came to <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> where there was a company of worthy and learned Doctors and Professors. But the Covenanters welcome there was so cold, (all the Subscriptions they got being but 19 or 20; and they were not admitted to preach in the publick Churches, which made them preach in the Court of the Earl <hi>Marshal's</hi> Lodgings) that they went away full of fury and threats against that Place; and this gave the rise to that Debate which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed betwixt the Doctors of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and those Ministers,<note place="margin">Debates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen</hi> and them.</note> which the Learned Doctors managed with so great advantage, as did not a little confound the whole Party: and the Ministers being pinched by them about the lawfulness of combining without warrant of Authority, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that my Lord Commissioner was satisfied with the Covenant, upon the offer of that Explication was mentioned formerly. But the falshood of this Calumny was cast back on them with shame, by him at his return; for as he had never expressed any satisfaction with their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65282:44"/>
Covenant, so all the ground they had for that, was, because according to the Kings Order he had treated about that Explication to gain time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He brought along with him to <hi>Scotland</hi> Dean <hi>Balcanqual,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canqual</hi> comes to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> a man of great parts, of subtil wit, and so eloquent a Preacher, that he seldom preached in <hi>Scotland</hi> without drawing Tears from the Auditors. Him the Marquis intended to make use of, as his Council in Church-affairs, which Trust he discharged faithfully and diligently, and received those Informations which were made publick in the large Declaration pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him.</p>
            <p>The Marquis came to <hi>Holyroodhouse</hi> on the tenth of <hi>August,</hi> and found things in a much worse posture than he had left them, and that the Flames were growing almost past quenching; for at a Convention of Burroughs a few days before, they had enacted,<note place="margin">The Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters high reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</note> That none might be Magistrates, or bear Office in any Burrough, except he had first taken the Covenant: and the Covenanters were resolved, that Bishops should have no Vote in the Assembly, unless they were chosen by a Presbytery; and they were sure that should not be. They were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to abolish Episcopacy, and to declare it unlawful, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, if not all, yet most of the Bishops; they were resolved to condemn the Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> and discharge Bishops to Vote in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; they were also resolved, to ordain all under pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication to sign the Covenant; and to shew they meant to break out into Hostility, they were beginning to levy men in several places. But to make sure work of the Assembly, they fell on a new device of Lay-elders to be chosen Commissioners, who should be men of the greatest power and interest, whereby they doubted not to carry all things; and because in a Meeting at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> of Ministers being 120 in number, about four parts of five were only for limiting of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, it was resolved by the <hi>Iunto,</hi> that none of these should be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners. The Marquis being surprized with so great a change of the State of Affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gave account of all these inconveniences to His Majesty, and resolved not to proceed to call a General Assembly, since he saw what effects it was like to produce, till he first went and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted His Majesty with these hazards.</p>
            <p>On the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> the Covenanters came to demand his Answer:<note place="margin">The Marquis makes known His Majesties intentions.</note> he told them, he had a clear and full Answer to give them, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be excused till he first communicated it to the Council, which was to sit next day. So they were satisfied for that time, and on the fourteenth he held a Council, where he delivered His Majesties Answer in these Terms.</p>

               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:65282:46"/>From <hi>Broxmouth</hi> he went forward to wait on His Majesty, and did shew him, that unless he enlarged his Instructions he was to treat no further;<note place="margin">The Marquis advises the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new King <hi>Iames</hi> his Covenant.</note> since he saw the Contempt was like to be put on the last In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions so visibly, that he durst not make use of them, lest he should thereby have exposed His Majesties Goodness to new Affronts. And as he represented this to His Majesty, so he told him, nothing seemed so likely a Course for removing of Jealousies and settling all things, as the Authorising the Covenant that upon King <hi>Iames</hi> his command was drawn up by Mr. <hi>Iohn Craig, An.</hi> 1580<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> containing the renunciation of all the Articles of Popery, which was the ground of the present Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The King rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against that.</note>His Majesty did utterly disrelish the Proposition of signing that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, usually called the <hi>Negative Confession</hi>; for he remembred how his Father had resented his doing of that, as rash and indeliberate. And it seemed strange to him, that so many Negatives should be sworn to, especially with such aggravations of Epithets; as if one might not be firm enough to the Protestant Doctrine, unless he not only abjured Popery in bulk, but also by retail, in so many particulars, some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might be both uncertain and indifferent. And it seemed tyrannical over tender Consciences, to require such an Oath from all Persons, but more especially from Women and simple People who could not judge well, and so were not fit to swear in such nice points; therefore the King said, he looked upon the Remedy proposed as full as bad, if not worse, than the Disease. The Marquis was so far from denying this, that he confessed, he could hardly without straining of his own Conscience resolve on the doing of it himself, upon divers accounts; a chief one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that in disclaiming of Transubstantiation, the real presence of the Body and Blood of Christ was rejected, which he could not sign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declaring, that by <hi>real,</hi> he understood <hi>corporal</hi> (and this he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly declared when he signed it.) But to this he added, that it was the Idol of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and he saw no other way to reduce things to any temper, unless this Course were taken and followed.</p>
            <p>He presented likewise to the King a Paper of all the Inconveniences, which were not only like to follow on the calling of an Assembly, but seemed certain: which Account was so full, that when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Ross</hi> came up after that, being sent by the Bishops, to divert the King from calling an Assembly, His Majesty said, he offered no inconvenience could follow on it, but what the Marquis had laid out to the full before him. And now the King resolved to try the utmost of yielding, for the recovery of His Subjects; therefore he again di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched His Commissioner from <hi>Oatlands,</hi> on the tenth of <hi>September,</hi> with ample Instructions which follow.</p>

with the Marquis: yet they resolved to keep the Assembly, and in the mean while to send one of their number to Court, to which he gave way.

            <p>Hitherto the Marquis had wrestled against the Malice and Jealousies of the Covenanters, and now Storms begun to rise from another Hand, which ceased not to persecute him to his Grave: but the Truth of this Narration will best discover both their Injustice who charged him, and his Innocence.</p>
            <p>He holding on his Journey came to <hi>Holyroodhouse</hi> on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>

He also found the Covenanters were ready immediately to have indicted an Assembly, if he offered at any more delays; and therefore resolved to give them present satisfaction.

            <p>Upon the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> the Covenanters sent to ask the Marquis when they might wait on him to know His Majesties Pleasure:<note place="margin">The Marquis lets the Kings intentions to be known,</note> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, when they would; for he was resolved to hold a Council next day, and the day following to publish it. So on the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they came to him: he told them he was going to Council to make His Majesties Pleasure known, which should be also known at the Cross next day; but for their present joy he told them, that the King had granted all they had desired, and more also, and that a free Assembly and Parliament should be immediately indicted. Some did hang their heads, and seemed surprized, yet they expressed thanks. He also spoke
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65282:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
frankly to some of them, telling them what the particulars were which His Majesty had granted; for having opened them to so many PrivyCoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours,<note place="margin">at which the Covenanters were troubled.</note> he could not think but all was known to them. They seemed reasonably well satisfied, onely they pressed him to desist from renewing the Confession of Faith; for they clearly saw that this could not but take off a great many, and would heal most of the Subjects of the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies they had been infusing in them: but he resolved to hear of no delay, having made most of the Councellours sure before-hand, and that by Oath. The Council sat in the afternoon, and it was a very frequent Meeting. After they were set, the Marquis with all the Art and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry he could think of,<note place="margin">He proposes the matter in Council,</note> laid out His Majesties Gracious Intentions for the Preservation of the true Reformed Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of that Kingdom; and that for the saving it from utter ruine, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of peace in the Land, he had done many things to which he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been induced to have given way, except out of that Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Then was the Kings Letter to the Council read, which was of the same strain with the Instructions, after which there was a general silence. But the Marquis (not willing that should last long, much less that any whose affection he suspected should begin the Discourse) desired <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quair</hi> to speak, who spoke (as he used to do) both long and well. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he called up ten or twelve of whom he was most assured, who expressed their satisfaction to the full. Then he pressed it might be put to the Vote,<note place="margin">which was there debated at length,</note> but some desired they might proceed more maturely, since it was a Confession of Faith they were to sign. This could not be refused, and so was followed by a long debate, and in end many desired, they might not be put to sign it that night. The Marquis remembring the Disorder had followed upon the last Act, and resolving not to run such a risque again, said, he did not desire it should be signed that night, but that they should be ready for it next morning; withall protesting, he would have none sign it, but such whose Consciences were satisfied, and who were ready to hazard Life and Fortune in the prosecution of it: and so after he had caused Registrate His Majesties Letter, they rose about ten a clock at night.</p>
            <p>Most part of that night he spent in labouring those who had Scruples, and consulting with such as were well affected.</p>
            <p>In the morning the Clerk-Register and Kings Advocate came to draw the Forms of indicting the Assembly. The Kings Advocate seemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing it should be according to the style used in King <hi>Iames</hi> his latest times,<note place="margin">and much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Covenanters.</note> but he was over-ruled. About six in the morning the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and many of the Covenanting Lords, desired access; and the Marquis calling as many of the Council together as could be had of a sudden, admitted them. <hi>Rothes</hi> in the name of the rest said, they heard the Council were to sign the old Confession of Faith, and to publish a Declaration thereabout, which they desired might be delayed till Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day next, and then they doubted not to be able to give good reasons why they should not doe it. The Marquis replied, he should return them an Answer by the advice of the Lords of the Council quickly; and from them he went to Council, being firmly resolved to admit of no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, knowing that it was sought on design to divide the Council. The Covenanters upon their Petition were called in to the Council, and they raised a long Debate which lasted about four hours, and in the end
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65282:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no delay was granted, at which the Covenanters were infinitely discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and went away not without some big words. At length after three hours more debate amongst the Councellours,<note place="margin">The Council <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est satisfied with His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties offers;</note> it was carried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a contrary voice, that the Confession should be presently signed: next, the Proclamation of Grace was ordered to be published, with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for indicting an Assembly at <hi>Glasgow</hi> the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and another for a Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> next: then they passed an Act, declaring their full satisfaction with His Majesties Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, together with a Letter of Thanks to His Majesty, expressing their full satisfaction, with large Engagements to adhere constantly to His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and so they rose at four a clock, having sate from seven in the morning.</p>
            <p>The Proclamations were immediately sent to the Cross,<note place="margin">yet the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.</note> which there met with Protestations: but many judged they went upon Grounds so weak, that it was visible they were designed for no other end, but to keep the People from being satisfied, and to hinder the Subscription of the Confession and Bond. Many of the Council were displeased with the Protestation, and swore to the Marquis, that since Religion was now secured, they would appear in another manner for the Kings Interest; but all he could do could not persuade them to pass a Censure upon the Protestation as Seditious. Next, there were Commissions given out for the Shires to seek in Subscriptions to the Confession of Faith; and the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and some other Covenanters were joyned in the Commission for the several Shires: which was censured by many, but most of all by the King himself, who knew not how to construct of this, as will appear by a Letter which will be inserted in its place. But most of the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours were earnest for it upon these Reasons, that it gave these Lords a fair opportunity of retreating if they would accept of it; it might also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm all that the Kings Indemnity was designed to be Real, when such persons were so soon trusted: it might give some Jealousie to the other Covenanters against those who were so trusted, as if under-hand they had given some Engagements. But chiefly the Body of the People would be very much persuaded that the thing was designed in earnest, when they read those Names in the Commissions. Upon these Grounds the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis yielded to the desires of the Councellours, and the King was fully satisfied when he was informed about it; which will quickly appear. Upon the notice His Majesty had of what passed, he wrote the following Letter.

This being done, the Marquis his next Work was to preserve Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which was in visible hazard, since the worst-affected every where were chosen Commissioners for the Assembly:<note place="margin">The Marquis apprehends the design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</note> and of this he advertised the King, desiring him to go on with his Preparations for fear of the worst: and particularly he remembred him of the Resolution he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken about <hi>Berwick,</hi> which was, that because Souldiers could not be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied in <hi>England,</hi> and sent thither, without making a direct Breach; therefore a thousand and five hundred Souldiers should be levied in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his Name in <hi>Holland,</hi> and these be suddenly ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and as suddenly landed at <hi>Berwick</hi> for securing of that place.

                     <hi>I</hi> See by yours of the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> that the Malignity of the Covenanters is greater than ever, so that if you who are my true Servants do not use extraordinary Care and Industry, my Affairs in that Kingdom are likely rather to grow worse than better: therefore, you that do your endeavours accordingly deserve the more praise, and your opposers the more punishment; and in my mind this last Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station deserves more than any thing yet they have done, for if raising of Sedition be Treason, this can be judged no less. And methinks if the Colledge of Iustice have signed my Covenant, (which I hope they have, because I hear nothing in the contrary) it were no impossible thing to get them to doe me Iustice in this particular. And this I will say confidently, that until at least the Adherers to this last Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation be declared Traitors, nothing will go as it ought in that Kingdom; I say this not to alter your course, but onely to shew you my opinion of the State of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>As for the danger that Episcopal Government is in, I do not hold it so much as you doe; for I believe that the number of those that are against Episcopacy (who are not in their hearts against Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy) is not so considerable as you take it.</p>
                  <p>And for this General Assembly, though I can expect no good from it, yet I hope you may hinder much of the ill; first, by putting Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions among them concerning the Legality of their Elections, then by Protestations against their Tumultuous Proceedings. And I think it were not amiss if you could get their Freedom defined (before their Meeting,) so that it were not done too much in their Favours. And I hope you will remember to weigh well the Propositions for the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,

            <p>Now the Covenanters were not idle; and two Stories were at this time not a little talked of. The one was about one Mistress <hi>Mitchelson,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prophetess.</note> who was judged a devout person; (a zealous Covenanter she was) she was troubled with Vapours, and, as is incident to persons in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, spoke as one transported, and most of all her Raptures were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Covenant: she did also inveigh severely against the late Act for signing the Confession of Faith. This was highly magnified, and she was spoken of as a person inspired of God, and her words were recited as Oracles, not a few taking them from her mouth in Characters. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the best Quality came to see her in her Fits, and she was brought to the house of a noted Covenanter, and laid in a large Bed-chamber, which was always crowded to the doors; she was called an Impostress by many, but those who understood Nature better, knew the root of her Distemper, which to have called so at that time had met with a high Censure: though, it afterwards abating, they were willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it under that notion, and counted them favourable who believed no worse of it.</p>
            <p>The other Story was of one <hi>Abernethy,</hi> who from a Jesuit Priest turned a zealous Presbyterian;<note place="margin">A Jesuit turns Presbyterian.</note> and had learned so much falshood in the Jesuits School, as to forge a Story of the Liturgy of <hi>Scotland</hi> being sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to some Cardinals to be revised by them; and that <hi>Signior Con</hi> had shewed it to himself there. Upon the report of this, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis wrote to <hi>Con,</hi> who was then at <hi>London</hi>: but <hi>Con</hi> protested seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, he never so much as had heard of a Liturgy designed for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> till he came last to <hi>England</hi>; that he had never seen that <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethy</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> but once, and finding him light-headed, had never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain taken notice of him: yet <hi>Abernethy</hi>'s Story had a ready belief, as well as a welcome hearing; though the lightness and weakness of the man became afterwards so visible, that small account was made either of him or his Story, which at this time took wonderfully.</p>
            <p>Upon the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> a new debate arose in the Council, which had almost set all wrong again. Some at the Board, whose hearts were with the Covenanters, moved that it might be declared, That matters of Discipline and Ceremonies were points of Faith; this was at length debated and determined in the Negative. The Marquis his next care was, to write to all the Kings Friends through <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Kings Proclamation published over <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> that they might see His Majesties Proclamation published, and get in as many Subscriptions to the Confession of Faith as was possible, and do their utmost to see that the Elections of the Commissioners to the Assembly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65282:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might be well considered: but in none did he confide more, and to none did he write more freely than to the Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed great zeal for His Majesties Service, of which he gave the King a full account; and as he saw cause, he moved His Majesty to write divers Letters for encouraging all His good Subjects. The Doctors of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> were also much cherished by him,<note place="margin">The Marquis does all was possible to prepare things for the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> and very kindly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the King; neither was any thing omitted that might che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish such as he saw well-affected to His Majesties Service. He caused also draw a Remonstrance against Lay-elders, and sent it through the Country, to get as many Ministers Hands to it as was possible against the Sitting of the Assembly. He was likewise very earnest with the Doctors of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> to have come to <hi>Glasgow</hi> to the Assembly, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the only persons then in <hi>Scotland</hi> fit for undertaking the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Episcopacy</hi>; he was to have sent one of his Coaches to the North for them, but that Road being always bad for a Coach, was unpassable in Winter; and the Doctors were so extremely averse from coming, that he could not importune them any further, since he saw it was resolved, that though an Angel from Heaven should come to plead for Episcopacy, all would be rejected. He also discovered the Prelimitations which the <hi>Tables</hi> were setting on the Assembly, by the Orders they sent through all the Presbyteries, both about Lay-elders, and that none should be chosen save Covenanters, and chiefly those that were able to argue on those Heads that were under debate. In the mean time he went home to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to get those of <hi>Cliddisdale</hi> to sign the Confession, the Justice-Clerk having gone before him to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and published the Proclamations there; but he himself met with more difficulty in <hi>Cliddisdale</hi>; yet he overcame most of them, though they had been strangely wrought upon to resist him: of all which having given the King an Account he had from Him the follow-Letter.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Confess this last Dispatch does more put me to seek how to judge of the Affairs of that Kingdom, than any that I have yet received; for I did not think that you would have met with so much opposition within your bounds, since (as I thought) you past well over a greater difficulty, to wit, the Peevishness of the Council. The cause of this I judge to be, that you did not make so much opposition against the Protestation as it deserved, though (I believe) as much as you could. But one thing I desire you to send me the reason of, which is, why you have mingled the Protesters with my good Subjects, as Commissioners in most of all the Shires, for the procuring of Subscriptions to my Bond: now it seems to me, that this will make the Covenanters op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my Service with a shew of more Authority than otherwise they could, (and certainly you cannot but imagine, that they must oppose that that they have protested against;) for by this the ignorant Multitude may be brought to believe, that my Council have either
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65282:52"/>
admitted, or at least do not gainsay, the Protestation: yet whether I be right in this or not, I will suspend my Iudgment, even of my own Opinion, until I hear from you. But one thing I will confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, that until most of the Council express themselves vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously in detestation of this last damnable Protestation, never look for any Obedience there. In the latter end of your Letter, you are very careful not to give them cause of Fears of my Preparations, or hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theirs; yet in the middle persuade to hasten on Mine: now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that this seems to me a Contradiction, I think that there is as much (if not more) danger now, that they should imagine I fear to displease them, than to make them scar at my Preparations, or for stopping of theirs; for now that the pretext of Religion is (I dare say) fully satisfied, fearful Proceeding now may hazard the loss of the little Party we have, by making them probably fear, that I either cannot, or dare not maintain my own Authority. But I doubt not your Dexterity and Diligence will help me to break through these difficulties, and so I rest</p>

            <p>This Letter seems of another strain than the former; but as soon as His Majesty was informed of the Reasons, which were given in the former account of the Proceedings of the Council the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which were forgotten by the Marquis in the long Dispatch, he then sent, he was well-satisfied, as will appear by His Letter bearing date the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> to be inserted in its due place.</p>
            <p>Many every where did at first offer to sign the Confession,<note place="margin">The Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do much oppose the signing King <hi>Iames</hi> his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> and the Covenanters seeing an inclination in most persons to return to their Duty, forgot nothing could be devised, to fill the Peoples minds with new Jealousies, as if the King were but abusing them, and intended the performance of nothing that was promised; all being done only to to evite the present Storm, which would be no sooner calmed, but they might expect worse Usage than ever: and with this they added a great many Reasons to perswade all, that it was Perjury for such as had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Covenant, to sign the Confession. And the sins of <hi>Scotland</hi> being so great, that they were to be punished with a tract of bloody Civil Wars, God in his holy and wise Judgments permitted the poor People to be so blind in their Obedience to their Leaders, that these Arts took universally with them; to which may be justly imputed all the mischiefs that Kingdom hath smarted under ever since.</p>
            <p>The Covenanters were no less careful to see well to the Elections for the Assembly, the Ruling-elders coming to all the Presbyteries,<note place="margin">Great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one knot, and men of power, carried the Elections as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; for there being an Elder out of every Parish, they equalled the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in number, but exceeded them when the Election was voted, all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65282:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Ministers who were on the List, and were ordinarily six or seven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed; yet in many Presbyteries Protestations were used against them by some Ministers. The Marquis seeing how things were carried, and having Informations from all places of the unlucky Elections, begun to draw up the Nullities of the Assembly, sending the particulars to the King as he had them; advising him withall to go on more frankly with his Preparations, since he saw it impossible to prevent a Rupture a <hi>Glasgow.</hi> And it was now apparent to him, that the Factious Spirits among the Gentry and Ministry were resolved to receive no satisfaction from any thing the King could offer, how just and rational soever.</p>
            <p>The Kings Declaration was published through all the Shires in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; in some it met with Protestations, but in other places the Marquis his diligence in sending the Commissions for it had prevented the <hi>Tables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most of the Councellours were slack in procuring of Subscriptions, yet in all there were twenty eight thousand Subscribers; of which number those the Marquis of <hi>Huntley</hi> procured made twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</p>

            <p>These Explanations were too just not to be accepted of by the Marquis of <hi>Huntley</hi>; but lest an humour of annexing Explications might have run through others from their example, which might have not onely retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Work, but occasioned new Grounds to the Covenanters to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel this Confession, he kept the matter secret, and took their Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Bond apart, and so sent it to the Marquis. But leaving to the Reader to judge how judiciously cautious these Exceptions were, I quit this Digression and go on.</p>
            <p>From all places some Subscriptions were brought, except from <hi>Argyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> my Lord <hi>Argyle</hi> alledging, that since the Assembly was so near, all desired to be excused till it had sate and determined about it. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Jealousies of him, it being well known how absolute his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was in that place.</p>
            <p>The Marquis returned to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> about the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> but was much disordered to find neither my Lord <hi>S.

Likewise those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops who stay'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> having pressed him earnestly to prorogue the Assembly, foreseeing what was like to follow on it,<note place="margin">Some advise to prorogue the Assembly.</note> he advertised His Majesty of the hazards which on the one hand were visible; but on the other hand, if it were prorogued it would not fail of fortifying the Jealousies the Covenanters had spread, as if the King intended not to observe what he promised; which might work much on the Vulgar. Besides, he saw grounds to fear, that most of the Council would desert him if it went to that; and certain it was, that the Covenanters would not obey, but keep the day onely with this odds, that they would hold it at <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> he therefore judged it fitter the day should be kept, and His Majesties Gracious Offers first proposed, and next the Nullities of the Elections examined, and then the Bishops Declinator offered; and by that time there was no reason to doubt they would give too good grounds for dissolving them. All this he submitted to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Judgment, adding, that if he thought fit to prorogue it, there were grounds enough from the Actions of the Covenanters for justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, but a present Rupture would be unavoidable; to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the following Answer.</p>

            <p>In the end of <hi>October</hi> the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> with the other Covenanters, petitioned for a Warrant to cite the Bishops to appear before the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:<note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to the Assembly.</note> the Marquis answered, the Law was patent, and there were legal ways for citing all such as were either within or without the Country; but for him to give Warrants, it had never a President, and so could not be granted; for it was enough that he did not protect them against a fair Trial: whereupon the Covenanters addressed themselves to the Presbytery of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for it, who gave Warrant for the most scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Summons that was ever heard of in the Christian Church, which is to be seen in the large Declaration, wherein all the Bishops were cited as guilty of Heresie, Simony, Perjury, Incest, Adultery, Fornication, Breach of the Sabbath, and what not! to which they added <hi>respectivè,</hi> which many said was on design to abuse the poor Vulgar, who could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the importance of that Law-term, but would undoubtedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them all guilty of these Crimes. This was ordered to be read in the Churches of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but carried so secretly, that it was onely on the Saturday-night before that the Marquis had notice of it; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he presently sent to require them under pain of Treason to forbear, but that was not formidable to them: so notwithstanding that, it was read in the Colledge-Church of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> after Communion, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be read in all the Churches over <hi>Scotland,</hi> and accordingly done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:65282:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>They sent also Orders through all <hi>Scotland</hi> to search into the Bishops Conversations, that all their escapes being gathered together, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses being cited to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> they might find pretexts of Justice to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the fervour of their Zeal.</p>
            <p>Upon the first of <hi>November</hi> the Session sat down at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Session sits, and most of the Lords sign the Kings Covenant.</note> and the Marquis having dealt with all the Lords of that Court before, went thither to get them to sign the Confession of Faith: some desired a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and this raised a Debate of three hours; at length nine of the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen signed it, two were absent, and four refused: but those who signed it durst hardly walk the Streets, so odiously had the Ministers represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Confession to all.</p>
            <p>At this time the Marquis got the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> to resign the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to the King:<note place="margin">The Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the Kings hands.</note> five thousand pounds <hi>Sterlin</hi> was that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for it, but he was brought to accept of two thousand; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> would not meddle with the Exchequer for payment, the Marquis gave him Security out of his own Estate for it; and at the same time the Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> resigning the place of Chancellour, he gave him also Security for two thousand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds <hi>Sterlin</hi> out of his own Fortune: so ready was he to go through with His Majesties Affairs, and to hazard the ruine of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Family; for the Treasury of <hi>Scotland</hi> was so entirely exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there was no Money in it. And though no Payments were made the Marquis for the great Expence he was at, yet in all his Letters to the King he never once complained of it; nor did he press the King to send him Money, except onely ten thousand pounds <hi>Sterlin,</hi> which he earnestly called for to distribute among the Bishops, and other poor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters who were ruined for their Duty to the King; and though this was not sent, he suffered none of them to be pinched, but supplied them in all their straits, for which the Bishops made great Acknowledgments not onely to himself, but to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who returned him many thanks in their Names. Concerning all these particulars His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty wrote to him the following Letter.</p>

               </gap> Loyalty was as invincible as his Courage. But the Marquis having visited the Castle, found it in the worst case imaginable, not a Musquet but one in it, and it not for Service: very little Powder, and not a Yard of Match. The buying the Command of the Castle made so great a noise, that he durst not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the furnishing it with Men, Victuals, and Arms, all which were wanting, till the first Heats were over, and the Body of the Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had gone to <hi>Glasgow</hi>; for besides that they set Guards about it, had they set upon it, they would have infallibly carried it, by starving them within, who were able to doe them no hurt. <hi>Ruthwen</hi> would not go to the Castle till it were better furnished, neither did the Marquis think fit to change the Captain of it too soon. But finding him no Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter, and having taken his Oath in writing, which is yet extant, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to surrender it but with his Life, he laid down the best course he could for furnishing it; which he got no opportunity to doe, as we shall see hereafter.</p>

This brisk Answer, though it was no surprize to the Marquis, put his temper to a greater trial than any thing he met with in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> he threatned him with taking his Place from him, but he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him boldly, that his Right to it was ratified in Parliament.

God will reward your Grace we are confident, and bless your Grace and yours; for we dare aver in this Division your Grace hath made choice of the better part. The Difficulties are great, the Hopes none, but too pregnant Fears to the contrary; yet it is the more like to be Gods Cause, that his Work may appear: and it may be called <hi>digitus Dei,</hi> and marvellous in our eyes.

                        <p>
                           <q>For the Professions which have been made by Our Sacred Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign (whom God long preserve to reign over us) I am come hither by His command to make them good to His whole People, whom to His grief He hath found to have been poysoned (by whom I know not well, but God forgive them) with misconceits of His Intentions, concerning the Religion professed in this Church and Kingdom. But to rectifie all such Misconceptions of His Subjects, His Majesties desire is, that before this Assembly proceed to any thing else, His Subjects may receive ample and clear satisfaction in these Points, wherein His Majesties gracious Intentions have been misdoubted, or glanced at, by the malevolent Aspects of such, as are afraid that His Majesties good Subjects should see His clear mind through any other Glasses or Spectacles, than those they have tempered and fitted for them.</q>

                        <p>
                           <q>I am confident that no man can harbour or retain any such thought in his breast any more, when His Majesty hath commanded that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, (which you call the Negative) to be subscribed by all His Subjects whatsoever, and hath been Graciously pleased to put the Execution of this His Royal Command in your own hands.</q>

                           <q>The next false, and indeed foul and devilish Surmize, wherewith His good Subjects have been mis-led, is, that nothing promised in His Majesties last most Gracious Proclamation (though most ungraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously received) was ever intended to be performed, nay, not the Assembly it self; but that only Time was to be gained, till His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty by Arms might oppress this His Own Native Kingdom; than which Report Hell it self could not have raised a blacker and falser.</q>

                           <q>For that part which concerneth the Report of the Intention of not holding the Assembly, this Day and Place, as was first promised and proclaimed, (thanks be to God) confuteth that Calumny abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; for the other of making good what His Majesty did promise in His last Gracious Proclamation, His Majesty hath commanded me thus to express His Heart to all His good Subjects.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>He hath seriously considered all the Grievances of His Subjects, which have been presented to Him, by all and several of their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, Remonstrances, and Supplications, exhibited unto Himself, His Commissioner, and Lords of His Secret Council, and hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously granted them all; and as He hath already granted as far as

could be by Proclamation; so he doth now desire, that His Subjects may be assured of them by Acts of this General Assembly, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by Acts of Parliament <hi>respectivé.</hi>

                        <p>The Kings Majesty, as he conceived for the ease and benefit of the Subjects, established the High Commission, that thereby Iustice might be administred, and the Faults and Errours of such persons as are made liable thereto taken order with, and punished with the more convenience, and less trouble to the People: but finding His Gracious Intentions to be herein mistaken, hath been pleased, likeas he is Graciously content, that the same be discharged, with all Acts and Deeds made for the establishing thereof; and is pleased to declare by me, That that Court or Iudicatory, nor no other of that nature, shall be brought in here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but in that way allowed by the Laws of this Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>And the Kings Majesty being informed, that the urging of the five Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Perth</hi>'s Assembly hath bred Distraction in the Church and State, hath been Graciously pleased to take the same into His consideration, and for the quiet and peace of Church and State, doth not onely dispense with the practice of the said Articles, but also discharges, and by these hath discharged, all and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Persons from urging the practice thereof, upon either Laick or Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick person whatsoever: and doth hereby free all His Subjects from all Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Pain, whether Ecclesiastical or Secular, for not urging, practising, or obeying them, or any of them, notwithstanding any thing contained in the Acts of Parliament or General Assembly, to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>And because it is pretended, that Oaths have been administred to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters at their entry contrary, and differing from that which is set down in the

                        <p>And that it may appear how careful His Majesty is that no Corruption or Innovation shall creep into this Church, neither any scandal, vice, or fault of any person whatsoever censurable or punishable by the Assembly, go unpunished, it is His Majesties Pleasure, likeas by these His Majesty does assure all His good People, that hereafter General Assemblies shall be kept as oft as the Affairs of this Kirk shall require: and to this purpose, because it is probable that some things necessary for the present Estate and Good of this Church may be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfected at this present Assembly, We do by these indict another Assembly to be holden at And that none of Our Subjects may have cause of Grievance against the Procedure of Prelats, Our Pleasure is, that all and every one of the present Bishops, and their Successours, shall be answerable, and accordingly from time, to time censurable according to their Merits by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, which His Majesty is likewise pleased be enacted in this present Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and thereafter ratified in Parliament.</p>

                  <p>THis Worthy Gentleman hath desired my Iudgment concerning three things:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>who write to him.</hi>
                     </note> first, concerning the production of a Letter from His Majesty to the Assembly, directed to the Archbishops, Bishops, and Ministers, whether or not this can be produced, and any Note made upon it, before there be a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator condescended upon. My humble Opinion is, (which I humbly submit to your Graces better Iudgment) that the Letter be presented, given by your Grace to the Clerk, and read by him. Here it is most like your Grace will be pressed, that the Letter is directed to an Assembly that cannot be without a Moderator, and yet on purpose to get a Moderator by Election, and an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly established; to which in my Iudgment it may be replied, that it may be that the Kings Letter containeth something to that purpose, which therefore is to be read, and noted by the Clerk as produced onely. The second is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Examination of the Commissions and Commissioners: My Lord, it is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65282:58"/>
certain that both are most illegal, and there is more than sufficient ground from this one (if there were no more) to void this Assembly and make it null. But how to begin at this I see not so well, for if the Commissions and Commissioners be rejected, then how shall the Kings Real and Royal Intentions be manifest to the Subjects, which is most necessary, that the Factious may not have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to possess good and loyal Subjects, that His Majesty is onely deluding them for other ends. On the other part, if your Grace approve the Commissions and Commissioners, how far King and Church shall suffer, your Grace is wiser to conceive than I am able to express. The third is concerning the Declinator, when it shall be proposed or presented to your Grace; My Lords of <hi>Glasgow</hi> and <hi>Brechin</hi> are fully of that mind, that at the very first it is to be used be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Assembly be established: their Reasons seem very pregnant, first, because all Declinators are used so; next, if the Assembly be once established, how can it be declined, or your Grace admit our Declinator or Protestation?</p>
                  <p>My Lord, seeing two things are mainly to be look'd to, the one that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Pious Intentions be made known to this present Meeting; the other, that the Church suffer no prejudice; my humble Opinion is, that first the Kings Letter (as I have said) be read, and marked <hi>Produced;</hi> next imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after, our Declinator produced, and presented to your Grace, read in audience of all, Instruments taken in the Clerk-Registers hands, and it marked by the Clerk <hi>Produced.</hi> Then your Grace may by your own Wisdom conceive a brief Speech, excusing your self that you are not so well acquainted with the Formalities and Legalities of Church-meetings; yet that seeing in such Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Combustions all things cannot be done in that orderly way is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, and that your Grace does know how that, with a most earnest and Fatherly Care, His Majesty endeavours the binding up of this Breach, and the restoring of Church and State to Quiet and Peace, and that your Grace for that Duty you owe to your Master, and Love you have to your Native Country, will leave nothing undone that is in your power, and incumbent to a faithful Servant and kind Patriot, and therefore will adventure to chuse rather to erre in formal Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: than to leave so material and necessary a Work at such an exigent of time; and so seeing there is no Archbishop nor Bishop present, your Grace by connivence will permit them (for how your Grace can allow it I see not) to chuse a Moderator, and will not fall upon that shelve or rock of Examination of Commissions or Commissioners; being confident that if matters go on in a moderate way, what shall be agreed upon shall be liked by all, even those that are taken to be their Party; and what is amiss in Formality and Legality, if no errour be in the matter of the Conclusions, may most easily and speedily be helped. After the Moderator is condescended upon, the first thing your Grace would urge is the Registrating the Kings Letter in the Books of the Assembly, then the Registrating of our Declinator. After this your Grace will be careful, that nothing be proposed till what is in His Majesties Declaration be enacted, and if (this being done) they fall upon any extravagancy, your Grace then may by advice of the Council declare, that seeing they will not hold Moderation, your Grace and the Council must examine their Commissions and Commissioners, (to which before you gave connivence) and discuss the relevancy of our Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator.</p>
                  <p>This Course keeped, in my poor Iudgement, will fully manifest to all His Majesties pious Intentions, evidence your Graces sincere affection to Religion and the Kingdom, preserve our Right, make them unexcusable, let the People see how unreasonable and immoderate they are, and give to your Grace a fair way and ground, to discontinue and discharge the Meeting under pain of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65282:59"/>
Treason. This my weak and poor opinion I have made bold to declare to your Grace, not out of any confidence in my self, but necessitated because of that Obedience I owe your Grace, and true affection to the Peace of Church and State, which with my self, and all my endeavours, I humbly prostrate to you, and submit to your Graces better Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>I humbly beg of your Grace to let me know by this Gentleman, what shall be done with our Declinator, and let him come and speak with my Lords of <hi>Glasgow, Brechin,</hi> and me, that we may be acquainted by him of your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces commands.

Some Commissioners there were who could neither read nor write, and yet these were to judge of Heresie, and condemn <hi>Arminius</hi> his points.

His advice was, that <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Carlisle</hi> should be secured, of which he put the King in mind almost in every Letter; that His Majesty was to send a Fleet of some of his Ships to lie in the <hi>Frith,</hi> and to be plying from that to the North, to block up their Trade; and also some others to ply from the <hi>Mule</hi> of <hi>Galloway</hi> to <hi>Kintire,</hi> marking to the King the Roads and Harbours whither they might retire.

After that he moved that they would read the Bishops Declinator, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him by Dr. <hi>Hamilton</hi>; but that they refused, saying, they must first be constituted before they could consider of any business. Upon this he protested, which with all the other Instruments that he took, is yet extant under the Clerk of Registers hands. Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Moderator.

Upon this also the Marquis took Instruments, according to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Forms: and thus for a few days he went on in the Assembly, protesting at every step; but as he was consulting what to doe, he received the following Letter.</p>

            <p>The Assembly went on at such a rate that the Marquis judged it no longer fit to bear with their Courses; for all Elections, how disorderly soever, were judged good; their ears were shut upon Reason, and the Bishops Declinator being read was rejected, and an Answer drawn:<note place="margin">The Marqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> asked if he was to desire the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Approbation of what he intended, or not: the Marquis answered, his Instructions from His Majesty were clear and positive for what he was to doe, and therefore it was not in his Power to let any Debate be whether he should doe it, or not; onely he desired their concurrence and advice as to the manner of doing it. Two hours were spent in Discourse, but clear advices were not given from any of them: from thence the Marquis went to the Church where the Assembly sate, and after he sate long a Witness to some Debates were among them, it was offered to be put to the Vote, whether the Assembly was a free Assembly notwithstanding the Bishops Declinator, or not; upon which the Marquis knowing well how the Vote would run, rose up and said.</p>

            <p>
               <q>You have called for a Free General Assembly: His Majesty hath granted you one, most Free on his part, and in his intentions; but as you have handled and marred the matter, let God and the World judge, whether the least shadow or footstep of Freedom can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Assembly, by any man who hath not given a Bill of Divorce both to his Understanding and Conscience. With what wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wringing your last Protestation charges His Majesties last Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Proclamation in the point of Prelimitations, is both known and misliked by many even of your own pretended Covenant; but whether your Courses, especially in the Elections of the Members of this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, be not onely Prelimitations of it, but strong Bars against the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of it, nay utterly destructive both of the Name and Nature of a Free Assembly, and unavoidably inducing upon it many and main Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, will be made manifest to the whole World.</q>

            </p>
            <p>And after this he caused read His Majesties Concessions, as they had been before proclaimed: upon which he took Instruments, that by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and signing of them, first, his Majesties Intentions were made known; next, that in the producing and delivering of them, the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Assembly was not acknowledged. After that he went on, and discoursed against the Constitution of the Assembly in the following words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But now I am sorry I can go on with you no more, for the sad part is yet behind, about Ruling-elders; for neither Ruling-elders, nor any Minister chosen Commissioner by Ruling-elders, can have voice here, because no such Election is warranted, either by the Laws of this Church or Kingdom, or by the practice or custom of either: for even that little which appeareth to make for those Elders in the Book of Discipline, hath at this time been broken by you, there being more Lay-elders giving votes at every one of those Elections, than there were Ministers, contrary to the Book of Discipline; as in <hi>Lanerick</hi> but eight Ministers, and eighteen or nineteen Lay-elders; and so in divers other Presbyteries: and in every Presbytery, when the Ministers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the List were removed, the remaining Elders exceeded far the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Ministers. But say there were Law for those Lay-elders, the interruption of the execution of that Law, for above 40 years, makes so strong a Prescription against it, that without a new reviving of that Law by some new Order from the General Assembly, it ought not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be put in practice; for if His Majesty should put in practice, and take the Penalties of any disused Laws without new intimations of them from Authority, it would be thought by your selves very hard dealing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To say nothing of that Office of Lay-elders, it being unknown to the Scripture or Church of Christ for above 1500 years, let the World judge whether those Laymen be fit to give Votes in inflicting the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Church, especially that great and highest Censure of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, none having power to cast out of the Church by that Censure, but those who have power to admit into the Church by Baptism: and whether all the Lay-elders here present at this Assembly be fit to judge of the high and deep Mysteries of Predestination, of the Universality of Redemption, of the Sufficiency of Grace given, or not given to all men, of the Resistibility of Grace, of total and final Perseverance, or Apostasie of the Saints, of the Antilapsarian or Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsarian Opinion, of Election and Reprobation; all which they mean to ventilate, if they do determine against the <hi>Arminian,</hi> as they give out they will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In many Presbyteries these Lay-elders disagreed in their Elections wholly, or for the most part, from the Ministers, and carried it from them by number of Votes, though in all reason the Ministers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should best know the abilities and fitness of their Brethren: and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65282:61"/>
this was done in the Presbyteries of <hi>Chirnside, Linlithgow, Aberdeen,</hi> and divers more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>How can these men now elected be thought fit to be Ruling-elders, who were never Elders before, all or most part of them being chosen since the Indiction of the Assembly, some of them but the very day before the Election of their Commissioners; which demonstrates plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were chosen onely to serve their Associates turn at this Assembly?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Since the Institution of Lay-elders by your own Principles is to watch over the Manners of the People in the Parish in which they live, how can any man be chosen a Ruling-elder from a Presbytery, who is not an inhabitant within any Parish of that Presbytery, as hath been done in divers Elections, against all Law, Sense, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>By what Law or Practice was it ever heard, that young Noblemen, or Gentlemen, or others, should be chosen Rulers of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet Minors, and in all Construction of Law thought unfit to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their own private Estates, unless you will grant that men of meaner Abilities may be thought fit to rule the Church, which is the House of God, than are fit to rule their own private Houses, Families, and Fortunes?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>By what Law can any Ruling-elder be sent to a Presbytery to give Vote in any thing, especially in chusing Commissioners for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly, who is not chosen for that purpose by the Session of that Parish in which he is a Ruling-elder? And who gave power to the Minister of every Parish, to bring with him to the Presbytery for that purpose any Ruling Elder of his Parish whom he pleased?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But it is well known, that divers Elders gave Votes in these Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries to the Elections of some Commissioners here, who were not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the Sessions of their several Parishes to give Votes in those Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries; and therefore such Commissioners as were chosen by such Lay-elders can have no Vote here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>By what Law or Practice have the several Parishes or Presbyteries chosen As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>essors to their Ruling-elders, without whose consent some of the Commissioners here present are sworn not to vote to any thing?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This introducing of Ruling-elders is a burthen so grievous to the Brethren of the Ministry, that many of the Presbyteries have protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against it for the time to come, some for the present, as shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by divers Protestations and Supplications ready to be here exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For the Ministers chosen Commissioners hither, besides that the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test are passed by, and some chosen who were never Commissioners of any Assembly before, that so they might not stand for their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in an Assembly of the nature whereof they are utterly ignorant, choice hath been also made of some who are under the Censure of the Church, of some who are deprived by the Church, of some who have been banished and put out of the University of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> for teaching their Scholars that Monarchies were unlawful, some banished out of this Kingdom for their Seditious Sermons and Behaviour, and some for the like Offences banished out of another of His Majesties Kingdoms, <hi>Ireland,</hi> some lying under the fearful Sentence of Excommunication,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65282:62"/>
some having no Ordination nor Imposition of Hands, some admitted to the Ministry contrary to the standing Laws of this Church and Kingdom, all of them chosen by Lay-elders; what a Scandal were it to the Reformed Churches to allow this to be a lawful Assembly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of such Members, and so unlawfully chosen?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Of this Assembly divers who are chosen are at the <note n="*" place="margin">That is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Writ of Outlawry.</note> 
                  <hi>Horn,</hi> and so by the Laws of this Kingdom are uncapable of sitting as Judges in any Judicatory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Three Oaths are to be administred to every Member of this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the Oath for the Confession of Faith, lately renewed by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Commandment, the Oaths of Allegeance and Supremacy; and whosoever shall refuse any of these, cannot be a Judge in any Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of this Kingdom; and therefore resolve presently whether you will take them or not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You have cited the Reverend Prelats of this Land to appear before you by a way unheard-of, not only in this Kingdom, but in the whole Christian World, their Citations being read in the Pulpits, which is not usual in this Church; nay, and many of them were read in the Pulpits after they had been delivered into the Bishops own hands. How can His Majesty deny unto them, being His Subjects, the benefit of His Laws, in declining all those to be their Judges, who by their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant do hold the principal thing in question, to wit, Episcopacy to be abjured, as many of you do? or any of you to be their Judges, who do adhere to your last Protestation, wherein you declare, that it is an Office not known to this Kingdom, although at this present it stand established both by Acts of Parliaments, and Acts of General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies? Who ever heard of such Judges as have sworn themselves Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? And if it shall be objected, that the Orthodox Bishops in the first four and other General Councils could not be denied to be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges of the Hereticks, though beforehand they had declared their Judgments against their Heresies: it is easily answered, that in matters of Heresie no man must be patient, since in Fundamental points of Faith a man cannot be indifferent without the hazard of his Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore must declare himself to be on Christs side, or else he is against him; but in matters of Church-government and Policy, which by the Judgment of this Church in the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is alterable at the will of the Church, it is not necessary for any man who means to be a Judge, to declare himself, especially against that Government which stands established by Law at the time of his Declaration, being not onely not necessary, but likewise not lawful for him at that time so to doe: now this Declaration all you who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the last Protestation have made, even since you meaned to be the Bishops Judges. Besides, even those Orthodox Fathers never did declare themselves against the Hereticks, their Persons or Callings, by Oaths and Protestations, as you have done; for that had been a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging in them, and this prejudging in you makes you now to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Judges.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Upon the whole matter then there are but two things left for me to say: first, you your selves have so proceeded in the business of this Assembly, that it is impossible the fruits so much wished and prayed for can be obtained in it; because standing as it does, it will make this Church ridiculous to all the Adversaries of our Religion, it will
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65282:62"/>
grieve and wound all our Neighbour Reformed Churches who hear of it; it will make His Majesties Justice to be traduced throughout the whole Christian World, if he should suffer His Subjects in that which concerns their Callings, their Reputations and their Fortunes, to be judged by their sworn Enemies. If therefore you will dissolve your selves, and amend all these errours in a new Election, I will with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient speed address my self to His Majesty, and use the utmost of my Intercession with His Sacred Majesty for the Indiction of a new Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, before the meeting whereof all these things now challenged may be amended: if you shall refuse this Offer, His Majesty will then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the whole World, that you are disturbers of the Peace of this Church and State, both by introducing of Lay-elders against the Laws and Practices of this Church and Kingdom, and by going about to abolish Episcopal Government, which at this present stands esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by both the said Laws: two points (I dare say) and you must swear it, if your Consciences be appealed to, (as was well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by that Reverend Gentleman we heard preach the last Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day) which these you drew into your Covenant were never made acquainted with at their entring into it; much less could they suspect, that these two should be made the issue of this business, and the two stumbling-blocks to make them fall off from their Natural Obedience to their Soveraign.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi> made a long Speech,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi> answers.</note> wherein he said much to the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of the Kings Authority in matters Ecclesiastical, calling him <hi>The Vniversal Bishop of the Churches in His Dominions,</hi> with other such like Expressions, which gave no small disgust to many of the zealous Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: but in the end he said, that we must render to God the things that were Gods, as well as to <hi>Caesar</hi> the things which were <hi>Caesars</hi>; and spoke much for vindicating their Proceedings, and charging the Bishops. And after him many of the Lords spoke about the Freedom of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, to whom the Marquis replied.</p>
            <p>
               <q>AS for your pretence of your unlimited Freedom,<note place="margin">The Marquis replies,</note> you indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused so much as to hear from His Majesties Commissioner, of any precedent Treaty for the preparing and right-ordering of things before the Assembly; alledging, that it could not be a free Assembly where there was any Prelimitation either of the Choosers, or of those to be chosen, or of things to be treated of in the Assembly, but that all things must be discussed upon the place, else the Assembly could not be free: but whether you your selves have not violated that which you call Freedom, let any man judge; for besides these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, which it may be are not come to our knowledge, we have seen, and offer now to produce, four several Papers of Instructions sent from them, (whom you call the <hi>Tables</hi>) containing all of them Prelimitations, and such as are not onely repugnant to that which you call the Freedom, but to that which is indeed the Freedom of an Assembly. Two of these Papers were such as you were contented should be communicated to all your Associates, to wit, that larger Paper sent abroad to all Presbyteries, immediately after His Majesties Indiction of the Assembly, and that lesser Paper for your meeting first

at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> then at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> some days before the Assembly; which Paper gave order for chusing of Assessors, and divers other particulars: but your other two Papers of Secret Instructions were directed, one of them onely to one Minister of every Presbytery, to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him as he should see cause, but to be quite concealed from the rest of the Ministers; the other Paper was directed onely to one Lay-elder of every Presbytery, and to be communicated by him as he should see cause, but to be quite concealed from all others: in both which Papers are contained such Directions, which being followed, as they were, have quite banished all Freedom from this Assembly; as shall appear by reading the Papers themselves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These he caused read, but they were disowned by the Members of the Assembly; and they said, they might have been the private Opinions of some, but did infer no Prelimitation on the Assembly: to which the Marquis answered, <q>That all the Elections being ordered according to these, was a clear proof, they were sent by an Authority which all feared to disobey. And after that he told, That for many moneths the Orders of the <hi>Table</hi> had been obeyed by all; but he would now make a trial what Obedience they would give to the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: and protested, that one of the chief Reasons that moved him to dissolve this Assembly, was to deliver the Ministers from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Lay-elders, who (if not suppressed) would (as they were now designing the ruine of Episcopal Power) prove not onely Ruling, but Over-ruling-elders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By this time his Heart was so full of Grief (which was easily to be observed by divers Indications) that almost all present were affected with it. In end, seeing nothing said in reason did prevail, he in His Majesties Name dissolved the Assembly,<note place="margin">and dissolves the Assembly; but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to sit.</note> and discharged their further Proceeding under pain of Treason. Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> answered him, that they were sorry he left them: but their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences bore them witness, they had hitherto done nothing amiss, so they could not desert the Work of God; protesting much of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Obedience to the King in its due line and subordination: and after this a long Protestation was begun and read.</p>
            <p>This being done, the Marquis presently went out, and called a new Council,<note place="margin">The Council approved of it.</note> to whom he told how sorry His Majesty would be for this Breach, and how really desirous he was to have done all was possible for satisfying of his Subjects, but that their Behaviour had extorted what was done; he therefore encouraged them all to their Duty to the King, assuring them, that whatever any of them might suffer for it, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty would see they should be no losers. From this Council the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> withdrew, and fully cleared all Jealousies about him; for he told the Marquis in plain Language, he would take the Covenant and own the Assembly. But most of the Councellours seemed satisfied with the Marquis his Carriage in the Assembly, particularly all his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors, (<hi>Argyle</hi> onely excepted:) yet the Marquis durst not offer the Proclamation for dissolving the Assembly to be signed in Council, for fear of a refusal, not having tried them all in it beforehand; but got most of them to sign it next morning, and then he sent it to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Cross to be proclaimed, where it met with a new Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Example was followed by some few Privy-Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65282:63"/>
whose declaring themselves the Marquis judged rather an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage than a loss.</p>
            <p>The Council also wrote a Letter to the King, highly commending the Marquis his zeal and industry in what had passed in the Assembly, which is in the Large Declaration, to which the Reader is referred for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal of all the Papers set down there at length; these being onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted here that were not then made publick.</p>
            <p>Thus he left <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and went first to <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Marquis returns to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </note> carrying some of the Bishops with him for their security from hazard; and after two or three days stay there went to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> (hoping that as he had outlived their Threats, he should ere long see His Majesty master their Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:) and from thence he gave His Majesty an account of what had passed since his last, together with a desire for a Permission to come and wait on him; to which the King wrote the following Answer.</p>

                     </note>
                     <hi>I</hi> Received your Lordships Letters of <hi>Novemb. 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,</hi> they came safe to me on <hi>Decemb. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
                     </hi> after <hi>8</hi> at night. I was glad to see them short; but their short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is abundantly supplied by the length of two Letters, one from the Lord <hi>Ross,</hi> and the other from the Dean. They have between them made their word good to your Lordship, for they have sent me all the passages from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Assembly to the time of the Date of their Letters: and this I will be bold to say, never were there more gross absurdities, nor half so many, in so short a time, committed in any Publick Meeting; and for a National Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly never did the Church of Christ see the like.</p>
                  <p>Besides His Majesties Service in general, that Church is much beholding to you, and so are the Bishops in their Persons and Callings: and heartily sorry I am, that the People are so beyond your expression furious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you think it fit to send the two Bishops from <hi>Glasgow</hi> to <hi>Hamilton;</hi> and much more, that you should doubt your own safety. My Lord, God bless your Grace with Life and Health to see this Business at a good end, for certainly, as I see the face of things now, there will very much depend upon it, and more than I think fit to express in Letters; nay perhaps, more than I can well express if I would.</p>
                  <p>I am as sorry as your Grace can be that the Kings Preparations can make no more haste. I hope you think (for truth it is) I have called upon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and by His Command upon some others, to hasten all that may be, and more than this I cannot doe; but I am glad to read in your Letters that you have written at length to His Majesty, that you may receive from himself a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Answer to all necessary particulars: and I am presently going to him to persuade him to write largely to you, that you may not be in the dark for any thing.</p>
                  <p>But (my Lord) to meet with it again in your Letters, that you cannot tell whether this may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>our last Letter, and that therefore you have disclosed the very thoughts of your Heart, doth mightily trouble me: but I trust in God, he will preserve you, and by your great Patience, Wisdom, and Industry, set His Majesties Affairs (to your great Honour) in a right posture once again; which if I might live to see, I would be glad to sing my <hi>Nunc dimittis.</hi>

                  <p>I pray (my Lord) accept my thanks for the poor Clergie there, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> who protests himself most infinitely obliged to you.</p>
                  <p>I heartily pray your Lordship to thank both the Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> and the Dean for their kind Letters, and the full account they have given me; but there is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that requires an Answer in either of them, saving that I find in the Deans Letter, that Mr. <hi>Alex.

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Received your Letters of the second of <hi>December</hi> upon the sixth of the same at night, and could not speak with His Majesty till this day. This day I did, and shewed him your Letters and the Deans; and I read to him more than the later half of all the long Discourse which the Dean wrote unto me, for His Majesty was very desinous to know what occasion you took to dissolve the Synod, and how you prosecuted it; in both which that Paper gave him great satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>With your Letters I have received three other Papers, that which s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ews you have keeped within your Instructions, the Copy of the Proclamation which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves the Assembly, and a Copy of the Councils Letter to the King; both which His Majesty takes to be very good Service done for him, and commands me to give your Grace thanks in his Name, which I am very glad to doe, and I doe it heartily.</p>
                  <p>For the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> I can say no more than I have already, though now I know him more perfectly than I did. Your Resolution was to put him from the Council-Table, if he refused the Kings Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enant; he hath now deserved it more, but whether it be a fit time as yet to proceed so far, I dare not determine here. This I am sure of, if he do now publickly adhere to the Covenant and the Assembly, nay be the professed Head of the Covenant, (as the Dean calls him;) yet he will have much ado to look right upon that, who ever looked asquint upon the Kings business.</p>
                  <p>Concerning your coming up to Court, I am glad I find His Majesty in that Opinion which I cannot chuse but be of, that is, to leave it to your self, and your own Iudgment upon the place, whether it be fitter for you to come or stay: for the truth is, my Lord, in my poor Iudgment the King must needs leave this to your self, or discern himself; for if he bids you come, you will not stay; and if he would have you stay, you will not come: but whether it be fittest to come or stay cannot be prudently judged here, therefore (my Lord) doe that which shall be best approved there for His Majesties Service. And as much as I desire to see you, I will be bold to adde this, that I hope you will not stir to come thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till you have so settled the Country, or at least the Kings Party there, as that you may be sure they may be safe, till further course for Security may be taken: for I do not know how much it may dishearten them if your Grace come away from them too soon.</p>
                  <p>In tender care of His Majesties both Safety and Honour, I have done and do daily call upon him for his Preparations. He protests he makes all the haste he can, and I believe him; but the jealousies of giving the Covenanters umbrage
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65282:65"/>
too soon, have made Preparations here so late. I doe all I can here with trouble and sorrow enough.</p>
                  <p>Here is News that three Ships-full more of Arms are come to <hi>Leith</hi> from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> whence have they money to buy all this? If this be true, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> hath watched a shrewd opportunity to quit the King for the late ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of his Ambassadour. And that which troubles me not a little is, that the Kings Party there (I doubt) is not half so well provided of Arms as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters are.</p>
                  <p>For the Money you mention, I wish with all my heart you had received it, for at the rising of the Assembly most miserable will be the Condition of them who have faithfully served God and the King. I have now again put it to the King, and he sees enough, but cannot well tell how to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elp it; yet this he said, If he could possibly scrape so much together, it should be had.</p>
                  <p>I pray be pleased to thank the Dean for his great pains, though it cost me the sitting up some part of the night to read it. His Letter, beside that Discourse, contains but two things, The necessity of a present shew of Force against the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Assembly, before men be urged to new Confederacies, and Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all things determined in this Assembly; The other, that some care may be had for the poor Ministers, who will be put to the greatest sufferings, and all for God and the King. And to these two I have said as much as I can, and shall daily labour with the King to doe all that may be done for them. I pray God bless your Lordship, but I am infinitely sorry so much Grace and Goodness of the Kings should be no better received. To Gods blessed Protection I leave you, and all your Endeavours, and shall ever shew my self</p>

They condemned all the Assemblies had been for forty years before, as prelimited and not Free; they declared Episcopacy unlawful, and contrary to the Laws of their Church: the same was the fate of the Service-book, Book of Canons, High-Commission, and the Articles of <hi>Perth.</hi> They appointed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be taken by all under pain of Excommunication, with their new Gloss against Episcopacy and the Ceremonies: and then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Processes of Bishops notwithstanding their Declinator, which was sure not to be sustained by them; for they being both Judges and Parties, would not fail to carry the matter as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65282:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
assuring them of the Kings Favour and Goodness. But now were all Peoples minds set on flame, every one expecting what should be the issue of this disorderly Affair.</p>
            <p>He begun again to talk with the Covenanters, according to the Kings Order for a continuance of Treating; but they received it with so much neglect, that he was scarce able to bear it: and sinding they did encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage themselves with the Kings Clemency, he resolved to prostitute the Offers of it no more. He found the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in some better posture at his return thither, than he had left it when he went to the West; forty good men were stolen into it with some Musquets and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Pistols, and abundance of Ammunition, and Provision for five weeks. This was carried with great cunning, for the Castle had been watched all the while: but when the Covenanters understood what was car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Marquis his Journey was delayed,<note place="margin">The Marquis indisposed through long Fatigue.</note> through an Indisposition of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, some days longer than he intended; and indeed (all things being considered) it was a wonder how either Body or Mind could hold out so long. His Negotiation was both painful and unprosperous: most of the day he was obliged to spend with unmanagable and unruly Spirits, and much of the night in writing Letters; for every third or fourth day he gave the King a large account of what passed, which was sometimes of the length of two sheets of all sides in close writing. This was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways seconded by another to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> of the same, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a greater length. Besides that, about other matters of course he wrote as often to the Earl of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and almost as often to Sir <hi>Henry Vane.</hi> And this was besides all his Letters up and down <hi>Scotland,</hi> most of which, particularly those to my Lord <hi>Huntley,</hi> (which were at least weekly) were all with his own Hand. And the most uneasie part of all was, that he was obliged to keep himself in a reserve almost with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body, there being very few about him whom he durst intirely trust: and certain it is, had not his Mind been of a great and undaunted stayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and calmness, the shocks he met with had dashed him to pieces.</p>
            <p>But having recovered his Health, &amp; put things in the best Order could be expected in the midst of so great Disorders, he took Journey to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> having committed the chief care of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi>; in who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">The sad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture Affairs were in.</note>THE Marquis his thoughts did bear him sad company during his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: the least painful of them was, that he knew he had many Enemies, who would impute the present Disorders to his Mismanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if not to his unfaithfulness; but those he quieted with his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in His Majesties Justice, and his own Integrity. And indeed any personal Hazard could meet him must have had small footing in a mind prepossessed with other thoughts. That which tormented him most (as appears by his Letters) was, that he saw inevitable Ruine hanging ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over his Master, or his Country, if not over both; since the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of either would prove fatal to both. To advise His Majesty to Treat any further, before he were in a posture to command as well as to treat, was so dishonourable that he could not think of it. He saw a Kingly way must be taken, but he knew well His Majesties Affairs were not in a very good posture. <hi>England</hi> had enjoyed a long quiet, and so both their Warlike Spirits and Preparations were much rusted: there was store of Factious Spirits among them, who would give heartless assistance to His Majesty in his Designs; and those who would be most forward, he knew were ready to drive His Majesties Resentments too far. He saw little hope of any Party to be made for the King in <hi>Scotland,</hi> except from the Marquis of <hi>Huntley.</hi> He knew the Covenanters would proceed as men desperate; and less heartiness could be expected from His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties hired Souldiers, than from such as had no hope but in their hands and actions. In a word, all things looked so cloudy to his discerning mind, that it proved a melancholy Journey to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The King highly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the Covenanters.</note>On the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> he came to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where he gave the King a true and ample Relation of all particulars. His Majesty was fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with his Carriage in every step of it, approving all he had done; but was so highly irritated at the Covenanters, that he resolved nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to think nor talk of Treating, till he should appear in a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable posture; judging it would render his Person and Government contemptible, not onely to all abroad, but to his other Subjects, and teach them to kick off his Authority, if after all the Affronts had been put upon his Laws and Condescensions he should be so tame as still to Treat; and therefore was resolved not to receive the Letter he knew was coming from the Assembly to him, backed with a Petition from the Lords. But the Marquis desired he would delay any such more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Breach, till he were ready to appear in the Field, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible before <hi>March.</hi> All His Majesties thoughts were now bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way of reducing <hi>Scotland</hi> to due Obedience, in which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis offered him his humble and hearty concurrence: for though his Affection to his Country and Friends did struggle strongly against his engaging further, yet it yielded to his Duty; but not so intirely, as to clear his Spirit of sad regrates. And in this he was not onely rivalled, but far out-stripped by his Soveraign, whose Sorrow keeping pace with his Affection and Interest, made this Expedition prove as sad as it was just.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:65282:66"/>The Design was thus laid down: His Majesty was to raise an Army of thirty thousand Horse and Foot, and to lead them in Person to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Scotland</hi>: He was to write to all the Nobility of <hi>England</hi>;<note place="margin">and resolves on a War;</note> to wait upon him to the Campagne with their Attendants, who should be maintained by His Majesties Pay: He was to put good Garrisons in <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Carlisle,</hi> two thousand in the former, and five hundred in the latter: He was at the same time to send a Fleet to ply from the <hi>Frith</hi> North-ward for stooping of Trade, and making a great Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for guarding the Coast: He was also to send an Army of five thousand men under the Marquis his Command to land in the North, and joyn with <hi>Huntley</hi>'s Forces: all which should be under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he retaining still the Character of Commissioner, with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of General of the Forces in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And with these he was, First, to make the North sure, and then to move South-ward, which might both make another great Diversion, and encourage such as wished well to His Majesties Service, who were the greater number in those Parts. Next, the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> was to land in <hi>Argyle-shire,</hi> upon his Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to <hi>Kyntire,</hi> and the old Fewds betwixt the <hi>Mackdonalds</hi> and <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi>; and he promised to bring with him ten or twelve thousand men. And last of all, the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was to draw together such Forces as could be levied and spared out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and come with another Fleet into <hi>Dumbriton-Frith</hi>; and for his encouragement, the Marquis desired him to touch at <hi>Arran,</hi> (that being the only place of his Interest which he could offer unto His Majesty) and he would be sure of all his Men there, (<hi>such naked Rogues as they were,</hi> is his own phrase.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, there were store of Cows in that Island for the provision of the Fleet, which he appointed should not be spared.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Design laid down for curbing the <hi>Scotish</hi> Insolences:<note place="margin">and layes down method<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuating of his design.</note> yet His Majesty firmly resolved, that when-ever they returned to their Obedience, he should not be inexorable. The first thing for prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Design, was the looking for Officers and Money: for the former, <hi>England</hi> was pretty scant; yet the best were sought out. On the second of <hi>February</hi> the King named the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> to be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> to be Lieutenant-General of the Foot, and the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> to command the Horse. Letters were also sent through the Counties for levying of Men, and Advertisements given to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to meet the King at <hi>York</hi> against the first of <hi>April. Antrim</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook bravely, and <hi>Strafford</hi> said, he should doe what was possible with all expedition. The Fleet was appointed presently to be rigged out; and Orders issued out for levying five thousand Souldiers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of the three gallant Colonels, <hi>Morton, Byron,</hi> and <hi>Harecoat,</hi> who should go with the Fleet without knowing whither they went. A Commission for the Lieutenantry of the North of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was sent to the Marquis of <hi>Huntley</hi>; but he was ordered to keep it up as long as was possible, and carefully to observe two things. One was, not to be the first Aggressor, except he were highly provoked, or His Majesties Authority signally affronted; the other was, that he should keep off with long Weapons, till His Majesty were on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; lest if he should begin sooner, the Covenanters might overwhelm him with their whole Force, and either ruine him, or force him to lay down his Arms. As for the Marquis his Employment, he told His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that though he was so far from declining his Service at such a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65282:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
time, that he should be infinitely troubled if he were not imployed: yet he desired the King might choose a fitter person for the Naval Forces, since he was altogether unacquainted with Sea-affairs, and not fit for such an important Service. But His Majesty looking upon this as an effect of his Modesty, gave no hearing to it; telling him, that as for Affairs purely Naval, Sir <hi>Iohn Pennington</hi> the Vice-admiral should go with him, and would abundantly supply his defects in that.</p>
               <p>But the getting of Money was the hardest part of all, for two hundred thousand pound <hi>Sterlin</hi> was all the Money the King could make account of. The Treasury was much exhausted; and an unlucky Accident fell in at that time, which put the King to much extraordinary Expence, the Queen-Mother of <hi>France</hi> coming over to <hi>England</hi>: yet the King found Himself able to doe well enough for the Summer following, but His Purse could not weather out another year.</p>
               <p>Thus did the King frame and prosecute His Design, with the Secret whereof very few were trusted; it being communicated to none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reserve, save to <hi>Canterbury, Arundel</hi>; Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> and by Letters to <hi>Strafford,</hi> but above all to the Marquis.</p>
               <p>But here this Narration must be stopt, that we may take a view of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters prepare for War.</note> and of the Power and Practices of the <hi>Covenanters.</hi> In the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> there was a full Meeting of them at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where they first resolved to send a Gentleman to the King, with the Assemblies Letter, and a Petition from themselves, full of Submission to the King, Invectives against the Marquis, and Justifications of their Procedure in all things, particularly in the late Assembly: which they doubted not, they should make appear in the ensuing Parliament, of the holding whereof they seemed to make no question. With this the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> wrote a general Vindication of his own Behaviour; and these Letters were sent to Court by Mr. <hi>Winram.</hi> His Majesty received their Petition, but resolved to give it such an Answer in due time as their Behaviour deserved: but he wrote back to <hi>Argyle,</hi> that he should be willing to receive from his own mouth a Vindication of his late Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, though it seemed scarce capable of any. The Covenanters their next, and indeed chief care, was, to fortifie themselves against what they knew in reason they might quickly expect. Orders were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given through all the Shires of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that a Committee of War should sit in every Shire, Souldiers be listed and trained, and a Commissioner sent from every County, to lie at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and transmitting of Orders. Great care was also taken to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Country with Arms and Ammunition, Merchants were sent every where to buy up all were to be had, and in a short time there were Arms for above thirty thousand men brought to <hi>Scotland</hi>; and particular Orders were given, that none should be sold, but to such as were well-affected to the Cause. Strong and strict Guards were set about the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> so that it being but hitherto ill furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, little was to be expected from it; wherefore <hi>Ruthwen</hi> would not shut himself up within it, but went to offer his Service to His Majesty, where he might be more useful. They were also careful to fortifie <hi>Leith,</hi> apprehending hazard from the Kings Fleet; and about fifteen hundred of all Sexes, yea and all Qualities, for encouraging of others, wrought about it till the Fortifications were compleated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:65282:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>But of all men the Ministers were the busiest: the Pulpits did ring with the Ruine of Religion and Liberties; and that all might look for Popery and Bondage, if they did not now quit themselves like men.<note place="margin">and are much inflamed by the Ministers.</note> Curses were thundred out against those <hi>who went not out to help the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord against the mighty,</hi> (so oddly was the Scripture applied;) and to set off this the better, all was carried on with many Fasts and Prayers: and they forgot not to pretend much Duty and Affection to the King; but the Bishops and his other ill Councellours (as they called them) got the blame of all, and none more than the Marquis. By these means it was, that the poor and well-meaning People were animated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great extremities of Zeal, resolving to hazard all in pursuance of the Cause: for they were told, that the design was to reduce <hi>Scotland</hi> to a Province under the Power of the <hi>English,</hi> whose Oppression they must resolve to bear if they stood not now to their own Defence. Upon this it was that the Committees for War, which were held in the several Shires about the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> found small resistance, and no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of levying Men; greater numbers being offered than could be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther armed or maintained.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the Session met with great trouble from the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;<note place="margin">The Session is disturbed.</note> for the greater number of the Lords of the Session being resolved not to own the Assembly, all such Petitions wherein the Bishops were not designed as they ought to have been, but were called either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Bishops, or late Ministers of the Places where they served before their Promotion, were rejected: and some Signatures being offered in Exchequer, wherein they were so designed, <hi>Traquair</hi> took them and tore them to pieces. Of all this the Covenanters complained, as if Justice were denied; but it was told them, that if they went to force the Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would be High Treason, and that they would never yield to them. But the four Covenanting Lords of the Session having passed Petitions wherein the Bishops were so called, these were stopt at the Signet. The Covenanters made also great Complaints to the Council, of some persons who had written to <hi>England</hi> of their Designs to invade it; of which they protested themselves innocent, and craved liberty to pursue their Slanderers: but that was laid aside, only a Letter was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about it to the King. Yet all, at least most, of the Council, what through fear, what through inclination, went along with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters; and such as stood firm to their Duty were forced to fly into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Covenanters made sure work of all the Shires;<note place="margin">They become Masters of all <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> onely in <hi>Twed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale Traquair</hi> resisted them a little, and got their Meetings to be desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for two or three Diets; but that was all he could doe. In <hi>Teviot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> the Earl of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> kept all right, and begun to levy men as well as others; but he was faintly followed. The Marquis of <hi>Douglass</hi> was not able to doe His Majesty that Service his Illustrious Ancestours had done the former Kings; for himself was a Papist, and so not followed by the Friends and Dependers of that Noble Family: so that all the Marquis could doe, was to go and wait upon His Majesty, and offer his House of <hi>Tentallon</hi> to be made use of as the King pleased. But the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters seized both it and his House of <hi>Douglass:</hi> and thus all on the South of <hi>Tay</hi> was lost without stroke of Sword. But in <hi>Angus</hi> the Earls of <hi>Airly</hi> and <hi>Southesk</hi> made more vigorous resistance to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the Covenanters, and were able to have made that Country

good for the King, but could not withstand the Force came upon them from other Places. They all armed, and Earl <hi>Airly</hi> stood out to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, but <hi>Southesk</hi> was fitter for a Council than a Camp; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inevitable Ruine to follow, since the Kings Preparations went on so slowly, he struck sail and came to <hi>Edinburgh. Huntley</hi> gave them more trouble: for my Lord of <hi>Montrose</hi> and <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> with some others, coming to hold a Committee at <hi>Turreff</hi> in that County, he gathered so many together, and came so near them, that they were forced to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse themselves; yet he kept up his Commission of Lieutenantry, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely in the quality of a Peer and Councellour. But they resolved, since they could doe nothing against him with the men of that Shire, to bring a Body from other Places to ruine him. The want which pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Covenanters most at first was, of good Officers; and this made General <hi>Lesley</hi> (who at that time had acquired much Fame in the Wars of <hi>Germany</hi>) get an earnest Invitation sent him from the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> in the name of the Covenante<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, to come home to command their Forces: upon which he did quit his Employment there, and came to <hi>Scotland</hi> with many other Commanders. He was chosen their General, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Service with much Joy. And this was the Posture and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which I draw from the Letters that are yet extant, written to the Marquis from the Lords of <hi>Traquair, Huntley, Airly,</hi> and <hi>Roxburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mean-while the King went on, making all the haste with his Levies and Preparations that was possible, in which none acted his part with more Fidelity and better Dispatch than the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who was Admiral, and discharged what was committed to him so well, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was defective that concerned the Fleet. But the Marquis found the Hearts of many of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility both backward and cold; and in particular he assured the King, that he saw much Heartiness was not to be expected from some of the general Officers; which the King apprehending,<note place="margin">The King emits his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Reasons of the War.</note> trusted them as little as was possible. About the middle of <hi>March</hi> the King published a Declaration of the Reasons of his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition against <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was followed by a larger one, commonly called the Large Declaration or <hi>Manifesto,</hi> penned by <hi>Balcanqual,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised by His Majesty: in which a full account was given of the rise and progress of the Combustions of <hi>Scotland</hi>; of which no more shall be said, it being so commonly known, save that from the account hath been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it will appear, how unjustly that Book was charged to be full of Lies and Calumnies.</p>

It is true, much could not be made; but that could not wipe off their stain, who yielded that impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and important Place so faintly. The occasion of their negligence
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65282:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was, that a Gentlewoman of good Quality was sent in under pretence of visiting the Captain of the Castle, to keep him in discourse: she di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him, and engaged him to play at Cards, so that they were about his ears, before he was apprehensive of danger. <hi>Dumbriton</hi> run the same fate, it being surrendred by Sir <hi>William Stewart</hi>; whose only excuse was, that at his coming down the former year, he found the whole Garrison Covenanters, that he durst not turn them off, nor take on new Souldiers without a powerful assistance; and so finding them resolved both to deliver him and the Castle up, he could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alone: besides that he was unprovided of every thing that was necessary for a Siege. The next day after the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> was seized, the Covenanters went to the Session to force the Lords to take the Covenant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>Their next Attempt was upon <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> whither <hi>Traquair</hi> retired with a small Company: and he without stroke of Sword surrendred it, for which his Courage seemed more blame-worthy than his Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty. But his greatest fault was, that he yielded up the <hi>Regalia,</hi> the Crown and Scepter which lay there, and carried them not with him: neither did he spoil the Arms that lay there, which since he could not carry with him, he ought to have done, and not to have left them to strengthen the Enemy. But from this he hasted to meet the King at <hi>York. Roxburgh</hi>'s Misfortune followed this; his County being upon the Borders was of great importance for the Kings Service, and he kept it in pretty good order, till <hi>Munro</hi> came with some Forces out of other Shires: but his Son Lord <hi>Ker,</hi> whom he left with the Trust of all, (going himself to wait on the King) turned over to the Covenant. The News of this overtook <hi>Roxburgh</hi> in his Journey, in which he made the more haste, that he might be the first who should give the King an account of that unlucky Adventure, whereby he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all Jealousies against himself.</p>
               <p>The King set out from <hi>London</hi> the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and came to <hi>York</hi> the first of <hi>April.</hi> The first blast of this Storm fell on <hi>Huntley,</hi> against whom the Covenanters sent a great Force both of Horse and Foot with some Cannon, commanded by the Earls of <hi>Montrose</hi> and <hi>Marshal.</hi> But Marquis <hi>Huntley</hi> finding himself unable to resist them, retired in some disorder to <hi>Turreff,</hi> and they followed him, taking <hi>Aberdeen</hi> in their way; which had hitherto stood for the King, but was now forced to render, the Bishop with the Doctors escaping by Sea to <hi>Berwick.</hi> At <hi>Turreff</hi> My Lord <hi>Huntley</hi> laid down Arms, where treating with them, by a surprize he and his Son the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> were taken Prisoners, and brought over, and committed to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>

And this, with other Stories of the like truth, was put in to swell the Charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in against him some years after this; yet it is strange that when the Viscount of <hi>Aboyne,</hi> who was <hi>Huntley</hi>'s second Son, came to wait upon

                  </gap>s there appear the least vestige of his alledging any thing to the Marquis his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. The ground of the Story is this, the Marquis had written in the Kings Name, and by his Order, to the Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> when he sent him the Commission of Lieutenantry (as hath been said) to beware as much as was possible, that he should not be the first Aggressor, till His Majesty were upon the Borders; for the King knew that <hi>Huntley</hi> could not resist all the Covenanters Forces, and to make a powerful Diversion when the King should be dealing with them in the South, was all could be expected from him. Likewise, the Marquis failed not to give weekly Advertisements of the progress of the Kings Preparations; which appears both from <hi>Huntley</hi>'s Letters to the Marquis, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Returns he gave them, that are yet extant: and therefore there remains nothing upon this account to charge or suspect the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis his Fidelity.</p>

               <p>Having received these Orders he held on his Course, and on the first of <hi>May</hi> he entred the <hi>Frith,</hi> and found the fittest place to cast Anchor in was <hi>Leith-Road.</hi> The Covenanters had committed a great escape, in not building a Fort on <hi>Inchkeith</hi>; which might have occasioned much trouble to him, besides that it would have kept that Place from him, which proved of great use to his weary Souldiers. As soon as he came thither, Fires were presently set up on all the Hills to gather the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for the defence of the Coast, which they expected he should have set on immediately. But he was first to get the Proclamation publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wherefore that same night he sent one ashore with a Letter to the Clerk of the Council, commanding him to come aboard. He wrote al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the Magistrates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to send him to him. The Bearer of these Letters was used civilly, but kept as a Prisoner; and the Town-Council of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> excused themselves from sending the Clerk of the Council to him. The Clerk also wrote to him, that he was kept by Force from coming to wait upon him. Next day he landed his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on <hi>Inchkeith</hi> and <hi>Inchcolm,</hi> (two little Islands in the <hi>Frith</hi>;) one of them upon the former, and two on the latter, both for giving them air, and exercising them. He caused also search and cleanse the Wells of these Places, which gave great relief: but at this time the Small Pox got among his Men, whereupon he put all the Infected in Ships by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; some few died. Yet for all the stories were made of his Mens dying below Decks, very few died during his whole stay at Sea; and he divided his care so equally among them, and was so obliging to them all, that they not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And next day at the hour wherein it ought to have been published, he caused loose some Peece of Ordnance: but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> desired a delay of three days; to which he yielded because he was willing it might fall out so, that as soon as the eight days

                     <p>It is true, that His Majesty sent me hither to accommodate these Affairs in a peaceable manner, if it were possible, which I have laboured to doe; and accordingly my Deportment hath been, which hath been met with that Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if I had met with the greatest Enemy: but your refusing to publish His Majesties Grace to his People, signified in his Proclamation, hath taken away that Power which otherwise I had; that being a Liberty taken to your selves, which never any Loyal Subjects assumed in any Monarchy. You alledge many Reasons for your selves, of the Illegality of that Proclamation; but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant, that your Carriage hath forced many of these principal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours for safeguard of their Lives to forsake the Kingdom, out of which they remain yet for the same cause. You have suppressed the Printing of all Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65282:73"/>
but what is warranted by Mr. <hi>Alexander Henderson,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Archibald Johnstown:</hi> neither was the Clerk of the Council, whom I sent for twice to give him Directions concerning this Business, permitted to come aboard to me, upon Conference with whom (for any thing you know) I might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to come ashore my self, and convened a Council for the Publication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the ordinary way. But your extraordinary Proceedings in all things must needs force from His Majesty some things, which perhaps you may think not ordinary. Whereas you desire me to be a means that your Supplications may have free access to His Majesties Ears, it is a work of no difficulty; for His Majesty hath never stopt his Ears to the Supplications of any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, when they have been presented to him in that humble and fitting way which became dutiful Subjects: nor did I ever refuse any all the time I was among you, or conceal any part of them from His Majesty. So that your Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation of not being heard, is grounded upon the same false Foundations that your other Actions are; and serves onely for a means to delude the simple Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that by making them believe what you have a mind to possess them with, they may become backers of your unwarranted Actions; which as it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lamented by all His Majesties good Subjects, so it is more particularly by me, who have had the Honour to be imployed in this Business with so bad Success.</p>

On this River standeth the Town of <hi>Innernesse,</hi> which hath a strong Castle, in the keeping of the Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> as yet not taken: if in this Town and Castle were put a competent Garrison, with a Ship and Pinnace in the Bay, you might break the Ferry-boats, and stop all Passages from North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of that River.</p>
                           <p>The River of <hi>Tay</hi> falleth out of a Lake ten miles long, and one and an half broad, from whence the River hath the name, which is the main and onely Passage between the North and the South parts of the Kingdom. This River falleth into the East Sea below <hi>Dundie,</hi> the biggest Town almost in <hi>Scotland.</hi> At the entry to the Sea it is two miles broad, and continueth the same breadth upward till within three or four miles of <hi>Saint Johnstown,</hi> between which Town and <hi>Dundie</hi> there are <hi>16</hi> miles and above, at no part whereof there is any Passage but by Ferry-boats. If a few Ships would ride at the mouth of this River below <hi>Dundie,</hi> and send up some small Pinnaces, they might break all the Ferry-boats, and stop all the Passages that could be made over at any part, between the North of the River and the said Town of <hi>Saint Johnstown,</hi> above which to the said Lake the River is not ridable, but at some few Fords; the Passages whereof might be kept by the Noblemen who stand well-affected to His Majesties Service, and whose Estates do lie thereabouts in <hi>Strathern:</hi> such as the Earls of <hi>Airly, Perth, Tullibardin,</hi> and <hi>Kinnowl,</hi> who if they were sent home with a competent number of Souldiers to attend them, all those of their Name, their Friends and Tenants gathered unto them, might stop all Land-passages whatsoever from North to South.</p>

                           <p>These four Noblemen, with the number Your Majesty will send with them, might be sent almost to their Dwellings by Sea on the said River.</p>

It was far by my Expectation, and your Graces Oath and Promise, that you should ever come in any chiefCommand against your Native Country. Whereas your Grace doth challenge our coming in such numbers to attend this Parliament, I hope you conceive that this Navy and Army upon the Borders, and the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion threatned in the West, do sufficiently warrant our Preparations to defend these places, and divert such dangers. That Proclamation that is said to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry so much Grace and Goodness, is as destitute of that, as your Invasion is of a good Warrant; which persuades me, that neither of the two proceeds from His Majesties own Gracious Disposition. I cannot stand here to answer all these misconceived particulars, contained in your Graces Letter; but if I had the Honour to see your Grace, before any more mischief be done, I dare engage my Honour and my Life to clear all these Imputations laid on our Proceedings; and I can demonstrate how hardly we have been used without any just reason. I dare not be answerable to God Almighty, and to that Duty I owe my Prince and Country, if I do not shew your Grace, that your going a little further in this violent and unjust way will put all from the hopes of Recovery, for which both a great deal of Blame from Men, and Iudgment from above shall attend you, as the special Instrument, which I wish you labour to evite. If our Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be intended, we are confident in that Majesty who owns this Cause, and is able to defend it: and if onely Terrours to fright, and prepare us to accept of any Conditions will be offered, that Intention is already as far disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as any of these many former. But as we are ready to defend, so ever to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in supplicating, and using all humble and lawful means, as becomes us.

                        <hi>I</hi> Have received your Lordships Letter signed by you, but I cannot conceive it of your Lordships enditing; for I believe you would not have sent such an one to me, if you had not had some malignant spirits busied in the framing of it; for you cannot but remember that my words were never other, than that I would die at my Masters feet, and that I would prove an Enemy to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of my Power to this Kingdom, if my Countrymen continued in their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy: and here I set it under my Hand, that I will (by Gods Grace) make it good. It is true, knowing my own inability, I neither desired, nor indeed willingly did accept, the Conduct of an Army against this Nation; but my backwardness proceeded not out of a desire not to be imployed against such in this Country as were disobedient, but that His Majesty might have found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more able to have served him: but since he hath been pleased to trust me, I will not deceive him.</p>
                     <p>You pass by many particulars in your Answer to my Letter untouched, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you cannot stand here to answer them. It is most true, they are not to be answered, and so I take it. As for your own Iustification, it is the same which you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>You say, If I go any further in a violent course, it will be past all hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. If I doe, none can blame my Master, for that can never be called Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which is onely to suppress Rebellion: and if I proceed to execute his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands therein, you are the causers of it.

               <p>After this the Marquis was assaulted with thundering Letters from all Hands, both from Ministers and Noblemen. Many of these Letters, with the Copies of his Answers, are yet extant, and run in a strain very far from any thing of Friendship or Correspondence; indeed they look liker Challenges than Letters of Civility. The Covenanters desired a Safe Conduct for such as they should send to him to treat with him: but he answered, he was the Kings Commissioner, and so would give no Conduct for any of his Subjects coming to wait upon him. And after a days Advisement, they sent the Lord <hi>Lindsay</hi> (the Marquis his Brother-in-law) aboard with a Petition of the former strain, who told the Marquis, that they would lay down their Lives sooner than pass from what they had done; that their Army consisted of 25000 Men: they knew the Kings Cavalry was better than theirs, but their Infantry exceeded his far. After some Discourse had passed, (all before Witnesses) the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis dismissed him. In the mean while all Trade was stopt, and every Vessel that belonged to <hi>Scotland</hi> was seized: onely such as took an Oath for adhering to the King against the present Rebellion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were let go, according to His Majesties Orders. One Vessel was taken which was of more Importance, having in her about twenty Officers, who were coming home from <hi>Germany</hi> upon <hi>Lesley</hi>'s Invitation. All these the Marquis sent to <hi>Berwick.</hi> He sent also a free Advice to the King, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him of all he knew of their Strength: and that besides the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which was marching to the Borders, there were about 20000 Men lying on both sides of the <hi>Frith,</hi> so that his being there made a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diversion. He besought His Majesty not to hazard on a Battel, the success whereof was always dubious, but more than commonly so in this case, where the one side was desperate, and the other but half cordial. He told His Majesty, how much he feared his Foot might be too weak, wherefore he desired His Majesty to consider, if he would call for two of His Regiments; since all the three were not sufficient for him to land with them, and march into the Country, and one was enough to burn the Coast, which was all he could doe: and for that he was resolved not to fail in it as soon as he had Orders; adding, that in a Fortnight he would doe all that could be done that way: after which he thought it would be fittest, that he went Northward, and landed His Regiments there, (which must be supplied another way, if His Majesty called for any of them) where some good might be done. But as for Treating, he desired His Majesty would imploy others in it, if that were to be done; for he confessed his Spirit was so irritated against them, that he desired
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65282:76"/>
neither to see nor meddle with them: onely he told His Majesty, that the Covenanters had addressed both their Letters and Petitions to some <hi>English</hi> Lords, which he thought they should have brought to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty unopened, and given no other Answers but such as His Majesty or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>On the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> he received the following Letter from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</p>

               <p>And the day following Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> wrote to him to send two of his Regiments to <hi>Holy-Island,</hi>

The Paper follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE whole Discourse (so far as I can remember of it) may be reduced to these Heads.</hi>

                  <hi>Their Invitation of your Excellence to go in person to His Majesty, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their Desires, and to mediate for an Accommodation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this your Excellence answered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, that having full Power from His Majesty to treat and conclude of all things concerning that Business, you held it unnecessary to go to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:65282:77"/>
                  <hi>Secondly, your Excellence thought it unfit, you having so great a Charge here, which required your presence, and they having propounded nothing that could give sufficient occasion to such a Voyage to undertake it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, that if the distance from His Majesty were thought by them to be a hindrance to the Treaty, they might address themselves to His Majesty by such of the Nobility as were about him, who was not distant above threescore and twelve miles from the Leaguer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They replied, that things would be more facilitated by your Excellence's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, wishing, that as you had a part in the beginning of these Affairs, you might have the Honour to put an end to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Excellence returned, that the Lords</hi> Traquair <hi>and</hi> Roxburgh, <hi>who were now with His Majesty, were imployed in them before you; which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, but wished it had never been, confessing that they were spoiled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had the managing of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning a Cessation of Acts of Hostility, both by Sea and upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, where they complained of divers Insolencies committed by the Horse-troops of His Majesty; your Excellence answered, That in what concerned the first, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ad committed none since your coming hither: true it was, you had stayed and taken many Barques and Boats, but some of them you had dismissed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching any thing that they had in them; and these from whom you did take to supply your uses, you had paid them for it: that this day you had sent to</hi> Burnt-Island, <hi>and would doe so to other Places, to offer them full permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Trade, provided they would swear not to carry Arms against His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and take the Oath of Fidelity; and for the Fishermen you required no Oath.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>As for the ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er, namely some pretended Insolences upon the Frontiers, you kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ere was any it was their fault, by their deferring to return to their Obedience to His Majesty: and when they made Instance in some particulars, your Excellence did cut them short, and said, That it was an unfit thing, and nothing conducible to make an end of Business, for them to stand upon those Punctilio's with their Soveraign; and for your particular, you would never be an Instrument of any dishonourable Act to His Majesty, such as would be the engaging him not to correct the Misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours of his Subjects: that you had made a like Answer when you was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for Pass-ports to those that should come to you; which you had reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as judging it dishonourable for His Majesty to grant, or any of his Subjects to ask or capitulate with His Majesty for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They pressed to know what His Majesty required of them, and what would be the extent of his condescending to their Desires in point of Conscience, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching Bishops, and the Acts of the last General Assembly; wherein they said if they might have satisfaction, they would cast at His Majesties feet their Bodies and Fortunes, to be disposed of at his Pleasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In answer to this your Excellence caused me read His Majesties Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein desiring to be cleared of His Majesties Intentions, in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the Civil Obedience, your Excellence said, it was the retiring with their Troops, laying down t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for the enjoying of Liberty of Religion, wherein likewise they did press to know how far His Majesty would condescend to their humble Supplications, as likewise in the point of the Acts of the last pretended General Assembly, your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65282:77"/>
answered, It would be so far as the Laws of the Kingdom did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They asked who should judge of these Laws, and of their intention, and if it might be decided by a General Assembly: Your Excellence answered, Yes, and that either His Majesty would call one, or your self, as His Majesties High Commissioner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They desired to know if His Majesty would stand to the Award of such an Assembly, especially in what concerned the Acts of the later.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Excellence answered, His Majesty was not bound to it, as having his Negative Voice; which they not acknowledging, your Excellence added, that notwithstanding you were confident, that whatsoever should be agreed on by such an Assembly, called by His Majesties Command, and where the Members should be legally chosen, His Majesty would not onely consent unto them, but have them ratified in Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They desired your Excellence would limit them a time wherein to return, and treat further with you, with full power to conclude all things wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired not to be pressed with scantness of time, in regard of the Nobilities being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed in several places of the Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Excellence answered, it should be when themselves would, were it to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow or a moneth hence; for you assured them, they would find you so long in these quarters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly, they desired to know, what they might report of what your Excellence had assured them of His Majesties Intentions concerning Religion and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your Excellence answered, that as they brought no Commission to treat of all these particulars, but kept themselves within the limits of the Contents in their Letters, you would doe accordingly in your Answer, and that in writing they should receive something to morrow.</hi>
               </p>

As for Money, he was limited by the King; and for Men, he had sent away the two Regiments that same day; and since he expected Orders every Hour from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty for somewhat to be executed by the third Regiment, he could not weaken it too much: yet he sent a few Officers, the chief of whom was Colonel <hi>Gun,</hi> together with some Ammunition, and four small Peece of Artillery. And of all this he gave an account to His Majesty, adding, that perhaps some might misrepresent his lying so long idle; but His Majesty knew what Orders himself had given, it being his part to obey: yet he earnestly craved liberty to doe somewhat worth the while; to which he received the following Answer.</p>

But a strange Accident befell him the next day; for as he went out in a small Vessel with a Drake on her, and 60 Souldiers, to view the <hi>Queensferry,</hi> and burn the Ships that lay in the Harbour, he saw a Merchant-barque coming down towards him, and he caused row up to her: but she perceiving her Danger, run her self aground upon the Sands of <hi>Barnbougle.</hi> The Tide falling apace, and he following her indeliberately, run himself likewise on ground; where he was like to have been very quickly taken by the men on the Shoar, who were playing upon him and some Volleys passed upon both hands. But they on the Land were waiting till the Waters should

fall, reckoning him their Prey already, which had been inevitable, had not the Seamen got out, and being almost to the middle in Water, with great tugging set them afloat; and so he returned safe to the Fleet.

And to perswade the King to this Course was the easier, that both his Reason and his Affection to his Subjects did cooperate with it; a great strengthening coming to it by my Lord <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Opinion, who saw a Pacification absolutely necessary for the Kings Service, and did advise it.</p>
               <p>So on the thirteenth of <hi>Iune</hi> His Majesty returned Answer, <hi>That he supposed Religion and Liberties were abundantly settled by his former Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations: but if any thing was wanting, wherein either Religion or Liberties were concerned, none should be more zealous for it than himself.</hi> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters

                           <p>And for settling the general Distractions of that Our Ancient Kingdom, Our Will and Pleasure is, that a Free General Assembly be kept at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> the sixth day of <hi>August</hi> next ensuing, where We intend (God willing) to be personally present, and for the Legal Indiction whereof, We have given Orders and Command to Our Council; and thereafter a Parliament to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>And whereas We are further desired, that Our Ships and Forces by Land be recalled, and all Persons, Goods and Ships be res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65282:81"/>
Forts, and Ammunitions of all sorts, as likewise Our Royal Honours; and to every one of Our good Subjects their Liberties, Lands, Houses, Goods and Means whatsoever, taken and detained from them, since the late pretended General Assembly, We will presently thereafter recall Our Fleet and retire Our Land-Forces, and cause Restitution to be made to all persons, of their Ships and Goods detained or arrested since the aforesaid time: whereby it may appear, that Our Intention in taking up of Arms was no ways for inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Our Own Native Kingdom, or to innovate the Religion and Laws, but mainly for the maintaining and vindicating of Our Royal Authority.</p>
                           <p>And since that hereby it doth clearly appear, that We neither have, nor do intend any Alteration in Religion and Laws, but that both shall be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Vs in their full Integrity, We expect the performance of that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dutiful Obedience, which becometh loyal and dutiful Subjects, and as in their several Petitions they have often professed.</p>
                           <p>And as We have Iust Reason to believe, that to Our peaceable and well-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Subjects this will be satisfactory; so We take God and the World to witness, that whatsoever Calamities shall ensue by Our necessitated suppressing of the Insolencies of such as shall continue in their Disobedient Courses, is not occasioned by Vs, but by their own procurement.</p>

               <p>The Treaty being thus ended,<note place="margin">The Treaty is variously cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.</note> all parted with great expressions of Joy. But few wise men expected it should be followed with a lasting Agreement, the Covenanters being peremptory not to part with a hoof, so that whatever Concessions came not up to all their Desires, were not like to prove satisfactory. Those who understood not the true state of the <hi>English</hi> Army, wondered that the King should have let this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity out of his hands, whereby they judged he was able to have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and subdued <hi>Scotland.</hi> And according to the vulgar Civility of of all Censurers of Kings Actions, his bad Counsellours bore the blame, whereof the far greatest share fell upon the Marquis. But others who saw beyond those superficial Observers, acknowledged there was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual temperature of Wisdom and Goodness in His Majesties Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, not denying a proportionable share of the praise to his good Counsellours. The Covenanters judged they had scaped well, who got off so easily; for it would have been impossible for them, to have maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great Bodies they had gathered together any longer, except they had marched into <hi>England,</hi> to which they had no mind unless forced by necessity. But some made another Observation though of less mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet not unpleasant, upon Mr. <hi>Henderson's</hi> signing the former Paper, That it was strange to see a Church-man who had acted so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously against Bishops for their meddling in Civil Affairs, made a Commissioner for this Treaty, and sign a Paper so purely Civil; so strongly does Passion and Interest biass and turn men.</p>
               <p>When the Commissioners came back to the Camp,<note place="margin">A Paper is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out for the Conditions of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though not agreed to.</note> they gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Negotiation; and besides the Articles of Treaty, they produced another Paper which passed among all for the Conditions of the Agreement. It was a Note containing some Points which were alledged to have been agreed to at <hi>Berwick</hi> verbally, though not set down in the written Treaty: which was made up of some down-right Mistakes, and of other things which the King in discourse had indeed said, but not positively, nor as a Determination on which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. However the Army made a Declaration, that their accepting of the Kings Papers wherein the Assembly of <hi>Glasgow</hi> was called <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Assembly,</hi> did not infer their accounting it so which they could never do. Yet all the Forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s withdrew, most of them laying down Arms, but still keeping in great Bodies together; and a Proclamation
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65282:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was sent to the North to <hi>Montrose</hi> on the one side, &amp; <hi>Aboyne</hi> on the other, to lay down Arms, (for all this while there had been a Body of about 2000 that had stood for the King in <hi>Aberdeenshire,</hi> who were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my Lord <hi>Bamf,</hi> against whom my Lord <hi>Montrose</hi> was sent:) and these Orders were obeyed by them both; and indeed they came in good time to <hi>Aboyne,</hi> otherwise he had been sore put to it.</p>
               <p>On the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> the Marquis was ordered to go to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Marquis receives, and furnishes the Castle of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
                  </note> and take possession of it in the Kings Name, and relieve the Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and put <hi>Ruthwen</hi> (now created Lord <hi>Estrick</hi>) in it; and also to furnish it with store of Provision and Ammunition out of the Magazine in the Navy: which being done, the Fleet was to be sent out of the <hi>Frith.</hi> And accordingly on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> he came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but he met with such Reproaches and Hootings from the Vulgar, that he was forced (for preventing a Tumult) to desire some of the Covenanting Lords to wait on him to the Castle; and yet on the way he was all along cried out upon with most unworthy Names, as <hi>Pyrate, Traitour, Enemy to God and his Country,</hi> with other such-like Invectives. These he could not but despise, though he was sensible of the Dishonour put upon the Kings Commissioner by that Usage: yet he might well have expected, that it should have secured him from the Jealousies &amp; Stories which were spread of him, as if he had been all that time so popular, that he was looked upon as the chief Friend of the Good Cause; which was as well grounded as the rest of these Reports. But having executed the Kings Orders about the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he left the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> (whom with the Earl of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> His Majesty had again received into his Favour) to see the rest of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions fulfilled.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tables</hi> continued to sit,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tables</hi> continue to sit,</note> pretending it was necessary they should doe so till all were scattered. It is true, I have in my hands a Copy of a Warrant for them to sit till the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi>; but whether it was signed, I can neither assert nor deny.</p>
               <p>Divers Disorders fell out in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and <hi>Traquair</hi> met with many Insolences, in one of which the White-staff, which was carried by his Servant before his Coach, was pulled out of his Hand; and Complaint being made of this to the Town-Council of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> all the Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they offered, was to bring my Lord Treasurer another White-staff: so it was said, they rated the Affront put on the King in the Person of his Treasurer at Six pence.</p>
               <p>Other Insolences were also complained of, and the Covenanters part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excused them,<note place="margin">and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters are insolent.</note> partly denied what was alledged; but no Reparation was made. These Disorders obliged His Majesty to change his purpose of coming to <hi>Scotland</hi> in Person, resolving to be present onely by his Commissioner.</p>
               <p>The Marquis returned to His Majesty, and stated all that was to be thought upon for <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs in a Paper presented to His Majesty at <hi>Berwick</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> yet extant in these words.</p>

<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>The Marquis his advice to the King.</hi>
                              </note>WHether the Assembly and Parliament now indicted is fittest to be held or discharged?</p>
                           <p>If held, the Success of the Assembly will be the Ratisying of what was done at <hi>Glasgow;</hi> or if that point be gained, yet certainly most of the Acts that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65282:82"/>
were made there will of new enacted: nor is there any hope to prevent their finding Episcopacy to be abjured by their Covenant, and the Function against the Constitution of their Church.</p>
                           <p>This will be by the Members of Parliament ratified, and put to the Kings Negative Voice; and if it be not condescended to by him, it is more than probable, that his Power even in that Court, and in that Place, will be questioned.</p>
                           <p>If it will be discharged, nevertheless the Assembly be keeped by the Rebels, and the same things done in it by them, and thereafter maintained by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Kingdom, this consequently will bring alongst with it the certain loss of Civil Authority, and so necessitate the re-establishing the same by Force, or otherwise the desertion of that Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>So it is to be resolved on, whether it be fit to give way to the Madness of the People, or of new to intend a Kingly Way?</p>
                           <p>If way be given to what is mentioned, it is to be considered in that case, if the King shall be personally present or not; if not present, who shall be imployed, and how instructed?</p>
                           <p>If the Kingly Way be taken, what shall be the means to effectuate the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed end: particularly how Money may be levied for the waging of this War, and if that be feisible without a Parliament?</p>
                           <p>If a Parliament, what the Consequence may prove? So all may be summed up in this; Whether to permit the Abolishing of Episcopacy, the lessening of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power in Ecclesiastick Affairs, the Establishing Civil Authority in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Iniquity of the Times will suffer, and to expect better; and what will be the Consequence of this if way be given thereto: or to call a Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> and leave the event thereof to hazard and their discretions, and in the interim <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Government of the Covenanters?</p>

               <p>This Freedom declares how candidly he dealt with the King in all his Counsels. It is true, he pressed the King earnestly to give way to the abolishing of Bishops, judging that to be the onely mean to bring <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> again into Order: but this was out of no other Principle, save his Desire to see the King again enjoy the Affections, as well as the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, of his Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi>; thinking Episcopal Government not so essential or absolutely necessary, as not to be parted with for a time in such an Exigency, wherein the Ruine of the King and Kingdom was was so manifestly threatned.</p>
               <p>His Majesty considering that God did not tie him to Impossibilities,<note place="margin">The King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to send him again Commissioner into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  </note> resolved, notwithstanding his Conscientious adhering to Episcopacy in <hi>England,</hi> to give way for some time to lay aside that Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> hoping to draw more good from it; but intended to imploy another for executing it, knowing that his Countenance and Carriage would betray the Discord was betwixt his Heart and his Actions, if he went himself: and being well satisfied with the Marquis his Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, desired him to return to <hi>Scotland</hi> in the same Character, and finish that Business.</p>
               <p>But he made use of all his Forces both of Reason, Friendship,<note place="margin">who opposes it with all his Interest.</note> and Interest, to divert the King from this, representing the following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to dissuade him from it, in a Paper presented the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> in these words.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> I am thought to have been a chief Instrument in moving Your Majesty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their Carriage in such sort as you have done: which will cause in them, for my sake, not onely a Dislike of all that shall pass through my hands, but even an Vndervaluing, or at least not that hearty Acknowledgment of such Favours as Your Majesty conferreth on them, which they would doe if another were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; whom they would endeavour to gain for their own ends, and hoping to make him theirs, would not onely seem to be contented, but endeavour to make Your Majesty, the World, and himself, believe they were so. Whereas (on the contrary) they would be ever repining, and not give that obedient Acquiescing,

                     <p>If Your Majesty should at this time continue me Your Commissioner, they would apprehend that I might resent the many particular Injuries done me, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> so be a mean to work them prejudice, if it were but to revenge my self, which will not onely cause Iealousie in them, but an earnest endeavouring to make me inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to prejudice them; which cannot more easily be effected than by frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and crossing my Intentions of serving Your Majesty: Whereas if another be imployed, they will not apprehend it to be in my Power to prejudice them, and so be free'd of that Fear, and consequently give way to those things in another Mans person, which they would not doe if I be still imployed.</p>
                     <p>They know that I am so well acquainted with their Ways and Proceedings,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> and that my Heart is so streight to Your Majesties Service, that I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any thing from You, either of their by-past Actions, or any thing that shall be done of new: Whereas if Your Majesty imployed another, they will be in hope that what is past is not so well known to him, and so will be forgot, or if remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by me, it will serve to no end, I being out of Place; and that perhaps he will be more sparing of speaking than I have been, or that he is to be gained to their Party: for which end hoping he may prove for the future useful to them, they may comply with him for the present in divers things, which they would not doe if I be continued.</p>
                     <p>There are so many of Your Majesties Subjects of all sorts, whom I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> to resist the Ways of the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon this he was presently called from <hi>Scotland.</hi> The King also wrote for 14 of the Lords that were the chief Covenanters,<note place="margin">and writes for many Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters.</note> to come and wait upon him at <hi>Berwick,</hi> that he might advise with them about the Affairs in hand. But the true reason (as was believed) was to try what fair Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might doe with them. This gave great Jealousies to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, who were not so blind as not to understand what the effect of this might prove. And indeed some studied to infuse worse Jealousies, as if the Design of calling for the Lords had been to send them all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to <hi>London.</hi> In end they resolved none should go, save three from each Estate: the three Lords were the Earls of <hi>Montrose, London,</hi> and <hi>Lowthian</hi>; and <hi>Lowthian</hi> was the person who pressed them most to send any, for many had no inclinations to send at all.</p>
               <p>But before they came to <hi>Berwick</hi> the King ordered the Marquis by a Warrant in writing, yet extant under His Majesties Hand, <hi>to try what way he could gain upon them, and discover the bottom of their Intentions, how the Estate of Bishops should be supplied in Parliament, and how far they intended to lessen the Kings Authority.</hi> The King also allowed him to use what means he pleased, and speak to them what he thought fit; not onely authorizing, but requiring him to it, and warranting him if he were ever question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or accused for it by any. Bearing date at <hi>Berwick</hi> the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1639.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Kings Trust in the Marquis.</note>It is easie from this to infer, both how intirely His Majesty confided in him, and how unjust they are who upon any Expressions he might then have used, offer injury to his Memory: and yet he managed this so cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously, that very little escaped him for which he could not have justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himself without this Order. But so tender was he of His Majesties Reputation, that when he was afterwards charged for some hard Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, alledged to have been uttered at that time, in all his written De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences he never made use of this Justification; knowing how at that time it might have prejudiced His Majesties Service, if it had been known that he gave such Warrants to those he imployed; reserving to whisper it in His Majesties Ear, when he should be admitted to his Presence. And indeed till this appeared, the Writer of these <hi>Memoires</hi> was not a little stumbled with some of his Speeches then uttered, which were hard to be understood: for having them so near the Fountain, he could scarce doubt his Information: but this Order reconciles the Truth of these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports he had heard with the Marquis his Innocency.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65282:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lords that came. The Earl of <hi>Montrose</hi> was much wrought upon, and gave His Majesty full Assurances of his Duty in time coming; and upon that entred in a Correspondence with the King. The other two were a little mollified, but not gained: onely from them the Marquis learned, that all the Acts of Parliament for Episcopacy were to be abrogated by the next Parliament; and that they designed to change the course of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in things to the Parliament by the Lords of the Articles, as a Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation upon the Parliament. Whereupon the next thing to be done was to draw <hi>Traquair</hi>'s Instructions, which was not done without great and long Consultation, none being privy to it besides the Marquis and <hi>Traquair</hi> himself. That which made the King so tender, was his Zeal for Episcopacy: but <hi>Traquair</hi> helped him out of all Difficulties, by telling him, that doe the next Parliament what it would, there were still good grounds to introduce Episcopacy, when ever the King was able to carry it; for Bishops being (by all the Laws of <hi>Scotland</hi>) one of the three Estates of Parliament, no Act that passed without them could have force in Law, much less the Act that abolished them, especially they not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing or consenting to it, but protesting against it. This gave much ease to the Kings thoughts, and so on the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iuly Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quair</hi>'s Instructions were signed, which follow as they are taken from a Copy of them under the Marquis his Hand.</p>

                     </gap>municate to the rest of your Brethren.</p>
                  <p>We do in part approve of what you have advised concerning the Prorogating of the Assembly and Parliament, and must acknowledge it to be grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Reason enough, were Reason only to be thought on in this Business; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the present state of Our Affairs, and what We have promised in the Articles of Pacification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We may not (as We conceive) without great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to Our Self and Service, condescend thereunto: wherefore We are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nay rather necessitated, to hold the Assembly and Parliament at the time and place appointed. And for that end We have nominated the Earl of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quair</hi> Our Commissioner, to whom We have given Instructions, not only how to carry himself at the same, but a Charge also to have a special care of your Lordships, and those of the inferiour Clergy, who have suffered for their Duty to God and Obedience to Our Commands. And We doe hereby assure you, that it shall be still one of Our chiefest Studies, how to rectifie and establish the Government of that Church a-right, and to repair your losses, which We desire you to be most confident of.</p>
                  <p>As for your Meeting to treat of the Affairs of the Church, We do not see at this time how that can be done; for within Our Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> We cannot promise you any place of Safety, and in any other of Our Dominions We cannot hold it convenient, all things considered: wherefore We conceive that the best way will be for your Lordships, to give in, by way of Protestation or Remonstrance, your Exceptions against this Assembly and Parliament to Our Commissioner, which may be sent by any mean man, so he be Trusty, and deliver it at his entring into the Church; but We would not have it to be either read or argued in this Meeting, where nothing but Partiality is to be expected, but to be represented to Vs by him, which We promise to take so in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as becometh a Prince sensible of His Own Interest and Honour, joined with the equity of your Desires: and you may rest secure, that though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps We may give way for the present to that which will be prejudicial both to the Church, and Our Own Government; yet We shall not leave thinking in time how to remedy both.</p>
                  <p>We must likewise intimate unto you, that We are so far from conceiving it expedient for you, or any of my Lords of the Clergy, to be present at this Meeting, as We doe absolutely discharge your going thither, and for your Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, this shall be to you and every one of you a sufficient Warrant. In the <hi>interim,</hi> your best Course will be to remain in Our Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> till such time as you receive Our further Order, where We shall provide for your Subsistence, though not in that measure as We could Wish, yet in such a way as you shall not be in want.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have Our Pleasure briefly signified unto you, which We doubt not but you will take in good part; you cannot but know, that what We doe in this We are necessitated to. So We bid you farewell.</p>

                  <p>We therefore the Vnder-subscribers for discharge of our Duties to God and to the Church, committed to our Government under our Soveraign Lord the Kings Majesty, Protest, as in our former Declinatour, as well for our Selves, as in name of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so many as shall adhere to this our Protestation, That the present pretended Assembly be holden and reputed null in Law, as consisting and made up partly of Laical persons that have no Office in the Church of God, partly of refractory, schismatical, and perjured Ministers, that contrary to their Oaths and Subscriptions, from which no Humane power could absolve them, have filthily resiled, and so made themselves to the present and future Ages most infamous: and that no Church-man be bound to appear before them, nor any Citation, Admonition, Certification, or Act whatsoever, proceeding from the said pretended Meeting, be prejudicial to the Iurisdiction, Liberties, Priviledges, Rents, Possessions, and Benefices belonging to the Church, nor to any Acts of former General Assemblies, Acts of Council, or Parliament made in favours thereof: but to the contrary, That all such Acts and Deeds, and every one of them, are and shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unjust, partial, and illegal, with all that may follow thereupon. And this our Protestation we humbly desire may be presented to His Majesty, whom we do humbly supplicate, according to the practice of Christian Emperours in Ancient times, to convene the Clergy of His whole Dominions, for remedying the present Schism and Division, unto whose Iudgement and Determination we promise to submit our Selves, and all our Proceedings.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>WE have hitherto commanded <hi>Hamilton</hi> to answer several of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but that of the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> being of more weight than any of your former, We have thought fit to answer it Our Self.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you say, that nothing will satisfie them, except <hi>in terminis</hi> the last Assembly be named and ratified, or that way be given to the discharging Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy as abjured in that Church, as contrary to the Confession of Faith <hi>1580.</hi> and the Constitutions of the same, you being yet in some hope, that the word <hi>Abjured</hi> may be got changed, and that in drawing up the words of the Act it be onely condemned, as contrary to the Constitution of that Church; We in this point leave you to your Instructions, they being full, if you consider what We have said concerning Episcopacy, and subscribing the Confession of Faith <hi>1580</hi>: We thinking it fit to declare hereupon unto you, that let their Madness be what it will, further than We have declared in Our Instructions in these points, We will not go.</p>
                  <p>For the Service-book and Book of the Canons, though We have been and are content it be discharged; yet We will never give Our Voice nor Assent, that they be condemned as containing divers Heads of Popery and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In like manner, though We have been and are content, that the High Commission be discharged; yet We will never acknowledge that it is without Law, or destructive to the Civil and Ecclesiastical Iudicatories of that Our Kingdom, nor that the Five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> though dischargod with Our Approbation, be condemned as contrary to the foresaid Confession. As concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late Assemblies, We cannot give Our Consent to have them declared null, since they were so notorously Our Father (of Happy Memory) His Acts: It seeming strange, that We having condescended to the taking away all these things that they complained of, which were done in those Assemblies, they will
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65282:88"/>
not be content therewith, without laying an Aspersion on Our Fathers Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Wherefore if the Assembly will in despite of your Endeavours conclude contrary to this, you are to protest against their Proceedings in these points, and be sure not to ratifie them in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the yearly Indicting of General Assemblies, and the Confession of Faith, We commanded <hi>Hamilton</hi> in his of the <hi>16th</hi> to answer that point to this effect; That We think it infinitely to Our Prejudice, that We should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to tie Our Self for the keeping yearly of their Assemblies, not needing to repeat the Reasons, they being well enough known to you; seeing at <hi>Berwick</hi> it was conceived upon debate of that Point, that your having Power to indict a New one within the Year, would save that dispute, which you are by all means to eschew. But if this will not give satisfaction, you are by no means to give your assent to any such Act, nor to ratifie the same in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The Article in your Instructions which is onely, That the Covenant <hi>1580</hi> shall be subscribed, you must have an especial care of, and how you proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: That the Bond be the same which was in Our Fathers time, <hi>mutatis mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandis;</hi> and that you give your Assent no other ways to the Interpretations thereof then may stand with Our future Intentions, well-known to you: nor is the same otherwise to be ratified in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have Our Pleasure fully signified in every particular of your Letter, which you will find no ways contrary to Our Resolution taken at <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and Our Instructions given to you there. But if the Madness of Our Subjects be such, that they will not rest satisfied with what We have given you Power and Authority to condescend to, which notwithstanding all their Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies We shall allow you to make good to them, We take God to witness, that what Misery soever shall fall to that Country hereafter, it is no fault of Ours, but their own procurement. And hereupon We do command you, that if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compose this Business according to Our Instructions, and what We have now written, that you prorogue the Parliament till the next Spring; and that you think upon some course how you may make publickly known to all Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, what We had given you Power to condescend to. And because it is not improbable that this way may produce a present Rupture, you are to warn and assist <hi>Ruthwen</hi> for the defence of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and to take in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the like care of all Our Houses and Forts in that Kingdom; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to advertise all such who are affected to Our Service, that timously they may secure themselves. And so We bid you heartily farewell.</p>

                     </hi> to <hi>Hamilton</hi> We have seen, and think fit to return Answer thereunto Our Self; and the rather because We find by yours, that some Points in the former Letter were not so fully expressed, but that you desire more clear Answers. First you say, that in all your Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions it is condescended, that by Act of Assembly Episcopacy should be declared <hi>unlawful in this Kirk;</hi> and that by all the Capitulations of Agreement, and Instructions given to you, that same is allowed to be ratified in Parliament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foresaid terms agreed upon in the Assembly. In this Point We must tell you, that you are much mistaken: for though you have Power for giving way to the Abolition of Episcopacy, as contrary to the Constitutions of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> yet you will not find either in your Instructions, or any other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection since sent you, that We have consented to declare the same <hi>Unlawful:</hi> We making a great difference therein, for many things may be contrary to the Constitutions of a Church, which of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mselves are not simply unlawful; for whatsoever is absolutely unlawful in one Church cannot be lawful in the other of the same Profession of Religion, but there may be many several Constitutions, and yet they all lawful. Therefore if I do acknowledge or consent, <hi>That Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy is unlawful in the Church of Scotland,</hi> though as you have set it down in your consenting to the Act, the word <hi>Unlawful</hi> may seem onely to have a relation to the Constitutions of that Kirk; yet the Construction thereof doth run so doubtfully, that it may be probably inferred, That the same Function is acknowledged by Vs to be unlawful in any other Churches in Our Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Therefore as we totally disapprove of your consenting to the word <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi> as well to the Function, as Civil Places and Power of Church-men, in the Act of the General Assembly: so We absolutely command you, not to ratifie the same in these terms in the Parliament, but onely as contrary to the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of that Kirk; and to declare, that We ratifie this Act meerly for the Peace of the Land, though otherwise in Our Own Iudgment We neither hold it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient nor fitting; which you are to declare at the Ratifying of the same. And for the rest of your Declaration in the Assembly, to be registred in the Books of Council, for brevities sake We send you herewith a Copy of the same, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that of the Covenant, interlined in those places which We disapprove of, and conceive to be the contrary to your Instructions, and some other Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>As We have formerly written to you, We cannot consent to the rescinding any Acts of Parliament made in favour of Episcopacy; nor do We conceive that Our refusal to abolish those Acts is contradictory to what We have consented to, or to that we was obliged to: there is less danger in discovering any future Intentions of Ours, or at the best letting them guess at the same, than if We should permit the rescinding those Acts of Parliament, which Our Father with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65282:89"/>
so much expence of Time and Industry established, and which may hereafter be of so great use to Vs. And though it should perhaps cast all loose, (as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press;) yet We take God to witness, We have permitted them to doe many things in this Assembly, for establishing of Peace, contrary to Our Own Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And if on this point a Rupture happen, We cannot help it; the fault is on their own part, which one day they may smart for. So you have in this Point Our full Resolution.</p>
                  <p>We likewise wrote formerly to you, that We thought it not fit at this time, that the Power of the Lords of the Articles should be defined, and that you are to avoid the same, and to be sure not to consent thereunto. Now your last Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gives Vs ground to repeat the same again, and to declare to you, that We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Our former Opinion.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you say, that it is to no purpose to vex Vs with all the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and mad Propositions that are made, since they go about not onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all pretended Abuses, of what nature soever, but to constitute and define the Power of all Iudicatories from the highest to the lowest, and that you are like to agree in few or none of the General Acts: If you find, that what We have commanded you to doe is likely to cause a Rupture, their impertinent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions give you a fair occasion to make it appear to the World, that We have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to all matters which can be pretended to concern Conscience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and that now they aim at nothing but the Overthrow of Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, contrary to all their Professions, which We can neither with Honour nor Safety suffer. And therefore We hope and expect, that if a Rupture happen, you will make this appear to be the cause thereof, and not Religion, which you know not onely to be true, but must see it will be of great advantage to Vs, and therefore must be seriously intended by you.</p>
                  <p>We have no Directions of new to give you, concerning the Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> Sir <hi>Donald Mack-donald,</hi> or any others to whom Malice is carried for their Zeal for Our Service, but again recommend them to your care.</p>
                  <p>What hath past betwixt your self and the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> We have heard nothing of; but We are easily induced to believe, that what you wrote of his undutiful Carriage is true, and that you will easily make it appear, to which We will give no unwilling Ear.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have your last Letter answered, with what for the present and on such a sudden hath come into Our thoughts: and so We bid you Farewell.</p>

            <p>The Parliament sate at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the day appointed,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sits in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               </note> but their Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings can onely be overly related, they being too remote from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis his Story; so that onely such Generals are to be hinted as occur among his Papers. They consented that for that time <hi>Traquair</hi> (as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner) should name those Lords of the Articles that were for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, who should have been named by the Bishops; but protested it should be no Precedent for the future. And they went roundly to take away the Lords of the Articles totally, and were framing all their Acts at the rate of the Assembly.

The Covenanters, though they resolved not to sit till the day to which it was prorogued; yet protested against the Legality of any Prorogation without consent of Parliament, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65282:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sent up the Earls of <hi>Dumfermline</hi> and <hi>Lowdon</hi> with the Acts of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly to the King, desiring he would order his Commissioner to give way to their Ratification in Parliament, as also to purge themselves of any Misrepresentations the King might have received of their Actions.</p>
            <p>They came to <hi>London</hi> on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November:</hi> but His Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to see them, since they came from <hi>Scotland</hi> without His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners Warrant; wherefore they were commanded presently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home. They sent a Letter to the Marquis, (for he would not see them) desiring him to interpose for procuring them a Hearing, and that they might not be condemned unheard; whose Answer was, That the Order which the King had sent them was upon mature Deliberation, and that nothing remained for them but Obedience: so they returned. And the King ordered <hi>Traquair</hi> to prorogue the Parliament, (Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing and Adjourning are all one in <hi>Scotland</hi>) to the second of <hi>Iune</hi> next, and to come up and give an account of Affairs: which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he did, but got a cold Reception, the King being highly displeased with his Subscription of the Covenant, as was before marked. But he complained, that he could have no Assistance from them to obtain any thing if he had not done that, and that it was impossible to prevail with these People,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Traquair</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites the King to a new War.</note> except by Force, or by a total Compliance. The Bishops failed not to take advantage at this trip of his, to pursue him with much eagerness, and he to recover himself was the more earnest to press the King to a new Invasion; assuring him that <hi>Ruthwen</hi> was so strong in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> that he would teach them their Duty, and was very formidable to them. He also furnished the King with a great many Grounds for justifying his following Procedure against them; a chief one being a Letter he had got, which the Covenanters had written to the <hi>French</hi> King, desiring his Protection and Assistance, which was High Treason by the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as being a Treaty with a Foreign Prince without the Kings Permission. And upon these Grounds it was, that the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> was afterwards pursued as the Grand Incendiary.</p>
            <p>The Marquis saw there was too much Ground for His Majesties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments, either to contradict or condemn them; but that which grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him was, that he saw not a way how His Majesty should be able to defray the Expence of a War without calling a Parliament in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was no less formidable to the Court than the Covenanters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they foreseeing what followed.</p>
            <p>At this time the Covenanters sent up their Petition to His Majesty by one <hi>Cunningham,</hi> desiring permission to send some of their Number for their own Vindication: which His Majesty granting, the Earls of <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Dumfermline</hi> were again sent up. But <hi>Lowdon</hi> being accused of that Letter to the <hi>French</hi> King,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Lowdon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower.</note> was committed to the Tower. Yet he vindicated himself; first, that the Letter was not finished, and had neither Date nor Direction, since that which was on the back of it <hi>(Au Roy)</hi> was added afterwards, and by another Hand; next, that it was written before the Pacification, and so was buried by the Oblivion; that it was never sent, and that it was designed onely that the <hi>French</hi> King should interpose and mediate for them. Upon all this he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a strict Trial by his Peers in <hi>Scotland:</hi> but added, that he being sent by the States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and come upon His Majesties Warrant, was first to be returned a Freeman thither, and thereafter to be accused
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65282:90"/>
and tried. This Accident troubled the Marquis extremely, for he knew it would raise Clamours against His Majesties Justice, among those who were inclined to misconstrue his Actions; and indeed it was highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the <hi>Scotish</hi> Lords, as a violation of the Law of Nations to meddle with any publick Messenger: but the King judged no Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration could warrant his Subjects to commit Treason, nor secure them from Trial and Censure when found Guilty. There were some ill In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments about the King, who advised him to proceed capitally against <hi>Lowdon,</hi> which is believed went very far; but the Marquis opposed this vigorously, assuring the King, that if that were done, <hi>Scotland</hi> was for ever lost. They would then have somewhat to pretend against so much as Petitioning and Treating: besides, it was against the Laws of <hi>Scotland</hi> to proceed against a <hi>Scotish</hi> Peer for a Crime committed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but by the Peers of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And after all this, he assured His Majesty, that he knew few of the Covenanters who might be more able to serve the Kings Interest, and could be more easily gained than <hi>Lowdon.</hi> And the truth was, that Letter was signed by six of the Covenanting Lords, but being put in the hands of the Lord <hi>Mirtland</hi> to sign it, (as he told the Writer) he found it was False <hi>French</hi>; and so it was laid aside for that time, and never again taken into consideration: but one taking up the Letter brought it to <hi>Traquair.</hi> His Majesty being of himself both Just and Good, did reject those cruel Counsels, as hurtful to his Service: yet <hi>Lowdon</hi> continued prisoner for some months; his Enlargement shall be mentioned in its proper place.</p>
            <p>But how to proceed in the publick Affairs was a hard Chapter.<note place="margin">A new War with <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> Which way the Counsels were taken this Winter, doth not appear to the Writer, but from the Effects. Only the Marquis was full of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, foreseeing that it would be impossible for the King to do much without a Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> and Subsidies granted by it; but they had reason to think the Parliament would begin with Grievances, before they went to Subsidies; and if their enquiring into the former proved long and fierce, as it would protract the Kings Supply, it might also breed Irritations and Heats, and end in a Rupture, without relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the King. Neither could much be expected from a Loan of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: most of the Cities (<hi>London</hi> especially) were not well-affected to the Court, and so were like to prove backward and narrow; and all might be promised from that, was to put off one Summer: but the <hi>Scotish</hi> Storm was like to lie longer. Besides, he believed, that if the Loan of Money went through, the <hi>Scots</hi> would think that a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for their entring into <hi>England,</hi> to make the Northern Countries the seat of the War, which would prejudice the Kings Service in <hi>England.</hi> All this he foresaw well, and therefore was rack't with perplexity: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was not doubtful what to doe himself, resolving to follow the Kings Interests on all hazards: and in these Consultations this Year ended.</p>

               <p>But to go on with the <hi>Series</hi> of the Story, the King went on careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his Preparations; only the Charge of a Fleet was so great, that he could not think of it this year, but sent out as many Ships as stopt the <hi>Scotish</hi> Trade.

put in the former; whereupon they were forced to resolve on hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the utmost for the Defence of Religion and Liberties, and that all were Contributing very liberally, and knew of good Friends, both in <hi>England</hi> and abroad; wherefore he assured him, if things went to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, they would not end so well as they did last year. And he besought him that he would prove a good instrument betwixt the King and the Country, protesting, that for his own part nothing next to Religion went so near his Heart as the Kings Service. In end, he conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him not to accept of any new Service, if it went to an open Breach, assuring him he would be ruined if he did; telling him that God had provided a relief for them beyond their expectation. The Marquis carried all these Letters, as he got them, to his Majesty, and by his command wrote the following Answer.</p>

                     <p>The Arguments that you use, are the Resolutions of your own People, and the assistance that you will have elsewhere, the particular way you forbear to write; yet you say, that God hath provided it beyond your expectation; and as it was beyond your expectation, so it is still beyond my belief; my Reasons you shall have anon. But first I will say somewhat concerning my self.</p>
                     <p>Know then, <hi>Brother,</hi> for a truth, that I heartily pray a Curse may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him and his Posterity, that doth not endeavour and wish, that these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Troubles may be composed in a fair and peaceable way. God, who knoweth the Secrets of all mens thoughts, can bear me record, with how much care, pains, and zeal I have endeavoured that; and I promise you, I shall as faithfully continue in that Course, as ever man did, in any Resolution which was with reason grounded in his heart; how few either believe, or know this, I care not, for I have laid my accompt long since, and am resolved on the worst that can befall me. And for your further satisfaction, know, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can grieve me more in this World, than to be sent in any Hostile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner against my Friends, Kindred, and Country; where at the best, though I may merit something from His Majesty, (to whose Goodness I owe much besides the Duty of a Subject) yet I shall never be called other than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of them; and what cause of Sorrow this will be to a kind-hearted <hi>Scotsh-man,</hi> I leave to you to judge. Therefore I assure you, that if either my Industry, Intreaties, nay Prayers prevail, no such Charge will be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on me, my inclinations having always led me in this rather to follow your Advice, and absent my self, in case things come to the worst, than to accept of that Employment; though I must tell you, it may bring along with it His Majesties Displeasure, and so consequently certain Ruine. Yet I do intend to put that to the hazard, and if it happen, I will have the Vanity to say, it will neither prove advantageous to the Country, nor to those in it, who once did me the Honour to esteem me their Friend. To conclude this point, consider, if a Navy come, probably I must be miserable; for what can I gain by it? if employed, a Discontented Life ever hereafter. If the King should impose the Charge on me, and I refuse it, what the better would you be? an abler would be employed in it, and I need never look for His Majesties Favour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65282:92"/>
after, and without that in his Kingdom will I never live. If I had no other Reasons but these, (but I could write you fourty more,) consider if I have not cause to endeavour Peace, and believe me I will do it.</p>
                     <p>For the Danger that His Majesty will run if he enter into this War, I do acknowledge with you it may be great; but that certain Ruine must follow, I cannot confess: yet I must say, that his Gain will be but small, when he hath g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>For the Assistance you mention God hath provided for you elsewhere, that is conceived to be used as an argument to fright us: For from whence can it come?</p>
                     <p>From a Party in <hi>England?</hi> Trust not to that, nor give credit to a few Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Spirits, with whom perhaps Correspondence may be kept.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>France?</hi> Reason and the knowledge of their Affairs make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that no great matter can come from thence: Reason, for they will not assist the Rebels (for so you will be called) of a King for examples sake; and the necessity of their Affairs, for we know they have enough to do else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Sweden?</hi> Though they perhaps be willing, yet it is known, they have not men to do it in these Parts.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Holland?</hi> The Body of that Estate hath by their Publick Ministers disallowed your Actions, and hath given assurance that they will be far from either giving Countenance or Assistance to you; what private men may doe by way of Stealth, is little regarded or to be esteemed.</p>
                     <p>Thus I freely write what is thought of the Assistance you are like to get from abroad, of which Opinion I shall still be, unless you can make it more clearly appear; therefore I will use the old Proverb to you, <hi>Beware that your stout Hearts make not your Heads dry a Gutter,</hi> and make you neglect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of His Majesties Pleasure with all thankful Obedience, which, for any thing I know, nay I durst Swear, will be no other than stands with the true Protestant Religion and the Laws of the Kingdom. What pity is it then, that these mistakes should continue? but how much more will it be, that they should encrease to a Bloody War. If all amongst you would rightly consider what true Religion and Piety is, and lay that only before their Eyes, there are yet, not only good hopes, but certain assurances of a peaceable Conclusion of those unhappy Troubles; and as you have advised me, so let me you, (which perhaps may be the last time, that on this Subject I shall write to you) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Peace, which if gained, the effusion of much Christian Blood will be saved, the Country preserved, <hi>Scotsh-men</hi> esteemed Valiant, Iust and Loyal, not only in this Kingdom, but through all <hi>Europe,</hi> and no man happier than</p>

When the Earls of <hi>Dumfermline</hi> and <hi>Lowdon</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> a Person of Quality of the <hi>English</hi> Nation (whose Name is supprest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Infamy of this Action) came to them, and with great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence pressed them to engage in a new War, and among other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives brought them Engagements in writing from most of the greatest Peers of <hi>England,</hi> to joyn with them, and assist them when they should come into <hi>England</hi> with their Army. This did much animate them, for they had not the least doubt of the Papers brought them. But all this was discovered at the Treaty of <hi>Rippon</hi> to have been a base Forgery: for there the <hi>Scotish</hi> Lords looking very sullenly on some of the <hi>English</hi> Lords, as on Persons of no Faith or Truth, the Lord <hi>Mandevil</hi> came to the Earl of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and asked the reason of that Change of their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Behaviour in them, who after some high reflections, at length challenged him and the other Lords of not keeping what they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to them. Upon which that Lord stood amazed, and told him, and so did the other Lords there, that they had sent no such Messages
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65282:93"/>
nor Papers to them, and that they had been abused by the blackest Imposture that ever was. Thus it appeared how dangerous it may be to receive some things that seem to have the highest Probabilities in them easily and upon trust.</p>
               <p>In <hi>April</hi> following the King called a Parliament in <hi>England</hi>;<note place="margin">A short Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> but they begun with their Grievances, in which they rose to so high a strain, that after twenty days Sitting the King by advice of his Council dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved them: but the hopes of Money from the Parliament failing, the next Course was to try, what could be drawn by Loan; and for good example the Councellours subscribed for near two hundred thousand pounds Sterlin.<note place="margin">The Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours lend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> What the Marquis his part was in this I should have willingly concealed, judging fit that his Story should be as sparing in relating it, as himself was modest in not boasting of it: but <hi>Sanderson,</hi> and some other malicious or ignorant Pens, who say, <hi>That he pretended Poverty, and subscribed for none,</hi> force me to free him of that Calumny, by a true Relation of what his Duty to the King cost him at this time. He subscribed for 10000 <hi>l. Sterlin,</hi> and laid down <hi>Eight thousand</hi> of it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently in Gold: likewise in <hi>August</hi> following at <hi>York</hi> he again subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and laid down Six thousand and three hundred pounds, for both which he had Tallies struck. Besides this, when he served as Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the year 1638. he got no Payments made him; Ten thousand pounds Sterlin was allowed him, of which he had not received a farthing: and besides the great expence he was at in that Service, he laid that year out of his own Money about 5000 <hi>l. Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> on the Kings account. And thus in the space of four years he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the King near <hi>Thirty thousand pounds Sterlin,</hi> and this was in a time when the advantages he had by his Places and Pensions were (through the necessity of the Kings affairs) dried up.</p>
               <p>But since I was forced to say this, I must not conceal His Majesty who now reigns, His Justice and Goodness to his Heiress, in repaying the sum contained in those Tallies, together with the other Royal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of His Favour, which they have felt in the repayment of the <hi>Scotsh</hi> Debt.</p>
               <p>This is said once for all, and all this was little reckoned of by him, who was ready to hazard both Life and Fortune for His Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, acknowledging that it was Just, since he and his Ancestors owed so much to the King and his Progenitours bounty, that all he had should be spent in his Service.</p>
               <p>The Covenanters in <hi>Scotland</hi> were beginning to look to themselves, and fearing <hi>Ruthwen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ruthwen</hi> a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters.</note> who was in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to obey their Orders: but he told them, he had his Trust from the King, and would acknowledge no Commands but his; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they blockt him up. He might easily have done them much Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, but his Orders were to hold himself most on the Defensive, and to amuse them, but not to break out to open Hostilities, within which limits he contained himself.</p>
               <p>The second of <hi>Iune</hi> came, which was the day the Parliament was to Set: but the King had sent down an Order to the Justice-Clerk for proroguing it,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sits not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Kings Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing of it.</note> and he was to carry along with him in this Affair the assistance of the Kings Advocate, who was at this time confined to his House in <hi>Fife</hi> by the King, upon pretence of some petty maleversation in his Office, but really because of his adhering to the Covenanters too
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65282:93"/>
much. The Kings Advocate was glad both of being delivered from that Disgrace, and for being honoured with the Employment. But to clear the Method in which he intended to proceed to make this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation legal, I must look back a little; when <hi>Traquair</hi> got his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission under the Broad-Seal, there was another Commission given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the quarter-Seal to the Lord <hi>Elphinstown,</hi> the Lord <hi>Napier,</hi> the Kings Advocate, and the Justice-Clerk; these or three of them were impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to act as Commissioners in <hi>Traquair</hi>'s absence, and upon his Orders. Therefore the Kings Advocate judged it needless to fill up a Blank that was sent down to be made use of if need were, to make the Proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Legal; but resolved to require one of the other two, to concur with the Justice-Clerk and himself in the Prorogation, which was to be done after the Parliament was Fenced; therefore they provided the persons necessary for Fencing of it, (a Ceremony they use in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a Session) who are the Constable, the Marshal, the Provost of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Sheriff of <hi>Lowthian,</hi> and a Doomster; and if any of these be absent, the King must name others for their Service that day. So the Members of Parliament being met, the Kings Advocate required the Lord <hi>Elphinstown,</hi> who was first in the Commission, to go up with them to the Throne, for executing the Kings Commands; who having read the Commission, found their Power was only to act by the Commissioners Order, and therefore called for <hi>Traquair</hi>'s War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: the Kings Advocate answered, That as when the King is present a Commissioners Power of it self expires, so also when his Warrant is produced, there is no need of one from his Commissioner. But <hi>Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stown</hi> stood on the Letter of the Commission, and so found, he was not legally warranted to doe it. That same was the Lord <hi>Napier</hi>'s Answer, who was also of the Commission, and so the Kings Advocate and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice-Clerk could doe nothing but take Instruments. Many imputed this to the Kings Advocat's Jugling; but he vindicated himself solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is extant under his Hand, with a long Narrative of this whole Affair sent up by him to the King. However the effects of this Errour were great; for the Members voted themselves to be in a Parliamentary Capacity, as being summoned by the King at first, and again adjourned to this day: whereupon they proceeded to the Enacting of what they had designed the former Year; and their Acts, though of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet meeting no opposition were quickly dispatched: all which with a Prologue and Epilogue of two high Declarations were sent in the Packet to the Earl of <hi>Lanerick,</hi> with the following Letter written by a Committee of Lords they had left to sit at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

The Letter it self was never sent nor used, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and no other Letter sent. It was written long before the Pacification, wherein His Majesty was Graciously pleased to pass all preceding Deeds in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.</p>
                     <p>The Lord <hi>Lowdon</hi> came hither upon His Majesties Own Warrant, which is sufficient for his Indempnity and Return, till he be exonered of his Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He came from the Parliament with Commission from them to shew His Majesty the Reasons of their Demands, trusting confidently in His Majesties Iustice and Goodness, and with most Loyal Affection and Ardent Desires to have given His Majesty satisfaction, and to have returned with no less Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Forwardness in carrying and pressing His Majesties Royal and Iust Commands, during which time he could expect nothing less than that he would be called in question for a <hi>prior</hi> Deed; all which are most manifest by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions and Informations presented to His Sacred Majesty.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I most humbly beseech, that His Majesty may be Graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to consider of the former Petitions and true Informations, which being pondered in the Balance of His Majesties Righteous Iudgment, I am most confident my Innocency will appear clearly to His Majesty, and that I will find such a speedy delivery, as may give demonstration to the World of His Majesties Iustice and Goodness, and as may not onely from the Conscience of my Duty, but likewise from the sense of His Royal Benignity, encourage me ever to contribute my best Endeavours for furthering of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Service.</p>

                        <hi>BEcause no great matters can be well effectuated without Trust, Fidelity,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and Secrecy; therefore it is fit that we swear Fidelity and Secrecy to others, and that I shall faithfully contribute my best Endeavours for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what I undertake; and that my Lord Marquis doe the like to me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Our desires and designs do tend mainly for Preservation of Religion, Laws,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> and Liberties of the Kingdom, the Kings Honour, and of His Royal Authority, and for establishing of a happy Peace, and preventing of Wars; and we are to advise and resolve upon such ways and means as may best conduce for these ends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If (after using of our utmost Endeavours) it be not Gods will that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> may be so happy as to obtain such a Peace in haste, as may content the King and satisfie his Subjects, till differences draw to a greater height, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Wars, to resolve what is fit to be done in case of such an Extremity, for attaining a wished Peace, and to condescend what course we shall take for keeping of Correspondence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If my Endeavours and Service (which doubtless will put me to a great deal of expence and pains) shall prove useful for His Majesties Service and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the Good of the Kingdom, which are inseparable, the Marquis will intercede really, and imploy his best Endeavours with the King, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and recompence the Lord</hi> Lowdon<hi>'s Travels and Service, in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as a Gracious King and Master should doe to a diligent and faithful Servant.</hi>

                     <hi>Lowdon</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.</note> and permitted to go down to <hi>Scotland</hi>; but those who did not know the Secret of this, thought the King had weakened himself much, by letting go an Hostage of such importance: and this gave new Suspicions of the Marquis his Tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the Covenanters.</p>
               <p>His Majesty commanded the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> to write, by the Lord <hi>Lowdon,</hi> the following Answer to the Letter sent up by the Lords of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with the Acts they had lately passed.</p>

Yet such is His Majesties Clemency, that when they shall take such an Humble and Dutiful way as may witness, that they are as careful and tender of His Majesties Royal Power, as they are desirous of His Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, then shall it be time for them to expect such a Gracious and Iust Answer, as may testifie His Majesties Fatherly Compassion of that His Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Kingdom, and his Pious and Princely care of performing whatsoever is necessary for establishing their Religion and Laws.

                        </hi> of <hi>June</hi> from the Lord <hi>Lowdon,</hi> whose relief out of Prison, gives us occasion (before we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer your Lordships Letter) to acknowledge the same as an act of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Royal Iustice and Goodness, although the pretended cause of his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment was but a malicious Calumny of the Enemies of the Kings Honour and our Peace, forged to engage both His Majesties Kingdoms in a National War. As we cannot but regrate, that any neglect of His Majesties Officers, or absence of His Commissioner, whose presence we did both desire and expect, should hinder the interposing of His Royal Authority to these Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which were found most necessary for establishing Religion and the Peace of this Kingdom, and which according to the Acts of Pacification, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was graciously pleased to promise; so we have and shall still endeavour to give demonstration of that tender Respect we have of His Majesties Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Royal Power. And whereas your Lordships Letter doth imply, that we should take some other way for the more easie obtaining His Majesties Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, which also by several reasons hath been most instantly pressed by the Lord <hi>Lowdon;</hi> yet we conceive that Parliamentary way, which was taken by the Estates convened by His Majesties Special Warrant, to have been most Legal and necessary, and no ways derogatory to His Majesties Power in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, nor contrary to the Duty of good Subjects, who are warranted by the Articles of Pacification, under His Majesties Hand, to determine all Civil questions, ratifie the Conclusions of the Assembly, and remove the present Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions of this Kingdom, as is more abundantly demonstrated by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration

in Parliament thereabout. So that we dare not take any other Course, which may entrench upon their Parliamentary Power, or Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; nor will we (being so few in number appointed by them to stay here) presume of our selves, in a matter of so great moment, to return a more full and particular Answer, till there be a more frequent Meeting of those appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Parliament, which will be shortly; and then your Lordship shall be acquainted, that you may shew His Majesty their Resolutions and humble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and we shall remain</p>

               <p>They went on with their Preparations,<note place="margin">The Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are great in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> and caused all to bring in the tenth Peny of their Rents, to make this War look like a Sacred one, since carried on by the Tithes: and ordered their Forces to be drawn together. Mean while the King went on at as good a pace as he could, and went from <hi>London</hi> in the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> to make his Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous at <hi>York.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> staid some time behind, partly for Sickness, partly to see what Money could be borrowed from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; and at this time there were great and high Misunderstandings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> both making their Complaints to the Marquis by their Letters. <hi>Strafford</hi> was also to bring an Army out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon the West of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereupon they in <hi>Scotland</hi> drew their Forces together in the end of <hi>August,</hi> and resolved to march into <hi>England,</hi> and make that the Seat of the War, pretending (as by their Declaration then emitted doth appear) that their Trade was block't up by <hi>English</hi> Ships; that in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland, Scotishmen</hi> were procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against for taking the Covenant, and the <hi>English</hi> Council had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a War with them: wherefore, they said, they were constrained to go into <hi>England</hi> with their Petitions, declaring they came not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>England,</hi> but to avert the Invasion of their Country, that was designed; adding, that they should be so far from doing prejudice to any in <hi>England,</hi> that severe Justice should be executed upon those who took any thing in <hi>England</hi> without payment. And about this time <hi>Ruthwen,</hi> being for many months block't up in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> (so that Victuals and Ammunition were spent, his Water also failed, and most of his Souldiers died,) was forced to Capitulate, and render up the Castle of the Covenanters.</p>
               <p>But not to stand too long on matters universally known, as soon as they entred <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Scotish</hi> Army enters <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> the King by Proclamation declared them Traytors on the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August</hi>: yet they went on, and when they came to the <hi>Ford</hi> of <hi>Tine</hi> at <hi>Newburn,</hi> some miles above <hi>Newcastle,</hi> they found it guarded by a Body of Foot, who had raised a Brest-work near the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and lay there to obstruct their passage. Yet no sooner did the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Cannon begin to play, but they, struck with Fear, threw down their Arms and run away; whereupon the General passed over with some
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65282:97"/>
Troops, and they were encountred by three Troops, commanded by <hi>Wilmot,</hi> whom after a little Dispute they routed: their Officers were taken Prisoners, and some were killed. And after this the whole Body of the <hi>English</hi> Army, that lay there, marched to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of 2000 Horse, and 9000 Foot: the Disorder among them was the greater,<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> Forces are routed; and flie at <hi>Newburn.</hi>
                  </note> because the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> who Commanded, had gone that day from the Camp to Dine at a place about a miles distance called <hi>Stella.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> continued passing till it was late, and lay in the Fields all night: next day they marched towards <hi>New-Castle,</hi> and were beginning to be in some strait; for they had driven as many Cattle out of <hi>Scotland</hi> with them, as served hitherto for their Provision, and were resolved to take nothing in <hi>England</hi> but for payment, which would have been a vast charge to them. They purposed therefore to summon <hi>New-Castle,</hi> and in case it yielded not, to threaten to burn all the Coaleries which lay on the South-side; though they designed not the executing of that, for fear of making the Rupture beyond remedy. But as they were marching, doubtful what Course to take, they met a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> who had been a prisoner at <hi>Durham</hi>; he told them, how that morning by six a Clock all the <hi>English</hi> Forces had marched throw <hi>Durham</hi> in great haste; whereupon they went forward, and found <hi>New-Castle</hi> open to them, and there they took up their Quarters, and found great Magazins of Provision, which the King had laid in for his Army, and by those they maintained their Army a great while.</p>
               <p>This Loss and Affront went very near the Kings Heart, who begun to fear this years Success, as much as he had done the last.</p>
               <p>After this the Lords of the <hi>Covenant</hi> wrote the following Letter to the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> by one <hi>Cathcart.</hi>

                     <p>THat Whereas after our many Sufferings the time past, extreme necessity hath constrained us for our Relief, and obtaining our Humble and Iust Desires, to come into <hi>England,</hi> where according to our Intentions formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, we have in all our Iourney lived upon our own Means and Victuals, and Goods brought a long with us, and neither troubling the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor harming any of Your Majesties Subjects of whatsoever quality in their Persons or Goods, but have carried our selves in a most peaceable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, till we were pressed by strength of Arms, to put such Forces out of the way, as did without our deserving, and (as some of them have at the point of death confessed) against their own Consciences, opposed our peaceable passage at <hi>New-burn</hi> on <hi>Tine,</hi> and have brought their Blood upon their own Heads, against our purposes and desires expressed in our Letters, sent unto them at <hi>New-Castle,</hi> for preventing the like, or greater Inconveniences. And that we may without further opposition come into Your Majesties Presence, for obtaining from Your Majesties Iustice and Goodness satisfaction to our just Demands, we Your Majesties most Humble and Loyal Subjects, do still insist in that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss way of Petitioning, which we have keeped since the beginning, and from which no provocation of Your Majesties Enemies and ours, no adversity that we have before sustained, nor prosperous success can befall us, shall be able to divert our minds.</p>
                     <p>Most humbly intreating, That Your Majesty would in the depth of Your Royal Wisdom, consider at last our pressing Grievances, provide for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing

of our wrongs and losses, and with the advice and consent of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> convened in Parliament, settle a firm and durable Peace, against all Invasion by Sea or Land, that we may with chearfulness of heart pay unto Your Majesty, as our Native King, all Duty and Obedience that can be expected from Loyal Subjects, and that (against the many and great Evils, which at this time threaten both Kingdoms, whereat all Your Majesties good and loving Subjects tremble to think, and which we beseech God Almighty in mercy timeously to avert) Your Majesties Throne may be established in the midst of us, in Religion and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and Your Majesties Gracious Answer we humbly desire, and earnestly wait for.</p>

               <p>And now the King was in a great strait what to resolve on. Most of all the Peers advised a Settlement with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a Parliament in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: Strafford</hi>'s Advice was more severe, and the Marquis pressed a Pacification. But though their Opinions varied, yet their Friendship continued, since both had the same designs for the Kings Honour and Service. A recruit of Money (which was beginning to run low) was not to be hoped without a Parliament, and their late experience told, on how uneasie terms that was to be had. Earl <hi>Lowdon</hi> also assured the Marquis by his Letters, that the Covenanters were well armed, well commanded, and very resolute, nor did they doubt of a strong Party in <hi>England</hi>; and therefore shewed, how dangerous it would prove to His Majesties Affairs, if a Treaty should not presently follow. The Marquis, little regarding how ill these Counsels would be represented by others, used all his Industry to prevail with the King for a Pacification on any terms; since none could be so bad, as the hazard the King was like to run, if matters continued so broken: for it was now apparent, how faintly His Majesties Forces did serve him, and with how much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution the <hi>Scotish</hi> Armies proceeded; neither were they without fears in their own Army, and that many of the Peers, and People of <hi>England,</hi> would have assisted the <hi>Scots,</hi> if matters had run to extremities.</p>

                  </note>But at that time a passage fell out, which drew after it a tract of great Troubles on the Marquis. The Earl of <hi>Montrose</hi> had in <hi>Iuly</hi> that year, procured a Meeting of some Noblemen at <hi>Cumbermwald,</hi> the Earl of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65282:99"/>
                  <hi>Wigtons</hi> house, where there was a Bond signed by them of adherence to one another in pursuance of the Covenant; and from <hi>New-Castle</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to keep Correspondence with His Majesty, notwithstanding an Act that had passed in the Committee, that none should under pain of Death write any Letters to the Court, but such as were seen and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by at least three of the Committee. But this Correspondence of my Lord <hi>Montrose</hi> came to the knowledge of the Covenanters, and there were ill Instruments who suggested, that this Advertisement must have been given by the Marquis, which being too easily believed, occasioned a Breach betwixt them that could never be made up. And <hi>Sanderson</hi> hath had the Impudence not only to fasten this on him, but as if there had not been Imputation enough in it, he adds that the Marquis had in the night picked His Majesties Pockets for his Letters. Indeed he needed not take such Courses, had he been capable of that Treachery; for the Kings Confidence in him was such, that he delivered all the Letters he had from <hi>Scotland</hi> to his keeping, and if he had designed such a thing upon <hi>Montrose</hi> it was in his Power to have done it long before: for in <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> and <hi>December</hi> of the former year, <hi>Montrose</hi> had writ much in the same strain to the King; which Letters the King gave him, and are yet extant, but were never heard off, till now that the Writer gives this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. But the way how that Letter was discovered was this: the Covenanters sent Sir <hi>Iames Mercer</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> with their Letters to my Lord <hi>Lanerick</hi> of <hi>September</hi> the 14<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> with whom my Lord <hi>Montrose</hi> sent his Servant with Letters to some of his Friends at Court; and these Letters had been shown to the Committee: but as he sealed them up, he put within one to Sir <hi>Richard Grahame</hi> a Letter to the King, which had not been seen; and Sir <hi>Richard</hi> opening his Letter carelesly, the inclosed to the King dropt out: whereupon Sir <hi>Iames Mercer</hi> being near him stooped down in civility to take up the Letter, and read the Direction of it; and he returning next day to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Camp, told what he had seen to the General, who (in a Committee, that sate that afternoon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was my Lord <hi>Montrose</hi>'s turn to preside) said, that the Gentleman they had sent must be examined concerning any Letters he carried to the Court; and so he was called in, and examined. But <hi>Montrose</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that his Correspondence with the King was discovered, said, that seeing others kept a Correspondence with the Court, he knew not why he might not do it as well as they: it was answered, if others were guilty that did not excuse his fault, but when that could be made out against any, they were liable to the same Censure he had now incurred; whereupon he was commanded to keep his Chamber, and he called a great many of his Friends to him, to try who would adhere to him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the General bade the Earl of <hi>Calender,</hi> who was then Lieutenant-General, tell him, that if he came not, and submitted himself, he would hold a Council of War upon him, and proceed against him Capitally. Upon this my Lord <hi>Montrose</hi> came, and produced a Copy of the Letter, he said he had written, and craved pardon, and so this Matter was passed over: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet this went current for the Marquis his Treachery, though Sir <hi>Iames Mercer</hi> did often vouch the truth of this before many Witnesses, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65282:100"/>

Upon this the King resolved to send none but <hi>English</hi> Lords, conceiving it not fitting to send any <hi>Scotchman,</hi> if the persons he had imployed as Commissioners were not of the number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rippon</hi> a little Town fifteen miles from <hi>York,</hi> was appointed to be the place of Treaty instead of <hi>Northallertown,</hi> and the King sent the <hi>English</hi> Lords thither, appointing <hi>Traquair</hi> and <hi>Lanerick</hi> to wait upon them, for giving them Information of <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs; but he kept the Marquis to wait upon Himself. The Treaty begun at <hi>Rippon,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few days, by reason of the new Parliament the King had summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> was removed to <hi>London.</hi> The Covenanters Demands were the same with those contained in their Letter of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> about which they continued Treating till the <hi>Iune</hi> of the next year; and so this year ended.</p>
               <p>But here I shall insert a Paper, all written with His Majesties hand, which though it do not relate to <hi>Scotish</hi> business, yet I judged it a crime to let any of the Reliques of that Princes Pen perish. How it came into the Marquis his hand, I know not; it is an Answer to a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance, sent to the King by the Two Houses at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the end of this year.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Having taken to my serious Consideration the late Remonstrance made to me by Both Houses of Parliament do make this Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I take in good part your care for the Preservation of the true Religion established in this Kingdom, from which I will never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; as also for your tenderness of my own Safety, and security of this State and Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is against my mind that Popery or Superstition should any way increase within this Kingdom, and I will restrain the same by causing the Laws be put in due execution. I resolve likewise to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide against the dangers of Iesuites and Priests, setting forth a Proclamation with all speed, commanding them to depart the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom within one month, whereof if they fail or shall return, then they shall be proceeded withall according to the Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning</hi> Rosettie <hi>you must understand, that my Wife hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways assured me, that (to her knowledge) he hath no Commission, but only to entertain a pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65282:100"/>
warranted to Her by the Articles of Our Marriage, which give Her a full Liberty of Conscience; yet I have so perswaded Her, that (since the misunderstanding of this person's Condition gives offence) She will within a convenient time remove him. Moreover, I will take special care to restrain my Subjects from resorting to Mass at</hi> Denmark-house, St. Jame<hi>'s, and the Chappels of Ambassadours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly, concerning</hi> John Goodman <hi>the Priest, you must know the reason why I reprieved him, is, that (as I am informed) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>nor my Father, did ever avow that any Priests in their times were executed meerly for Religion, which to me seems to be this particular case; yet seeing that I am pressed by Both Houses, to give way to his Execution, (because I will avoid the inconvenience of giving so great a discontentment to my People, as I perceive this Mercy may produce) I remit this particular Cause to Both Houses: but I desire you to take into your serious Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations the inconveniences, which (as I conceive) may upon this occasion fall upon my Subjects, and other Protestants abroad, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since it may seem to other States to be a Severity with surprize; which I having thus represented to you, think my Self discharged, from all ill consequences that may ensue upon the Execution of this person.</hi>

               <p>For the first of publishing their Acts, though it was contrary to the practice of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to hold a Session of Parliament, unless the King were present by himself or his Commissioner: yet it was represented, that was but a point of Form; for as they Sate by the Kings Summons, so they did not pretend their Votes were Laws without the Kings Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; and their Sitting in this manner (though disorderly) could not be so derogatory to the Kings Authority, as at first view appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; since it was the constant practice of the Two Houses in <hi>England,</hi> to Sit and Vote in the Kings absence. The King was willing all these Acts should be of new voted, promising his Royal Assent to them; but they were stiff, and the King yielded. For the Reparation of Losses, the King remitted them to the Two Houses, who considered their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, and gave them a large Brotherly Assistance.</p>
               <p>For the disposal of the Castles, the election of the Councellours,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65282:101"/>
Officers of State and Judges, which the Covenanters desired should be done with Advice of Parliament, they went very harshly down with the King. But they alledged divers old Laws for their Demands, which seemed now necessary to he revived, since His Majesty was so seldom in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Kings great apprehension of this was, that it would give a Copy to <hi>England,</hi> for making the like Demands: to which it was answered, that the Kings residence in <hi>England</hi> made the case to differ vastly; the <hi>Scotish</hi> Lords engaging upon their Honour, to declare (in case the Two Houses should make the like Demands) they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable in so doing.</p>
               <p>In a Word the King granted all they demanded, only he thought it unjust, and unreasonable to grant an Indempnity to the other Party, and let his Friends be secluded from it; wherefore he pressed nothing so earnestly, as that the Oblivion might be without exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the List of those who were summoned upon the pretence of being Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, was so great, that he thought to abandon so many of his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants to the violence of the Times was so dishonourable, that he could not answer for it, neither to God nor man. The Covenanters, to yield somewhat, reduced their great number to five persons, who were the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Spotswood,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Hay,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Balcanquell:</hi> but the King thought he could not yield to that Demand, were there but one excepted; and told them, that though he had better Grounds to pursue some of themselves as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries, yet being willing to dispense with these his Resentments, he had reason to expect the same Condescendency from them. But they pretended their Bond and Oath for prosecuting of them; and though it was told them, that an ill Oath was worse kept, yet they were stiff; and the temper found, was, that their Processes should go on, but their Censure should be remitted to the King, and that the <hi>Scots</hi> should be satisfied with his Assurance, that he should imploy them no more in <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs without consent of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And thus all things were agreed on, and His Majesty determined to go in Person to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to settle matters there; but at this time the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners began to Cabal with the Male-contents in the Two Houses, and in particular concurred with them in the pursuit of the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> The Friendship betwixt the Marquis and that Gallant man, had been great and intire: and as his Testimony in those matters about which he was examined was among the Evidences <hi>Strafford</hi> had in his Defences; so his Confidence in the Marquis did appear by the following handsome Letter he wrote to him a few days before his Death.</p>

               <p>But since all His Majesties most vigorous Intercessions were not able to preserve that Great man, it is not to be imagined, any good Offices done by meaner persons could succeed; yet the Marquis acted in it with Great Candor and Friendship: but that preserved him not from being suspected, of having advised the King to consent to <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Death; and for his Vindication, I shall only refer the Reader to his own words, in the Speech he delivered the morning before he died, to be inserted in its proper place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scotish</hi> Bishops who were now at <hi>London,</hi> thought themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and complained of the Marquis as the cause of their Ruine;<note place="margin">Many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Marquis.</note> and yet he had been careful, to get them all either provided with Places, or relieved with the Kings Money, so that all of them in their Letters to him acknowledged him to be their only Patron, about the King. <hi>Traquair</hi> was worst pleased of any, and complained that the Marquis had opposed the Article of Incendiaries till his own Name was dashed out, and then had deserted the rest; but his Name was not struck out alone, <hi>Huntley</hi>'s, and many others being dashed out with him: besides, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of that Process, was only to be put out of Imployment in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by which the King was engaged in Honour to make up that loss another way, wherein the Marquis engaged to serve him faithfully. Others of the Court who hated and envied him, were glad to find colours of Censure in any of his Actions, and it was loudly talked, that the King was now to part with his Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> with his own hands, by granting Concessions so derogatory from Kingly Authority: but the King, who understood his own Affairs better than any of these Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers, saw the necessity of settling with <hi>Scotland</hi> immediately. For the Marquis represented to His Majesty, that though those Acts did very much diminish his Authority; yet the <hi>Scotish</hi> Parliament, being govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by a few Heads, who influenced the rest, there was no doubt but the gaining of the Leading-men, might so prepare things, that ere a few years went about all might be brought to a greater Temper: for the King was firmly resolved to make good what he now promised, and never to violate these Concessions, unless he could get them rescinded in Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:65282:102"/>And let me once for all say freely, this was the great Measure of all the Marquis his Counsels about <hi>Scotland,</hi> that (except when he saw at the beginning, as hath been said, that the Kings Interest and Honour requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, his utmost Resentments, and that a forcible Redress seemed not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, and promised success) way should be given to the present heats for some time, in hope of recovering of them by such Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and soon after dies.</note> and in pursuance of this design <hi>Rothes</hi> was much caressed by the King, and intirely gained; but as he was recovering to his Duty, he was overtaken by sickness, of which he died at <hi>Richmond,</hi> and was much regrated both by those of the Court, and the Covenant, being a man of great Abilities and much Honour.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Iune</hi> the Earl of <hi>Dumfermline</hi> and <hi>Lowdon</hi> were sent from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Scotland</hi> with the Articles of the Treaty, and a desire that the Parliament there might yet be prorogued for some time, since the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> put a stop to the Kings present Journey. They also carried down a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from <hi>Traquair,</hi> and were to deal, that the Acceptance of it might stop the further agitation of the Pursuit against him.</p>
               <p>All this while there had been divers Meetings of Parliament in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; but by reason of the dependence of the Treaty, they were still prorogued.<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is oft pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued, but goes on with the Process against Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries.</note> Their greatest business was to prepare the Process against the Incendiaries, both the President <hi>Spotswood,</hi> and the Clerk of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Hay,</hi> being Prisoners in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> since the former Winter. The Covenanters required the Kings Advocate to concur with them, according to his Place, which obliged him to assist in the Pursuit of all Publick Crimes; but <hi>Lanerick</hi> in the Kings Name commanded him to deny his concurrence, and this made much ado; as also in all the Kings Orders for proroguing the Parliament, mention was made of my Lord <hi>Traquair</hi> as Commissioner, against which they always protested. But at this time the Parliament would not consent to Prorogue of new, only they declared they should be preparing matters, and not go on to the Determining any thing before the middle of <hi>August,</hi> against which time the King purposed to be in <hi>Scotland.</hi> As for <hi>Traquair</hi>'s Submission, it was rejected, and many begun to complain aloud, that whereas they sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Bond to prosecute the Incendiaries, yet many were dispensed with; and much pains was taken by distinctions to satisfie their Consciences, that they meant not to set up an Inquisition by that Oath, and that it was only meant of those that were declared and avowed Incendiaries: but others said that the words were general, and tied them without respect of persons to pursue all equally.</p>

him: the King answered, He believed he was an honest man, that he had never heard any thing to the contrary, but that his Brother had been very active in his own Preservation. This made <hi>Lanerick</hi> Look the more narrowly to his Brothers Actions, to see if he could discover, whether in any thing he had studied to preserve himself, by prejudicing the King; but in a long Account of that business, which I have under his hand, he protested that the nearer he looked he discovered in him the greater Fidelity and Affection to his Master. It is true, the King met with great Opposition in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the matter of the <hi>Incendiaries</hi> and <hi>Plotters,</hi> and it was represented that the Marquis and his Brother might have made it less, which perhaps left some Impressions on His Majesty; but having it so often under both their hands, That might their Souls perish, if they left any thing undone that was in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to get a Compliance to the Kings Desires from the Parliament, I must believe this Opposition flowed from the Distempers of that Time.</p>
               <p>But about the middle of <hi>October,</hi> an odd passage fell in, which for its not being expected, was called the <hi>Incident.</hi> A Gentleman, not known to the Marquis, brought him and the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> the Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a Plot, he said, was laid for their Lives, and the Earl <hi>Lanerick</hi>'s; which he said he could justifie by one Witness, who was invited to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it. He told also a long formal Story of the persons were to be Actors, of Time, Place, and Manner, and said it was to be executed that very night. This the Marquis carried to the King without naming Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which could not be done safely by the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> since he had but one Witness to prove them by. The King desired him to examine the thing to the bottom, and bring him what further Evidence he could find. In the Evening other Presumptions were brought to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, but no clear Evidence, and the matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r was got abroad, and in every bodies mouth; so that all who depended on these Lords came about them in great numbers: and those on whom the Design was fastened, gave out it was a Forgery to make them odious, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered also together. The Marquis hearing this, did not stir out of doors, lest some of their too officious followers had raised Tumults; and next day in the Evening, he with the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and half a dozen Servants, went out of Town to his House of <hi>Keneel,</hi> twelve miles from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and sent his excuse to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, with the true account of the Reasons that moved him to do what he had done. Upon this many Discourses went about, People of all sides passing construction as they were affected; but the Parliament took the whole matter into Consideration. Those who had given the Information, owned what they had said, and those on whom the Plot was fixed, did as positively deny all: so that no clear Proof being brought, the Parliament could come to no other Decision, but that the Lords had good reason to withdraw themselves; and so they were invited to return to their place in Parliament.<note place="margin">But he is again in His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties favour.</note> This was a tedious business, and put a great stop to the Settlement betwixt the King and the Nation; but further Particularities are thought needless to be set down, since this Matter vanished no effect following on it.</p>
               <p>The Marquis quickly recovered his former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oom in the Kings Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, so that there remained not so much as a vestige of this cross Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. Things in <hi>Scotland</hi> took presently a Settlement, and those
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65282:103"/>
were called <hi>Plotters</hi> and <hi>Banders</hi> (after examination, and a delivering up of their Bond, which was burnt by the hand of the Common Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) were set at Liberty, after some time of further Restraint: but the Process of the alledged Incendiaries was to go on, yet they were to enjoy their Liberty, and undergo no other Censure but the loss of Publick Imployment; which though yielded at<hi>London,</hi> was long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they pretending their Oath to bring them to condign Punishment.</p>
               <p>But as the King was going on with the Settlement of one Kingdom,<note place="margin">The Rebellion breaks out in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note> he got the saddest News that ever were heard out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Rebellion and Massacre had broken out there; whereupon His Majesty recommended to the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Relief of his oppressed Protestant Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which they undertook very willingly. But because of the interest <hi>England</hi> had in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners were appointed to Treat with the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> for Concluding a Peace betwixt the two Nations, and Settling of Trade, and particularly about the Terms upon which they should engage in the War of <hi>Ireland</hi>: and so about the middle of <hi>November,</hi> the King, having granted to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation all they could demand, ended the Parliament there, and returned to <hi>London</hi> about the end of that month. But before the Marquis left <hi>Scotland,</hi> he by the Kings particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, entred in a close Friendship with <hi>Argyle,</hi> considering that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the great Power of that Family, his Interest with the Clergy and Covenanters was such, that none could be so useful to His Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as he. And this Friendship was to be twisted closer by a Bond of a near Alliance betwixt their Children. But from all the Letters that passed betwixt them, (yet to be seen) it is as clear as can be, that all the Marquis his design in this Friendship was for the Kings Service, and that all that time <hi>Argyle</hi> expressed a hearty concurrence in it. To gratifie the Covenanters the more, the King had created him a Marquis: <hi>Lowdon</hi> was also made Chancellor, <hi>Lesley</hi> Earl of <hi>Leven,</hi> and <hi>Lindsay</hi> put in a fair way to be Treasurer, <hi>Traquair</hi> being turned out.</p>
               <p>The King at his return to <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to <hi>London</hi> where he finds matters worse.</note> found the Edge he had left on some of their spirits was no way blunted, but growing into more sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. When the Marquis was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Member of the House of Commons, laying out their Grievances, among other things inveighed against Monopolies, and spoke so plainly, that all understood he meant the Marquis, as a Person that deserved to be accused, as well as either <hi>Strafford</hi> or <hi>Canterbury</hi>; but others of that same Cabal took him up sharply. And now upon the Kings return, his Enemies finding their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs against him could not take with the King, in whose Favour he was as much as ever, they took a strange Course to destroy him; which was to set on some Members of the House of Commons to accuse him, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had engaged <hi>England</hi> into all that Expence; who had also invited the <hi>Scots</hi> to march into <hi>England,</hi> and had been always the third in <hi>Strafford</hi>'s and <hi>Canterburie</hi>'s Counsels; who had advised the Dissolving of the former Parliament, and had oppressed the Subjects by the grants of many Monopolies which he had. This was smelled out even by some of the same Cabal, who perswaded their Friends to desist; shewing them, That for his Carriage betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> an Oblivion was passed in the late Treaty, which was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>; That for other things, though his
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65282:104"/>
Engagement in the Court had carried him along to some extreme Counsels; yet they said, it was well enough known, how moderate his Inclinations were, how great an Instrument he had been in the late Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and how much he was hated upon that account; and that this was a design to destroy him, either out of malice, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some feared his moderate Counsels in <hi>England,</hi> as much as they hated them in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This seems to have flowed from the Friendship which divers of the Leaders in the House of Peers had for him, whom he had often obliged; and as they were not unsensible, nor forgetful of his good Offices, so they seem to have had a particular kindness for his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And while he was in <hi>Scotland</hi>; he kept Correspondence with <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devil, Essex,</hi> and others, and chiefly with the Lord <hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Seale</hi>; but all their Letters shew that his greatest business with them, was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to a better Correspondence with the King.</p>
               <p>But when the Marquis smelled out the design against him, he gave the King an account of it; and told him, that if His Majesty intended to go on in his Affairs in a Kingly way, he would wait on his Commands, and expose himself to the displeasure of the House of Commons: but if His Majesty intended to settle Matters by an absolute Compliance with the Parliament, then he conceived it was fit, that his Servants should use their endeavours for their own Preservation, that so they might be afterwards useful to his Service: yet he said, he would do nothing for himself, but by His Majesties Allowance and Direction (being it is like taught more caution by the Jealousies had been taken from his care of vindicating himself in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi>) The King upon this allowed him to use all means for his own Preservation, which he so managed that the designed Accusation came to nothing.

They could not alledge that against Episcopacy in <hi>England,</hi> which they pretended in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that it had never been fully nor clearly settled in it, or that the stream both of Clergy, and Laity, had run cross to it: the contrary of all that was clear in <hi>England,</hi> where Episcopacy was deeply rooted in their Law. And ever since the Reformation, for eighty years together, the Church of <hi>England</hi> had flourished under Episcopacy; so that it was the wonder and envy of the World, till of late that some <hi>Brownists,</hi> and other Sectaries, begun to disturb its quiet.

               <p>His Majesty named the Officers of the Army that was to go over to the relief of the Protestants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> choosing them so, that they might be most acceptable to <hi>Scotland</hi>: and this he did both to gain the more upon them by his Confidence, as also to set those troublesom People out of the way; though this turned to the great prejudice of his Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as shall afterwards appear. But for this Advice, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis deserved no share of the Blame; for the King left him behind at <hi>London,</hi> to see what could be effectuated by Mediation with those of the Peers, whom he knew to love him; and it appears by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Note, that he continued in His Majesties Confidence.</p>

But he hearing of this was resolved to be carried sick as he was to the King, which the King knowing, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to stay till God gave him Strength to come, without prejudice to his Health.</p>
               <p>In <hi>March</hi> the Treaty between the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was closed;<note place="margin">The Treaty with <hi>Scotland</hi> for the relief of <hi>Ireland</hi> is ended.</note> and among other Articles one was cast in, <hi>That an Vniformity of Religion should be endeavoured betwixt the Kingdoms.</hi> But the King would do nothing that might seem to stop the <hi>Irish</hi> business, and therefore gave way to it, though he smelled the design of it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly well. Besides, the words being conceived in general Terms, he would not oppose them; since he judged an Uniformity of Religion was to be endeavoured, as well as they did, but with this odds, that he thought the Standard of it should be taken from <hi>England.</hi> As soon as this went home, the <hi>Scotish</hi> Armies went over speedily in the beginning of <hi>April:</hi> And the <hi>Scotish</hi> Council wrote to His Majesty, and the Two Houses, that they designed to send the Marquis of <hi>Argyle</hi> over to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but first to send him and the Earl of <hi>Lowdon</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate betwixt the King and the Houses; with which His Majesty was pleased. But the Houses excused it in a fair way, pretending, that they judged <hi>Argyle</hi>'s presence necessary in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Many wondred whence this Jealousie of him did flow; some thought it was because the King consented to it, and therefore they misdoubted him; others apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that their Jealousie was founded on the Friendship that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Marquis and him; and that finding the Marquis so inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly firm to the Kings Interest, and averse from theirs, they feared that <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Friendships and his was founded on the same designs.</p>

                     <p>And as for His return to <hi>London,</hi> I likewise affirm He never gave me cause to hope, let be to engage my self to the Parliament for it.

                  </note> which he purposed, both to put more vigour in the Army by his Presence; as also to refute those Calumnies were spread upon him, as if he inclined to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and had been accessory to the late Rebellion, with which dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Calumnies his Enemies were beginning to asperse him. But the <hi>Scotish</hi> Council, as well as the Two Houses,<note place="margin">but that moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is disliked by both Nations.</note> interceded earnestly with him against this Design, pretending the Hazard his Sacred Person would be in. Some judged that they were afraid, lest by such a real Argument the Calumnies were cast on His Majesty, and scattered among the Vulgar for carrying on their Designs, might be refuted; and some feared lest His Majesty, had he gone to the Army, might have gained too much upon their Hearts, whereby he might have been in a Condition to have over-awed the Two Houses.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:65282:107"/>In <hi>May</hi> the <hi>Scotish</hi> Council sent up the Lord Chancellor to offer a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a better Understanding betwixt the King and the Two Houses; but the King was much irritated,<note place="margin">The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of <hi>Scotland</hi> sent to mediate betwixt the King and the Two Houses,</note> by the Affront he had lately received before <hi>Hull</hi> from <hi>Hotham.</hi> He likewise found the Chancellor insisting on <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Church-Government,</hi> therefore he ordered his return into <hi>Scotland</hi>; and gave him a full account of all had passed betwixt him and his Two Houses, requiring him to give a true representation of it to his Council there. In the end of the Month the Marquis had recovered so much Strength as to come and wait on the King at <hi>York,</hi> where he would gladly have prosecuted his former Counsels, for advancing a Settlement betwixt the King and his Two Houses: but he knew not how to advise the King to grant more than he had already yielded to, which (as the King said to him) was more than had been granted by all the Kings of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> since the Conquest: adding, that though he had gone a great length in Concessions to them, they had not obliged him by one favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Vote, so that nothing remained for the Marquis but to lament the Kings Misfortune; yet he offered the uttermost of his Services to him, and subscribed for the pay of threescore Horse in the Kings Army. But he represented to His Majesty the Hazard of <hi>Scotland</hi>'s concurring with the Two Houses; which the King might easily apprehend, both from the late carriage of their Commissioners, and from what he knew of their Temper, especially of the Ministers Zeal, and Power with the People. For his own part, he said, he was able to do the King small Service any where; but having neither Interest, friends, nor followers in <hi>England,</hi> he would be but a burden to His Majesty there: but if he could signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any thing, it was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he should use his utmost En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to divert them from assisting the Kings Enemies; for to expect Aid from them, was not to be thought upon. His Majesty judging this most expedient, sent him to <hi>Scotland,</hi> without any positive Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, recommending only to him his Service in General, of which he was so confident that he wrote the following Letter after him.</p>

These were zealously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by the Emissaries from <hi>England,</hi> and all Places sounded with the danger Religion was in; so that he found his Negotiation was like to prove again unfortunate. The only means by which he had any hopes of engaging <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Kings Quarrel, was, to move that an Invitation might be sent from <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Queen for her return, (whom the Tumults at <hi>London</hi> had driven beyond Sea) that she might mediate for a Settlement betwixt the King and the Two Houses. This he judged might insensibly draw them on to own the Kings Service, for if the Queen came upon their Invitation, they would be obliged in Honour to protect her, and see that she met with no Injuries, and to resent such as should be done her; and therefore he sent a confident Friend to give His Majesty an account of the Posture things were in, according to the following Instructions.</p>

            <p>In <hi>August</hi> following there was an Assembly, to which the King sent the Earl of <hi>Dunfermline</hi> Commissioner,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dunfermline</hi> Commissioner to the General Assembly.</note> with full Assurances of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Resolution to adhere to what was now settled by Law, and to encourage all good Motions for advancing of Piety and Learning: and it was also recommended to him, as his chief Work, to keep the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly within their own bounds; that they might not meddle with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> nor interpose in the Differences betwixt the King and the Two Houses. But this was not to be done, except by Authority backed with Force; for there came a Declaration from the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was very welcome to them, and had such a Return as they of <hi>England</hi> desired. For the Assembly declared <hi>Prelacy</hi> to be the great Mountain that lay in the way of the advancement of Religion,<note place="margin">The Assembly declares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               </note> which must first be removed before the Church and Work of God could be established; and nothing the Kings Commissioner said, was able to divert them from this, so irresistible was their Zeal. They also sent a Petition to the Council, desiring them to second their Address to the King, for an Uniformity in Church-Government in all his Dominions; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise desired, that by reason of the Commotions were in <hi>England,</hi> the Council would call together the Conservatours of the Peace (this was a Court established by the late Parliament, to see to the Preservation of the Articles of the late Treaty with <hi>England.</hi>) The Council upon this recommended Uniformity in Church-Government, by a Letter to the King, wherein they desired also Warrant to convene the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatours of the Peace: the Assembly wrote also to the King to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:65282:108"/>The Marquis represented to His Majesty, that their Zeal for this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity was so great, that no Art could hinder them from Petitioning for it; but if they could be preserved from Deeds,<note place="margin">Many desire Uniformity in Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and that the Conservators of Peace might meet.</note> their big words were to be answered with smooth Language.</p>
            <p>But as for the Meeting of the Conservatours of the Peace, he laid out the hazard of it to the King; for if he refused to convene them, it would raise Jealousies in the Peoples minds, and there was ground to fear they would meet of their own accord, if they were not called; which would be an affront to the Kings Authority, and might preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate a Rupture. But on the other hand, there was no small danger in their Sitting, for of that number, some were likelier to disturb than conserve the Peace. To the Letters from the Assembly and Council the King wrote the following Answer.</p>

                     </note> in their Desire to Vs about Vnity of Religion, and Vniformity of Church-Government in all Our three Kingdoms; which cannot be more earnestly desired by you, than shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally endeavoured by Vs, in such a way as We in Our Conscience conceive to be best, for the flourishing Estate of the true Protestant Religion. But as for Ioyning with Our Houses of Parliament here in this Work, it were improper for Vs at this time to give any Answer: for since their Meeting they have never made any Proposition to Vs, concerning Vnity of Religion, or Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Church-Government: so far are they from desiring any such thing, as we are confident the most considerable Persons, and those who make fairest Pretences to you of this kind, will no sooner embrace a Presbyterial than you an Episcopal. And truely it seems, (notwithstanding whatsoever Profession they have made to the contrary) that nothing hath been less in their minds than Settling of the true Religion, and Reforming such Abuses in the Church-Government, as possibly have crept in, contrary to the establish't Law of the Land: to which we have been so far from being averse, that We have by divers Declarations and Messages pressed them to it, though hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it hath been to small purpose. But when-ever any Proposition shall be made to Vs by them, which We shall conceive may any way advance the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the true Protestant Religion, according to the Word of God, or esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Church-Government according to the known Laws of this Kingdom, We shall by Our chearful Ioyning with them, let the World see, that nothing can be more acceptable unto Vs, than the furthering and advancing of so good a Work. So we bid you Farewell.</p>

                  <p>I found them with the same Affections and Desires your Lordship left in them, but as they conceive, not so able to Act as they were then. They appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> will be much higher in their Demands than at that time; as understanding now both the Kings Power, and their own, which were then but upon forming, and promised a greater Equality. The Kings two Messages to the Parliament have likewise so discredited His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Affairs in this Country, that they fear many forward enough before, will now unwillingly engage in any way which may displease the Parliament; yet they are resolved to do their best, and I believe say little less in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed Letter, signed by all three.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty must expect in point of Religion, to be prest for Vniformity in Church-Government; and if His Majesty may be moved to publish some handsome Declaration satisfactory in that point, it would infinitely advance all his Affairs in this Country, and from hence have a powerful influence upon that.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament hath gained much here by their last Vote, and there is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine Answer expected to their last Message sent by the Lord <hi>Maitland,</hi> which will extraordinarily confirm the former Correspondence; if the King do not something plausible in the same kind, timeously and unconstrained, the two Kingdoms will shut upon him in despight of what his best Servants can do.</p>
                  <p>Here is no Order for publishing His Majesties Declarations, and great care taken to the contrary, which occasions great prejudication in the common Peoples minds, and were very fit to be amended.</p>
                  <p>I am looked upon here with great Iealousie, yet it lessens because they see I am not busie. I am advised by your Brother, and the rest, for avoiding of suspicion to go up to Court, which (having dispatched some particular business I have of my own) I am resolved to do. They have entrusted me with these particular Queries, of which they desire His Majesties Resolution; if your Lordship find opportunity you may acquaint His Majesty with them They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire likewise your Lordship may be sent down with a Letter to the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners full of Confidence, and allowing them all Freedom in their Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In respect of this great Meeting, your Brother cannot make his Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Holland</hi>: no Act of that nature being now to be done, their Opinion and Authority not consulted: but I find them all right set in the thing, and truly so respective to the Queens Person, it did my Heart good to hear them.

All the Lords Conservators which are with you, will receive Summons: but it is not desired they should come down, and truly I believe their Presence will do more hurt than good.</p>

He said, he had a Message to deliver them from His Majesty, but received no other Answer than still a Command to withdraw, which at last he obeyed: then they sent the Black Rod to him, requiring him to send the Message to them by him; which he refused, having Commands to deliver the Message him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the House. But they again pressed it, yet he still refused; at last they declared, that if any Evil did arise from the not delivering of his Message, they were free of it: whereupon he sent it to them by Mr. <hi>Maxwell,</hi> to which he received no other Answer, than their absolute Command immediately to remove from Town. The House of Commons were something more favourable to Sir <hi>John Culpeper,</hi> who after some Debate, was admitted into the House, (though not to his Place) but, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, delivered his Message at the Bar, and thereafter was commanded to withdraw. It was then taken into Consideration, whether or not he should any more be admitted as a Member of that House; which was voted in his favours, so that it is like their Answer will be returned by him: which I hear will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be to let His Majesty know, that so long as his Proclamations are out against the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> (and such others their Adherents, of whom they
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65282:110"/>
account themselves to be) as Traytors, and the Standard up for raising of Men to suppress them; they account themselves as out of His Majesties Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and so incapable to Treat.</p>
                  <p>By this the World will see, whether His Majesty or they be the occasion of this War, and of all the Blood which is like to be shed in this unfortunate Kingdom. His Majesty hath left no means of Accommodation unessayed, for he hath even descended to make the first Offer of a new Treaty; so careful is He of His Subjects Lives, that for their Safeties, He is even prodigal of His Own Honour: and certainly he hath not a Subject that hath Honour, but will be sensible of the Extremities he is now reduced into. I wish our Countrymen may take it so to heart, as not to neglect this occasion of witnessing their Affections to His Majesty, by making some Overtures for such a Treaty, or offer of their Service to Him, (since His Majesty is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely resolved to send no more Messages) as may be most for His Majesties Honour, and Peace of His Kingdoms: which if they shall refuse or despise, I hope we will not then forget, that it is our King that is reduced to this necessity, and that we will never look on unconcerned where he is so deeply engaged. I hope you will pardon the Trouble I give you in reading this long ill-written Letter; for had I not been Commanded to it, by a Power which God willing I shall never disobey, it had not been hazarded on by</p>

We are sure, Our late Actions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> will to all posterity be an acceptable witness of Our Care, in preserving the Liberty of those Our Subjects, and Our Desire to settle perfect Peace in that Our Kingdom.

of this Parliament, (indeed denying none but such as denyed Vs any Power at all, and were never so much as demanded from any of Our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors) will bear the like Testimony of Our Affection to the Good and Peace of this Kingdom, though the success hath not been alike. For though We have used Our best Endeavours, to prevent the present Distractions and threatning Dangers: yet so prevalent have been the opposers of Vs, and the Peace of Our Kingdoms, that not so much as a Treaty can be obtained, (though by Our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Messages We have descended to demand and press it) unless upon such Conditions, as would either by taking all Power of Government from Vs, make Vs as nothing; or by forcing Vs to quit the Protection of such, as for obeying Vs (according to Law and their Oath of Allegiance) they would have Traytors, and so make Vs do an Act unworthy of a King. Yet so desirous We are to save Our Subjects Blood, (which cannot but be prodigally spent, if We be necessitated by force of Arms to decide these unhappy Differences) that no sooner any such Treaty shall be offered unto Vs by them, (which with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Safety We can receive) but We shall chearfully embrace it. This We have thought fit to acquaint you with, that from Our Selves, you may know Our love to Peace, and We doubt not but your Meeting at this time will produce something which will witness your tender respect to Our Honour and Safety; and so much We do confide in your Affections, as We shall absolutely leave the ways and means of expressing it to your selves.

            <p>At this time there were great Complaints of some encroachments made upon the Priviledges the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation had enjoyed in <hi>France</hi>:<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Louthian</hi> is sent to <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress whereof the Council thought it necessary to send one to <hi>France,</hi> and made choice of the Earl of <hi>Louthian</hi>; and sent him first to the King, with the Instructions they had given him, that His Majesty might send him as His Minister, to negotiate that Affair. One of the Instructions, was to get the Marquis put in possession of the Honour and Revenue of <hi>Chastle-herault.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Earl of <hi>Lowthian</hi>'s coming to Court, the Instructions he had from <hi>Scotland</hi> were called for by His Majesty; who judged he had no reason to allow this Precedent of His Subjects instructing His Agents to Foreign Courts, and these are yet extant among <hi>Lanerick</hi>'s Papers.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65282:111"/>
But the King caused write them over in his Name, so that there was no ground from this, to charge any thing on the Marquis, as tampering with Foreign Princes, which was publickly done by his Enemies on this occasion; it having been ordinarily recommended by King <hi>Iames</hi> to all the Ministers he sent from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>France.</hi> Neither was this done without the Kings particular Knowledge and Orders; for besides that the King gave that Instruction with the rest, he very seriously recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it by word of mouth to <hi>Lowthian</hi>'s Care, as he informed the Writer.</p>
            <p>After this the Marquis represented to the King, that it were fit he should send down some person of Quality to give fresh Assurances and Hopes, before they sent up their Commissioners:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lanerick</hi> is sent back to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> whereupon the King sent down the Earl of <hi>Lanerick,</hi> as the person who understood his thoughts best, and was ablest to second his Brother in advancing his Service. He came from <hi>Oxford</hi> in the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> and brought the following Letter from the King to his Brother.</p>

               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:65282:112"/>This excellent Letter will both shew, what pious Resentments His Majesty carried along with him in the greatest perplexities of his Affairs, and discover how he did not think that the Marquis had either negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or abused his Trust. <hi>Lanerick</hi> acted with more briskness, and spoke more home and roundly than his Brother, which preserved him in a high degree from the Jealousies, which the smoothness of his carriage brought upon him. Now the Pulpits were not idle, for the Ministers begun again to work on the People,<note place="margin">The Ministers perswade the People to Arms.</note> for the Defence of the Good Cause now in hazard, which was ecchoed back with the applause of the Vulgar.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Marquis and <hi>Argyle</hi> at enmity.</note>At this time the Marquis his Friendship with <hi>Argyle</hi> grew to a Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which after a few moneths turned into an Enmity; for he finding <hi>Argyle</hi> so backward in all motions for the Kings Service, and that he could not be prevailed upon to continue in a Neutrality in the <hi>English</hi> quarrel, broke with him.</p>
            <p>There was then in <hi>Scotland</hi> one <hi>Pickering,</hi> an Agent from <hi>England,</hi> who studied to poyson all with Misinformations of the Kings Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Designs.<note place="margin">The Marquis is complained of <hi>England</hi> as the Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> He wrote to Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> that he found good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with all in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to own their Quarrel, and declare for them; only the Marquis with his Friends resisted it so powerfully, that till he were laid aside, the success of his Negotiation was to be feared. Wherefore he advised to proceed against him roundly, and either to summon him to the House of Peers, or to send down a Warrant to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue him in <hi>Scotland</hi> as the Incendiary betwixt the two Kingdoms: and he sent threatnings of this to the Marquis; but he found his firmness to the Kings Service was proof against all Attempts, and he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be caressed, nor cudgelled out of it. Most of <hi>Pickering</hi>'s Letters, both to <hi>Pym</hi> and <hi>Clotworthy,</hi> were intercepted, from which I draw these Accounts.</p>
            <p>About the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> there was a Council-day, (a particular account whereof I shall give,<note place="margin">Great debates in the Council about the Kings Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> as I have it from a Copy of a Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>London</hi>) in which the Chancellour presented to the Council a Letter from my Lord <hi>Lindsay</hi> (then at <hi>London</hi>) with the Declaration of the Parliament. But though the Lords of that Party knew nothing of this, yet by private Letters <hi>Lanerick</hi> had some conjectures of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand. After the Parliaments Paper was twice read, <hi>Lowdon</hi> resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it fully, and assoon as he had done with that, <hi>Lanerick</hi> delivered another Letter from the King, with as large a Declaration within it: and after it was twice read, <hi>Lanerick</hi> bade the Chancellour resume it, as faithfully as he had done the former; which accordingly he did. The first thing the Marquis thought best to move, as that of the least Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which yet would discover how the Council was inclined was the Publishing the Kings Declaration. The Lord <hi>Balmerino</hi> said, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament desired not theirs to be published, so it were Officiousness to do it; but that it were Injustice to publish the one without the other. The Marquis asked, was that because we owed as much to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as to the King? <hi>Lanerick</hi> added, he had a Command from the King for it. <hi>Argyle</hi> answered, they sate there to good purpose, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Message to them was a Command; and they two let fly at one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for a while with much eagerness. But the Marquis and <hi>Balme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> took the debate off their hands, and managed it more calmly. The Marquis said, the Vote was to be stated, Obey or Not obey: the other
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65282:112"/>
answered, that was the Bishops way of proceeding, to procure Orders from the King without Advice, and then charge all who offered bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Counsel with Disobedience. The Marquis said, to what did they mean to reduce the Kings Authority, if he might not set out Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for removing the Aspersions were cast on his Person and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? or would they speak plainly, were they afraid that his Subjects might have too good an opinion of him, if they heard himself? There appeared a variety of Opinions before it was put to the Vote, some were for Printing both, some were for Printing neither, some for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Kings and not the Parliaments; and one had a singular Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for Printing the Parliaments, and not the Kings. There were one and twenty Councellours present, and it being put to the Vote, Print or not Print, there were eleven who voted <hi>I, I, I,</hi> and nine voted <hi>No, No, No.</hi> This being carried that the Kings Declaration, and not the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should be Printed, the Marquis moved next, that the matter of these Declarations might be considered. But the Lord <hi>Balmerino</hi> said, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was long in contriving their Paper; and the King, and those about him, had been no doubt, as long in forming the other; and if we shall fall upon a few hours Consideration, to give our sense of them, <hi>we were pretty fellows in faith,</hi> which he twice repeated. This rude Raillery touched the Marquis in the quick, because he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived these words were not so much a reflexion upon himself, as on the King, who (on another great occasion) had used the same expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion. However they had sate and debated long, so they gave it over for that day. This is set down more particularly, because it was the first instance that these two Parties fell visibly asunder: and henceforth they continued stated in two Factions. But because I love not to name persons upon invidious occasions, henceforth all the other Faction shall be designed by the General term of the <hi>Church-party,</hi> (others calling them <hi>Argyl</hi>'s Party) and the other the <hi>Hamilton</hi>-party. However the Declaration was printed, which drew a large share of Censure and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on the two Brothers; but the King was so well pleased with their Behaviour, that he wrote the Marquis the following Letter.</p>

                     <p>The happy Vnion of the two Kingdoms under one Head, our King, doth so much add to His Majesties Greatness, and Strength of both Kingdoms, that we <hi>British</hi> Subjects cannot choose but wish that the said Brotherly Vnion be heartily entertained, and cherished by all fair and reasonable means, to which we conceive no one thing will so much conduce, as that the late Articles of the Treaty of Peace, and Conclusions taken thereupon about Vnity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, may be carefully and timeously prosecuted: wherein as our Commissioners then, so we now without presuming or usurping to prescribe Rules, or Laws of Reformation to our Neighbour-kingdom (Civil Liberty and Conscience being so tender that it cannot endure to be touched, but by such as they are wedded to, and have lawful Authority over them) notwithstanding, seeing the duty of Charity doth oblige all Christians to pray and profess their Desires, that all were of the same Religion with themselves, and since we all acknowledge that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the base and foundation of Kingdoms, and the strongest Bond to knit the Subjects to their Princes in true Loyalty, and to knit their Hearts one to another in true Vnity, we cannot but heartily wish, that this work of Vnion so happily begun, may be crowned and strengthened by the Vnity of Church-Government; and that your Lordships with us may be pleased to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it to His Majesty, and Both Houses of Parliament, as an expression and Testimony of our Affections to the good of our Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> and of our Desires to make firm and stable our Brotherly Vnion by the strong chain and Bulwark of Religion: but, as we have said, no ways intending thereby to pass our bounds, in prescribing, and setting down Rules and Limits to His Majesty, and the Two Houses of Parliament, their Wisdom and Authority, in the way of prosecution thereof. The sense we have of the great Calamities, and irreparable Evils, which upon occasion of these unhappy Distractions and Mistakes betwixt the Kings Majesty and the Two Houses of <hi>England,</hi> (which if not speedily removed cannot but produce the fearful and prodigious effects of a bloody and Civil War) obligeth us in the duty of Christians, and as feeling members of what may concern our Common Head, the Kings Majesty, and the Good and Happiness of our Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> humbly to represent to your Lordships, That as we will not be wanting with our Prayers, and our faithful and best Endeavours, to assist in the removing of these unhappy Mistakes and Misunderstandings: so we heartily wish, and humbly Petition your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, that from the deepness of your Wisdom such happy Motions may flow, as upon that tender care of our Soveraigns Person and Authority, Peace and Truth may be settled in all His Majesties Dominions.

Neither can we suppose, that any good Protestant, or true member of our Church, can imagine, far less seduce others to believe, that by the late Treaty of Peace, or Act of Vnion, we as <hi>Scotish</hi> Subjects are in any sort liberated from the Dutiful Obedience, which as <hi>Scotishmen</hi> we owe to our <hi>Scotish</hi> King, or from that due Loyalty, which as <hi>Scotish</hi> Subjects we owe to our Native Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, for Maintenance of His Person, Greatness and Authority; or that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, we are in any other Condition in these necessary Duties to our Soveraign, than we and our Ancestors were, and have been, these many Ages and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents, before the making of the said Act, or before the Swearing and Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of our late Covenant, by which we have solemnly sworn, and do swear <hi>not only our mutual Concurrence, and Assistance for the cause of Religion, and to the utmost of our power, with our Means and Lives, to stand to the Defence of our Dread Soveraign His Person and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the preservation of Religion, Liberty, and Laws, of this Church and Kingdom; but also in every Cause, which may concern His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Honour, we shall according to the Laws of this Kingdom, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Subjects, concur with our Friends and Followers in quiet manner, or in Arms, as we shall be required of His Majesty, or His Councel, or any having His Authority.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, That if your Lordships think it fitting, to make any answer to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> their Declaration, your Lordships may be pleased not to declare, enact, or promise, any thing which may trouble or molest the Peace of this Kirk and Kingdom; which by God's special Grace, and His Majesties Favour and Goodness, we enjoy and have established unto us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Hearts desire, by the Laws Ecclesiastical or Civil of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>respectivè,</hi> and which His Majesty since, by so many Declarations and deep Protestations hath Sworn to maintain inviolably.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That your Lordships may be pleased to consider, that as nothing will more diminish His Majesties Greatness, than that this Kingdom should consume in Civil War; so nothing will more conduce to the Suppressing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent <hi>Papists,</hi> malignant, schismatick, and Disloyal <hi>Brownists,</hi> and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, the special, if not the sole promovers of these unhappy Misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, than that heartily and freely, without respect of worldly and secondary Considerations, we give to <hi>Christ</hi> what is <hi>Christ</hi>'s, and to <hi>Caesar</hi> what is <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s; by means whereof, the Truth and Purity of Religion shall be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the utter Confusion of all these Sectaries, true Monarchical Government firmly setled; by which likewise, Laws and Authority shall retain their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vigour and force, to the Suppression of all Commotions and tumultuous Conventions, the bane and overthrow of all true Religion and Policy.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Although there be nothing farther from our minds, than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to question, or crave of your Lordships an account of your Actions, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly by the inviolable Laws and Customes of this Kingdome, that to be only proper and due to the King and Parliament, from whence you have

that great Charge and Trust delivered unto you: yet we hope your Lordships will give us leave, in all Humility to remember your Lordships of your Deliverance <hi>June 1642.</hi> and are confident, that the said Lords, the Petitioners, neither have, nor shall have, necessity to trouble themselves, nor the Council with Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of this kind, and that your Lordships in your Wisdom will take some Course for preventing all occasions, which may in any sort disturb the Peace of this Kingdom, or make Division among the Subjects thereof.</p>

               <p>This Petition was signed by a great many Noblemen, and Gentlemen;<note place="margin">Many sign it.</note> but though they took much pains to get Ministers to concur in it, yet none of them could be drawn to it. This Petition was presented with many hands at it to the Council; and it was observed, that as it was written by a trusty Friend of the Marquis's; so also all his Friends sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, which made the Author suspected, and did shew that his Friends adhered (hitherto) to their Duty, and his Example. All the Answer the Councellors returned to it, was, that they should be careful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as they should be answerable:<note place="margin">All the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters condemn it.</note> But the Preachers threatned Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to all the Authors and Subscribers of it, and detestable Neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty became the Head on which they spent their Eloquence. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the General Assembly passed a severe Censure on the Cross Petition, in a Remonstrance they gave in against it, which was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Counter-remonstrance. Upon these cross tides of Petitions, that were offered to the Council, the Conservatours of the Peace resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to send some Commissioners to <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers sent to Treat betwixt the King and the Two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> to Mediate betwixt the King and the Two Houses, and endeavour chiefly the Uniformity of Church-Government; for which end the Commission of the Kirk was also to send their Commissioners, to second them in it: and no resistance could be made to this, that was able to obstruct it. They also moved, that the King should be desired to call a Parliament in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis and his Friends opposed this vigorously, not that he was against a Parliament, but judged the Motion unseasonable; and thought the Time prefixed at the last Parliament, for the next, to wit, after three years, needed not be anticipated. It was also put in their Instructions to their Commissioners, to press the King to put all Papists from his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The Marquis and his Friends also opposed this, not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the thing it self, but because it seemed to cast a Scandal upon the King, as if his Religion were to be suspected. But the Church-party was strongest in this Meeting of the Conservatours, and so carried every thing in it. The Safe-conducts being come, they named their Commissioners, the Chancellour being the chief of them; and though <hi>Lanerick</hi> in the Kings Name excepted against the Lord <hi>Waristoun,</hi> and produced the Kings Warrant for it; yet they named him, but were so wise as not to send him. They were also so discreet, that they appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Commissioners to go first to the King. Things being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, <hi>Lanerick</hi> took the start of them; but they were at Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he being detained by a Garrison of the Parliaments for some days.</p>
               <p>In the end of <hi>February</hi> he came to <hi>Oxford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lanerick</hi> goes to Court, and discovers the inclination of the Church-party.</note> where he gave the King an account of the present state of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs, and that it was the Advice of His Majesties truest Friends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he should enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Commissioners with the best words he could give them, but should not by any means suffer them to go to <hi>London</hi>; since there were
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65282:115"/>
great grounds to fear, they would engage too deep in the Quarrel if they went thither. This Advice agreed so with the Kings Inclinations, that it could meet no resistance in his thoughts. When the Commissioners arrived they delivered their Message; but the King repeated what was formerly told them, <hi>That</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> England <hi>had different Laws and Interests, and therefore it was to give the one Kingdom too great an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over the other, to suffer them to come and be Vmpires in the present Differences.</hi> They pressed their Desires as warmly as they could, but all was in vain, for the King would by no means suffer them to go to <hi>London</hi>; and in particular he told the Earl of <hi>Lowdon,</hi> what grounds He had to believe they designed to raise an Army for the Parliaments Quarrel, and that some of his fellow-Commissioners would prove Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries rather than Mediators. But <hi>Lowdon</hi> with great Protestations deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they designed to raise Arms; and said to the King, These were but the Misrepresentations, with which the Marquis and his Brother abused His Majesty. As for the Calling a Parliament, the King said he saw no reason for it, and therefore would not anticipate the Day that was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prefixed for it. But to the Commissioners from the Assembly, the King gave the following Answer; which I set down in his own Words, having it written all with His Majesties own Hand.</p>
               <p>HIs Majesty commends the Zeal of the Petitioners for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the true Reformed Religion, against Heresy, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sects, Innovations, and Profanity, and always shall use His best and uttermost endeavours, for Advancing the one, and the utter Suppressing the rest.</p>
               <p>For the Vnity in Kirk-Government, His Majesty knows, that the Government now established by the Laws, hath so near a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and intermixture with the Civil State, (which may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Petitioners) that till a composed digested Form be presented to him, upon a free debate by Both Houses of Parliament, whereby the Consent and Approbation of the whole Kingdom may be had, and He and all His Subjects may discern what is to be left, or brought in, as well as what taken away, He knows not how to consent to an Alteration, otherwise than to such an Act for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e ease of Tender Consciences, in the matter of Ceremonies, as His Majesty hath often offered.</p>
               <p>And His Majesty hath formerly expressed Himself (and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues) willing, that the Debates of Religion may be entred into by a Synod of Learned and Godly Divines, to be regularly c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>osen, according to the Laws and Customs of this Kingdom; to which end His Majesty will be very willing, that some Learned Divines of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> may be likewise sent to be present, and offer their Reasons and Opinions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:65282:115"/>This was the Success of that Negotiation; but because the Reader may wonder how <hi>Lowdon,</hi> and the Marquis came to be in such terms, I shall set down the occasion of their Breach.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Lowdon</hi> was to go up, the Marquis resolved on a Course that should either stop his Journey, or make him so obnoxious to the King, that he should not dare to act contrary to his Duty; which was this. <hi>Lowdon</hi> had purchased from the King a Right to the Annuities of the Tythes, that was confirmed to His Majesty by Act of Parliament, whereupon the Marquis caused the following Petition to be drawn by <hi>Traquair's</hi> Advice.</p>

               <p>The last words of this Petition were by the first draught so concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as would have amounted to a Bond of Mutual Defence and Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which the Marquis thought might draw on a Rupture, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion a pursute as against Plotters; therefore, since this Paper was to be avowed and publick, he judged such Expressions as were smooth and general were fittest for their Design.</p>
               <p>This Petition was signed by him, and a great many of the Nobility: he also sent it up and down, all the places where he or his Friends had Interest, to get Subscriptions to it. This was generally lookt upon as a well-couched Bond, both by such as took it, and those who refused it; and yet this smoothing of the Expressions of it, was represented by the Marquis's Enemies, as done in prejudice to the Kings Service. These Petitions were sent immediately to the King; upon which great
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65282:116"/>
Complaints were made, as if by these immediate Addresses, the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of <hi>Scotland</hi> had been neglected: but the King justified that part of it in an Answer he wrote to the Council; and for the thing it self, he resolved to keep <hi>Lowdon</hi> under the fear of it, and therefore delayed to make any Answer.</p>
               <p>In the end of <hi>February</hi> Her Majesty landed at <hi>Burlingtown,</hi> whither the Earl of <hi>Montrose</hi> went to represent to Her the hazard of a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in <hi>Scotland,</hi>

Mean-while the Marquis hearing of Her Majesties Landing, went to wait on Her, to whom She proposed the Earl of <hi>Montrose</hi>'s Offer; but he studied by all means to divert Her from listning to it, upon the following Grounds.</p>

                  </note> and till that were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated on their part, he knew His Majesty would never consent to a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture on his part: and the King had so often and so lately, in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Declarations, protested, he was resolved unalterably to adhere to the late Settlement; that if he should now authorize the first Breach, it would bring an indelible stain upon his Honour, and create a perpetual Dif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was never a Castle nor Strength in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Kings Power, to which they might retire. The Vulgar were still at the Ministers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and by late and fresh experience they saw them all as one man resolved to die in the Defence of the Covenant; and any handful of Gentry could be gathered together, would signifie nothing, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their own Throats to their Enemies Rage, and the Kings Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their Hatred and Scorn: so there remained no hopes but in the <hi>Highland-men,</hi> which he accounted as good as none. Their two chief Heads where the Marquis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, any Companies could be brought down from the High-lands, might do well enough for a while; but no Order could be expected from them, for assoon as they were loaded with Plunder and Spoil, they would run away home to their Lurking-holes, and desert those who had trusted to them. And after all this, there was a <hi>Scotish</hi> Army in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was now well trained and disciplined, consisting of ten thousand men, who were for the most part at the Covenanters devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and these would be instantly brought over, there being no way to stop their Passage: and it was not to be imagined, that any Body of an Army could be raised in <hi>Scotland</hi> able to resist that Force. Upon
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65282:116"/>
these Reasons it was, that he not only disswaded the Queen from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to a present Breach, but resisted it as long as was possible; yet he undertook for none but himself, of which he put the Queen fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in mind, and the utmost of his expectation was to drive off Matters for that Year. And in this both my Lord <hi>Traquair</hi> and Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> concurred with him, and desired the whole Matter might be laid before His Majesty, that his Pleasure might be made known about it; but after a few days waiting on the Queen, the Marquis returned back to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>IT is acknowledged by His Majesty, that if any one of the Articles of Treaty had been broken or violated, (as His Majesty doth not so much as see pretended) or any Debate or Difference had risen thereupon, (about which there is now no Dispute) the Commissioners had then been not only warranted, but obliged to have laboured to prevent all Troubles and Divisions, which might arise by such a Breach to the disturbance of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e Common Peace, and to remove and compose all such Differences, according to such Power as was granted to them: but till His Majesty be satisfied, that Authority (by some Law) is given to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for Conserving the Articles of Treaty, to represent His Majesties Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in this Offer of Mediating for a desired and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Pacification here; His Majesty cannot see how the pious, dutiful, provident or charitable, Concernment of that Kingdom in the Calamities of this, or their Sympathy and sense of the Troubles of their Head, and fellow-Subjects, can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teress the Commissioners, any more than any other of His good Subjects of that Kingdom, to bestir themselves in Matters of that kind: or why any such Endeavours should be by any (much less universally) expected from them; so far is he from seeing that any undeclinable Necessity constrained them to it. And since the express words of the Act of Pacification it self are, that the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Commission shall be restrained to the Articles of Peace concluded in the Treaty, His Majesty cannot but wonder, whence they can pretend any Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Authority to meddle with, or press him concerning any such Articles, as are not included, but still left dependent, how important soever they suppose them to be, (even to the Common Peace:) And it giving them only liberty to convene to that effect among themselves, or with the Commissioners chosen by His Majesty with consent of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and restraining them in all their Proceedings to the Power granted to them, in manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said and no otherwise, as clearly intending to restrain all Power that might be pretended to by any Inserences, Analogies or Consequences (how manifest soever they might appear) and requiring them to consist of the number of Twelve, and not giving them Power to delegate a smaller number; His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty cannot consent, That that number the Laws allow not (that is, Three) should address themselves to those the Law hath not appointed them (this is, Both Hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s) not only concerning that which the Law intrusted not to them, (as a Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication here) but even concerning that from which the Law expresly restrains them, that is, one of the Articles of the Treaty no way concluded, or agreed on, but expresly reserved by the Parliament to be considered in due time, that is, in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65282:117"/>
their own time, concerning Church-Government, the intermixture of which with the Civil State, as His Majesty still conceives to be very great, and of very high Concernment, and not to be understood by the Commissioners, who have not the knowledge of the Laws and Policy of this Kingdom; so His Majesty is confident, (notwithstanding the Declaration, and Bill abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the Order of Bishops) that if they well knew, how generally any thing of that kind was opposed whilst the Houses continued full, and how the Major part of Both Houses were absent at the passing of that Declaration and Bill, (in so much that His Majesty, is credibly informed, that there were not above five Lords present when the Bill past) and what violent and tumultuous As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies had occasioned so great and unusual Absence, they would be confident, as he is, that in a full and peaceable Convention of Parliament, Both Houses will appear to be of the same opinion with His Majesty in this Particular, and to have in that the same thoughts of the Law and Policy of this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>His Majesties care that the deluge of the Troubles of this Kingdom affect not that with the danger of the like, is very visible to all the World. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty out of His great desire of continuing t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>em in Peace and Tranquillity, not desiring any assistance from them, even for His Own Preservation. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth desire any Commotion there, to assist their Rebellious and Invasive Armes here, will (He hopes) be lookt upon as the Troublers of Peace, and as Incendiaries labouring to lay foundations of perpetual Hostility betwixt the Two Kingdoms. And then (for ought His Majesty can see) there will be no cause to expect any Commotions there, and such Dangers will rather prove imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than real, though the Conservatours of the Treaty contain themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their legal and proper Bounds. His Majesty wonders, that since His appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of their Mediation was desired when His Safe-conduct was asked, and the first was not given, when the latter was, that it should not have been easily seen by these Proceedings of His Majesties, that as He never granted the first, (as seeing no Authority they had for such a Mediation) so He only at last granted the other, as being contented to hear what they could say to Him upon that Point, either as private persons, or to give Him better satisfaction than He could give Himself, what Right they could pretend to any Publick Capacity of that kind: but having heard all they have offered, and not finding any thing that warrants them in this, in any special manner above His Majesties other Subjects, His Majesty cannot with reason admit of any private Persons whatsoever into such a Publick Capacity, nor with His Own Dignity, and that of this Nation, can allow His Subjects of another Kingdom, not authorized by any Law, to make themselves (under the title of a Mediation) Vmpires and Arbitrators of the Differences here.</p>
                     <p>For the Calling of a Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> His Majesty desires to know what Promise of His it is, which they mention Him to have particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to His late Parliament. The Law which His Majesty then Graciously past concerning that Point, His Majesty well remembers, (and will justly, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, and religiously observe it, together with all the rest consented to by Him,) that the Parliament there shall convene upon the first <hi>Tuesday</hi> of <hi>June, 1644.</hi> And, according to the same Act, will appoint one betwixt this and that Day, if His Majesty shall think fitting; who as He is by that very Law expressed to be sole Iudge of that Convenience, so the Commissioners are neither by that, nor any other Law, entrusted, or enabled to Iudge thereof.</p>

                     <p>There is a general noise, as if the Lord Chancellour and the rest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, were not only kept as Prisoners, but in some further Danger. By <hi>Mungo Murray</hi> Your Majesty was advertised, that it was conceived fit, that seeing those that sent them had so positively recalled them against the fourth of <hi>May,</hi> they should be dispatched against that Time. In our opinions there was no Danger now to be apprehended by their Home-coming, but there would arise great Inconveniences if they should be detained: of that same Iudgment we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be still.</p>
                     <p>We do likewise humbly intreat, that we may know, if what was proposed to Your Majesty by my Lord of <hi>Traquair,</hi> Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> and my self, be come to His Majesties knowledge: and if we may expect the signification of his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against the fourth of <hi>May,</hi> in these Particulars, which we exceedingly wish.</p>

                     <p>But the Truth is, it will be a Work of great difficulty to keep these Men there any time, seeing there is little appearance that Money will be got from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and how to raise any considerable Sum here, as yet we see not; so even in this we desire to know Your Majesties Pleasure and Directions, what Course will be fitest to be taken; and if Your

                  <note place="margin">The Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners are not suffered to go to <hi>London,</hi> and returned to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note>But at <hi>Oxford</hi> the Commissioners insisted warmly, for a Permission to go to <hi>London</hi> for Mediating; and His Majesty persisting in his Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, the Lord Chancellour resolved on making a Protestation, that His Majesty, by not suffering them to go to <hi>Westminster,</hi> had violated the Safe-conduct. My Lord <hi>Lindsay,</hi> who was ordered to come from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and second the Chancellour in this Negotiation, did all he could to divert him from that Resolution; but the other said, he had positive Orders from <hi>Scotland</hi>: he was also peekt with the Petition about the Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, and got a great disgust by a Letter of his Ladies, which not coming under a right Cover had been intercepted, and brought to His Majesty, wherein severe things were said against the Kings Cause and Party; and particularly the Marquis was bitterly enveighed against, for having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himself up so intirely to the Kings Service, that he designed the Ruin of all who opposed it. The Chancellour came, and made his last Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to the King, for liberty to enter on a Mediation betwixt Him and the Two Houses: adding, that if that were denyed, he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to Protest in the Names of them who sent him, that His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Conduct was violated. But the King was not shaken with it, only he took the Chancellour apart, and used many perswasions to divert him from it, and made him great Offers if he would comply with his Desires: for the King apprehended, that it might have precipitated a Breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Him and <hi>Scotland.</hi> But the Chancellour said, he acted by a Trust committed to him, which he must discharge faithfully, and obey the Orders sent him, from those in whose Name he came; and said much to assure the King, there was no design in <hi>Scotland</hi> to own the Quarrel of the Two Houses against His Majesty, and protested, he should die rather than concur in such Courses. But this did not satisfie His Majesty, whereupon finding the Chancellour could not be wrought upon, his next Attempt was upon <hi>Lindsay,</hi> to whom he spake with more Freedom, and told him in how great a Strait he was; for it seemed, if he refused to allow their going to <hi>Westminster</hi> a Breach might follow betwixt him and his Native Kingdom: but on the other hand, he could not permit them to go, both because of the Reasons he had alledged, and the Fears he had of their engaging with the Parliament; and chiefly, that all his Councellours and Officers at <hi>Oxford</hi> were so far against it, that he heard it was whispered amongst them, that they would all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake him if he gave them leave, since they held themselves assured that the Design of their going was to bring an Army from <hi>Scotland</hi>: wherefore he intreated <hi>Lindsay</hi> would serve him in that Particular, which he undertook frankly, though he added he had small hopes, since he had already attempted as much as he could with no Success. But as he left His Majesty, he made a Visit in his way to his Lodgings, where he met the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> who told him plainly, That though the King
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65282:118"/>
should consent to their going to <hi>London,</hi> thither should they never get; for a great many were resolved to lie in their way, and cut them all to pieces ere they were many miles from <hi>Oxford.</hi> This he confirmed to him with many Oaths, adding, that as the King knew nothing of it, so it would not be in his power to hinder it; and out of kindness to my Lord <hi>Lindsay,</hi> he advised him not to go, though the Chancellour went. With this <hi>Lindsay</hi> came to his Lodgings, and shewed the Lord Chancellour the hazard, not only their Lives would be in, but of the irreparable Breach would follow upon it; which being considered by them, it was resolved they should pass from their Desires, and crave the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for <hi>Scotland,</hi> since they would not offend him by the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an unacceptable Mediation; which they accordingly did, to His Majesties great satisfaction. And so they took leave, the Chancellour with the other Commissioners going for <hi>Scotland</hi>; only <hi>Lindsay</hi> returned to <hi>London.</hi> Upon this His Majesty sent all the <hi>Scotish</hi> Lords, then at Court, to <hi>Scotland</hi> to serve him there, who were the Earls of <hi>Morton, Roxburgh, Kinnoul, Annandale, Lanerick,</hi> and <hi>Carnwath</hi>; but before they could be dispatched, he sent Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> to <hi>Scotland</hi> with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his opinion about the Services his Friends might do him there; who came by <hi>York,</hi> and brought from the Queen the following Letter to the Marquis, in answer to what he had written to Her Majesty: which (though written in <hi>French,</hi> as all Her private Letters were, yet) I shall set down, translated in <hi>English,</hi> that all may run more smoothly.</p>

                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:65282:119"/>About the beginning of <hi>May, Lowdon</hi> and the other Commissioners came down, and a day after them came the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> who told the Marquis,<note place="margin">They proceed to final Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> that in a few days he should see the Earls of <hi>Roxburgh, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noul,</hi> and <hi>Lanerick,</hi> with the Kings Instructions; but by reason of <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noul</hi>'s Infirmity, and <hi>Roxburgh</hi>'s Age, they moved slowly. On the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> the <hi>Iunto</hi> of the Church-party moved, that there might be a Joynt-meeting of the Council and Conservatours of the Peace, and Commissioners for Publick Burdens, to consider of the present State of Affairs. The Marquis and <hi>Morton</hi> resisted this all they could, but they were over-ruled, and so these Judicatories met: to them it was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that considering the hazard the Nation was in, by reason of Armies, which were now levying in the North of <hi>England,</hi> there was a necessity of putting the Kingdom in a posture of Defence, which could not be done without a Convention of Estates or a Parliament; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was moved, that a Convention of Estates should be presently called. The Marquis argued much against it, shewing that this was to encroach upon the Kings Prerogative in the highest degree, and so would be a direct Breach of the Peace with the King, and against the Laws of the Land; adding, Was this all the Acknowledgment they gave the King for his late Gracious Concessions, for this struck at the root of his Power? In this he was seconded by my Lord <hi>Morton,</hi> but most vigorously by Sir <hi>Thomas Hope</hi> the Kings Advocate, who debated against it so fully, from all the Laws and constant Practice of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that no Answer could be alledged; and indeed discharged his Duty so faithfully, that the Marquis forgave him all former errors for that dayes Service. But it was in vain to argue, where the Resolution was taken on Interest more than Reason; so it was carried, that the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour should summon a Convention of Estates against the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune.</hi>

                           <p>AS there hath been no mean left unattempted which the malice and wit of Rebellion could devise, to infect and poyson the Affections and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of Our good Subjects of Our Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and to withdraw their Hearts from Vs by the most pernicious and desperate Calumnies, that could be invented to under-value and lessen Our Reputation with Foreign Princes, by Injuries and Affronts upon their Publick Ministers, and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming to send Agents qualified for Negotiation without Our Consent, and in truth, to expose Vs, and Our Royal Authority to Scorn and Contempt, by assuming a Power over Vs; so the pernicious Contrivers of these bloody Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers have not delighted in any Art more than in that, by which they have hoped to stir up Our good Subjects of that Our Native Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> to joyn with them, and to infuse in them a jealousie and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem of Our true Affection, and Our Gracious Intentions towards that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To this purpose they have used great Industry to convey into that Our Kingdom, and to scatter and disperse there divers Seditious Pamphlets, framed and contrived against Our Person and Government, and have sent Agents of their own to reside there; and to promote their Designs, one of whom lately resident there, one <hi>Pickering,</hi> by his Letters of the <hi>9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                              </hi> of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> to Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> assures him of the Concurrence of that Kingdom, and that the Ministers in their Pulpits, do in downright terms press the Taking up of Arms, and in another of his Letters to Sir <hi>John Clotworthy,</hi> sayes, that the Trumpet sounded to the Battel, and all cryed, <hi>Arm, Arm,</hi> with many other bold, scandalous, and seditious Passages, very derogatory from the Duty and Affection, which We are most confident Our good Subjects of that Our Native Kingdom bear to Vs. To this purpose they traduce Vs with raising and making War against Our Parliament, of having an Army of Papists, and favouring that Religion; of endeavouring to take away the Liberty and Property of Our Subjects: and upon these grounds they have presumed by a Publick Declaration to invite Our good Subjects of Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland</hi> to joyn with them, and to take up Arms against Vs their Natural Liege Lord. Lastly, to this purpose they endeavour, as well in Publick as by secret Insinuations, to beget an apprehension in them, that if We prevail so far here, as by the blessing of God to preserve Our self from the Ruine they have designed to Vs, the same will have a dangerous influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon that Our Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Peace established there; and that Our good Laws lately established by Vs for the Happiness and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of that Our Native Kingdom will be no longer observed, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Vs, than the same Necessity, which they say extorted them from Vs, hangs upon Vs, but that We will turn all our Forces against them: a Calumny so groundlesly and impiously raised, that if We were in any degree conscious to Our Self of such wicked Intentions, We should not only not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a dutiful Sense, in that Our Native Kingdom, of Our Sufferings; but should think Our Selves unworthy of so great Blessings, and eminent Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as We have received from the hands of the Almighty, to whom We know
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65282:121"/>
We must yield a dear Accompt for any Breach of Trust, or failing of Our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty toward Our People.</p>
                           <p>But as We have taken special Care, from time to time to inform Our good Subjects of that Our Native Kingdom of the Occurrences here, particularly by Our Declaration of the <hi>12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                              </hi> of <hi>August,</hi> wherein is a clear, plain Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the beginning and progress of Our Sufferings to that time; so the bold and unwarranted Proceedings of these Desperate Incendiaries, have been so publick to the World, that Our good Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> could not but take notice of them, and have observed, that after We had freely and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily consented to so many Acts of Parliament, as not only repaired all former Grievances, but also added whatsoever was proposed to Vs, for the future benefit and security of Our Subjects, insomuch as in truth there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing to make the Nation compleatly Happy, but a just sense of their own excellent Condition, a few discontented, ambitious, and factious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so far prevailed over the Weakness of others, that instead of receiving that return of Thanks and Acknowledgment, which We expected and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Our People were poysoned with Seditious and Scandalous Fears and Iealousies concerning Vs; We were encountered with more unreasonable, and importunate Demands, and at last were driven through Force and Tumults to flee from Our City of <hi>London,</hi> for the Safety of Our Life. After which We were still pursued with unheard-of Insolences and Indignities, and such Members of either House as refused to joyn in these unjustifiable. Resolutions, were driven from these Councils, contrary to the Freedom and Liberty of Parliament, insomuch that above four parts of five of that Assembly was likewise forced, and are still kept from thence; Our Forts, Towns, Ships and Arms, were taken from Vs, Our Money, Rents, and Revenue seized and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and that then a powerful, and formidable Army was raised, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted against Vs, (a good part of which was raised and mustered, before We had given Our Commissions for Raising one Man) that all this time We never deny'd any one thing, but what by the known Law was unquestionably Our Own; That We earnestly desired and pressed a Treaty, that so We might but know at what price We might prevent the Miseries and Desolation that were threatned; That this was absolutely and scornfully refused and rejected, and We compelled with the assistance of such of Our good Subjects as came to Our Succour, to make use of Our Defensive Arms for the Safety of Our Life, and Preservation of Our Posterity. What passed since that, Battel hath been given Vs, Our Own Person and Our Children endeavoured to be destroyed, those unheard-of Pressures have been exercised upon Our poor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by Rapine, Plundering, and Imprisonment, and that Confusion which is since brought upon the whole excellent Frame of the Government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is the Discourse of Christendom. We are very far from making a War with, or against Our Parliament, of which We Our Selves are an essential part: Our principal Quarrel is for the Priviledges of Parliament, as well those of the Two Houses as Our Own; if a few Persons had not, by Arts and Force, first awed, and then driven away the rest, these Differences had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver arisen, much less had they ever come to so bloudy a Decision. We have often accused these Persons against whom Our Quarrel is, and desired to bring them to no other Trial than that of the Law of the Land, by which they ought to be tried. As We have been compelled to take up these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive Arms for the Safety of Our Life, assaulted by Rebellious Arms, the Defence of the true Reformed Protestant Religion, scornfully invaded by <hi>Brownists, Anabaptists,</hi> and other <hi>Independent</hi> Sectaries, (who in truth
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65282:121"/>
are the principal Authors, and sole Fomenters of this unnatural Civil War) for the Maintenance of the Liberty and Property of the Subjects, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously violated by a vast unlimited Arbitrary Power, and for the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Right, Dignity, and Priviledges of Parliament, almost destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Tumults and Faction: so what hath by Violence been taken from Vs, being restored, and the Freedom of Meeting in Parliament being secured, We have lately offered (though We have not been thought worthy of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer) to Disband Our Army, and leave all Differences to the Tryal of a full and peaceable Convention in Parliament, and We cannot from Our Soul desire any Blessing from Heaven more, than We do a peaceable and happy End of these unnatural Distractions.</p>
                           <p>For the malicious groundless aspersion of having an Army of Papists; though in the Condition and Strait to which We are brought, no man had reason to wonder if we received assistance from any of Our Subjects of what Religion soever, who by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>e Laws of the Land are bound to perform all offices of Duty and Allegeance to Vs; yet it is well known, that We took all possible Care, by Our Proclamations, to inhibit any of that Religion to repair to us, which was precisely and strictly observed (notwithstanding even all that time We were traduced as being attended by none but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, when in a Month together there hath not been one Papist near Our Court) though great numbers of that Religion have been with great alacrity entertained in that Rebellious Army against Vs, and others have been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, to whom We had formerly denied Imployment, as appears by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of many Prisoners, of whom We have taken Twenty and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at a time, of one Troop or Company, of that Religion. What Our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is of that Religion, Our frequent Solemn Protestations before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who knows Our Heart, do manifest to the World; And what Our Practice is in Religion, is not unknown to Our good Subjects of that Our Native Kingdom. And as We have omitted no way, Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and Vnderstanding could suggest, to be for the promoting and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Protestant Religion; so We have professed Our readiness in a full and peaceable Convention of Parliament, to consent to whatsoever shall be proposed by Bill, for the better Discovery and speedier Conviction of Recusants, for the Education of the Children of Papists by Protestants in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion, for the prevention of the Practices of Papists against the State, and the due Execution of the Laws, and true Levying of Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties against them; so We shall further embrace any just Christian Means to Suppress Popery in all Our Dominions, of which Inclination and Resolution of Ours, that Our Native Kingdom hath received good evidence.</p>
                           <p>For the other malicious and wicked Insinuations, that Our Success here upon the Rebellious Armies raised to destroy Vs, will have an influence upon Our Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that We will endeavour to get loose from those whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Laws which have been enacted by Vs there, We can say no more, but Our good Subjects of that Kingdom well remember, with what Deliberation, Our Self being present at all the Debates, We consented to these Acts: and We do assure Our Subjects there, and call God Almighty to witness of the uprightness and resolution of Our Heart in that point, that We shall always use Our utmost Endeavours, to defend and maintain the Rights and Liberties of that Our Nati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And We hope that Our zeal and carriage, only in Defence of the Laws and Government of this Kingdom, and the subjecting Our Self to so great hazard and danger, will
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65282:122"/>
be no argument, that when the Work is done, We would pass through the same Difficulties to alter, and invade the Constitutions of that Our other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. We find disadvantages enough to struggle with in the Defence of the most upright, innocent, just Cause of Taking up Arms; and therefore, if We wanted the Conscience, we cannot the Discretion to tempt God in an unjust Quarrel. The Laws of Our Kingdom shall be always Sacred to Vs; We shall refuse no hazard to defend them, but sure We shall run none to invade them.</p>
                           <p>And therefore We do conjure all Our good Subjects of that Our Native Kingdom, by the long happy and uninterrupted Government of Vs, and Our Royal Progenitors over them, by the Memory of those many large and publick Blessings they enjoyed under Our dear Father, by those ample Favours and Benefits they have received from Vs, by their Own Solemn National Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and their Obligation of Friendship and Brotherhood with the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> not to suffer themselves to be misled and corrupted in their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Duty to Vs, by the cunning Malice and Industry of those Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries and their Adherents, but to resist and look upon them, as Persons who would involve them in their Guilt, and sacrifice the Honour, Fidelity and Allegiance, of that Our Native Kingdom, to their private Ends and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And We require Our good Subjects t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To conclude, We cannot think that Our good Subjects there will so far hearken to the Treason and Malice of Our Enemies, as to interrupt their own present Peace and Happiness; and God so deal with Vs and Our posterity, as We shall inviolably observe the Laws and Statutes of that Our Native Kingdom, and the Protestations We have so often made, for the Defence of the true Reformed Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and the Iust Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Freedom of Parliaments.</p>

               <p>In the end of <hi>May,</hi> there was a Meeting of about thirty Noblemen, where these two Questions were proposed;<note place="margin">The Lords consult what to advise His Majesty.</note> First, if it were fit for the Kings Service that the Convention should be suffered to hold; Next, if it held, whether those who were well-affected to the Kings Service should fit in it. There were three or four Days spent in debating upon these Heads: some moved, that since by the calling of this Convention the other Party had so far encroached upon the King, they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently break with them: this Motion came chiefly from other Lords, who would not come to that Meeting. But it was answered that the King, as he would not give Commissions for raising an Army in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> till he knew the Parliament had first done it on their side; so it was his positive Pleasure that his Party should not make the first Breach, which the King judged so much for his Honour, that no Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could move him to dispense with it: yet these who made that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, were desired to lay down ways, how it could be made effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, since it was Madness, and not Courage, to hazard the Ruine of the Kings Service and Friends, without at least a likelyhood of being able to carry it through with some Success.</p>
               <p>All things being examined, it was concluded that the following Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage should be sent to His Majesty, which was set down in a Paper, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi>; but because of the War in <hi>England,</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it verbally to a Trusty Bearer, lest it had been interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Convention was indicted by the Chancellour, and such others of the Council as have signed His Majesties Letter thereabout, with the Advice and Concurrence of the Committees for conserving the Treaty and Common Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens to be kept at</hi> Edinburgh <hi>the</hi> 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>of</hi> June: <hi>whereby it is conceived His Majesty suffers exceedingly in His Regal Authority, in the Calling thereof without his Special Warrant. A Proclamation for the Indicting thereof is likewise issued forth in His Majesties Name, expressing a danger to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, His Majesties Person, and the Peace of this Kingdom, from Papists in Arms in</hi> England, <hi>which in that appears to be contrary to His late Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sent to</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereupon divers Noblemen and Gentlemen well-affected to His Majesties Service met at</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>and after three or four days Debate, considering the exigency of Time, the present posture of Affairs, and the disposition and inclination of the People of this Country, did not conceive it fitting, that His Majesty should absolutely discharge that Meeting, (which certainly would be
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65282:123"/>
kept notwithstanding of any Discharge from Him, which would both bring His Authority in greater Contempt, and lose more of the Affections of the People, whereby the Power of His Majesties Servants would be lessened) but rather that His Majesty should so far take notice of the Illegal Calling thereof, and His Own Suffering thereby, that the same remaining upon Record may be an evidence to Posterity, that this Act of theirs can infer no such Precedent for the like in the future; but afterwards His Majesty, or His Successors, may Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally question the same. And that His Majesties Servants here may be better enabled, and strengthened with the assistance of others of His Majesties faithful Subjects, who truly and really intend nothing but the Security of Religion as it is here established, and are altogether averse from and against the Raising of Arms, or Bringing over the</hi> Scotish <hi>Army in</hi> Ireland, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by His Majesties Affairs, or their own Peace may be disturbed, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it fit, that His Majesty should permit this Convention to Treat, and conclude upon such Particulars, as may secure their Fears from any danger of Religion at home, without interessing themselves in the Government of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>And in respect that the Two Houses of Parliament have not sent Supplies for Entertaining the</hi> Scotish <hi>Army in</hi> Ireland, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may have some colour or ground for recalling them, it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved necessary, that this Convention should have a Power from His Majesty, to advise and resolve upon all fair and Legal wayes for Entertaining the said Army still in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and for recovering payment of the Brotherly Assistance: providing always, that in the doing thereof no Resolution be taken for Levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Forces, or doing any Act, whereby this Kingdom, or any part thereof, may be put in a posture of War, or under any pretence to bring over the</hi> Scotish-<hi>Army in</hi> Ireland, <hi>or any part thereof, without special Warrant from His Majesty; wherewith if such as shall meet at this Convention rest not satisfied, His Majesties Servants here are resolved to Protest, and adhere to these Grounds, and to oppose all other derogatory to His Majesties Authority, or prejudicial to His Service.</hi>

The Lord Chancellour was very sensible of the ruine of his Fortune, which would follow from the Publishing of that which certainly would be popular, as being an ease of the Subjects, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promised to them, to use his utmost Endeavours to put all the stops he could in the Agreement with <hi>England</hi>: wherefore with joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent they resolved to proceed no further in that Affair for that time, and accordingly the Lord Chancellour was very instrumental (though covertly) in getting things kept off so long; for had not much Art been used, the Church-party were inclined, immediately upon the opening of the Convention, to have engaged in the Quarrel for the Two Houses.</p>
               <p>The 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> came, and the Convention sate down,<note place="margin">The Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sits.</note> (which is a Court made up of all the Members of Parliament, but as they are called and sit without the state or formalities used in Parliaments; so their Power is to raise Money or Forces, but they cannot make or repeal Laws.) The Duke and his Friends, as they answered to their names, declared they were present, upon the notice they had of the Kings Warranting of the Convention. After that, <hi>Lanerick</hi> delivered the Kings Letter of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> and it being read, drew on a great Debate, which lasted four days, whether the Convention was free or not, and if bound up to the limits of the Kings Letter or not. The grounds of the Debate were, on the one side it was certain, that by the Law of <hi>Scotland</hi> no Assembly of that nature could be called but on the Kings Writ, and therefore there was a Nullity in the beginning of it; but that now the King <hi>ex post facto</hi> allowing them as a Meeting of His Subjects to consider of some Particulars, they could pretend to no Authority but what that Letter gave them: therefore they had not the Authority of a Convention of Estates, but were only a Meeting of so many Subjects to consult of some Affairs. On the other side it was said, that the Convention was summoned by a Writ under the Great Seal, which was all that the Subjects were to look for, they not being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look into the Kings secret Orders, or private Pleasure: so this was a sufficient Authority for their Sitting; and for the Kings Letter, though it seemed he was not well-pleased with his Council for it; yet it did not annull the former Writ, nor indeed could it, and it was essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to all Meetings of that nature to be free, and not limited in their Consultations; for if the King calls a Parliament or Convention, their Freedom cannot be restrained to such Particulars as the King would li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to, otherwise the Grievances of the Nation should never be considered: therefore they concluded, it either must be no Convention at all, or if it was one, it must be left at liberty to treat of all the Affairs of the Nation. The Duke and his Brother were the great Arguers on the one side; and when they saw how it was like to go, they resolved
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65282:127"/>
to Protest, and leave them. But the Kings Advocate told them, that if the Convention were Voted a free Convention, then to Protest against it was Treason; but they might declare their Judgments, and thereupon take Instruments, which was equivalent to a Protestation, and more Legal: and they judging this punctilio of the word <hi>Protest</hi> of no Importance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to follow his Advice. So on the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> it being put to the Vote, <hi>a Free Convention or not,</hi> the Duke voted it <hi>no Convention, but as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Kings Letter</hi>: so did eighteen Lords, and but one Knight, all the rest voting it a Free Convention. Whereupon the Duke rose up and declared, he could no more own that for a Free Convention, nor acknowledge any of their Acts or Orders, further than as they kept within the bounds of the Kings Letter. My Lord <hi>Argyle</hi> asked, did he by that Protest against the Convention? my Lord <hi>Lanerick</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, they meant not to Protest, but declare and take Instruments, both in the Kings Name and their own, which accordingly they did, and so removed. Only <hi>Lanerick</hi> required them to record the Kings Letter, which was refused; next he craved an Instrument of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it, which was also refused: so having taken witness of it, he withdrew, and none of these Lords would sit in the Convention any more. After this some came to the Duke, and asked his Advice if they should sit or not; he suspected their Intentions were only to betray him, and told them, that his Practice declared his own Judgment, which he wished the whole Convention had followed; but for particular Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he left it to themselves. Others of their Friends were by them all thought necessary to sit still in the Convention, to keep up delays in the approaching Treaty with the <hi>English</hi>; but divers of their Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-awed with the Power of the Church-party, did forsake them.</p>

                  </note>At the same time some of the Church-party, who feared the Duke more than all that opposed them, knowing the depth of his Designs, and the smoothness of his Address, took a strange Course to render him suspected to the Kings Party, which was to let a Whisper fly out, but so as they should not appear in it, that he and they kept a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence; which was too easily believed by many, who were already ill-affected to his Person, and displeased with his Methods: and the great forwardness of some for appearing in the Kings Service, made them impatient of all Delays. But the Duke sent divers Messages by Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> of the Bed-chamber (who was at that time sent by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to <hi>Scotland</hi>) to those of the Kings Friends, who he saw were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with him, to mediate a Reconciliation, who dealt in it with all possible diligence; but their Jealousies of the Duke were insuperable.

                  </gap>e, if He would change his Tools and Methods. The Duke upon this wrote to the King, that he found himself betwixt two Tides, of those who were perverse on the one hand, and over-forward on the other; yet he wished not only Life and Fortune, but his Soul might perish, if he left any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essayed and undone, that was in his power for the Kings Service. But all in which he could hope to prevail, was Delays, which to draw out longer than this Winter he could not promise. And the Methods he used to draw out the Treaty by Delays, were, to set some on work to get <hi>Scotland</hi> to insist on their Demands for the rest of the Brotherly As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65282:127"/>
and for what was agreed to by the former years Treaty, to be paid for the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before they engaged further, all which amounted to a round Sum; and he knew it would neither be soon, nor easily advanced. The time of the Assembly was also approaching, wherefore they advised the King for his Advocates encouragement to Name him Commissioner for it.</p>
               <p>The Convention did little at first, only they begun a new Process against some alledged Incendiaries, and named many Committees, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still for the <hi>English</hi> Commissioners who were daily expected. On the first of <hi>August</hi> came the Kings Advocat's Commission with his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and a Letter to the Assembly.</p>
               <p>His Instructions were, <hi>First, to assure the Assembly of the Kings constant adherence to the late Establishment, and his willingness to encourage all good Motions.</hi>

               <p>The Convention voted an hundred thousand Marks Sterling to be raised by a Loan: this was a pretty Device to fine all that were not judged well-affected; for they were appointed to lend Sums upon the Publick Faith, which every one knew would turn to no Security for their Money.</p>
               <p>On the ninth of <hi>August</hi> came the much-longed for Commissioners from <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Commissioners come from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> with a large Declaration from the Two Houses, justifying all their Procedure, and intreating the assistance of their Brethren in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> This was cheerfully welcomed by the Assembly, and some did run so far back, as to remember how Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> helped the <hi>Lords of the Congregation</hi> in the <hi>Scotish</hi> Reformation in opposition to the Queen Regent; and therefore it was but Justice that they should now repay them with the like Assistance.</p>
               <p>But that which generally prevailed to engage the greater part of the Nation in the War,<note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that prevailed for entring in a League with them.</note> shall here be set down with that fulness and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that becomes a Historian. The (now) Duke of <hi>Newcastle</hi> had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a great Army in the North of <hi>England</hi> for the King, upon which that Countrey was like to be for some time the seat of the War; and though <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Carlisle</hi> had no Garrisons in them, according to the Treaty between both Kingdoms, yet it was not to be doubted, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one side or the other would see their advantage in putting Garrisons in these places: upon which, all in <hi>Scotland</hi> judged it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to raise some Forces, otherwise the best Counties in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which lye toward the South, had been put under Contribution by those Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, and they had been all a prey to the prevailing Army; yea, and which side soever were either beaten or straitned, it was not to be doubted but they would send in Parties to <hi>Scotland</hi> to bring Provisions, and what else could be had; therefore it was Concluded, that a Force must be raised for the Security of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This being laid down, it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65282:128"/>
was not uneasie to perswade all, that it was better to carry in and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Army in <hi>England,</hi> than keep it in <hi>Scotland</hi> to be a vast Charge upon themselves. And the Forces that were raised in the years 1639 and 40, had been very heavy on the chief Nobility and Gentry; nor had the Brotherly Assistance, which the Two Houses had Voted to be raised for their reimbursement, come to their Supply, the War of <hi>England</hi> intercepting it: therefore they had generally a great mind to Quarter their Army in <hi>England.</hi> Now this could not be done, they keeping up the Neutrality they were then in, therefore they must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther joyn with the King or the Two Houses. For joyning with the King many Arguments were used, both from the Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that obliged all the Subjects to assist the King in his Wars; and from the Covenant, wherein they swore to assist Him in every cause in which His Majesties Honour was concerned. There were also private assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances given, not only to the leading Men, but to the whole Nation, of signal marks of His Majesties Favour, and Confidence in the disposal of all Offices, and Places at Court, that every third time they should be filled with <hi>Scotish</hi> men, together with other particulars, not needful to be mentioned. But against all this it was objected, that those who had the Ascendant in the Councils at <hi>Oxford,</hi> were either Papists, or men of Arbitrary Principles; and the Clamours that always follow Generals and Armies where there is no certain Pay, were carried to <hi>Scotland,</hi> not without great additions, against the Kings Forces, to possess peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with a deep alienation from them. It was likewise said, that since the King, notwithstanding the Declining of his Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> would not grant what was desired there about Episcopacy, it might be from thence gathered, what he would do if his Arms were successful, and therefore all People were possessed with the jealousies of his subverting the whole Settlement with <hi>Scotland,</hi> assoon as he had put the War in <hi>England</hi> to a happy Conclusion. And though it was answered to this, that the Kings putting things to hazard rather than sin against his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, was the greatest assurance possible, that he would faithfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what He had granted; to this, Malicious people said, that it would be easie to find distinctions to escape from all Engagements; and if the putting down of Episcopacy was simply sinful according to the Kings Conscience, then that alone would furnish Him with a very good reason to overturn all, since no Men are bound to observe the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they make, when they are sinful upon the Matter. And these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons did generally prevail with the Covenanters, to refuse to joyn with the Kings Party in <hi>England</hi>: therefore they concluded it necessary to Engage with the Two Houses, both because the Cause was dear to them, it being a pretence for Religion and Liberty. It was also said often, that they owed their Settlement, partly to the backwardness of the Armies the King had raised against them in <hi>England,</hi> and partly to the Council of the Peers, who had advised the King to grant a Treaty, and afterwards a full Settlement to them. And that Paper which was sent down in the Year 1640, as the Engagement of 28 of the Peers of <hi>England,</hi> for their Concurrence with the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army that year, was shown to divers, to engage them unto a Grateful return to those, to whom it was pretended they were so highly obliged. For though the Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> (and a few more) were well satisfied about the Forgery of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yet they thought that a Secret of too great Importance to be generally
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65282:128"/>
known; therefore it was still kept up from the Body of that Nation. And upon these Pretences and Inducements it was, that it came to be generally agreed to, to enter into a Confederacy with the Two Houses. So Fatal did the Breach between the King and his People prove, that even when it seemed to be well made up by a full Agreement, there was still an after-game of Jealousies and Fears, which did again widen it by a new Rupture, which to these men seemed at this time unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: otherwise they found the ease of a Neutrality to be such, that the Men of the greatest Interest in those Councils have often told the Writer, they had never engaged again, had it not been for those Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies with which they were possessed to a high degree. There was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Nine appointed to Treat with the Commissioners: the <hi>English</hi> pressed chiefly a Civil League, and the <hi>Scots</hi> a Religious one; but though the <hi>English</hi> yielded to this, yet they were careful to leave a door open for <hi>Independency.</hi> Thus the Treaty with the <hi>English</hi> Commissioners went on, notwithstanding a Letter the King wrote to the Chancellour, to be communicated to the Council, requiring them not to Treat with them, since they came without His Majesties Order; but they who had leaped over all other matters, could not stand at this.</p>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65282:130"/>
but by others to the Power and Policy of the Leaders, and the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and fear of the rest. One Article of it was thought strange, that one Government of the Church was abjured, but none sworn to in its place for <hi>England</hi>; this was not the fault of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed nothing so much, as to see Presbytery established in <hi>England.</hi> But the <hi>English</hi> Commissioners would not hear of that, and by that General words of <hi>Reforming according to the Word of God,</hi> (cast in by Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>) thought themselves well-secured from the inroads of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Presbytery; and in the very contriving of that Article they studied to out-wit one another, for the <hi>Scots</hi> thought the next words of <hi>Reforming according to the Practice of the best Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> made sure game for the <hi>Scotish</hi> Model, since they counted it indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that <hi>Scotland</hi> could not miss that Character.</p>
               <p>Those of <hi>Scotland</hi> would have had Episcopacy abjured, as simply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: but those of <hi>England</hi> would not condemn that Order, which had merited so much Glory in the whole Christian Church, therefore the second Article was so conceived, that it might import only an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the present Model of <hi>England</hi>; and it was so declared, both in the Assembly of Divines, and in the Two Houses of Parliament when they swore it. The <hi>Scots</hi> either perceived not this Change, or were glad to get it carried on at any rate. But many judged the oddest part of it all was their Oath to maintain the Priviledges of both Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, since that was never defined, and was scarce capable of a Definition; and the Priviledges of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> were far enough from the knowledge and divination of the <hi>Scotish</hi> People, who in this case must believe all that to be Priviledge which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so.</p>
               <p>The Covenant was carried up, by those trusted with it, to the Two Houses, to be approved by them; and being returned to <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Committee of Estates did by their Printed Act of 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain it <hi>to be Sworn and Subscribed by all the Subjects, under the pain of being punished as Enemies to Religion, His Majesties Honour, and the Peace of these Kingdoms: and to have their Goods and Rents confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and they not to enjoy any Benefit or Office within the Kingdom, and to be cited to the next Parliament as enemies to Religion, King and Kingdoms, and to receive what further punishment His Majesty and the Parliament should inflict on them.</hi> At this time His Majesty sent Mr. <hi>Mungo Murray</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> (to assure his Friends of his Confidence in them) who brought the following Letters from the King and Queen to the Duke.</p>

               <p>These Lords appointed at parting to meet again about the end of <hi>August,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Lords whom theKing employed, meet and send Propositions to the King.</note> which accordingly they did; and when they met, divers told they found much coldness among their Friends. Many professed a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialness to the Kings Service; but they had neither Armes, nor Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, nor saw they a place of Security for a Rendezvouz, nor of Safety for a Retreat in case of a Misfortune; so that divers of the Noblemen said, It was not in their power to bring any with them to the fields, but their own Domesticks. Whereupon it was agreed by them all, to send one <hi>Neal</hi> Servant to Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> of the Bed-Chamber to the Marquis of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> to desire him to seize on <hi>Berwick,</hi> which was of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and was at time without a Garison, that it might be the Place whither they might bring what Forces they could draw together which was indeed the most proper Place for them, since the Counties that lay next it were best-affected. They likewise desired my Lord <hi>Newcastle,</hi> to send them such Arms and Ammunition, as could be spared them out of the Kings Magazins, which were then in his hands: they also ordered <hi>Neal</hi> to go forward from him to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to give the King an account of their Desires, that they might be presently supplied. He was dispatched on the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August</hi>; but on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> my Lord <hi>Newcastle</hi> wrote back to them a short answer referring them to <hi>Neal,</hi> who in a large one, (both which are extant) told them, that my Lord <hi>Newcastle</hi> said, he could spare them neither Armes nor Ammunition: and as for <hi>Berwick</hi> he could not seize on it without bringing Ruine on himself and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, unless he had a Commission for it under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>; it being contrary to the Articles of the late Treaty of the two Kingdoms, which was ratified in Parliament.</p>
               <p>At this time the Treaty betwixt the Two Houses in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Treaty betwixt <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</note> and the Convention in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was closed. Against the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> a hundred thousand pounds Sterling was to be paid in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Twentieth of that Month, an Army of Twenty thousand Horse and Foot, was to be on the Borders from <hi>Scotland,</hi> who were to have thirty thousand pounds Sterling a Month for Pay; only the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds Sterling was to serve for the first three Months. The General was to be chosen by the <hi>Scots,</hi> the Army was to receive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from a Commitee of both Kingdoms; no Peace should be treated, or concluded without the <hi>Scots</hi>: and the Publick Faith was given by the Convention of Estates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that their Army should return out of <hi>England</hi> when a Peace was concluded by both Kingdoms. And so the Convention Adjourned till <hi>Ianuary,</hi> having chosen a Committee of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, to whom they gave full Power in all matters Civil and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>The Kings Friends were now in the greatest perplexities imaginable, they saw his Affairs in a ruining Condition, and themselves able to do nothing but regrate it. All <hi>September</hi> passed over, ere they had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Oxford</hi>; and since the hope of <hi>Berwick</hi> was irrecoverably lost, nothing remained but Despair. The Church-party became daily more resolute, and the Kings-party became fainter. At length in the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mungo Murray</hi> came from Court, but brought no present Relief, only large hopes of Assistance to follow quickly. He also brought Letters from the King, both to the Council and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatours of the Peace: that to the Conservatours of the Peace fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

                     <p>You are particularly trusted by Vs and Our Parliament, (and solemnly sworn to be faithful in the discharge of that Trust) of seeing the Articles of the late Treaty observed, which here is most grosly violated: therefore We require you, as you will be answerable to God, to Vs, and Our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to take speedy and present Order for recalling and suppressing those Forces.</p>

               <p>The Lords whom the King trusted, seeing no present help of Men,<note place="margin">The Kings Affairs in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> decline.</note> nor relief of Armes, like to come from <hi>England,</hi> were like men desperate: and some moved desperate Propositions, that according to what had been (in some former cases) practiced in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there should be Orders given out, requiring all to kill the chief Leaders of the Church-party, where-ever they could find them, setting Prices on their Heads, and that with such Orders some of the Blanks should be filled up. But the Duke opposed this strongly, and said, he would take it on him without an Instruction to assure them, that he knew His Majesty would rather patiently suffer all things, than consent to a Course so barbarous and unchristian. As for the practices of some former ruder times, these were to be no Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents now. Besides, if this were done on the one side, they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the same Orders would be presently issued out against them from the Comittee of Estates, which would bring on an unheard-of Butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and lay all their Throats open to their Servants; whereupon it was laid aside, only the Proposition with the Precedents is yet extant: and they resolved to see what Force they could bring together under the pretence of their Attendants to the Countess of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> her Funeral, which was to be in the beginning of <hi>November.</hi> But there was some Difference about the Methods of carrying on their designs among these Lords, and divers others who were called to their Consultations, besides
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65282:134"/>
those who were particularly trusted by His Majesty, Those whose Fortunes were broken were for brisker Courses, and those whose E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states were intire, and had the most followers, thought it fitter to delay an open Breach as long as was possible. This diversity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion raised some Animosities and Jealousies among them, so that they fell into a mutual distrust; neither was Secrecy (though not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned but sworn) closely kept, for all their Designs broke out; and and yet some who were guilty of this, were among the busiest to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten it on the Duke. But the Writer designs only an account of his Affairs, without reflecting needlesly on others; and therefore here he restrains his Pen. So quickly did their closest Secrets fly abroad, that when the Duke was returning home from one of their Meetings, a Covenanter Lord came from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to meet him on his way, and told him, to a word, all had past at their Meeting, as that Lord informed the Writer.</p>
               <p>On the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> went to Court,<note place="margin">A Message sent to Court by the Earl of <hi>Traquair.</hi>
                  </note> whom the Lords that were trusted by the King, had carried along with them in all their Counsels, though his Name could not be in the Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by reason of the Act that was past against him at the former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. With him they sent the following Instructions, containing the grounds and steps of their whole Procedure; which is the fullest and clearest Dispatch was sent this year, (most of the other Messages being verbal) and so will give great light to the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is desired it may be represented to His Majesty, that now all He expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our Affection and Industry here, is performed, this Summer being spent, and he having received no other Prejudice from hence, than what might rise from words, which we did never pretend to prevent, being no ways a Party in the Iudicatories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To shew our readiness still to venture our Lives and Fortunes in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Service, which we will make good, not only by verbal Expressions, but real Actions, when we shall see the least probability of Success to His Affairs, though to our Ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To represent the Reasons that (hitherto) we have not been in Action; which have been grounded, First, upon our Desire of Protracting time, the chief thing we had Commission to study, (in which our Endeavours have not been fruitless:) Secondly, that they (not His Majesty) should be the first Breakers, both a pious, just, and popular Motive: and thirdly, our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Supplies both of Men, Arms, Ammunition, and Moneys, which we were confident should have been provided for us, and without which we never conceived our Strength to be considerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To represent, that we would immediately draw our selves together into a Body, (being thereto authorized by His Majesty) if we had the least hope of making it considerable, and if we had any proportion of Arms or Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, a Place of surety for our Rendezvouz, and of safety for a Retreat in case of a Misfortune; having by divers Messages represented our Wants, and pressed for Supplies, with the securing of some Places, now lost, but still without Success, without which, many who would joyn with us in this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of serving His Majesty are unwilling to hazard; and divers very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and most affectionate Noblemen and Gentlemen have declared, that for that reason they cannot bring to that Meeting more than their Domestick Servants, so that we justly fear, we cannot draw together so considerable a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65282:134"/>
Body, as could resist, much less offend our Enemies, and likewise an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, for those and other Noblemen and Gentlemen (being only so back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and lying at so great a distance one from another, and from the Place, which of necessity must be appointed for our Rendezvous, to joyn with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And considering these necessities, we cannot but be the more tender of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto present Action, seeing His Majesty hath so wisely commanded us, to weigh the Consequences of angering before he be able to punish, and the Prejudices which may thereby arise to His Service, wherein we must proceed as we shall be answerable upon our Perils: and therefore we dare not presume to advise the present Engaging of His Majesty, by drawing our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Body; for many would oppose us (seeing then we would be esteemed Rebels) within this Kingdom, that would be unwilling to go into <hi>England,</hi> which probably cannot be done this Winter, though we dare give no assurance thereof; but do humbly advise, that present Preparation be made for the worst, and in discharge of our Consciences and Duties to His Majesty, we cannot but represent our Fears of the great Disservices He may receive from hence, if he do not timely prevent it, either by a Royal and considerable Strength, or in his Wisdom think of some other way of effecting it, and not to trust to the Power of His Party here. And this our humble Opinion doth neither proceed from Fear, nor Disaffection, nor out of any Intention to desert Him, or His Cause, (wherein we will spend the last drops of our Blood) but really is our sense of the Condition of His Affairs here, which we cannot conceal, without betraying the Trust He hath reposed in us, and which we will be ready to make appear to His Majesty, whensoever He shall think fit to call us to an account, at the hazard of losing His Favour, and all that is dear to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the end of <hi>October,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">All are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to take the Covenant.</note> all the Lords of the Council received Letters from the Committee of Estates, requiring them to come to Council against the second of <hi>November,</hi> and sign the League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, from which the Lords (whom His Majesty had intrusted) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused themselves, not being well-satisfied, neither about the matter of the Covenant, nor the Authority by which it was imposed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they were again summoned to appear upon the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of that Month, to do it under the highest pains in case of Disobedience; but they excused themselves the second time likewise.</p>
               <p>All this while the Duke had been doing his utmost to engage his Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals,<note place="margin">The Duke's endeavours for serving the King.</note> and the Dependers on his Family, to a cordial Concurrence in the Kings Service, and offered to divers of them, if they would vigorously concur in it, to dispense with great advantages he had over their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes by his Superiorities. But that County where his Interest lay, was so prevailed upon by the Ministers, that no endeavours could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them from the Course that the rest of the Country were taking: and so little could he prevail with them, that all the Authority and Art he and his Brother used, could not get the Commissioners to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Estates well chosen, though he bestirred himself in it as much as was possible; for beside the Clamours against him, there came out at this time a Book under the name of <hi>The Mystery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which was shrewdly but maliciously penned. The design of it was to demonstrate, that the King's Intentions ever since his Voyage to <hi>Spain,</hi> had been for introducing Popery: but to this old Slander was
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65282:135"/>
added a new damnable Calumny, that the King had given Commission for the Massacre in <hi>Ireland</hi> under the Great Seal of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>October</hi> 1641. when it was in the Duke's keeping, and in the Custody of Mr. <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> who is by that Pamphleteer called <hi>the Scribe of the Cross Petition.</hi> This was sent through all places, and both preached and printed up and down <hi>Scotland,</hi> and zealously infused into the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds, amongst whom it gained belief; which as it irritated them to more fury against the King, so it drew the next share of the <hi>Odium</hi> upon the Duke, whereby he was much disabled from doing the Service which he desired and designed: with such a <hi>series</hi> of sad Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als was God pleased to exercise him almost all the days of his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Lords that were for the King met at <hi>Kelso.</hi>
                  </note>Their Appointment at My Lady <hi>Roxburgh</hi>'s Funeral was to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried secretly, as if their numerous Meeting had been only for gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Company to solemnize it with the more Pomp, according to the Ceremony used at Burials in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Duke took with him near two hundred Horse, the half of them were Gentlemen, and the rest were their Servants. But when they came to the Funeral, all that could be accounted of were about a thousand Horse; but there were such Jealousies among them, and they were so undetermined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what to do, or who should Command, and so little assurance had they of the Adherence of those who were with them, that they parted without coming to any Resolution.</p>
               <p>This Attempt gave a <hi>Crisis</hi> to the Covenanters Proceedings against them, and therefore, because they came not on the Day prefixed to subscribe the Covenant, they were declared <hi>Enemies to God, the King, and the Country</hi>; and it was resolved, that at least they should be made close Prisoners, of which the Duke was advertised by the Earl of <hi>Lindsay.</hi> But this was not all the height of the Committees zeal,<note place="margin">The cruel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Committee against those who took not the Covenant.</note> for on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>November,</hi> by another Act <hi>all their Goods were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be seized on, their Rents gathered up, and their Persons to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, wherever they could be found:</hi> and a Commission was given to Souldiers to go take them, <hi>warranting them to do it, notwithstanding any Resistance was made, securing them though they killed those that made Resistance. Southesk</hi> was first wrought upon by those thunder-claps: but the Duke and his Brother, seeing all was past recovery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there was no standing before this unparalelled Zeal, prevented their severe Orders, and went to Court; so he and his Brother left <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the end of <hi>November.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this while his Enemies at Court had been with great Industry mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representing his Actions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for this end made use of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness of some <hi>Scotish</hi> Lords who were then at Court:<note place="margin">The Duke ill represented at Court.</note> yet the King's Affection to him, and Confidence in him, continued firm and unshaken till the end of <hi>September,</hi> (if not longer,) as appears by His Majesties Letter of that Date, already set down. But the miscarriage of Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> together with the Duke's absence, raised some jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in the King's thoughts; nor had the Duke any Friend at Court, who had such credit with the King, as to be able to justifie him, and so Reports went current without contradiction. But when Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> came up, and <hi>Traquair</hi> after him, they gave a truer representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Affairs; therefore, to take off the weight of their Testimony, they were charged with accession to the same Miscarriages, and many things of a high nature were fastened upon the Duke. And the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65282:135"/>
of Affairs in <hi>Scotland</hi> seemed to give good colours for casting all the blame of it upon the Unfaithfulness or ill-management of those who had his Majesties chief Trust in that Kingdom, (the usual fate of all Unsuccessful Ministers.) Many foul Slanders were cast on him, and very scandalous and undutiful Discourses were laid to his charge. And to crown all, it was represented, that he had set on foot a Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and designed to put all once into Confusion, that so he might fish the better in those troubled waters.</p>
               <p>This was the most bloody and pernicious of all the hellish Slanders his Enemies could invent, and nothing could raise Jealousies in a Court like Stories of this nature; wherefore they were confidently vented: and it was said, that after he and his Brother had betrayed the King's Service in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they were now coming to Court to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers to his Enemies; therefore it was necessary to secure him upon his first Arrival, and particularly to hinder his access to the King, since it was to be feared, that his Majesties Affection, with his Innocency, which they in their Consciences knew was unstained, would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly break through all those Arts that had been contrived for his Ruin.</p>
               <p>The Duke was not ignorant of all that was designed against him,<note place="margin">The Duke goes to Court,</note> nor so totally destitute of Friends, as to be let perish without sending him advertisements. Any Loyalty less than his would upon such advices have kept out of the way till he had sent his Justification before him, and had cleared himself of all Imputations: but being confident of his own Innocency, he resolved to go on, and put all to hazard; so on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> he came to <hi>Oxford.</hi> There was at the Ports an Order left to stop him till the Governour were advertised: but the Captain of the Guard thinking he was in the Coach that followed, not knowing himself who was on horseback, let him pass without stopping him. But he was presently followed with an Order from the King,<note place="margin">and is made Prisoner.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining him and his Brother to their Chambers during his Majesties Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The Duke answered, that as he had ever given a ready obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Majesties Commands, so in this he would punctually obey his Order.</p>
               <p>At night Secretary <hi>Nicholas</hi> came to him, and told him, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty had received an Accusation of a high nature against him, and that he could not be answerable to himself, if he had not taken this Course with him; but that he might expect from him all Favour that in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice he could grant him, and that himself would be graciously pleased to hear as much of his Cause as he could, and that all haste should be used in it.</p>
               <p>The Duke answered, that he humbly thanked his Majesty for his Goodness thus in general to let him know the Cause of his Restraint: and for any favour in that Charge he desired it not, but trusted to the King's Justice and his own Integrity, only he intreated he might have a speedy Trial. And for his Majesties constant Goodness to him, he had no more to return to him but his humble Thanks, since he had received greater proofs of it than he had either merited, or could ever deserve.</p>
               <p>Next the Secretary called for his Brother, who was a little indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and told him, he had the Liberty of the Town, only he might not
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65282:136"/>
come to the King's or Queen's Court without Permission; and after that a Guard was set at the Duke's Lodgings, with Orders, that none might speak with him except in the presence of one of the Secretaries. But Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> of the Bed-chamber had been with him at his first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, and the Duke desired him to give the King a full account of his Behaviour in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of the necessities that his Duty had forced him to when he left the Kingdom: and he desired he might have that Justice done him, to see the Charge that had been given against him, that so he might justify himself, since he was absolutely ignorant of it, and his own Conscience did not charge him with any Guilt in reference to the King's Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke gets a Copy of his Charge, and Answers it.</note>At night Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> returned to him with a very favourable Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage from the King, expressing his Confidence, that he should clear himself of the Charge given against him. And by what the Writer could learn, it was he that brought him a Copy of the Charge that was drawn up against him: for the Duke got the Copy of it before it was put in the due form of an Impeachment, being liker a Historical Information presented to the King, than a Legal Accusation. That Paper was never brought into any Court, nor did any thing ever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it; for the business went not the length of a Trial; yet it seems too important a Transaction of the Duke's Life, not to be inserted, with the Answers that were drawn to it: for assoon as the Duke got it, he sent to the best Counsel then at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who drew an Answer to it wholly in point of Law, and himself drew an Answer as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, and penned a long Speech which he intended to make at his first Appearance. But those Papers (which do yet remain) were afterwards digested into one full Answer; and therefore that the Reader may not be wearied too much, I shall insert that instead of all the rest, setting down the Answer after every Article of the Charge. Only I shall here promise what I copied out of an Original Letter of one of the most zealous Covenanters (who was a very considerable man among them and one of the <hi>Iunto</hi>) to his Correspondent; by which the Reader may judge what he is to think of the Truth of matter of Fact alledged in the Charge; <hi>I have seen the Charge against the Duke, and though he has been a great Enemy to our Cause and Work, I cannot but pity him, since he suffers from their hands whom he has been ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:</hi> and after that he adds, <hi>he is in no hazard if he get Iustice, for the Accusation is false, and can never be proved.</hi> This will discover both what the secret thoughts of the Covenanters were of the Duke, and how false the Charge was in matter of Fact. But the most material Evidences that do clear his Innocence, and justifie the Answers to the Charge, have been already set down in the former parts of this Work, to which the Reader will find some References marked in the Margent.</p>

                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:65282:137"/>
that the Defendant had carried himself during the former Troubles as became a faithful Subject, and one that tendered the Good and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Country. There was also in that same Parliament a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Act passed, declaring he had carried himself during the former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions as a faithful Servant to His Majesty, and a loving Patriot to his Country; upon which the Defendant may well plead that he is not bound to answer for any thing charged on him that was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Parliament, and that his Accusers do incur Punishment for going against the Act of Oblivion then passed: nor is he bound in Law, as his Learned Counsel assure him, to answer for any Words alledged to have been spoken by him unless questioned for them within three Months after they were spoken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the Laws of this Kingdom. But though the Defendant hath so far compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Lawyers as to have named the former particulars, yet it is not out of any design to escape either Trial or Justice: therefore he is ready to give an account to His Majesty of the Actions of his whole Life, in reference to His Majesties Service, whenever he shall be called to it; particularly for the Trusts and Imployments his Majesty honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him with, being so confident of his own constant unstained Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Loyalty, and of His Majesties Justice, that he is not afraid of the issue of the whole Matter, himself being so Innocent and his Judge so Just; therefore he shall answer plainly and particularly to all the Matters of Fact laid to his Charge, leaving the Plea in Law, together with the necessary distinction of points of Treason from Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, to his Learned Counsel when they shall be allowed to plead.</q>

His Majesty also knows well, that he had never advised these Innovations which gave the rise to these Commotions, nor engaged in the Affairs of that Kingdom but upon His Majesties particular Command, without which he had designed to avoid all meddling in them;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> p. 38.</note> so that nothing can be more notoriously false than that part of this Article is, <hi>That the Defendant did exasperate His Majesty against that Kingdom, or advised Him to conquer them before they fell from their Obedienee.</hi> It is true, after His Majesty had thought fit to imploy the Defendant in those Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he did give him clear advertisements of the state of Affairs in that Kingdom, not sparing his nearest Friends, as His Majesty well knows; but gave no advice, but what he thought agreed both with the Duty of a good Subject and Patriot. He never advised His Majesty to conquer or subdue that Kingdom, or to govern it as a Province; for he takes the suppressing of a Party in Arms against the King, or who were reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Authority, to be very different from conquering the Kingdom: and therefore as he simply denies the first branch of this Article, so he refers the clearing of his Innocency in this to His Majesty, (who cannot but know best what he advised him) and to the Letters he wrote to His Majesty if they be yet remaining.</q>

And whilst before his coming all his Friends and Followers, and such as did belong unto him, did resolutely stand out against that Course, no sooner was he come, but all of them perceiving his strain did on a sudden quit their former way, and violently joyn themselves to the other Party: witness amongst others the late Earl of <hi>Hadington,</hi> Sir <hi>Alexander Hamilton</hi> his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, now Master of their Ordnance; (a main stickler) the Earl of <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> and his Son the Lord <hi>Maitland,</hi> of all men most intimate with him; to omit his Brother-in-law the Lord <hi>Lindsay,</hi> a Principal Actor in that Rebellion from the beginning, and his Cousin-German the Earl of <hi>Glencairn,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing long firm for His Majesty, in end (by his secret sollicitation as is thought) made Defection: by which and such-like he cunningly necessitated the breaking up of the Assembly at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> that the Water might be once trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the Country quite abandoned unto themselves.</p>

                     <q>To the third Article the Defendant says, he was so far from foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Differences betwixt His Majesty and his Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he did all that was in his power to bring Matters (which were quite imbroyled when he went Commissioner thither) to a happy Close; and that he did yield to them all such things as he had power to grant, which he is ready to make appear by comparing his Actings with his Instructions. It seems the Accusers knew well what would have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Country, but understood little what his Instructions were.

He also stayed with the Assembly of <hi>Glasgow</hi> as long as his Instructions warranted him, and did all he could to keep them from those Extremities which enforced the Rupture;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> p. 107.</note> and in his whole Proceedings he carried along with him not only the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors His Majesty appointed him to advise with, (the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> only excepted) and the Secret Council, but likewise the Bishops, whose advice he got and followed: all which he is ready to make out by comparing his Instructions and His Majesties Letters to him,<note place="margin">

                     <q>Nor can he be charged with the faults of his Friends or his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. It is known how much the places where his Interest lies, were gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to those Courses before he was Commissioner, and yet many of his friends did stand out against the Courses others then followed, though they were not able to make head against the more prevailing Party round about them. For the Earls of <hi>Glencairn</hi> and <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> they continued in their Duty to the King till the Pacification, nor did they take the Covenant (for ought he knows) till His Majesty allowed it;

for the Earl of <hi>Lindsay,</hi> he did not joyn in these Courses after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant went to <hi>Scotland,</hi> but engaged in them from the beginning, though much pains was used by the Defendant to divert him from them. And as the Defendant is not answerable for the Actions of his Friends, much less is he accountable for the Thoughts of his Enemies, who may Charge what they please on the suspicions of his secret Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which are their own groundless and malicious Forgeries: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this whole Article is false, as the former are.</q>

And that he was not only accessory hereto, but really guilty of the thing it self, appears by his own Discourse to divers Persons, that if he had pleased he could have landed his Forces, and done what further he was Warranted by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, but that he never intended it; which Double-dealing may be yet more clearly evinced, in that he had frequent private Meetings, Correspondencies, and Practices with the Counter-party, as particularly by his Ordinary Appointments upon the Sands of <hi>Barnbougal,</hi> and other places next adjacent, where he usually kept his Meetings with some who were most desperate Leaders and Promoters of these Courses. And the Prime Instruments of the Committee and Cabinet-Counsels there amongst them, then at the very same time, and in the greatest heat of all the business, did profess and give assurance both by word and under their hands, that <hi>Hamilton</hi> was the greatest Favourer that ever their good Cause had, notwithstanding of all that the formality of the time obliged him to profess to the contrary. And not only in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (where it was generally known to be so) but even some of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners did profess to some of this Kingdom, that <hi>Hamilton</hi> had done things which they did not approve; but yet that he had been much more Friend than Enemy to the Courses of the Country, and had done much more good than evil: yea <hi>Argyle</hi> himself upon a private dispute, falling into heat, delivered, that he and those others did nothing but by <hi>Hamilton's</hi> Directions, Knowledg, or private Approbation.

After which, the Viscount of <hi>Aboyn,</hi> being cloathed by His Majesty with Commissions, and to have had some experimented Officers along in that Imployment, the said Duke of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:65282:139"/>
did break off that probable Course, and engaged such of his own Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Trust, who did so evidently miscarry the Business, as thereafter they were to be accused by the whole Noblemen and Gentry of that Party. Like-as he having got Orders about the same time from the King, to send Sir <hi>Nicholas Byron</hi>'s Regiment to assist the King's Party in the North, who could easily have reduced all that Country to His Majesties Obedience; notwithstanding thereof, and of their frequent Sollicitations to have it done, he still shifted the Business, and would never give way to it, pretending that he had some other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in hand for them, though all they had to do was to Die below decks, and be thrown over-board into the Sea.

Nor was his Service there useless, for besides the great Diversion it made by the huge Bodies were left to guard the Coast, he took divers Ships, particularly some coming from <hi>Germany</hi> with many Officers, who were returning home to offer their Service to the Covenanters: and his Carriage was so far from making him gracious to that Party, that none was more odious to them, which appeared in the Curses and Reproaches were cast on him as he passed through the streets of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to possess the Earl of <hi>Forth</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,<note place="margin">

It is true, upon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Orders he was resolved to do the Enemy all the mischief he could, but about thirty hours after he got these Orders, (in which time he was considering where he was first to make an Impression, and did go out himself to have fired some Ships, but by a mischance was run on a Shelve, so that he lost that Tide) they were countermanded by new Orders: for His Majesty having resolved to Treat with the Enemy,<note place="margin">

Like-as after the Pacification at <hi>Berwick,</hi> continuing in his wonted strain of incensing, in an underhand way, the People against their King, being demanded why he denuded himself of his former Commission; his Answer was, because he knew the King intended to keep nothing of that which at that time he had condescended unto, otherwise he would not easily have parted with the Honour of that Service. By which he did so wound the King in the Opinion of His Subjects, of the sincerity of His Intentions, That as no one thing did at that time breed more rubs and difficulties to His Majesties Service; so is there nothing by which the People are more readily and easily stirred up to the present Rising in Arms, than the Opinion they then, and by his continual underhand working, have since drunk in of the King's Intention to reverse (in case he should prevail in <hi>England</hi>) all the Acts and Favours he had condescended unto to His Subjects of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                     <q>To the fifth Article the Defendant says, he ever studied by all the means that became a good Subject and Countryman to bring the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt His Majesty and His Subjects to a happy Temper; and he desires the Malice of his Accusers in forming this Article (as all the rest) be considered, wherein base Discourses and Advices are fastned on him without naming the Persons to whom they were given: and in this he cannot but commend his Accusers Prudence, who have named no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son till they have tried upon whom they can so far prevail as to be guilty of the wickedness of owning such Lies. The Defendant can prove the contrary by many, in whose Preservation it is to be supposed he is more concerned than in any they can name, with whom he used his utmost endeavours to perswade them to adhere closely to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Interests, which prevailed on some, though not on all; nor did he advise any to agree with the Country, till he knew His Majesty was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to end the Business in a Treaty, in which case it could be no Crime to advise any to make their own Peace; nor did he ever infuse into any Person a jealousie that His Majesty would void the happy Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of <hi>Scotland</hi>: sure he is, he said and did all was in his power to root these jealousies out of the Subjects minds, which he can prove by innumerable Witnesses and Presumptions; and no man durst say he heard any of the Discourses mentioned in the Article from the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, if he were in a capacity to call him to an account for it.

First, when some Noblemen of that Kingdom well-affected to His Majesties Service, perceiving the Intentions of some there to engage that Nation in Rebellion with the Malignant Party here, made offer of all their best Services and ready endeavours to prevent the same, for themselves, and in the name of all the Kings greatest and best-affected Party there; he, to disappoint those promising and evident Courses, thrust himself into the Business,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65282:141"/>
and in a very seeming plausible way undertook to keep that Kingdom in Peace and Quiet, and from attempting any thing upon this Nation, or against His Majesties Service now depending here, and (to make it appear the more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) without making use of any Force, or putting His Majesty to any Trouble or Charges; and withall solemnly engaged to break off all his Alliance, Ties, and Friendship with the Marquis of <hi>Argyle,</hi> (who doth make himself so much the Head of that Rebellion against His Majesty) or otherwise perswade him to acknowledg himself, and become, a good Subject, and that betwixt and three Months thereafter at farthest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the effect of all which undertaking had this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, First, that immediately upon his return to <hi>Scotland</hi> a Convention of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Estates was indicted without the King's knowledg or consent, a Precedent whereof can never be shown in any Records; which coming to His Majesties knowledg, He did immediately direct a Letter under His own Hand, willing that <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and some other of his Complices, who had His Majesties Trust for the time, should declare the said Meeting Illegal, and disapprove it in His Majesties Name. About the time of the Receipt of which Letter the said <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> and some of his Cabal, did employ the Earl of <hi>Calander</hi> from them to speak with a great many Noblemen of the Kings Party, and take their Advices in what was to be done; and they who understood nothing of His Majesties Letter (it being altogether kept up from them) declared all in one voice, their Iudgments were that His Majesty should disclaim the Convention, and declare it Illegal, and that they would all be willing to joyn with <hi>Hamilton</hi> and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and take their Lives in their hands to maintain His Majesties Honour and Authority, and free themselves from the Slavery of those rebellious Tyrants. It was answered them again by the said Earl of <hi>Calander,</hi> (His Majesties Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being still supprest) That the King would needs approve of the Convention with Limitations; To which it was replied, That they behooved either to be very ignorant or unfaithful who had given His Majesty such Advice, seeing those People would never confine themselves within Limits, or take a part, if it should be left them in their power to extend themselves and over-reach all; and that they would on no terms assent to any such Course, as being intended for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a hollow undermining of His Majesty and all His faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. So they parted with little satisfaction on either hand, and some days thereafter the said Earl of <hi>Calander</hi> was again directed to the same Parties, to perswade them still to the former Overture, but to no effect: yet in end, lest the Service might seem to suffer by so much difference in Opinion, they desired <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> to shew <hi>Hamilton</hi> and those of his Party, that since he was only trusted and employed by His Majesty in the Business, their Affection and Tenderness to the Service should make them very unwilling to differ with him in the way; and however in their own Iudgments they did no way approve that the King should so far wrong His Authority, as to allow of any such Illegal Proceedings, which did portend from bad Causes worse Effects; yet since His Majesty would do it, and they needs have it so, they should go along, but with one <hi>Caveat,</hi> which was, That if the Convention did not observe these Limitations prescribed by His Majesty, in that case, that they should protest, and withdraw presently from the House; and that then all who were for His Majesties Service should immediately joyn themselves together, and take the Field. This being solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded, and with much attestation, it was resolved, that all who did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Kings Service, and had Vote in the Convention, should be present there, upon certain hopes that they should be able to ballance either by Voices all violent Courses, or at least to protest against them, and adhere to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Service and Authority in a vigorous way. But all their great Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65282:141"/>
and fair Assurances were either not intended, or very soon forgotten: for whilst it was the first Act of the Convention, after His Majesties Letter was read, to Voice themselves a Free Assembly as any had ever been kept in that Kingdom, notwithstanding of the Restraints in His Majesties Letter, and that in that case Protests and Declarations, and every thing else in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties behalf were faithfully assured, they came so short of that, as when <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>'s Voice was asked, and all expected he should have made a Protest, he pronounced so doubtful an Oracle, as <hi>Argyle</hi> seeming to question of what spirit it came, (though no question it had been oft so concluded among them the more to possess others with panick fears) desired he should explain himself, if that he meant not thereby any Protest; who answered, that he never intended to protest against a National Convention, and that it seemed his words were very much mistaken. To second this, his Brother <hi>Lanerick,</hi> the King's chief Secretary, rose up, and had a Discourse to qualifie <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s expressions, and free them from all such disloyal blemishes, as a Protest in the Kings behalf: so all who were to have declared themselves for His Majesty, being surprized by so strange and unexpected a way, withdrew, and retired themselves from the Meeting in a general Discontent. And yet their Affections being such to His Majesties Service, as they were unwilling to leave it on these Terms, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever so badly handled, would not let it rest there, but would yet put him a little further to it, making again the offer of all their best Endeavours for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Service; desiring that since he was only the Person chiefly imployed by His Majesty, and one who had most interessed himself in the King's Trusts, that they might be directed by him in the matter of His Majesties Business, how to carry themselves, and whether or not it were more fitting for the Service that they should sit in the Convention, or absent themselves, or do whatsoever else. He was so far (notwithstanding of his Imployment and Trust) from giving information, encouragement, or advice, as all that he returned them for their Affection and Faithfulness to His Majesties Service, was, That they might use their own Discretions, and do as themselves should think fit; which did so evidently discover unto them his hollow-hearted Cunning, the Ruin by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of His Majesties Affairs, the slight and cold way they themselves were used, and the ticklish condition he had so mired them into, as they seemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained for the most part to keep the Convention, and countenance all those Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal and Rebellious ways were taken in it. And it is likewise to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that notwithstanding His Majesties Letter, wherein He declared His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Pleasure anent the discharge of that Illegal Indiction, that they did not only suppress the same, and keep it up from the knowledg of the King's faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Party there, but also did procure from His Majesty an allowance to that Illegal Meeting, contrary to His Majesties Pleasure already expressed unto them, and the wishes and desires of all the faithful Party in that Kingdom. It is also to be called to mind, that after all hopes and probabilities of the Kings Service in the Matter of the Convention, were absolutely deserted and given over, that <hi>Will. Murray,</hi> who was commanded by the King to Agent His Affairs there then, desired a Meeting of those of the Kings Party, who had already kept these two Appointments with <hi>Calander</hi> before the Convention, who (notwithstanding His Majesties Service had been so grosly and palpably alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy miscarried, and they themselves so notably abused in it) being willing to study rather the Remedies than regrate the Disease, and redeem the Time ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than complain of its loss, once for all were content to hear what could be propounded for the recovery of Business; which only proved, that they would undertake, and joyn to re-gain that After-game which a few had spoiled, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65282:142"/>
all given over. Notwithstanding whereof they gave it <hi>Will. Murray</hi> back in his Commission to <hi>Hamilton</hi> and his Complices, that if they would really and even down put on a Resolution to appear vigorously and to purpose in the Service, they in that case (to shew they should not mingle themselves nor any of their particulars) would be willing to follow, were it <hi>Hamilton</hi> or any, in what should prove to the advancement of the Service: otherwise, if they thought that too much, that they would be willing to joyn hand in hand, and put their Lives and Fortunes and all together at the stake with them; and if that did not satisfie, but that they esteemed it too rash a Business for men of so much cunning to engage in, that they would but approve them to put it to a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and they would willingly take their adventure, which should they carry they could be very willing that <hi>Hamilton</hi> and his Party <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission being home and heartily delivered; it was promised by <hi>Will. Murray,</hi> that <hi>Hamilton</hi> and his Party should be presently put to it, and an Answer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; for the more hasty dispatch whereof, they sending along one of their own number to expede the Return, <hi>Hamilton</hi> and his Complices being several times convened and pressed upon it, did absolutely refuse to meddle in that kind, which was all their Answer: so that the other being willing, notwithstanding of all these hollow-hearted Treacheries, both before, in the time, and after the Convention, either to follow, joyn, or hazard alone in His Majesties Service, would they but approve it, they refused all either to do alone, joyn, or suffer others to do it; after all which there could be nothing resting but an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble necessity to know His Majesties own Mind, since they who had his sole and absolute Employ and Trust did so much abuse it to His Disservice.</p>
                  <p>By all which points, circumstances, and cunning fetches, to bring this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to the wished period, it may clearly appear to every undeluded eye, that he is accessory to that bad Plot of raising this Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to disturb the Kings Affairs in this Kingdom, that so all being brought to a <hi>Chaos</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, he might the better fish his hopes and ends from amongst so troubled waters.</p>

And for his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to break with the Marquis of <hi>Argyle</hi> if he did not faithfully adhere to His Majesties Interests, it is well known how ill an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and how little Correspondence, hath been betwixt the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and <hi>Argyle</hi> these twelve Months past.

                           <hi>See</hi> p. 226.</note> with the reasons that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them, to His Majesty, wherein the Defendant was but one of seven, and so is not to be charged nor answerable for the Advice so given; since they only offered Advertisements to the King, with their Advices and the reasons that prevailed with them; and as His Majesty (who could only judge what Advices were best) gave Orders, so they did Act: if the Advertisements sent were false, or their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices against Law, they are accountable for them; but are not bound to answer for the good success of every thing they advised, that being in the hands of God: and neither the Defendant, nor any other joyned with him in Trust, did advise His Majesty to authorize the Convention, but only to allow them liberty to sit, so they kept within the prefixed Limits. And there was good reason for offering such Advice, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Affairs not being in so promising a condition that it was fit for them to begin the Rupture; and it was certain that these who called the Convention without His Order, would have acted in it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing His Prohibition, which must have either affronted His Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or precipitated a Breach, which could not have been done at that time without the Ruin of the King's Affairs in that Kingdom. The Defendant did at that time desire the Earl of <hi>Calander,</hi> that he would use his Endeavours with some of these who pretended zeal for the King's Service, and are now the Defendant's Accusers, that they would lay aside all private Animosities and concur in His Majesties Service, and offer their Opinions with the Method in which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired things might be carried on, and the Defendant offered them all possible satisfaction in every thing, for which they stood at a distance from him: but that Earl brought Answers very far different from what they pretend they sent, and all wise men looked on their Propositions as so extravagant and unpromising, that none could think them fit to be followed. But the Defendant denies there were any such Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments passed as in the Article is falsly alledged, yet when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention sat the Defendant did often and no way ambiguously,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> p. 224.</note> but very plainly, declare he did not own their Authority, nor would give obedience to any of their Acts that were beyond the Bounds prefixed in His Majesties Letter: upon which he withdrew with divers of his Friends, and did advise and prevail on many to follow his Example. It is true, some came and asked his Advice, of whose Fidelity he had no reason to be assured, judging not without grounds that they came to him on design to trepan him; and therefore he told them, that for his own part he was resolved not to acknowledg their Authority, nor give obedience to their Commands, by which they might easily judge what he would advise, seeing his Practice. It is also false, that the Defendant procured from His Majesty an allowance to that Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65282:143"/>
since the Letter His Majesty wrote was so far from allowing it, that it particularly challenged the Illegality and Nullity of that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> p. 232.</note> and the Convention was so far from thinking themselves Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by it, that they refused to stand to it, or so much as to put it on Record. It is also false that any such Offers, as are vainly and without truth said to have been made to Mr. <hi>Murray,</hi> were ever brought by him to the Defendant, or others intrusted with him: he was indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to deal with them to overcome their untoward Jealousies and ambitious Vanity, but with no success, as he reported, and is ready to make good; but they venting their implacable Hatred and ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jealousies of His Majesties faithful Servants, left the Kingdom in the Summer, and possessed many with such Prejudices, that they infinitely retarded His Majesties Service, and divided the small Party that adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him: yet His Majesty sustained no Prejudice from <hi>Scotland</hi> all that year, which was the uttermost that ever the Defendant gave His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty any hope of. But it is most basely false, that the Defendant did bring the Convention of Estates to the wished period, since he did all that was in his power to hinder its Sitting, and to get it broken up assoon as it sat down. It is also false that the Defendant was on the design of raising the Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he opposed by all the probable and honest ways were in his power, and was ever ready upon the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances or hopes of Success, to have hazarded his Life and Fortune to hinder it: and therefore sent frequently to <hi>England</hi> for those Supplies, without which their Attempt could signifie nothing, but the exposing the Kings Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> to the scorn and malice of their Enemies. But the necessity of His Majesties Affairs in <hi>England</hi> did so retard the Answers, that opportunities were lost, and the other Party had prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over all, which forced the Defendant to fly out of that Kingdom, Order being given for seizing on his Estate, and taking and imprisoning his Person; and yet Affairs there are not quite desperate, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant had many very probable Propositions to have offered to His Majesty, the Maintaining of whose Prosperity and Authority hath been the constant designofhis whole Life.</q>

                  <p>Last of all it is craved, that in respect of his unexpected Arrival here, there may be liberty to add and amplifie this Charge as occasion shall offer.</p>
                  <p>One particular omitted above, is not amiss to be here inserted, at what time the business of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Covenant was at the greatest height, a distressed Gentleman of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Sir <hi>John Ferguson,</hi> desired the Loan of some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from Sir <hi>John Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Broomhill,</hi> (whose Relation and Interest every way to the Duke are known to every one who knows them both:) who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him in flat terms, he would neither give nor lend him a penny, except he and his Sons would bind themselves to go home and sign the Covenant, upon which Condition he offered to lend him what he sought.</p>
                  <p>We do engage from our faithful respects to His Majesties Service, without any consideration or interest else whatsoever, to make good this Charge, some of the weightiest points by several Witnesses, and all the rest by some and strong Probabilities.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Answer to the eighth Article.</note>
                     <q>To the eighth Article the Defendant says, here lies the Master-piece of his Enemies Malice and Calumny, to charge him with a point trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable in the highest degree, without offering one circumstance to make the Truth of it appear probable: and such publick things as the setting on foot a pretence to the Crown, the Treating with Forreign Princes touching his Claim to it, the Authorising and Protecting of any who wrote in defence of his Title, must have been notour and known things, and yet no particular is here named; which clearly shews the Forgery of the whole, on design to beget in His Majesty Jealousies of the Defendant, who knows of no such Title to the Crown, but acknowledges His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie's and His Posteritie's, (whom he prays God to preserve) their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right to the Crown. And as the Defendant acknowledgeth the great Honour of his Relation to the Royal Blood, so there is no more reason to Charge him on that account than to Charge any others who are more nearly related to His Majesty, as are all the Noble branches of the Prince Elector <hi>Palatin</hi>'s Family. But as the Honour of that near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Blood had no other effect on the Defendant's Progenitors, but to quicken them to serve His Majesties Ancestors with the more zeal, which appeared most signally in the Reigns of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> and K. <hi>Iames</hi> His Minority; so the Defendant hath in that always traced their steps in the same faithful zealous Loyalty; nor can so much as a colour for any of the impudent Forgeries in this Article be made out. The Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant never heard till he saw it in his Charge, that any did ever write for his Title, nor does he believe it a whit the more for that: but if any such thing be, let the Authors of such treasonable Books be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, according to the merit of so high an Offence; sure he is, he shall neither protect, nor encourage them. But he does not doubt this is a Forgery as all the rest are. The other particulars are an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious needless repetition of what hath been before falsly alledged in the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65282:144"/>
Charge, and so is already answered. The particular of the Earl of <hi>Lowthian</hi>'s Instructions can be no Presumption, much less Proof against the Defendant, since these Instructions were signed long before there was a Breach betwixt His Majesty and that Kingdom: they were also brought to His Majesty, who signed them, and not only by His written Instructions did appoint the Earl of <hi>Lowthian</hi> to endeavour the Restoring of the Defendant to his Right in <hi>France,</hi> but did also recommend it verbally to <hi>Lowthian</hi> very earnestly. For the Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that passed betwixt Sir <hi>Iohn Hamilton</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Ferguson,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant knows nothing of them, nor is he accountable for what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whatever their Dependance on him be, have spoken; he knows not whether Sir <hi>Iohn Ferguson</hi> ever took the Covenant or not, but this he knows well, that he did recommend him to His Majesty, as one that suffered much for adhering to his Duty to His Majesty, and did procure several Marks of His Majesties Favour for him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And thus the Defendant hath plainly, and in as short terms as was possible, and with all the Moderation such things can allow of, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered all the particulars Charged upon him; wherein he doubts not but it does appear, especially to His Majesty, (who knows well how he is able to make out most of his Answers from His own Royal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Warrants and Instructions) with how much Falshood and Malice he is accused, so that little credit will be given to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, base, groundless, and improbable Forgeries, devised to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Defendant; who, as he is ready quickly to adduce the main and most substantial points of his Evidence, so he begs, as an Act both of Justice and Goodness, that his Accusers have a competent time prefixed them for the bringing in and finishing their Evidence, that if the Defendant be found Guilty, he may receive condign Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and if Innocent, that he be exonered of this Charge, and liberated of this Disgrace, and suffered to accuse his Accusers for the Falshoods, Lies, and Calumnies, with which they have studied to abuse His Majesty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke having got the Charge, desired Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> would ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly move the King that it might be put to a speedy Examination, and that his Accusers might be ordered to go about it assoon as might be: they excused themselves, saying, it was impossible while the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions lasted, to get their Evidences brought. The Duke hearing of this, said it was the saddest thing imaginable to keep him under such high Imputations to so long and indeterminate a Term: for though no man wished a speedy end to those Troubles more than himself, yet there were sad grounds to fear they should prove too lasting; and it was hard to keep him under so deep a Disgrace, and such cruel Aspersions, to that uncertainty. Much was also alledged from the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Priviledges of the Peers, against this Procedure. His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fearing these Reasons might at length be heard, procured an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the beginning of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> for sending him, first to <hi>Exeter,</hi> on his way to <hi>Pendennis,</hi> a Castle upon <hi>Falmouth</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> to be kept Prisoner till his Trial were ready to be gone about.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lanerick</hi> was as active as he could both for his Brother and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lanerick</hi> being also Prisoner, does all he can for their Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</note> The particulars he was charged with did not amount so high,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65282:145"/>
and were chiefly his Concurrence with his Brother: for the Affection and Confidence betwixt them was so entire, that all judged the one could not be Innocent if the other was Guilty. The two <hi>English</hi> Secretaries were appointed to examin him, but he answered them only in some General things, and told them, that for those particulars of his late Trust, divers other <hi>Scotish</hi> Lords were concerned in them, and it was not an <hi>English</hi> business; and therefore he desired Liberty to give His Majesty Satisfaction, but refused to do it to any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And he seeing the Party made against them was so strong, did earnestly crave Liberty to go beyond Sea, since he could not be so happy as to serve His Majesty longer in <hi>Britain:</hi> 
                     <q>and he engaged his word of Honour never to meddle any further in <hi>British</hi> Affairs, but that assoon as he should be called home to undergo his Trial, he should upon the faith of a Gentleman and Christian return, since it was hard that they should be condemned to the infamy of so long a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace without any Trial. But to this he had no return; and it seemed that none of these Messages were faithfully carried to His Majesty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next he desired, that since he must continue Prisoner, at least that small Happiness might not be denied him of being Prisoner with his Brother; but neither got he any return to this. And the King sent to him for the Court-Signet, but with this Declaration, that he did not thereby intend to remove him from the Office of Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; which yet remains bearing date, <hi>Oxford</hi> the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1644.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">and makes his Escape.</note>When the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> saw that the malice and power of their Enemies was so great, that they were not like to obtain a Trial for clearing their Innocence, and discovering the Forgeries of their Accusers; and fearing a long and cruel Imprisonment, (some surmises being also brought him of greater Severities) he made his Escape out of <hi>Oxford.</hi> The particular way whereof is not needful to be inserted. Only the malice of his Enemies appeared more signally upon the knowledg of his Escape, who came and moved, that his Page (<hi>Robert Kennedy</hi>) who had been imployed in making it, and stayed behind him at his Lodgings, should be hanged out at his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. But the King told them, it was very unjust and unreasonable to punish a Servant for his Fidelity to his Master, and commanded him to be set at Liberty. The Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> went to <hi>London,</hi> and from that returned to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where it clearly appeared, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Malice of his Enemies, nor the hard measure he had met with at <hi>Oxford,</hi> could overcome his Love and Duty to the King: for though he was forced to comply in many things with the Publick Counsels, yet he begun very soon to draw a Party, that continued to cross the more violent and fierce Motions of <hi>Argyle</hi> and his followers. But here the Writer is forced to stop, Papers failing him for prosecuting this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>The Duke was upon his Brother's Escape used with much strictness, his Servants were put from him, his Money taken away; he was denied all freedom, and the use of Pen and Paper was refused him, except to write Petitions to the King: yea in the Room where he stay'd he met with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accommodations,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65282:145"/>
which are not fit to be named. Assoon as His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty knew of this, which was as long delayed as his Enemies could, that Strictness was changed, but still he continued to be a close Prisoner. And though he always petitioned for a speedy Tryal, yet he was put off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for all that severity of Usage, his Majesties Affection continued to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But to give the Narration of the Duke's Exercises during his long and tedious Imprisonment, is a Task which no Pen but his own could have performed: for that great Mind which had formerly dilated it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in gallant Designs and Actions, being restricted to retired Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, spent it self in thoughts worthy of their Author. Here it was that he instead of a Prison, begun to see a passage into Liberty and true Freedom: and those better thoughts, which a crowd of Affairs and the intanglements of Interests had barred free access into his Mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meeting now with none of that resistance, but quickened from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Misfortune, wrought a great Change on him. And here did the vanity of the World, and the folly of human Greatness, with all that is splendid on this side of Immortality, discover it self free from that false Varnish, that had formerly wrought too much upon human Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which raised in him a just undervaluing and loathing of those bewitching, but deceiving Charms: and he meeting with Reproach and Slander on every side, betook himself to the Rock of Ages, as to his strong Refuge. He was much pained with frequent returns of the <hi>Stone,</hi> which was fed by the lazy rest of his Prison: yet his Converse was so agreeable, that it took exceedingly with all his Guards and Keepers, which being apprehended by his Enemies, the place but not the nature of his Restraint was changed. And in one of the places of his Imprisonment, a Person of Honour who was Governour of the place, was so much wrought on by the Nobleness of his Deportment, that as from the first time he was committed to his keeping, he used him handsomly and with great Civilities, notwithstanding strict Orders he had to the contrary; so he afterwards offered to let him make his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, which the Duke generously refused, both because he would not do any thing which might turn to the prejudice of the Governour, but chiefly because he would not fly from his Majesties Justice, nor stain his Innocence by an Escape. This Story was avouched to the Writer, by the Person himself that made the Offer to the Duke.</p>
                  <p>Some who pretended Friendship to him at Court, wrote to him, that the only way to clear himself of all Imputations, was to get his Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> to concur vigorously in the King's Service, which was then managed with great success by my Lord <hi>Montrose:</hi> but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered them, that since he was charged with such heavy Imputations, he did not think it decent to meddle in any thing, till he were once Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally cleared of these: neither could it be imagined, that his Letters would signifie much in <hi>Scotland</hi> under that Disgrace, since his Presence, when under high Characters of His Majesties Favour, could prevail so little. And indeed he had small grounds to expect much from <hi>Scotland,</hi> since those who governed there had never expressed any resentments of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65282:146"/>
his Usage, beyond one Act they passed, Declaring it contrary to the Priviledges of the Peers. And from some of his Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> he got Letters, upbraiding him for his Services to the King, telling him, that had he been as faithful in serving the King of Kings, he had been better rewarded, and that he was well-served for preferring the one to the other. But his Imprisonment continued both this year 1644, and the next year, and lasted till the end of <hi>April</hi> 1646; that some of the Parliaments Forces brought the Castle of St. <hi>Michaels Mount</hi> in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> where he was then Prisoner, to a Surrender, by which means he had his Freedom.</p>

And as they of <hi>Scotland</hi> sent their Commissioners with these Instructions yet extant, so they emitted a Proclamation, forbidding any to go out of the Kingdom without Publick Permission; which was done to hinder those of the Kings Party from coming to him.</p>
               <p>What Reception my Lord <hi>Lanerick</hi> had from His Majesty doth not appear to me, but I find he was very quickly as well seated in the King's Affection and Confidence as ever. On the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners presented their first Paper, which went not beyond ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral things, containing a Welcome, with an offer of their Service ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant. But in their next Paper they pressed the King to send a Message to his Two Houses for a Happy Peace,<note place="margin">who press the King to settle matters.</note> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing satisfied with that Letter he had formerly written to the Speaker of the House of Peers; since no grounds were laid down for a Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, a Treaty being only in general terms desired. Of all these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that passed the Originals do yet remain.</p>
               <p>Next day the King called both for the chief Officers of the Army,<note place="margin">The King complains of the ill usage he met with.</note> and the Commissioners sent to him out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in presence of <hi>Mons. de Montrevil,</hi> did expostulate, That whereas He had come to their Army upon the Assurances <hi>Mons. de Montrevil</hi> had given him, that He should be safe in His Person, Honour, and Conscience, the two last were not kept; for he was pressed to settle Religion as they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wherewith his Conscience was not satisfied: next, His Subjects had not free access to Him, but Proclamations were issued out, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

them to come to Him; neither was the Ceremony due to Him as King, suffered to be paid Him at His entry to <hi>Newcastle</hi>: and lastly, His Servants were not suffered to wait on Him. And His Majesty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested <hi>Montrevil,</hi> if those conditions were not made to Him, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirmed it in all their presence, and that he had the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Assurances in <hi>French.</hi> The Commissioners retired to think of an answer; but when they returned, they desired His Majesty would put <hi>Montrevil</hi> to it, to declare what those Assurances were, and who gave them: but this was not done. Next they said, they would not Treat with the King in his Presence, nor admit of the interposition of any Foreign Agents betwixt them and their Native Prince. And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of the Army resolved that no suspected Person should be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to wait on the King, with which His Majesty was highly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and for some days would not eat in publick, but only in his Chamber.</p>
               <p>But because there were many in the Army who would have engaged cordially for the King on any terms, to les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en the apprehension of this, they got a Petition to be signed by almost all the Considerable Officers of the Army (yet extant) that His Majesty would settle Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant, and that He would enter into it Himself, and authorize it by His Command.</p>
               <p>On the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> His Majesty wrote another Letter to the Two Houses, desiring them to send Propositions for Peace, and in order to that,<note place="margin">The King moves for a Treaty.</note> He again offered to put the <hi>Militia</hi> into their hands for 7 years, as had been offered at <hi>Vxbridge.</hi> He demanded also a Safe-conduct for send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Orders to stop all further Proceedings in <hi>Ireland,</hi> since He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to leave the management of that War wholly to the Two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. He shewed His Letter to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners; but because it contained no Offer about Religion, they were not satisfied with it; yet it was sent. The next thing the Commissioners from <hi>Scotland</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was, that His Majesty would recall the Commissions He had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out against the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation; for the clearing whereof, somewhat must be resumed, that passed in those years which I have run over so hastily.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the year 1644. the King gave a Commission to the Marquis of <hi>Montrose,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A short Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>'s Affairs.</note> to see what could be done in <hi>Scotland</hi> by Force, for diverting the Army that was then entring into <hi>England.</hi> He had great hopes of making a strong Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and doubted not but he should be able, with the Assistance <hi>Antrim</hi> undertook to send him out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to give the <hi>Scotish Army</hi> work enough at home: but his hopes failed him, for all were so over-awed by the Power of the Covenanters, that none would stir till about the end of the year. Some came out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but far short of the number that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised: and with these, and a few of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation, he adventured to disturb the Covenanters, the particular Narration of whose Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes is not to be here prosecuted. This was judged by all a bold and desperate Attempt, for as his Force was small, so they wanted Arms and every thing necessary. Some of the Wisest of the Covenanters advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them not to engage with him in any Action, except on terms full of advantage, but to follow him up and down whither he went, secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Country from Spoil and Plunder; for they judged that his Men, being so unprovided as they understood they were, would not
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65282:148"/>
hold out long in the Hills, but be forced either to lay down their Arms, or break out in Mutinies among themselves, whereby they should have been starved with small Trouble, except the loss of some Time which this lingring Course would have cost: whereas if they fought with them, it was to be feared, that the <hi>Irish,</hi> with some <hi>Scotish High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> and other Gentlemen that joyned with <hi>Montrose,</hi> being despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, would be too hard for such raw Souldiers as would be drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to oppose them; for the Covenanters resolved not to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Forces out of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> till they were forced to it by necessity. Besides, the Plague at that time had broken in upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> and swept away many thousands, which filled all Places with so much fear and horrour, that the hearts and hands of all did fail them; and so a faint Resistance was to be expected in such a general Consternation.</p>
               <p>But the more forward did not relish these Advices, and many Church-men being full of hopes of Success, and the opinion of Gods Favour to their Way, were for engaging into present Action. This Advice was plausible; for they hoped for a speedy issue of it, whereas Delays drew a vast expence on the Nation. This their errour cost them dear, and opened a way for a great deal of Honour to <hi>Montrose,</hi> who managed his small Force with as much Conduct as Success, and carried all down before him with a torrent of Victories; till at length, after his last Victory at <hi>Kilsyth,</hi> the <hi>High-landers</hi> loaded with Prey, would needs go home to their Lurking-holes, which he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, his Authority over them being but precarious. And instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring with them into the Hills, he came down into the South-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with the little handful that adhered to him, in hopes that many should have flockt about his Victorious Standard: but he was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated by the Vulgar, so powerfully had the Excommunications and Thunders of the Church wrought upon them. Besides, many Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had been committed by his <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>High-land</hi> Souldiers, which had been indeed resisted by him as much as was possible; but having no Pay to give them, he durst not exercise that severity of Martial Discipline, which had been otherwise necessary. Yet all was imputed to his Orders by his Enemies, which made him very odious to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of those who knew him not: and hence it was, that wise men did not hope for a good account of the Kings Affairs from this Design; therefore he was not assisted with such Forces, as he had promised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the Kings Friends in the South-Countrey. But he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too secure of Victory, and began to apprehend, the Fame of his former Conquests was able to scatter any Force could be brought against him; therefore notwithstanding some Advertisements he had of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General <hi>Lesley</hi>'s coming down with a good Body of Horse, from the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army in <hi>England,</hi> he still remained in the low Countrey, till he was surprized and routed of a sudden. Then he went again to the Hills, but there he saw how groundless it was to expect any real Aid from those wild and disorderly People: he traversed to and again through the Hills, sparing neither Labour, Industry, nor Art, to draw together new Forces; but was never able to effectuat it, a small Body of a few hundreds being all the Strength he could ever make; only he was in hopes of great matters. And thus it continued till this time, that the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners moved the King for recalling his Commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:65282:148"/>His Majesty was willing to grant this, only he desired, he might have liberty to send for him with a Safe-conduct, and that he might be suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to kiss his Hand, after which he should go beyond Sea, never again to return without their Consent. But to this they would not hearken, wherefore His Majesty being constrained to yield to all their Demands,<note place="margin">His Majesty call in his Commissions to <hi>Montrose.</hi>
                  </note> did by Proclamation call in his Commission, and sent a Gentleman with Orders to him, and such as were with him, to lay down their Arms immediately.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Montrose</hi> answered by a Dispatch, (yet extant dated the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Iune</hi>) that as he had proposed nothing to himself in all he had done but His Majesties Service; so he was not now to dispute his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to His Commands. Only he desired, that Security might be granted, for those Gentlemen who had hazarded their Lives for the Kings Service, that they might not be laid open to the Fury of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but might live at quiet in their own Houses; and as for such as were counted unpardonable, he desired they might have Passes to go beyond Seas: and at this it stuck for some time.</p>
               <p>When this was done His Majesty began to be importuned from all hands, to settle Religion according to the Covenant,<note place="margin">The King is much pressed to take the Covenant.</note> Addresses being made to him for that effect, both from the Army, the Commissioners sent from <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Committee of Estates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners from the General Assembly. But to all those the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>That when he was satisfied in Conscience with the lawfulness of what they desired, then, but never till then, could he grant their Demands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he said he was willing to enter in Conference with any they should appoint; Protesting that if he got satisfaction to his Conscience in those two Points, the one being, that he judged Episcopacy of Divine Appointment; and the other, that by his Coronation-Oath in</hi> England, <hi>he was tied to the Defence of the Church as it was then established, he should not be ashamed to change his Iudgement, and alter his Resolutions.</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi> was pitched upon as the man of greatest Abilities and Discretion for that task, and during the Month of <hi>Iune,</hi> Papers passed to and again betwixt the King and him; of which they being so often published I shall say no more, but that from these it appears, had His Majesties Armes been as strong as his Reason was, he had been every way unconquerable, since none have the dis-ingenuity to deny the great advantages His Majesty had in all these Writings. And this was when the help of his Chaplains could not be suspected, they being so far from him. And it is indeed strange to see a Prince not only able to hold up with, but so far to outrun so great a Theologue, in a Controversie which had exercised his thoughts and studies for so many years. And that the King drew with his own Hand all his Papers, without the help of any, is averred by the Person who alone was privy to the interchanging of them, that worthy and accomplished Gentleman Sir <hi>Robert Murray,</hi> who at that time was known to His Majesty; and he discovering in him, those great parts and excellent qualities, that recommended him to the love and esteem of all vertuous persons that knew him, honoured him with a great deal of Freedom: and it was believed few were more in the Kings Favour than he was; him therefore did His Majesty imploy in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Papers, being all written with his own Hand, and in much less time than Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi> did his. They were given by His Majesty to Sir <hi>Robert Murray</hi> to transcribe: the Copies under Sir <hi>Robert Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>'s
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65282:149"/>
hand, were by him delivered to Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi>; and Mr. <hi>Hender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s hand not being so legible as his, he by the Kings Appointment, transcribed them for His Majesty, and by His Majesties permission kept Mr. <hi>Henderson</hi>'s Papers, and the Copies of the Kings, as was signified to the Writer by himself, a few days before His much-lamented Death.</p>
               <p>All this while they were consulting at <hi>Westminster,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They consult at <hi>VVestminster</hi> about Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be made to the King.</note> about the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to be sent to His Majesty, for now the <hi>Independent</hi> Party begun to prevail; and as they were certainly the strongest in the <hi>English</hi> Army, so they had a great Party in the House of Commons. Their Design was to perpetuate a Military Power in their own hands, and to set up a Toleration of all Sects; and so the Propositions at <hi>Vxbridge</hi> were much altered.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners are for making them easie to the King.</note> in the Papers they gave in concerning the Propositions, first complained, <hi>That the Settling of Religion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in general Terms, and that no particulars about Vniformity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were laid down; <hi>next,</hi> they opposed much the Propositions about the</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, <hi>desiring that no new ones, differing from what had been offered at</hi> Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge <hi>might be made, that so it might appear they were not taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages from the Straits His Majesty was in, to diminish His Iust Power and Greatness, to which they were bound both by Covenant and Treaties, and which had been often repeated in all their Declarations:</hi> adding, <hi>that they could not consent to any Proposition, that should take from their Soveraign, the Power of Protecting and Defending His Subjects, which necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, were the</hi> Militia <hi>put into the hands of the Parliament; wherefore they pressed, that the</hi> Militia <hi>might not be settled in the hands of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of the King and Parliament jointly, and so consigned to such Commissioners of both Kingdoms, as should be chosen by the King and them together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This they backed with a Paper,<note place="margin">Many Papers past betwixt them and the Two Houses.</note> containing the Extracts and Citations, of the former Declarations and Papers emitted by Both Houses, to the same purpose, both about Uniformity of Religion, and the Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings Authority, even in the matter of the <hi>Militia</hi>; which was a long and smart Paper. They also in another Paper, appealed to all the Treaties that had been betwixt the Kingdoms since the beginning of that War, wherein the Maintenance of the Kings Just Power had still been laid down as a ground, on which they were to proceed in order to a Peace. But upon this the <hi>Independent</hi> Party begun to say, that the Agreement made with <hi>Scotland, An.</hi> 1643. was no Treaty, and that the Parliament was not bound to make good what was agreed to in it. And this drew from the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners another large Paper, proving <hi>That to be a Treaty; wherein they did shew, How that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> Scotland <hi>had engaged both in the</hi> Irish <hi>and</hi> English <hi>War, upon the invitation the Two Houses sent them, by Commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>founded their Allegation that matters were not finally concluded,</hi> they did shew how false that was; <hi>since that Alternative was emitted, in their Agreement then made, to the Determination of the Two Houses, who thereupon declared, by repeated Letters, to what branch of it they agreed.</hi> So they made it appear, <hi>that no obligation could be brought on any State, by any Treaty that was wanting in that.</hi>

               <p>But at length the Propositions were all agreed on,<note place="margin">The Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are agreed on.</note> and the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners, though they opposed that Article of the <hi>Militia,</hi> yet gave way to it, rather than hazard on a Rupture.

Things were now brought to great extremities, so that the success of any Service might be laid on him, seemed not only doubtful but desperate. Besides, he had no reason to think, that cloud of Misfortunes which did hitherto hang over all his Actions was yet broken or dissipated, and therefore he had particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to apprehend, cross Events would yet follow his Attempts; but he knew the World would be so unjust, as to impute them to his Resentments, and count them not casual, but designed Miscarriages: wherefore he desired per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to go abroad into some corner of the World, where he might enjoy a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Retirement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Kings Answer to this, was, that he looked on it as a well-couched Resentment; adding, he did not expect he would now leave him when he needed his Assistance most: and this overcame his Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for that time, therefore he frankly desired His Majesty would lay his Commands on him.</p>
               <p>And the first of them gave occasion to a very unexampled and sublime exercise of his Vertue, for at this time the King was in great perplexity about <hi>Montrose</hi> his Affairs;<note place="margin">The King or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Duke to do what he could for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuing <hi>Montrose</hi>
                  </note> since to leave him to the fury of his Enemies, for having served him faithfully, was so contrary to his Honour and Conscience, that the King abhorred the thought of it: on the other hand, he could not preserve him, for having recalled his Commission, his further Actings were legally Treasonable; and there was no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to get him out of their hands, since the King had no Ships for his Transportation: and the fury against him was so great, that they would hear of no Conditions, unless he rendered himself to their Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherefore the King proposed it to the Duke, to do what in him lay to extricate him out of this Strait, for the known enmity that was betwixt the Duke and <hi>Montrose</hi> would make his Advices in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular less suspected.</p>
               <p>An ordinary Vertue would have judged it sufficient, not to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged Injuries, and to have dispensed with the remembrance of them; but it must be confessed to be a high Instance of Christianity, to repay Injuries, while the smart and sense of them was yet so fresh, with so great Generosity. He recommended the care of this to that Noble Gentleman Collonel <hi>Lockhart,</hi> who was in Command under <hi>Middleton,</hi> that led the Forces which were sent against him, and had much power over him being his intimate Friend; and did then begin to shew those eminent Qualities which made him afterwards be so much esteemed over <hi>Europe,</hi> and his death be so Universally lamented. <hi>Middleton</hi> treated with <hi>Montrose,</hi> and took <hi>Lockhart</hi> with him to the Interview, who told <hi>Montrose</hi> what Commands were laid on him by the Duke to serve him. <hi>Montrose</hi> seeing his danger was willing to Capitulate with <hi>Middleton,</hi> that they should lay down their Armes and retire to their Houses, those only excepted who were attainted by the Acts of their Pretended Parliament, who should be suffered to go beyond Sea within a few days after the Agreement. This being done, the Kirk-Party made great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Ratification of it in the Committee of Estates; nor could
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65282:150"/>
it have been carried, but by the Interest the Duke and his Brother had there, who pressed it with much zeal. This hath been often owned by <hi>Midleton,</hi> and was avouched to the Writer by Sir <hi>William Lockhart,</hi> who added, That never did the Duke or his Brother lay their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on him in more pressing terms, than in this particular about <hi>Montrose</hi>'s Preservation.</p>
               <p>The King being freed from this troublesom Intrigue,<note place="margin">The King is earnestly pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to yield to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</note> the next care was, what Answer should be given to the Propositions for Peace that were every day expected. The Duke prest him most earnestly, <hi>to yield to them (how unreasonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> soever they might seem) and particularly in the point of Religion; for without full satisfaction in that, nothing would please the</hi> Scotish <hi>Nation, nor the City of</hi> London, <hi>by whom only His Majesty could now hope to be preserved: and they would hear of nothing short of the Abolition of Episcopacy, and the Kings Taking the Covenant. But were those granted, he found a willingness in them, to interpose for Moderating the other Propositions, particularly those of the</hi> Militia, <hi>and about the Delinquents:</hi> he therefore intreated His Majesty, <hi>to consider the Danger He was now in; Foreign Aid was not to be looked for, and he could not apprehend that</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>would engage for him, if the case varied nothing by His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All this he did not say from his own sense of these Propositions, since himself thought His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Concessions were such as might give full satisfaction; but that he saw things were in that state, that nothing without satisfaction in the point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion could bring them to any Settlement.</hi> This was often repeated to the King, both by him and his Brother, as well in their Letters as Discourses.</p>
               <p>But His Majesty said, <hi>His Conscience was dearer to Him than His Crown,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">But the King resolves to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here firmly to his Conscience.</note> 
                  <hi>and He would willingly run the hazard of all His Crowns below, rather than endanger that above; that hitherto He had received no satisfaction to His Conscience in these two Great Points, at which He stuck, and till that were done, no Consideration whatsoever would prevail. The Quiet of His Kingdoms, and the Settlement of His Throne, were indeed to be purchased at any rate; yet the Peace of His Conscience must be preferred by Him to all things.</hi> And on these grounds did His Majesty still continue unshaken, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all hazards.</p>
               <p>The Propositions were brought from the Two Houses about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and a speedy answer was craved to them.<note place="margin">The Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are brought to the King.</note> But for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of His Majesties Thoughts of them, I cannot give it better, than by setting down a written account of them, in a Letter sent to the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> at His Majesties Command, by Sir <hi>Robert Murray.</hi>

of these afflicted Kingdoms, hath made me take the boldness to talk with the King upon the Propositions, to see how far he can be induced to yield to them. And although to every particular I cannot promise you an exact account, (because there are divers things in them which neither He, nor I understand) yet to the main Points I shall, and such as I hope may be a good ground-work for happy Conclusions. First then for Religion, I find His Majesty really Conscientious, and not superstitiously Scrupulous; wherefore until He be better satisfied, the uttermost He can be brought to, is, that He will be content that Presbyterial Government be generally established within this Kingdom by Act of Parliament for three years, provided that He, and all those of His Opinion, may freely enjoy their Consciences, according to the practices in Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s and King</hi> James<hi>'s Times. Now how to do this would be too long for a Letter, but as there are Examples, so I doubt not to shew you more than one way to do it, so willing ears may be brought to such a Motion; and I assure you, His Majesty is most willing to hearken and seek after information, to the end He may be satisfied, how with a safe Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence He may give you full satisfaction herein: but this Proviso that His Majesty grants, will probably be but temporary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the</hi> Militia, <hi>I can neither see inclinations in His Majesty to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish, nor can I find Arguments to perswade him to it: nevertheless I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive so great inclinations in Him to strain to the uttermost to give His Subjects all just Satisfaction, especially in what concerns the securing of their Fears, that He will be content for Ten years the Two Houses should dispose of the</hi> Militia <hi>by Act of Parliament, in the hands of such, and so many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as they shall name; as likewise to change them within the said time, and appoint others in their Places, as they shall think fit; but after the expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the said Time, to return to the Crown, as Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>and King</hi> James <hi>enjoyed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning Delinquents, His Majesties Opinion is, that a good Act of Oblivion is the best way to bind up a Peace, after Intestine Troubles, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been the Wisdom of other Kingdoms most usually, and with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, to grant general Pardons, with very few or no Exceptions, whereby the numerous Discontentments of all sorts of People (which are the seeds and fuel to future Disorders) might be totally extinguished: and His Majesty further conceives, that He cannot desert so many gallant Persons of Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fortune, who have engaged themselves with Him, only out of a sense of Duty, without a perpetual and irrecoverable Dishonour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for Offices, though His Majesty judges, that the Disposal of them is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Flower of the Crown, yet He is content for this time to accept of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of them from the Two Houses, to be enjoyed by these persons</hi> quam diu se bene gesserint; <hi>so that after Vacancies they return to be disposed of as before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I unwillingly mention</hi> Ireland, <hi>because His Majesties Publick Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged, how dare I speak to Him to violate that, which is, and must be all our Security; but even in this will I pawn my Life, He will prove Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a zealous Protector of Protestants, and a constant Maintainer of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Conclusion is, that if upon these grounds a Conference may be had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt His Majesty and the Two Houses, I will engage any thing that an Honest man can, that these Kingdoms will be shortly happy in a firm Peace; which if it should fail on our part, for our not hearing of our Soveraign, it would be an unparalelled Misfortune, not without Infamy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:65282:153"/>These were His Majesties private Thoughts, but His publick Answer inclined more to a Denial; which when it was brought to <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> was entertained both with Joy and Sorrow,<note place="margin">The King does not yield to the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the several Parties. The <hi>Independents,</hi> and those of the Army, feared nothing so much as the Kings granting them, for in that case they saw, there could be no colour for keeping up an Army: and in the House of Commons, when Thanks were Voted to the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners that had been with the King for their pains, one Member whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered another in the ear, that they owed more Thanks to the King than any body; and in another corner, an honest Member saying to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what shall become of us, since the King refuseth these Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? the other answered, nay what had become of us if He had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Independent</hi> Party upon this moved,<note place="margin">The Houses go on to high Resolutions, but are stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the <hi>Scotish</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.</note> that no more Addresses should be made, and that His Majesties Person should be demanded, and the Army commanded Northward to see it executed; which had been infallibly done, had not the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners given them in some Papers, complaining of many Violations of the Treaty, and the Arrears due to the Army. The King had also desired a Personal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty near <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> seconded it; but the obtaining it was impossible, for all this time the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners and the <hi>English</hi> (whereof the greatest part were of the <hi>Independent</hi> Faction) were in no good terms.</p>
               <p>As for the Arrears of their Pay, the Two Houses talked of offering five hundred thousand pounds Sterling, whereof an hundred and fifty thousand should be paid presently, that so they might be rid of their Army, which they said was no more necessary in <hi>England</hi>; and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint being made against some who spoke and wrote in prejudice of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation, an Ordinance was debated for punishing them. The <hi>Independents</hi> Imployed all their Strength against it; <hi>Cromwell</hi> spoke most vehemently, that it was to discourage their Friends, and to encourage their Enemies: but <hi>Hollis</hi> took him up so sharply, for calling base Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers Friends, that he was glad to recant. When it went to the Vote it run near an equality, for 102 were against it, and 132 for it; so quickly were the Services of their dear Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p>At this time the King sent my Lords of <hi>Argyle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes <hi>Argyle</hi> at <hi>London</hi> for obtaining a Personal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> 
                  <hi>Lowdon,</hi> and <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermline,</hi> to <hi>London.</hi> Their Instructions were, <hi>to deal for a Personal Treaty near</hi> London, <hi>to get some of the Kings faithfullest Servants to be suffered to come and wait on Him. And for the</hi> Militia, <hi>the</hi> Scots <hi>had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themselves satisfied with the Kings Concessions about it; wherefore He desired they would stick to Him according to their Promises. As for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, He desired they would represent to those who were best-affected, how dangerous it would be to insist too much on that at this time, when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hazard was from the Sectaries, and that His Majesties consenting to a temporary Establishment of what they craved, did put them in a fair way to their Desires. And beside all this, it was recommended to them, to procure a delay of the Desire for an answer to the Propositions till the</hi> 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>of</hi> Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</p>
               <p>When these Instructions were given them, the King desired their promise, first, of Secrecy, next, of Fidelity in discharging what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to them: for the second they undertook it, but refused the first,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65282:154"/>
except the King also promised Secrecy. His Majesty presently apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Design was, that the Duke and his Brother might understand nothing of their Imployment; and finding it was a thing, wherein neither of them was concerned, He thought it unfit to disoblige <hi>Argyle</hi> by that Refusal; since he was so able to serve him, if he should be Cordial in it, and He was secure of the two Brothers, that if they mistook His Reservedness, it would be easie for Him to clear Himself afterwards. Yet this Secret was ill-kept among them, for the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> had notice of it, as he told the Author, before they came to <hi>London</hi>; but opposed much the seeking a Delay to a prefixed day, since he knew that could not be granted without adding a dreadful San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Deposing the King, in case a favourable Answer came not against the day appointed; and found it would be easier to procure a Delay by other Methods, than by asking it. The Duke and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were much troubled with the Kings Reservedness in that Affair: but assoon as they understood the ground of it they were satisfied. But what success that Negotiation had, or how it was managed, doth not appear to me from any of the Duke's Papers.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>August</hi> the Duke went to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where his greatest Care was, to see what could be done to get the Committee of Estates to be satisfied with the Kings Concessions,<note place="margin">The Duke deals with the Committee of Estates, to get them to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce in His Majesties Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions.</note> representing to them, how they did at once put <hi>England</hi> in the possession of the desired Church-Government, and set the other out of the way, which was a great stop to their full satisfaction. He desired they would consider, how inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and unchristian it was to force the Kings Conscience, and how much it favoured of the Violence they had lately condemned in the Bishops. It was visible, that nothing but Conscience could be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to lye in the way of the Kings Accepting the Propositions; and were His Majesty, like many Princes, to swallow down all things, and belch them up at their Pleasure, there would be less ado made: but the Kings sticking at what He could not yield, did abundantly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them of His making good to them all that was promised. On the other hand they were to consider, that if they should now desert the King, and bring their Army out of <hi>England,</hi> it would make them odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous through the whole World, and the payment of the Arrears of their Army would pass under a far worse Character. Besides, <hi>England</hi> was divided, and the Party that was most prevalent among them wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">but was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Ministers.</note>This did shake many, but some of the Leading Church-men were not satisfied with this, and represented to their Party, that all this was said smoothly, to engage them to the Kings Quarrel, which they were resolved never to do till the Covenant were taken by Him. Neither were they well-satisfied with the Duke, for his being instrumental in the Agreement with <hi>Montrose</hi> and his Party; and it was preached to his face, that all the Bloud that was lately shed, would lye on them and their Posterity, who for the pleasing of men had procured such Favour to the Enemies of God, and of his Cause and People.</p>

                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:65282:152"/>In the end of <hi>August</hi> they sent the Duke with the Earls of <hi>Crawford,</hi> and <hi>Casilis,</hi> and some others, to deal with His Majesty for a speedy granting of the Propositions,<note place="margin">The Duke is sent to the King, to obtain from him the granting the Propositions.</note> and to represent to him all the inconveniences that followed, even upon a Delay, much more upon a Denial. The Duke had no willingness to the Employment, misdoubting the Success, and knowing his engaging avowedly in such a Message, would be misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented: but there was no avoiding of it, for had he declined it, he would have been suspected of being an ill Instrument, and of Aversion from the thing which would have disabled him much from going on with the Kings Service.

And yet here again I must tell you, (for in this case repetitions are not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent) that I do not give you a Denyal, nay I protest against it; and remember it is your King that desires to be heard.</p>

                           <hi>Another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties to the same purpose.</hi>
                        </note>'TIs a very great grief to Me, that what I spoke to you Yesterday, and offered to you in Writing, concerning Religion, hath given so little satisfaction; yet lest the Reasons I then told you, should not be so fully understood, I think it necessary at this time to set them down to you in this Paper.</p>
                     <p>I then told you, that whatsoever was My particular Opinion, I did no ways intend to perswade you to do any thing against your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; wherefore I desire you to consider, whether it be not a great step to your Reformation, (which I take to be the chief end of your Covenant) that Presbyterial Government be Legally settled. It is true, I desire that My Own Conscience, and those that are of the same opinion with me, might be preserved, which I confess doth not as yet totally take away Episcopal Government; but then consider
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65282:154"/>
withall, that this will take away all the superstitious Sects, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies of the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> to which you are no less ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by your Covenant than the taking away of Episcopacy. And this that I demand is most likely to be but temporary, for if it be so clear, as you believe, that Episcopacy is unlawful, I doubt not but God will so enlighten Mine eyes that I shall soon perceive it: and then I promise you to concurr with you fully in matters of Religion. But I am sure you cannot imagine, that there is any hope of Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Silencing the <hi>Independent</hi> Party, which undoubtedly will get a Toleration in Religion from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you joyn with Me, and in that way I have set down, for the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing My Crown, or at least that you do not press Me, to do this (which is yet against My Conscience) until I may do it without Sinning; which as I am confident none of you will perswade Me to do, so I hope you have so much Charity, not to put things to such a desperate Issue, as to hazard the loss of us all, because for the present you cannot have full satisfaction from Me in Point of Religion: Not Considering that besides the rest of the Mischiefs which may happen, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly set up the innumerable Sects of the <hi>Independents,</hi> nothing being more against your Covenant than permitting of those Schisms to encrease.</p>
                     <p>As for the Message which I think fit at this time to send, I have chosen rather to mention the Point of Religion in a general than par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way, lest (not knowing all these Reasons, which I have set down to you, which are most unfit for a Message) it may give less sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction than I desire. Nevertheless I do conjure you, by that Love and Loyalty you have always professed unto Me, that you make use of what I offered Yesterday in Writing, with these Reasons which I have now set down to you, and those further Hopes I have now given you for the best advantages of My Service.</p>
                     <p>With this particular Explanation, That whereas I mentioned, that the Church-Government should be left to My Conscience, and those of My opinion, I shall be content to restrict it to some few Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, as <hi>Oxford, Winchester, Bristol, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and <hi>Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> leaving all the rest of <hi>England</hi> fully to the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with the strictest Clauses you shall think upon against <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> and <hi>Independents.</hi>

               <p>The Duke left nothing unsaid that could be devised,<note place="margin">The Duke see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters desperate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to retire out of <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </note> to prevail with the King for satisfying <hi>Scotland</hi> in the point of Religion, assuring him, that he found a great willingness in them to serve him in all other things, should he yield to them in that one: That for the point of the <hi>Militia,</hi> they would study to bring it to what the King desired, and in the point of the Delinquents, they would labour to get it brought to that, in which the Process of the Incendiaries in <hi>Scotland</hi> had ended, that they should only be secluded from Trust: but he assured him, he found it impossible to make them abate a tittle of the Demand of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Yet His Majesty continued on his former Grounds, therefore the Duke resolved on a present abandoning of Affairs, and of retiring from the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lanerick</hi> was so angry at this Design, that he spared nothing that either his Affection or Wit could suggest, to divert him from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Resolution (as he termed it.) He told him, could he not be Religious, but he must turn a Monk? and did he not think it best to serve God in that Station whereunto he had called him, or must he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the choice of Gods Providence, and turn his own Disposer? and was he so mean-spirited, as to abandon matters because of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that were in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? But all he could devise was not like to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, for the Duke protested, it was impossible for him to look on and see His Majesties Ruin, which was inevitable upon the Grounds he went on.</p>
               <p>At this time the <hi>Independents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> cajole the King.</note> fearing the extremity to which the King was driven might force him to consent to any thing upon which a Settlement might follow, betook themselves to strange Methods to obstruct it: they therefore gave some hopes that they would be willing to dispense with the imposing of the Covenant, and consent to a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Episcopacy and the Liturgy, provided they might be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in other points.</p>
               <p>This suiting so well with the Kings Inclinations had too good a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him: but my Lord <hi>Lauderdale</hi> wrote from <hi>London</hi> very warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for undeceiving the King,<note place="margin">But <hi>Lauderdale</hi> disabuses his Majesty.</note> assuring him that he infallibly knew, their Designs were the Ruin of Monarchy, and the Destruction of the King
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65282:155"/>
and His Posterity; and though they might cajole His Majesty with some smooth Propositions, those were meant for His Ruine, that they might once divide Him from His Parliaments: after which they would destroy both Him and them, were it in their power. But if the King would now consent to the Propositions, all would go right, and in spight of the Devil, and the <hi>Independents</hi> both, he would be quickly on His Throne: but Delays were full of danger, for they that wished well to the King, were becoming daily more heartless, and the other Party grew in their Insolence; and the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> his Death at that time, had given the greatest blow to the Kings Affairs they could have met with. This he continued to represent by many Letters, both to the King and those about Him; yet His Majesty was much wrought upon to give credit to those Offers of the Sectaries, which made Him the less apprehensive of hazard.</p>
               <p>At length, when the Duke saw His Majesty immoveable,<note place="margin">The Duke ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to retire.</note> he begged His permission to retire. But the King resisted that with so much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and affection, that in the whole Course of His Favours to him, there had not been any since the business of <hi>Ochiltry</hi> wherein He had more obliged him, than by the tenderness that then appeared in him. Yet the Duke was so importunate, that at length the King seemed to give way to it, at least the Duke understood it so: whereupon, with as sad a heart as ever man had, he took leave of the King, which he apprehended to be his last Farewell; and it proved to be so indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (except a transient view he had of Him at <hi>Windsor.</hi>) So he left the King, and carried home with him a heart so fraughted with Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all could be done was not able to rouse him out of it; and neither the tears of his dying Mother, nor the intreaties of his Friends, nor the constant persecution of his Brother, (who was much vexed at it) were able to divert him from his Resolution; for having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Kings dislike of it, which was stronger than all other things with him, he was proof against every thing else. But His Majesty quickly repented Him of that tacit consent He seemed to give, and therefore sent after him this handsom Letter.</p>

               <p>But this Letter will be lame, unless made up with the Cover that went about it from Sir <hi>Robert Murray,</hi> which was, as he wrote in his next, almost wholly the Kings words, and not only his sense: for the King the night before, falling in Discourse with Sir <hi>Robert</hi> about the Duke, discovered very fully the Constancy of His Royal kindness to him: whereupon he laid His Commands on Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> to put him in mind of the Inconveniences his obstinacy in that Resolution would heap upon him; <hi>and mentioned them</hi> (these are Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s words) <hi>with a Friendliness, that related not to his own Concernments. Indeed they are such, as the very apprehension of them cannot but deeply wound a Soul so great as yours. They are briefly these; The withdrawing your self at this time, will be believed to proceed from a tacit Ioy at the appearance of the bad Success of his Affairs, or rather out of a design to contribute to it, under the disguise of a seeming Retiredness and Discontent; Constructions which are not possible for him to make, but obvious to malevolent humours: That although you should not be suspected to be any ways accessory to disloyal Courses, it will be said you are one of those, who could have best hindred them: That your Countrey and Friends may say you have deserted them in their greatest Exigences, and that Differences may be reconciled betwixt His Majesty and His Subjects by the endeavours of others.</hi>

               <p>These Commands were both peremptory and obliging, so that they could not fail of conquering all his Resistance, and carrying his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence after them; which were strengthened from the Letter he had at that same time from Her Majesty, which follows.</p>

Nor can I end this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking notice to you of the Contentment I had, that my last Letter to you had the wished for operation; for besides the obtaining my end, (which several ways is satisfactorily useful to Me) I see that all men have not forsaken Reason, or, at least, that I am some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Right, as I am confident you will make appear the great Reason I have to be</p>

               <p>But to return to Publick Affairs, the Duke at his coming to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage <hi>Scotland</hi> for a Personal Treaty.</note> procured new Instructions to be sent to their Commissioners at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to press a Personal Treaty, and that the King might be with Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Honour in <hi>England,</hi> and that it might be declared, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England</hi> should still continue according to the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws. The chief business at <hi>Westminster</hi> was to be rid of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Scotland</hi>; wherefore they fell a-treating about the Removal of the Army and the Delivery of the Garrisons. The <hi>Scots</hi> demanded five hundred thousand pounds Sterl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng, and of that Sum two hundred thousand pound presently: but four hundred thousand were Voted to them, and only one hundred thousand presently, and upon this they stood long.</p>
               <p>The Two Houses having on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> Voted, that the Kings Person should be demanded from the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army, their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners at <hi>London</hi> gave in long Papers against that,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners at <hi>London</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Kings ill U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and the harsh Votes of the Two Houses.</note> which were Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and so need not be here inserted. In them they shewed,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the King being Soveraign of both Kingdoms, was not to be disposed by the Parliament of one Kingdom; That this was destructive to the Relation and Interest the</hi> Scotish <hi>Nation had in Him, and contrary to the nature of Soveraignty, and to the Covenant and Treaties of both Kingdoms: by which it was agreed, That His Majesties just Power and Greatness should not be
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:65282:158"/>
diminished, which by such a Demand of His Person was very signally done. It was also agreed, that all things in order to Peace (to which the Disposal of the Kings Person did relate in a signal manner) should be done by the Ioynt Councils of both Kingdoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> begun the Treaty betwixt the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners and the Committee appointed for that end by the Two Houses of Parliament,<note place="margin">Many Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Two Houses and them.</note> which was managed in the <hi>Painted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> in the presence of all the Members of the Two Houses. The <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Commissioners (who were the Earls of <hi>Lowdon</hi> and <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wariston</hi>) declared in all their Papers and Speeches, that they were not to Treat about His Majesties Person, nor the Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it; but only about the Removal of the Army, the Delivery of those Garrisons that their Army had in <hi>England,</hi> and the Payment of Arrears due for their Armies both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>: and they continued to press, that whereas the Two Houses had, in all their former Declarations, laid the blame of the Breach betwixt the King and them on His Majesties Withdrawing from His Parliament, that therefore they would invite His Majesty to come with Honour, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Safety, to some of His Houses in or about <hi>London,</hi> in which they still insisted to the last. And so far were they from Treating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Disposing of His Majesties Person, that in the end of their Treaty, when they had finally agreed on all things, it was expresly declared in the first Article of the Treaty that pass'd under the Great Seal, that nothing relating to the Kings Person was concluded on by it; so that after that was ended, the <hi>Scotish</hi> Parliament might have still preserved the King, and brought him with their Army to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Houses turned the Propositions to Bills,<note place="margin">The Houses press a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Answer to their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</note> and passed a Vote that new Commissioner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> should be sent to the King, with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of those of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to press a satisfactory Answer: with this Sanction, that if it were not granted, they should be forced to look to the Security of His Person. And the <hi>English</hi> Army fell upon a most destructive Resolution, of adjourning the Parliament; neither were they over-awed by any thing so much, as the fear of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army. The great point now debated in the Councils of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a final Settlement with the King should be the Condition of the Armies Retiring, or not? The Duke with all his Friends pressed this vigorously, as that which was agreed on by their Covenant and Treaties. But the Church-men still influenced all Counsels, and finding the King irreconcileable to their Way, were still full of their Jealousies of Him; and it was said down-right, that they ought not to meddle betwixt the King and the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> but leave Him and them to their own Counsels; so strangely did their Language vary from what it was <hi>Anno</hi> 1643.</p>
               <p>At this time the King sent Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> of the Bed-Chamber to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> is sent by the King to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                  </note> who carried another Message; but it was so displeasing, that it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only to put his Neck to a new hazard for the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and he durst scarce stir out of doors all the while he was there.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>November</hi> a new Session of the Triennial Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scotland</hi> did hold,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> meets.</note> but little was done for some Weeks; save that there came to them a Remonstrance from the Assembly, wherein
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:65282:158"/>
in the first place Complaints were made of the Committee of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, for their Agreement with <hi>Montrose</hi> and his Followers, which was represented as a great Crime, especially they being excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. Next, they complained of His Majesties constant adherence to Prelacy, and of the danger Religion was in by the Malignants (for so was the Kings Party then called) who were beginning to set up their Heads again; wherefore they recommended to their Care, both the Preservation of Religion, and of the Treaties with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Upon this the Transaction of the Committee of Estates in the Agreement with <hi>Montrose</hi> was examined, and it was put to the Vote, <hi>Approve</hi> or <hi>Exoner them only</hi>: the former was carried by twenty Votes, but all the Pulpits thundered against it; wherefore to stop the mouths of the Ministries, it was enacted, That in any Treaty that should be thereafter with those who were in Arms, the Commission of the Kirk should be consulted about the Lawfulness of the Conditions. For at this time both the Marquis of <hi>Huntley</hi> was in Arms in the North, and <hi>Antrim</hi> was also come over to <hi>Kintyre</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> the former year, and continued still there. His Majesty sent Mr. <hi>Robert Lesley,</hi> with Orders to my Lord <hi>Huntley</hi> for laying down of Arms, with whom he wrote the following Letters to the two Brothers.</p>

                        </note>ACcording to My Promise by little <hi>Nobs,</hi> I send you here inclosed, the Answer which I have resolved to send to <hi>London;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you will find a Clause in favour of the <hi>Independents,</hi> to wit, the Forbearance I give to those who have Scruples of Conscience: and indeed I did it purposely, to make what I send relish the better with that kind of People. But if My Native Subjects will so coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance this Answer, that I may be sure they will stick to Me, in what concerns My Temporal Power, I will not only expunge that Clause, but likewise make what Declarations I shall be desired against the <hi>Independents,</hi> and that really, without any reserve or equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet know, that no Perswasion or Threatning whatsoever shall make Me alter a tittle of any thing else in it, nor that neither but upon these Assurances.</p>
                     <p>The end therefore why I send you this before it go to the <hi>English</hi> Parliament, is, to try before-hand how I can procure it to be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by My <hi>Scotish</hi> Friends, for which you are to use all possible industry, not seeking a full Approbation, but taking what you can get; absolutely commanding you not to hazard it in a Publick Way, unless you be sure that I shall receive no rub in it.</p>
                     <p>For this, I conceive it were a wrong to you, to use any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to make you do your best, but to tell you this is <hi>Coup de partie;</hi> assuring you that I shall not judge you by the Event, but by your Endeavours, which I am confident will be according to your Professions: and for Gods sake, do not so much as expect, much less linger after any other or further mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Me, whereby to serve Me in this great Business; for upon the Faith of a Christian, you shall have no more than what is now laid before you. And know that I rather expect the worse, than the better Event of things, being resolved (by the Grace of God, and without the least repining at him) to suffer any thing that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:65282:160"/>
Injury can put upon Me, rather than sin against My Conscience, of which upon My credit you see the furthest Extent in relation to the present Affairs. I say no more but <hi>difficilia quae pulchra,</hi> and so God bless your Endeavours.</p>

                        </note> as may speedily produce a blessed, firm, and lasting Peace in all His Dominions; so He hath employed His uttermost endeavours, to give a full and particular Answer to every Branch of them. But the more He consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the nature of them, together with the high Importance, and variety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, (not without some ambiguity, as well in the several Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as also in comparing the one with the other) so much the more He finds it necessary to desire the help of Explanation, Debate, and Conference, concerning some of them, (as he touched in His Paper) whereby His Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding may be informed in those things, which as yet are not clear to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:65282:161"/>
Him, His Reason may be more fully convinced, and His Conscience so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that without offence to either of them He may make such a particular distinct Answer, as may best attain His Desires of satisfying them: and though for the present His Majesty (at this distance from His Two Houses) wants the view of many necessary Papers, and other Assistances; yet at what disadvantage soever, He will apply Himself to give all the satisfaction that is in His power, desiring He may not be mis-interpreted in any thing He shall say or omit.</p>
                     <p>His Majesties Answer to the first Proposition is, That upon His Majesties coming to <hi>London,</hi> He will heartily joyn in all that shall concern the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of His two Kingdoms, or the Assembly of Estates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or of the Commissioners, or Deputies of either of them; and particularly in those things which are desired in that Proposition, upon confidence that all of them respectively with the same tenderness will look upon those things which concern His Majesties Honour.</p>
                     <p>Concerning all the Propositions touching Religion, His Majesty says, that He has often and solemnly professed His Opinion concerning Episcopacy, to which He refers Himself; yet considering the present Distractions about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which are so great, and of that nature, that Perswasion as well as Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, must be used to restore that happy Tranquillity which the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath lately and miserably lost, (for certainly Violence and Persecution never was nor will be found a right way to settle mens Consciences.) His Majesty proposes, that He will confirm the Presbyterian Government for Three Years, (being the time set down by the Two Houses) that is to say, that during the said time, the Church be governed by Classical and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Elderships, National and Provincial Assemblies, with their respective Subordinations, with such Forbearance to those who through scruple of Conscience cannot in every thing practise according to the said Rules, as may consist with the Rule of the Word of God, and the Peace of the Kingdom: and that the Office of Ruling-Elders, the Power of Elderships to suspend from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ignorant and scandalous Persons, be all settled by Act of Parliament for the aforesaid Term; as also that the Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be by the same way authorized for the same time; so that His Majesty, and His Houshold be not hindred from using that Form of Gods Service which they have formerly done: and also that in the mean time, and with all convenient speed, a Committee be chosen of Both Houses, to have a free Consultation and Debate with the Assembly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>f Divines, (being also willing the said Assembly shall be authorized to sit for the space of the said Three Years, twenty more being added of His Majesties Nomination) how the Church shall be settled and governed at the end of Three Years or sooner, if Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be agreed. Also it is to be understood, that those Committees shall have no Power, but of hearing, debating and reporting, the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare all these Differences for the Determination of His Majesty and the Two Houses.</p>
                     <p>To the Seventh and Eighth Propositions His Majesty will consent.</p>
                     <p>To the Ninth Proposition His Majesty doubts not but to give good satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when He shall be particularly informed how the said Penalties shall be levyed and disposed.</p>
                     <p>To the Tenth His Majesties Answer is, That He is, and hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways willing to prevent the Practices of Papists, and therefore is content to pass an Act of Parliament for that purpose; as also that the Laws against them may be duely executed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:65282:161"/>His Majesty will give His consent to the Act for the strict Observance of the Lords Day, for the suppressing of Innovations, and those concerning the Preaching of Gods Word, and touching Non-residencies and Pluralities.</p>
                     <p>And His Majesty will be willing to pass such an Act or Acts, as shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to raise Moneys for the payment and satisfaction of all Publick and past Debts, expecting that His also will be therein included.</p>
                     <p>As to the Proposition concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> though His Majesty cannot consent to it in <hi>terminis</hi> as it is proposed: because thereby (as He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives) He wholly devests Himself of the Power of the Sword intrusted to Him by God, and the Laws of the Land, for the Protection and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His People, and placeth the same (in effect) for ever in the Two Houses of Parliament; thereby at once disinheriting His Posterity of that Right and Prerogative of the Crown, which is absolutely necessary to the Kingly Office, and so weakening Monarchy in this Kingdom, that little more than the Name and Shadow of it will remain: yet if it be only Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the preservation of the Peace of this Kingdom after these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Troubles, and the due performance of all the Agreements that now are to be concluded, which is desired, (which His Majesty always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be the case, and hopes that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erein He is not mistaken) His Majesty will give abundant Satisfaction; to which end He will consent by Act of Parliament, That the whole Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> both by Sea and Land, be in the Two Houses for the space of Ten Years, and afterwards to return to its proper channel again, as it was in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> of blessed Memory. And now His Majesty conjures His Two Houses of Parliament, as they are <hi>English-men,</hi> Christians, and Lovers of Peace, by the Duty which they owe to Him their King, and by the bowels of Compassion which they have to their Fellow-Subjects, that they will accept of these His Majesties Of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ers, whereby the joyful News of Peace may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain restored to this languishing Kingdom. His Majesty will grant the same to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> if it be desired, touching the conservation of the Peace betwixt His two Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>Ireland,</hi> His Majesty will give full satisfaction, as to the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of War; and for Religion, as in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the mutual Declaration proposed to be established in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms by Act of Parliament, and the Qualifications, Mollifications, and Branches which follow in the Propositions; His Majesty truly professes, that He does not sufficiently understand divers things contained therein: but this He sufficiently knows, that a General Act of Oblivion is the best Bond of Peace, and that after intestine Troubles, the Wisdom of this and other Kingdoms, hath usually, and happily in all Ages, granted general Pardons with none or very few Exceptions, whereby the numerous Discontentments of many Persons and Families (otherwise exposed to Ruine) might not become fuel to new Disorders or the seeds of future Troubles. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty desires that His Two Houses of Parliament should seriously descend into these Considerations, and tenderly look upon His Condition herein, and the perpetual Dishonour that must cleave to Him, if He should thus desert so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny persons of Condition and Fortune, that have engaged themselves with Him, only out of a sense of Duty. His Majesty is very unwilling to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large Himself further upon this Subject, but earnestly desires that upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference these Particulars may be better understood and reconciled, wherein He will condescend to all that in Honour and Iustice He may do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same; and then they may likewise particularly consider, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65282:162"/>
of the best Means to discharge the Publick Debts, as likewise those of His Majesties: and then His Majesty will apply Himself to the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concerning the Seals, and any other thing now casually omitted, or to which for the present (without further Information or Debate) His Majesty cannot give any positive Answer.</p>
                     <p>As for the Offices which are mentioned in the <hi>17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                        </hi> Article, albeit His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty judges that the free Disposal of them is a necessary Flower of the Crown; yet he is content, for the space of these next Ten Years to come, to nominate such, both for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> who after shall be approved of by the Two Houses, to be enjoyed by these Persons <hi>Quam diu se bene gesserint,</hi> so that after the said Ten Years, they shall return to be disposed of as formerly.</p>
                     <p>His Majesty will very willingly consent to the Act, for the Confirmation of the Priviledges and Customs of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now that His Majesty hath thus far endeavoured to comply with the Desires of His Two Houses of Parliament, He conceives it seasonable for Him to propose some things for Himself, which (if consented to) may be a testimony of their reciprocal Affections to Him.</p>
                     <p>First, that an Act of Oblivion and General Pardon be passed by Act of Parl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ament, whereby all the seeds of Discontentments and future Troubles may be quite extirpated.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the Two Houses would settle upon His Majesty, such a certain Revenue as may be honourable, and sufficient for the support of Him, His Wife, Children, and their Families.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, that this Agreement may be firm and lasting, His Majesty desires to come to <hi>Westminster,</hi> with honourable Freedom and Safety, there solemnly to confirm the same; where He may both give and receive Pledges of mutual Love, Confidence, and of Trust with them in all things, which shall concern the good and prosperity of His People.</p>

I cannot find many here satisfied with it, nor dare I promise the least Countenance to it from this Kingdom; seeing Your Majesty hath divers times verbally, and now again by Your Letter, assured me of Your Resolution to adhere to the Grounds contained in this Message. I shall not presume to make any Objections against it, having (when I had the honour to wait upon Your Majesty last) represented my sense of that You was pleased to send by Mr. <hi>Murray,</hi> whereof this in divers Particulars comes far short; for besides that it is as wanting in that Article concerning Religion, Your Majesty offers far less than you did at that time by the private Instructions Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty then gave Him, in the Propositions about the <hi>Militia,</hi> Officers of State, and the Great Seal: yet I find not Your Majesties Condition is much more
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:65282:162"/>
promising at least to vulgar eyes. That Clause concerning the Liberty Your Majesty would allow to Tender Consciences, is one of the meanest Particulars, that is misliked in Your Majesties Answer to the Proposition concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Your Majesties Preface to that Article, the Limitation of time to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Government, the addition of Twenty of Your Majesties Nomination to the Assembly of Divines, the particular Exception of Your Own Family, and (what is most of all) the total omission of making any mention of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are the most insisted-on Objections. But as I dare not think upon the sad Consequences (in relation to Your Majesties Person and Government) which will presently follow upon the Return of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army, and Your Majesties declining to allow the Covenant, without which, though I presume not to press it, all that can be offered will not satisfie here; so I will not conceal the great advantages which I conceive the doing of it would bring to Your Majesty, and to those You study to preserve: for I am confident it might be so managed, as this Kingdom would not only declare themselves, for Preserving Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties just Rights in Civil Relations, but likewise engage themselves for an honourable and speedy Invitation of Her Majesty to return from <hi>France.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides an easie passing of all such, who during these Troubles have adhered to Your Majesty in <hi>England,</hi> with what else could be expected from faithful and dutiful Subjects.

                        </gap>u saw remediless. Yet since what I sent you is so much mistaken, the rest is the less wonder to Me; for it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazes Me to hear, that some amongst you, who know every tittle that <hi>Will. Murray</hi> carried, say that this is far short in divers Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, when there is but one (which is the <hi>Militia</hi>) for which there is any colour, and not that neither but in a much wrested sense. And is it not so, when private Instructions are the only ground, which only permit a further Latitude to be made use of in case of absolute
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:65282:163"/>
necessity, and not otherwise, it being a new kind of Incivility, that particular Freedoms should be esteemed Publick Obligations; yet if they think, they have so great a catch of it, so that <hi>Scotland</hi> will declare for Me, I will stand to the least tittle of these Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (nothing being omitted) according to their plain Grammatical sense. As for the Officers of State, certainly My Advocate will clear that Mistaking; for all the Alteration concerning them is only for the better Conformity of that Paper, which he brought from <hi>London.</hi> And for the Great Seal, upon the perusal of all My Papers, I have not wit enough to find from whence the ground of going less can be taken: but for Religion, I know not what to say, except en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to be civil be termed a going less; if so, that fault shall be soon helped. And indeed I cannot but think it strange, that rather than to comply any thing with My Conscience, you will (I speak not personally to you, but to the Kingdom in general) sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Wills of those, who at least can never prove your Friends, and that to the visible Prejudice (I may say more) both of you and Me, though I express My endeavouring to content you, by shewing you more than a probable way for attaining your Pretensions, which you make altogether desperate by rejecting My Offer. And truly I am confident not to be single to think your Exceptions strange; for, first, civil Ingenuity uses not to be misliked; then, I rather expected Thanks for giving of some time to Presbyterial Government, than to have the Limitation of it objected against Me, especially since that without Me it cannot be established. And is it unfit for Me to have what is granted to all Publick Ministers by the Law of Nations? Yes, I cry you mercy, for Kings use to dispense, not to be dispensed with. And why will ye not have Twenty Divines of My Nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to speak amongst your grave Assembly? Is it that you misdoubt your Cause, or that you will not have it disputed? neither of these Reasons can I submit to, a third I cannot find. Lastly, as for your Covenant, when, and not before, I shall be satisfied in My Conscience that I may allow it, I will: but I see no way for that satisfaction, unless by such a Conference as I have proposed. Now for sad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences I know no Antidote so good as a clear Conscience, which (by the Grace of God) I will preserve, whatsoever else happen to</p>

                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:65282:164"/>SInce my last, our Debates have been of so great Importance that I cannot conceal them. Yesterday we spent two Hours in the grand Commitee, (the whole Parliament being present) and indeed to good purpose; for it was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that present Instructions should be sent to our Commissioners, to press His Majesties coming to <hi>London</hi> with Honour, Safety, and Freedom, and that we should declare our Resolutions to maintain Monarchical Government in His Majesties Person and Posterity, and His Iust Title to the Crown of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> But I confess this Day is the saddest I ever saw, for after Resolutions were taken of sending to His Majesty, it is carried that nothing but a Grant to the whole Propositions must be demanded, and in case of a Refusal the former Certifications given to His Majesty put in execution, of Securing the Kingdom, and Settling a Government without Him: and lest His Majesty should have hopes of engaging this Kingdom on easier terms, or thinking to come to <hi>Scotland,</hi> (where though He should lose <hi>England,</hi> He might exercise the Office of a King) it is to be Declared, that this Kingdom cannot lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engage themselves for His Majesties Preservation, albeit He should be even Deposed in <hi>England,</hi> He not taking the Covenant, satisfying in Religion, and giving a satisfactory Answer to the rest of the whole Propositions presented to Him in name of both Kingdoms. Besides it is to be Declared, that His Majesty will not be admitted to come to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where though He were, His Regal Function would be sus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ended, and even His Royal P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rson at least be put under Restraint, if not delivered up to the Parliament. While we were on these Debates, the inclosed Warning was presented to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Commission of the Kirk, which though you may think possibly high, yet really it is very moderate in regard of these Motions have been in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; for now all Private Meeting is quit by us in relation to His Majesties Person, which certainly will not only not be admitted to come into <hi>Scotland,</hi> but a joynt Course will be taken by both Kingdoms for keeping him in Restraint in <hi>England.</hi> And you may be confident, that will certainly be carried in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of those that will oppose it. And to prepare us the better, before we come to a Resolution, we are to morrow to have a kind of Fast, and hear two Sermons in the Morning, (according to our Custom at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> before the Executions) and the rest of the Day is to be imployed in taking a Final Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; which (without all peradventure) will be, to send Commissioners to His Majesty, to demand the whole Propositions, (for Religion will not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie) and to settle both Kingdoms without His Majesties Regal Authority, and imprison His Person in <hi>England,</hi> for He will not be admitted to come to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> This I thought fit to shew you, from others you will hear what hath been every mans particular Carriage in the Debates; and our future Actions, though they prove not useful to His Majesty, yet shall witness to the World and Posterity, how we detest such Resolutions. However I shall boldly say, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now were the two Brothers,<note place="margin">The Duke and <hi>Lanerick</hi> oppose things as much as they can, but in vain.</note> according to the variety of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, swallowed up with the excesses of Passion. The Duke was all Melancholy and Despair, and <hi>Lanerick</hi> was full of Fury and Rage. But say or do what they could, all was in vain. One rare instance of the Kings temper appeared at this time, for after he had got this account, which brought him such ill tidings, he took no notice of it to those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, but continued in a Game at Chess, and was as chearful as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He was at that time thinking of making an escape from <hi>Newcastle</hi> by Sea, but whither he intended to have gone, does not appear to the Writer: to that <hi>Lanerick</hi>'s Letters do relate, when they press his speedy resolving on what he intended. The design was thus laid. Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> had provided a Vessel by <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Murray</hi> was to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the King thither in a disguise; and it proceeded so far that the King put himself in the disguise, and went down the back-Stairs with Sir <hi>Robert Murray.</hi> But His Majesty apprehending it was scarce possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ss through all the Guards without being discovered, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hugely undecent to be catched in such a condition, changed His Resolution, and went back; as Sir <hi>Robert</hi> informed the Writer. This came to be known to some: and one suspecting the Duke was in it, wrote to him earnestly to concur in no such design, and that the Kings getting out of their hands again would ruin all; that no man of Honour and Conscience ought to serve the King, since he would not serve God according to the Covenant: adding, that it seemed God had no mercy for the King or His Family, since His Heart was still so hardned in the matter of the Covenant; so high-flown were men at that time.</p>

                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:65282:165"/>At <hi>London</hi> things went on with great dispatch: for the Retiring of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army another hundred thousand pounds sterling was Voted to be paid presently, and other two hundred thousand pounds to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King at this time was much pressed both by the Queen from <hi>France,</hi> and by <hi>Believre</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour, to consent to their Demands; but all was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and my Lord <hi>Lanerick</hi>'s last Letter prevailed no more than the former.</p>

I shall not presume to reply to the Answers Your Majesty makes to the Objections were made here (for I did not then speak mine own Language) against Your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Propositions: I never laboured to perswade Your Majesty to grant them, from a sense of their Iustness, but only out of an opinion of their fitness in relation to Your present Condition, which (by what Your Majesty will learn from the Bearer) is more threatning now than ever. I know the representation of Your Danger, in what horrid shape soever it may with Reason lie before You, will be as impertinent an Argument as any: yet though Your Majesty should neglect it in reference to Your Self, pity Your hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Children and Posterity, pity Your Subjects, and suffer us not to ruine our selves, which the Confusions we are running into will certainly bring upon us; and pity all those who have suffered for You, who will be exposed to certain Ruine. All possible means have been used in a Parliamentary way, which is the only mean left to prevent the extreme Resolutions that are now taken: but all is to no purpose, our best Friends forsake us upon any Motion, which may infer the least Latitude about the Covenant and Religion; and therefore as in the presence of God I must discharge my self to Your Majesty, and shew you the Resolutions now taken here in relation to the restraining of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Person, and Governing the Kingdom without You, will be infallibly put in execution, if Your Majesty does not satisfie in the Covenant and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to the full, as it is demanded: neither will it be in the power of any in this Kingdom to prevent Affronts and Danger to Your Majesties Person, if You should have any thoughts of coming hither.

                  <note place="margin">and at <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> and first presented to the House of Peers, whereat all, even those who were best-affected, hung their Heads, and sent it down to the House of Commons without a word; and there it met with the same Entertainment. The next Debate was about the Kings Person, and the mildest opinion was, that He should be kept Prisoner, some being for the excluding Him for ever from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And for the place of His Restraint, some were for His stay at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> but it was carried that He should go to <hi>Holmby.</hi> And this passed without communicating it to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners. But when He was ordained to be kept in Safety for His Person, <hi>Henry Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> objected, that the King had broken the Peace, and why must the Parliament bind for His Safety? Some moved to preserve His Person according to the Covenant, and it was carried, which was thought a great point. For now it was esteemed, that the Covenant was that which must preserve the King, though His Ruine had been formerly imputed to it.</p>
               <p>In the end of the year the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners parted from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; and it being moved in the House of Commons, to send some with a Complement to them before they went, with the Thanks of the House for their <hi>Civilities and good Offices,</hi> those of the <hi>Independent</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal argued much against that, of <hi>good Offices</hi> done by them, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned many bad ones since the King went to <hi>Newcastle</hi>; and it being put to the Vote, it was carried by 24 Votes, to dash out <hi>good Offices,</hi> and only thank them for their <hi>Civilities.</hi> And so all those Noble Characters they were wont to give of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners, upon every occasion, concluded now in this, that they were <hi>well-bred Gentlemen.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nant, wherein they had sworn to defend the Kings Majesties Person and Authority? Was this a suitable return to the Kings Goodness, both in his consenting to all the Desires of that Kingdom,</hi> An. 1641. <hi>and in His late trusting His Person to them? what Censures would be past upon this through the whole World? what a stain would it be to the whole Reformed Religion? and in fine, what Danger might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended both to the Kings Person, and to</hi> Scotland, <hi>from the Party that was now prevalent in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding all this, the Question was put in these words, Whether they should leave His Majesty in <hi>England</hi> to the Two Houses there or not? so softly did the prevailing Party present that infamous Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to the Vote of the Parliament. The Dukes Vote was suitable to his Discourse and Temper, being a Negative uttered with much grave and deep Sorrow; but I shall set down <hi>Lanerick</hi>'s in the formal terms wherein he expressed it; <hi>As God shall have mercy upon my Soul at the Great Day, I would chuse rather to have my Head struck off at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-cross of</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>than give my consent to this Vote.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Lindsay,</hi> now Earl <hi>Crawford,</hi> was President, and so could not debate: but as in the stating the Vote he expressed much honest Zeal, so when it was carried in the Affirmative, he dissented from it, and to him those who had voted in the Negative did adhere. But some of their Friends were accidentally absent, others on design, and some downright de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted them; so that though there were divers who dissented, yet they were far short of being able to ballance the Vote. When all this was done, <hi>Lanerick</hi> with a deep Groan said, <hi>this was the blackest</hi> Saturday
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65282:167"/>
                  <hi>that ever</hi> Scotland <hi>saw,</hi> alluding to a great Eclipse that was many years before on a <hi>Saturday,</hi> from which it was still called the <hi>Black Saturday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being sent to the Commissioners at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> did not at all shake His Majesty, he being resolved not to yield to that, no not at <hi>Holmby,</hi> which He had refused at <hi>Newcastle.</hi>

                  </note>In the end of the Month the <hi>English</hi> Commissioners and Forces came down, and the Arrears for the payment of the Army being delivered, the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army withdrew, and left the King in the hands of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> who presently sent him to <hi>Holmby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is a free and faithful Relation of that great Transaction, only in invidious Passages I have spared the Memories and Families of the unhappy Actors.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">which is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>It was presently the matter of Discourse and Censure of Christendom, and brought an Infamy on those who acted it, which though an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity could pardon, yet no Oblivion was able to deface. It was thought strange, since the King had trusted himself to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they should have thus deserted Him. What grounds <hi>Montrevil</hi> had for giving the King those Assurances, did not appear; and certain it is, they were very slight ones, and were only from single Persons, but not from any <hi>Iunto</hi> or Judicatory.</p>
               <p>But generous minds thought the Kings frank casting Himself into their hands, was an Obligation beyond any Engagements they could have given. And it was thought strange madness in those of <hi>Scotland</hi> to do it at that time, since they saw the <hi>Independents</hi> prevailing, whose Designs against the Kings Person and Monarchy had been faithfully disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them by some of their Commissioners at <hi>London,</hi> and who were as little Friends to the Covenant and Presbytery as the King himself was; so that considering their Power, such a Strengthening of them brought Religion under a hazard of another nature, than could have been apprehended upon their Accepting of the Kings Concessions. But the Contradiction that this course had to the Covenant, was so plain that none could avoid observing it; for to make their King a Prisoner, was an odd Comment upon their Defending of His Person and Authority: and to do all that because he would not force his Conscience, was judged a strange Practice from those, who had so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complained heavily against any appearance of Force upon Tender Consciences.</p>
               <p>These were the Censures that generally passed on that Transaction: the Kings stifness was also very much condemned, and most men not understanding the strictness of a Tender Conscience, thought it was Humour that swayed Him, and judged that in the posture Affairs were then in, He should have yielded to any thing, how unreasonable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, rather than have so exposed Himself, His Posterity, and His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to such visible hazards; reckoning that no Form of Government that ever was, deserved to be so firmly adhered to. All persons looked for dismal effects from these Resolutions, few thinking the Friendship betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> would be lasting: and all apprehended some strange Curse would overtake those who were active in this infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Business.</p>
               <p>Amidst these greater Reflections, there were some who suspected the Duke had not acted in that Affair with that Candour and Zeal He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed: and this was chiefly founded on the base Votes of some of his
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65282:167"/>
Friends, chiefly of one who had served him, but was then a Lord. But as the tract of this Account hath cleared the whole Progress of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, so the visible affliction of his Mind, which drew after it a great indisposition in his Body, did abundantly refute these Calumnies. And indeed that great Mind which did not succumb under the hardest Trials, when it imployed its utmost strength, was now reduced to the most pinching Straits, and almost to desperate Resentments; so that he repented his Stay in <hi>Scotland,</hi> since he foresaw nothing but imminent Ruine to King and Country: yet His Majesties opinion of his Zeal and Affection to His Service, was at this time proof against all Whispers, which appears by the following Letter.</p>

               <p>Now it was that genuine Melancholy and Horrour dwelt in all the Dukes thoughts,<note place="margin">The Duke contrives how to turn <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the Kings Service.</note> his Brother was too deeply prepossessed with the like apprehensions to minister much Comfort to him; only he pressed him not to give way to languishing Sorrow, but to see what could be done for setting things right again; and for infusing that sense of Shame and Horrour in all People for the late Action, which might prepare them to a Noble Reparation of it by a generous Engaging in the Kings Quarrel. And upon this much pains was taken to infuse Jealousies of the <hi>Independents</hi> in the minds of the Kirk-men, though there were other violent persons as careful to refute them.</p>
               <p>Most of this Year was spent in possessing all mens Minds with these Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, so preparing them for what they designed to execute upon the first Opportunity. The Duke and the Earls of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerick</hi> were they, who united most closely and cordially for the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and prosecuting of that Design. The King was Prisoner at <hi>Holmby,</hi> without any other Liberty save that of taking the air sometimes: all his Servants were denied access to him, and so cruel was the zeal of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that it reached to his Soul; for they refused liberty for his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains to wait on him, a favour not denied to the worst of Malefactors: but God was his Refuge, who supported him in all his Sufferings and Solitudes. The Two Houses wrote to the Committee of Estates in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that they should take such a joynt Course with them, as might tend most to bring things to a happy Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:65282:168"/>But now the Jealousies betwixt the Parliament and the Army begun to grow visible and above board, for the Presbyterian Party in the Parliament saw their Error too late;<note place="margin">Disorders rise in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> most of them seemed to have intended the Kings Good, only they were mistaken, in Judging that the Parliament, in which they were most numerous, would never be disobeyed by the Army: but being disappointed in this, they ruined all, their confidence in their Power in Parliament having been the cause why they let the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army go home, for till they were gone, the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> crouched under them, and trepanned them into Severities against the King, and the Dismissing of the <hi>Scots</hi>; who were no sooner gone, but the Army acted what had been before projected, but most industriously concealed from the Presbyterians.</p>

                  </note>In <hi>April</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> was sent from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> to insist on the motion for a Settlement with the King, and chiefly to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the adding of any new Propositions; and he was also Instructed to deal for a permission to the Duke and the Earl of <hi>Dumfernline</hi> to go and serve the King in his Bedchamber. But the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> found matters in great confusion at <hi>Westminster,</hi> for the chief thing thought on was the Disbanding of the Army, which was an unnecessary Burden to the Kingdom, many grounds of Fear appearing, that their Designs were to keep themselves up, and govern the Nation by a Military and Arbitrary Power: therefore such as were best-affected, judged it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary once to disband them, before they engaged in a new Treaty with the King. But for that private Proposition concerning the Duke and <hi>Dumfernline,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> seeing it would not take, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was not a Family yet settled about the King, nor could it be expected that any from <hi>Scotland</hi> would be the first they would set about His Majesties Person, did not present it: and indeed the Duke's late Behaviour in opposing the Delivery of the King, had forfeited his Credit with those of <hi>England</hi> then in Power. But it is not my meaning to go on with a regular History of the irregular Transactions that past in <hi>England</hi> this Year: I shall only say so much of them, as will make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what reason the <hi>Scots</hi> had for their Proceedings, and to clear what may have relation to the Dukes Concerns.</p>
               <p>In the middle of <hi>May</hi> the King sent a new Message to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in order to a Treaty: but his Offers were the same (upon the matter) they had been at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and so not like to take; and the Two Houses were then busied about Disbanding the Army. They therefore ordered the Army to be disbanded, and some of the Forces they kept up to be sent over to <hi>Ireland</hi>; and all Satisfaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered,<note place="margin">The Army refuses obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Parliament,</note> the time of their Disbanding was named. But the Ring-leaders of the Army disposed them to mutiny against the Parliament, upon pretence of want of Satisfaction in matter of Money, and Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in point of Honour; so the Army drew to a Body, and erected a Court who were called the <hi>Agitators.</hi> Mean-while <hi>Cromwel</hi> puts his Party in the House of Commons, on the Recalling o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ever hated thralling of Consciences, yet I shall be sorry, there were no other price of Spiritual Freedom than Your Majesties loss of all Temporal Power.

It is wished Your Majesties true Condition and positive Pleasure may be made known (from Your Self if possible) against that time, when certainly the sense both of this Church (seeing the General Assembly will be then sitting) and State upon the present Differences in <hi>England,</hi> as they have relation to, or can have influence upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> will be made known. It is wished Your Majesties Prudence may prevent further Prejudice, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at first the full length You intend, in granting what Conditions shall be demanded; or if You find them absolutely destructive to You, to put Your Self in that Condition, that our Persons and Lives may be of use to Your Majesty, which shall be the constant care of</p>

And the Two Houses did choose a Committee of Safety to Treat with the City of <hi>London,</hi> for Raising a new <hi>Militia</hi> for their own Security, and some of the Trained Bands were drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under Presbyterian Officers. Upon this the Army came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> forced the Houses to recall their Votes, and disband their Forces, and drove away the eleven Members.

both Parliament and City, they began to levy new Forces: but assoon as they withdrew from <hi>London,</hi> the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> came in great numbers to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and petitioned to have their <hi>Militia</hi> settled again according to their former Votes; which being granted, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament next day was at liberty, and the Secluded Members returned. About the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> going to wait on His Majesty, who was then at <hi>Wooburn,</hi> was not only hindred access, but by the Violence of the Souldiers carried away; and say or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what he would of the Violation of the Treaty with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Law of Nations, by that Affront put upon a Publick Minister of another Kingdom, he could not prevail, but was forced to be gone. After this the King was Voted to come to <hi>London.</hi> But the Army, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Obedience, came thither again, and by the interposition of some treacherous People got the City surrendred to them: whereupon they marched through it in Triumph with Lawrels in their Hats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and came to <hi>Westminster,</hi> bringing with them the two Speakers, and some other Members of their Party, who had run away from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, pretending Fear, though no appearance of it had been in the Proceedings of the Parliament. <hi>Fairfax</hi> was declared Captain-General of all <hi>England,</hi> Constable of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and Commander of all the Garisons, and then they fell to the Purging of the House. And besides the forcing the eleven Members to flee, seven of the Lords were also impeached; and all Orders that past in the absence of the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were repealed; yet this was not carried but upon a fortnights De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Divers of the City of <hi>London,</hi> with the Mayor and some Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were likewise charged and imprisoned: and all this was upon a general Accusation of their designs to raise a new War.</p>
               <p>Those in <hi>Scotland</hi> being advertised by their Commissioners of all that passed, failed not to make good use of it,<note place="margin">This is resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> to stir up the Affection and Duty of all to appear for His Majesty; which prevailed generally, and even the Ministers begun both from their Pulpits, and by their Remonstrances, to complain of the Prevailings of the Sectarian Party, and of the Force that was put on the Kings Person. But the old lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Presbytery</hi> was still in their mouths; yet all were pretty forward for a real Resentment of the late Disorders in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Only Mr. <hi>George Gillespie,</hi> who was indeed of good parts, but bold beyond all measure, withstood these Inclinations, and represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the greatest Danger to Religion was to be feared from the King and the Malignant Party. He was suspected of correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Sectaries, which some Letters in my hand written in Cypher give good grounds to believe. Certain it is that he proved a very ill instrument, and marred that great Design, by which all former Errors might have been corrected. Thus as the Duke and his Friends designs began to appear, there was a violent Party no less careful to withstand them. Therefore it was not judged fitting the Duke should leave <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Service in it being greater than any he could do in <hi>England</hi>: besides, his being a Peer in <hi>England,</hi> made him more obnoxious to their fury than any other <hi>Scotchman</hi> could be. But His Majesties Concessions about Religion pinched them much, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty offered to Tender Consciences did very much disgust the <hi>Scotish</hi> Clergy; for in <hi>Scotland</hi> a Toleration was little less odious than Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy, and nothing but <hi>Presbytery</hi> would satisfie them.</p>

               <p>The King was then so filled with Hopes from Assurances given Him by the Army,<note place="margin">The King is abused by the Army.</note> that He was out of doubt of getting things carried by Treaty, and therefore continued to press <hi>Lanerick</hi>'s Coming up. The Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> wrote also to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that some Person of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence might be sent to concur with him in the great Transactions that were coming on; whereupon the Lord Chancellour and <hi>Lanerick</hi> were appointed to go up; upon which a Pass was signed by <hi>Fairfax,</hi> for the Earls of <hi>Lowdon</hi> and <hi>Lanerick</hi> (according to the desire sent from <hi>Scotland</hi>) to come and wait upon the King.</p>
               <p>But their Coming up was delayed, the occasion whereof is given in the following Letter written by my Lord <hi>Lanerick</hi> to the King; which though I set down in the due Stile, yet both it, and almost all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written this Year, being in Cypher, run in the third person: but for making the Narration smoother, I have presumed to change their phrase a little.</p>

Those of the Chancellor's Friends, who were against his being employed at this time, take occasion to press a Delay to his, and my present Going to <hi>London,</hi> or Court, from the Two Houses their not yet answering a Letter the Committee here wrote to them, for Reparation of the Affront done to the Earl of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale,</hi> and for Assurances to all Commissioners employed from this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: so until a satisfactory Answer be returned to that Letter, it is alledged that their Going will be useless, since (except they be allowed by the Two Houses) access to Your Majesty may still be denied them, and so their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to serve You frustrated. This is the rather urged by reason of many informalities in the Pass sent them by Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> by which they were only warranted to come to Your Majesty at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi>: and if You chance not to be there, it doth not warrant them to wait upon Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in any other place; especially since it bears not at all a liberty for them to go to <hi>London,</hi> where their Endeavours probably would be of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> use. If the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> had not been affronted, they would not have desired any Assurance at all; but that being unrepaired, (for they are not at all satisfied with Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> his Answer to the Two Houses Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in that particular) if they shall have occasion to move any thing in Your Majesties Favours, which shall be disliked by the Parliament or Army, they may chance to meet with the same or worse Vsage that <hi>Lauderdale</hi> did. I was not so scrupulous, but willingly would have hazarded through these (or any) Difficulties, being required, as I am, by Your Majesty to haste thither; but the Chancellor's Stay would have made my single Going (I being only employed to Your Majesty) useless: yet if it shall be thought fit, and I again commanded to it, want of Formalities or Passes will not fright me from my Duty. In the mean time Instructions are this day sent to our Commissioners at <hi>London,</hi> to delay their concurrence in sending the Propositions of Peace to Your Majesty till the Chancellour's Coming; for the Committee resolved to adhere to their former Instructions, in pressing Your Majesties Coming to <hi>London</hi> with Honour, Freedom, and Safety, for confirming so far as You have already granted, by Your Message of the <hi>12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                     <hi>Lowdon</hi> and <hi>Lanerick</hi> with difficulty are permitted to wait on the King.</note> which drew on a great Debate: for <hi>Haslerig, Martin,</hi> and others of that Cabal argued much against it, saying, why should <hi>Lanerick</hi> be sent up, who was a known Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary? and the <hi>Latham</hi> Letter mentioned in the account of the Year 1643, with many other Particulars were remembred.

               <p>All this while the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> went not near <hi>Westminster,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he got not Reparation for the Affront put on him by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but was extremely v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>xed to see the King possessed with such a good opinion of the Army, and used all the ways he could think of to undeceive Him.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>October</hi> the Earls of <hi>Lowdon</hi> and <hi>Lanerick</hi> came to <hi>London</hi>;<note place="margin">The <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners wait on the King,</note> and with them the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> went to wait on the King, who was then at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi>; and after they had learned from Him the State in which His Affairs were, and had expressed the Sense and Affection of His Subjects in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who judged all their happiness to depend upon His Settlement on his Throne, they fell upon their Treaty with the Parliament. But the Army was beginning to take off their Mask, and change their Stile: for having now seated themselves in the Power, they begun to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive how to execute what they had always designed, which was the Ruin of the King, and the Subversion of Monarchy. And a new Party among them called the Levellers, did avowedly own Principles contrary to all Order and Government, so that there was great ground to apprehend Danger to the Kings Person. My Lords of <hi>Lowdon, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale,</hi> and <hi>Lanerick,</hi> represented to the King, that if He would give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the point of Religion, he was Master of <hi>Scotland</hi> on what terms as to other things He would demand: but without that, they
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:65282:173"/>
feared their Design of serving Him should meet with great Opposition; yet they resolved once to rescue Him out of the hands of the Army, or to perish in the Attempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">and offered to rescue Him from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note>A little after this, His Majesty being to hunt at <hi>Nonsuch,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and <hi>Lanerick</hi> came thither on pretence of waiting on His Majesty, accompanied with 50 Horse, which struck no small terrour in the little Guard that was about the King: whereupon these Lords told His Majesty, that they were come to rescue Him from His Captivity, and they, with all these they brought with them, were resolved to die at His feet; wherefore they intreated Him to make His Escape. But the King told them, He had engaged His Honour not to leave the Army without giving them Advertisement; and till He freed Himself of that, He would die rather than break His Faith. But the Leading men of the Army were now weary of the Kings being with them, and wished to have Him in some secure Place under a good Guard: whereupon they made reports be brought to Him, that the Levellers were designing against His Life. The King therefore called again the Earls of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and <hi>Lanerick</hi> to Him some days before His Escape, and told them, He had freed Himself of the Engagement He had given not to leave the Army;<note place="margin">The King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises with <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale</hi> and <hi>Lanerick</hi> what to do.</note> He therefore desired their Advice what to do. The Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> said, things being driven to such extremities, it was not safe to give Advice; but would His Majesty suggest any thing, he would with all candour deliver his Opinion about it. The King first spoke of His Going to <hi>Scotland</hi>; the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> said, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept He resolved to comply with their Desires about Religion, He might expect no better Usage from the Church-party there, than He had met with at <hi>Newcastle.</hi> Next the King moved His Going to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>: the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> answered, that formerly that had been a safe Course, but now the City was so over-awed by the Army, that he durst not advise His trusting His Person to them; for the Tumults there were already great, and would undoubtedly grow upon His coming. The King asked, if He came, was He sure of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners that they would stick to Him in Name of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation? the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> answered, that all of them to a man should wait on Him, and own His Service at all hazards; but without Instructions from <hi>Scotland</hi> they could do nothing as Commissioners, but only in their own Names as His Subjects; and they had great reason to fear, the Church-party in <hi>Scotland</hi> would not own Him, nor order them to do it. Next the King spoke of His going to <hi>Berwick</hi>; whereupon the Earl of <hi>Lanerick,</hi> who till then had stood silent, begged of His Majesty, that for Gods sake he would follow that Motion: for if He left <hi>England</hi> the Army would pretend He was deserting His Kingdom, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Him; but <hi>Berwick</hi> was a strong Place, which at that time lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garrisoned, the Country about it was generally well-affected, and so He might easily get a good Garrison to go in with Him: and by that means he was near <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the encouragement of those who resolved to serve Him. This was also backed by <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and the King seemed fully resolved on it; so they left Him: of this the Author had his Information from the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A few days after this, His Majesty went to the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King goes to the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi>;</note> and on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> sent a Message to the Parliament, which is Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the rest of the Messages, declaring the reason of His Going

Besides He continued His Offer for the Settlement of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for Three Years, till things were freely debated and considered, adding a Liberty to all Tender Consciences, except Popish Recusants.

They also protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, first, against the sending of Propositions without a previous Treaty, which they earnestly pressed, as the likeliest Course for removing all Mistakes, and bringing things to a Final Settlement; and therefore they insisted on their former <hi>Desires</hi> for a Personal Treaty in or about <hi>London.</hi> Next, they excepted against the Bills, both because the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was quite omitted, and the Settling of the Uniformity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was turned to a Desire for a vast Toleration. The Treaties with <hi>Scotland</hi> were not desired to be confirmed, but only the making of them to be approved, which was rather an Indemnity for making them, than a Confirmation of them. Next they remonstrated, that the Kings Legislative Power was quite taken away, by an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Power they desired to be put in the Hands of the Two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and that their Demand about the <hi>Militia</hi> did put the King out of a capacity of Protecting His Subjects. In fine, they complained of the making Propositions without the concurrence of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners; wherefore they remonstrated against the Bills, and resolved to follow the Commissioners, whom the Two Houses were to send to <hi>Wight,</hi> and protest against these Bills; upon which divers Papers passed betwixt the Two Houses and them.</p>

Without this Assistance we are absolutely unable to serve Your Majesty; and although Doctor <hi>Goff</hi> shewed us Your unwillingness to allow of that Clause concerning the Covenant, yet we should but abuse Your Majesty if we gave You the least hopes that <hi>Scotland</hi> would be engaged at an easier rate: therefore we again beseech Your Majesty to haste to us Your clear and positive Answer, lest we forfeit our Trust with those that sent us hither, and You (which to us would be more bitter) perish by Delays. Our infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations concerning the Restraint intended to be put upon Your Majesties Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and some of those with You, are still confirmed; therefore Your Majesty would speedily resolve to satisfie <hi>Scotland,</hi> and engage their Power for Your Assistance.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He former Book has given the Reader a just and full Representation of His Majesties Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Danger his Person was in; of the Force put on the Two Houses by the Army, and of the breach of former Treaties with the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation: and now it cannot but be imagined, that such Illegal and Unjust Proceedings must have inflamed the Resentments of all good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and more signally of such who had formerly been carried away in the crowd to act against the Kings Interests, but now seeing how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal the Breach between the King and his People was likely to prove to both, were much concerned to correct all former Errours, and expiate all past Faults by a vigorous appearance for the Kings Rescue out of his Imprisonment. In order to this Design the Duke was not idle in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Dukes endeavours in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> but by all the Art and Diligence he was Master of, did study to rouse up and work upon the Fidelity and Loyalty of that Nation; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting, that now an Occasion was in their Hands to witness to the World the sincerity of their Intentions for their King, when he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so base a Restraint, and Designs were hatching against his Life: Would they now look on and see the King murdered, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> over-awed, the City of <hi>London</hi> oppressed, the whole <hi>English</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:65282:179"/>
Nation enslaved, the Treaties with <hi>Scotland</hi> so unworthily violated, the Covenant and Religion so neglected, and swarms of Sectaries over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run all? Now or never was the time for declaring themselves; and if Duty did not move them, yet the apprehension of their own Danger might provoke them to look to themselves; for did they think to escape the fury of the Sectaries, if they were so tame as to suffer them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in <hi>England</hi>? therefore all Laws Divine and Humane did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to look to themselves, and to those Enemies of theirs. And there was good reason to hope for success, since besides the Blessing of God, which might be expected upon so just and Noble Enterprizes, the People of <hi>England</hi> were groaning under this Usurpation, and would be ready to assist them: and they had reason to expect a welcome from the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the better part of the Two Houses. These things did prevail much on the most of the Nobility and Gentry.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Three Parties in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note>But at this time Three Parties begun to appear in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The one was, of those who would hear of no Proposition for the Kings Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, unless he first gave satisfaction in matters of Religion: and this was made up of the Preachers, and a few of the Nobility, and the Western Counties. Others were for a direct Owning of the Kings Quarrel without any restrictions; and for taking all Persons who had been in Arms for the Kings Service within it. The Earls of <hi>Traquair</hi> and <hi>Calendar</hi> were the chief of these, and many Noblemen were of it, who called themselves the Kings Party: but their Power in the Country was not great. The Duke was as much for that in his thoughts as any of them, but saw it impossible to effectuate the Kings business at that rate; and therefore judged it best to go on in so great a Design by degrees.</p>
               <p>The present Strait was that he first looked to, which was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue of the Kings Person; and he doubted not, if they once got a good Army engaged upon that account, though all were at first clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with many severe Restrictions, yet it would be easy afterwards to carry things that were not to be then spoken of: and this way took with almost the whole Gentry of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners spent much of the month of <hi>Ianuary</hi> at <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners return to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> establishing a good Correspondence with the Kings Friends in <hi>England</hi>: and they had Letters from St. <hi>Germans</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in which the Queen and Prince undertook to make good to them all that had been promised by the King in their Name. And in the Commissions the Prince gave to Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> and others, for Levying of Forces in the North of <hi>England,</hi> he commanded them to receive their Orders from the Earls of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and <hi>Lanerick,</hi> and follow their Commands. Thus having laid down the best Methods they could think of with their Friends in <hi>England,</hi> they set out for <hi>Scotland</hi> about the end of <hi>Ianuary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At their coming to <hi>Scotland</hi> they found a general dissatisfaction with the Kings Message (in <hi>November</hi>) about Religion. And though all the Duke's Friends were ready to have hazarded their Lives for His Majesties Preservation, on these, or on easier terms; yet it was long debated amongst them, what the Consequences might be of engaging in so great a Work, not only without Unanimity, but with the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Church, and most of those who had been of greatest Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and Power during the late Troubles. Wherefore they resolved
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:65282:179"/>
to give very extraordinary Complyances to their Desires, whereby they might either gain their Concurrence, or at least mitigate their Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and determined to go a greater length than otherwise their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties could allow of. But the Church-men, by the insinuations of Mr. <hi>Gillespie</hi> and others, were possessed with an opinion of their bad Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that their Resolutions (if they were blessed with Success) were to overturn all that had been formerly established: and so they resolved not to be satisfied with any Security or Proviso they might grant, believing that nothing they offered was really meant to be kept, and that all they intended was but Cajolery; therefore they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to oppose them with their utmost Zeal and Industry.</p>
               <p>A few dayes after the three Lords returned to <hi>Scotland,</hi> the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letter came to them from His Majesty.</p>

               <p>The Lord Chancellour (though at first the most forward of them all for an Engagement,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lowdon</hi> falls off to the Church-party.</note> yet) was quickly wrought upon to abandon his generous Resolutions; and not only turned over to the violent Church-Party, but some Months after was made do Penance by a solemn Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment in the High-Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for his sinful comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with these unlawful Courses, as they were termed. <hi>Traquair</hi> played his old game a great while with both hands, and studied to make a Reconciliation with some Lords of the Church-party, if by any means they could have been engaged in the Design: and Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> of the Bed-Chamber, who was sent to <hi>Scotland</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> treated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so long with the Heads of the Church-party, whom he thought more powerful in the Country, and so more able to deliver the King; but finding them so backward, without positive Concessions about Religion and the Covenant, he, and the rest of these called the Kings Party, were forced to unite with the Duke and his Friends.</p>
               <p>The first thing was to engage all the Officers of the little Army then standing, which was carried very successfully; and their next care was to fix on one to command. Those who united for engaging in the Kings Quarrel, designed that <hi>David Lesley,</hi> now Lord <hi>Newark,</hi> should command the Army to be raised; and he at first undertook the Service very cordially: but some of the Church-men fell upon him very furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and prevailed so far on others who had a great Ascendant over him, that he being of an easie nature, struck off, and refused the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Whereupon finding it necessary that a Person of Eminence and Integrity should command the Army,<note place="margin">They resolve the Duke should be Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which he oposed much.</note> they resolved on making the Duke General, which he opposed to a high degree; saying, that he was resolved to hazard his Life with the first, yet he would decline all Command, knowing with what Calumnies he had been aspersed, and what Jealousies many had still of him, as if his Designs were for himself, and to the Kings Prejudice. And many yet alive, with whom he lived in the greatest Confidence, know with what earnestness he pressed them to set their eye on some other Person; but there were none to choose fit for the Trust, wherefore it was agreed by them all, that the Charge must be laid on him, to which he submitted with great Aversion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meets in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note>In the beginning of <hi>March</hi> the Parliament sate. Their first trouble was from the Remonstrance, which the Commission of the Kirk sent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Association with Malignants, and of the danger Religion was in; which Paper they intended to have printed, but with much difficulty this was stopped.</p>
               <p>There were Commissioners sent down from the Two Houses (with whom Mr. <hi>Stephen Marshal</hi> came) for Justifying their Proceedings, and keeping a good correspondence with the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the Injuries done by them last Year, yet some of the Clergy, and of the Lords of their Party, were in a very good understanding with them. But first of all the Carriage of the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Commissioners in <hi>England</hi> was approved in Parliament; next,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:65282:180"/>
there was a Committee of Eighteen appointed for preparing business, and to confer with the Commissioners of the Kirk, for giving them satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; which was a long and slow Work.</p>
               <p>On the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Commissioners complained, that they heard there were Designs among some Malignants to seize <hi>Berwick,</hi> which they desired these in <hi>Scotland</hi> would oppose; whereupon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament referred it to the Committee of Eighteen to see to the Security of the Kingdom in that Affair, from which all the Members, who were of the Church-Party, dissented: and against this Vote the Commissioners of the Kirk sent in another Remonstrance, because they knew that Committee was so chosen that they would send Orders for the securing of <hi>Berwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> the Committee of the General Assembly, commonly called the Commission of the Kirk, gave in their large Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per consisting of a long Preamble and Eight Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe first was, That before they went on to a War,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">and find great opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Ministers.</note> 
                  <hi>the Grounds and Causes of it might be well cleared. Secondly, that the alledged Breaches of the Covenant and Treaties might be condescended upon, and Reparation of them first sought. Thirdly, that there might be no such Grounds of War, as might break the Vnion of the two Kingdoms, and disoblige the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians of</hi> England. <hi>Fourthly, that none of the disaffected or Malignant Party might be admitted to Trust, but on the contrary that they should be opposed and suppressed. Fifthly, that the Kings late Concessions might be declared unsatisfactory. Sixthly, that they should engage not to restore His Majesty to the exercise of His Royal Power, till He should by Oath bind Himself and His Successors to consent to Acts of Parliament for confirming the League and Covenant, and settling Presbytery, the Directory, and the Confession of Faith. Seventhly, that none might be trusted, but such as were of known Integrity and good affection to the Cause. Eighthly, that the Church might have the same Interest in carrying on this Engagement, which they had in the Solemn League and Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Demands run in so high a strain, that those of the Church-Party judged, either they would be rejected, and so the Church would pretend somewhat for their breaking with the Parliament; or if they were yielded to, it would so alienate the Hearts of the King, and all His Friends in <hi>England</hi> from them, that they would hate them as much as they did the <hi>English</hi> Parliament or Army. The Committee of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament found the Strait they were in, and saw what an unhappy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it had been to give the Church-men so great an interest in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Affairs. Some were for brisker Courses, and for clapping up in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son all the more turbulent Ministers; but the Duke apprehended great trouble from that, fearing it should raise stirs among the people, which might retard the design of the Kings Delivery, upon which all his thoughts were bent.</p>
               <p>The hazard of intercepting Letters made the Intercourse by them so slow, that the Lords that corresponded with His Majesty had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from him before the beginning of <hi>April</hi>; and then they got that which follows.</p>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I <hi>Have been long silent, and possibly should have been so a little longer, had I not received Your Majesties of the</hi> 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                        <hi>of the last Moneth; but lest I be involved in other mens Guilt, I must first speak and then perish, or do my Duty. Sir, at our first returning to</hi> Scotland, <hi>we met with a general Dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction with what you offered concerning Religion, from the Ministers and their Party; though all I have Interest in would have cheerfully hazarded their Lives for Your Majesties Preservation, upon these or easier terms: but after long Debate upon the Consequences of engaging in so great a Work, not only without Vnanimity, but with the Opposition of the Church, and most of those who have been of greatest Eminence and Power during these late Troubles, this moved us to a willingness for a very extraordinary Compliance with their Desires, providing we might be assured of an Engagemennt. But now when we have gone a greater length than even our Loyalty can allow us, we find that nothing is intended by them, but either a Conjunction with those that seek your Ruine, or at least a dull and stupid Suffering, and enduring of those destructive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions to Religion and Government, which are now designed by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God and Your Majesty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this there was a new Committee of 24 chosen by the Parliament for a Conference with the 12 Commissioners of the Kirk, who had many Meetings with them, and gave them satisfaction to all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, so that all back-doors were shut, and they were ashamed that they had asked no more; wherefore being driven from all their Pretences they fled to the last starting-hole of Jealousie, and said that their Designs were contrary to their Professions. This was a tedious Affair, and cost ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Conferences. In end great Offers were made to satisfie the Church-party, but nothing did prevail; whereupon the Committee drew up a large Declaration of all the Violations of the Covenant and Treaties made by the Two Houses, together with an account of their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, suitable to the Propositions made by the Ministers; only they stood much upon the sixth Article, that seemed most contrary to their Duty to their Sovereign, and it took them up many days; at length they yielded even to that: but for this the Reader is referred to the Declaration printed with the Acts of that Parliament.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Some of <hi>Lane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>'s Letters.</note> 
                  <hi>had I known how to have addressed my Letters; and however this be an uncertain way, yet because possibly it may come to your hands, first, I shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the receipt of yours the of the last Moneth, which I have in part obeyed, and to that end have written to</hi> Ireland, <hi>to those I have interest in; and I am confident that our Army there, will follow our Advice in order to the Kings Service: but our Difficulties here are greater than you can imagine; for the same disloyal spirit that hath governed these years past, is yet so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to obstruct, though I hope they shall not be able to destroy, our Designs of serving the King; and the same Instruments the Devil hath hitherto made
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65282:182"/>
use of, are still the rigid Opposers of all dutiful Motions. Many amongst us pretend to Loyalty, but have such faint Hearts, and love their Fortunes so well, that they dare not act where there is danger: others have both Courage and Affection, but their Ambition will not allow them to act if they be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute; and they have no power of themselves, without a Conjunction with some of greater Eminence than themselves. Thus while we are tearing our selves in pieces through Factions and Self-interests,</hi> perit Saguntum, <hi>our King is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, and may God forget them that do so. But though the Chancellour hath made a foul Defection, and these that pretend Affection to the King are not so united as they ought to be; yet I despair not but that with Gods assistance, in despight of all opposition, we will force an Engagement or perish. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not descend to the Particulars, only this I will assure you, that all you have interest in are intirely right and resolute. Adieu.</hi>

               <p>The next of <hi>Lanerick</hi>'s Letters that are in the Writers hands, was to His Majesty, dated the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1648.</p>

                     <p>OVr last was of the fourth of this Moneth, to be conveyed to you by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Frazer.</hi> In it did we shew you in general, what extraordinary Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we met with here in our Desires to serve You, but some of them we are now got over: for to morrow it will be resolved that the Kingdom shall be presently put in a Posture, and the whole Forces, or such parts of them as shall be appointed, are to be ordered to be ready to march when they shall be required; and while this is doing, we have voted the sending of three Demands to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> having found all the Articles of the Covenant, and divers of the Treaties, highly violated. The first is concerning Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein we are very high and full, knowing it will be refused, and we thereby obliged to resent it: besides, our Design is rather to fix the Denial thereof on them than on Your Majesty. The second is, that Your Majesty may come to some of Your Houses, in or near <hi>London,</hi> with Honour, Freedom, and Safety, where the Parliaments of both Kingdoms may make their Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to Your Majesty for obtaining a well-grounded Peace. The third is, that the present Army under the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> be disbanded, to the end that all the faithful Members of both Houses may with Safety return to attend their Charges, the Parliament may Sit and Vote in Freedom, both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, without their interposition, may make their Addresses to Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and the Settlement of Religion, and a common Peace, be no longer hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred nor obstructed. These Demands are to be sent by a Messenger, who is to have a few days limited him for his Return. We are forced to move by these steps, which certainly will either speedily procure Your Majesties Freedom, or an Engagement. Our Opposition from the Ministers doth still continue; but many, formerly of their Party, are ashamed of their unwillingness to all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and particularly <hi>Balmerino</hi> who is <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s Convert.</p>
                     <p>By the power of Perswasion our Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> hath offered their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to us, which may be of excellent use many ways.</p>
                     <p>Thus, Sir, you have the true Condition of Affairs: but as we proceed (which I confess is in a most horrid dull pace) I shall still presume to give You an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it as a part of our Duty.</p>
                     <p>Great Endeavours are used by some, that we may again send our Desires concerning Religion to Your Majesty; for their zeal will not allow them to hazard their Lives for Your Person, who will (as they say) no sooner be at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, than you will destroy all that they have been doing (with the hazard and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:65282:182"/>
expence of so much Blood and Treasure) for Religion. But this is as yet waved, and forced Concessions (such as certainly those must be while Your Majesty is in Prison) are alledged, can bring but small Security to Religion.</p>

                        <hi>I</hi> Had resolved upon eternal Silence, since I could not but be wrapped in the guilt of others for their disloyal Delays, nor should the receipt of yours of the <hi>10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                        </hi> Instant have invited me to have broke that Resolution, had not this days Proceedings in Parliament revived my languishing Hopes. I shall not mention any thing of my last Dispatch upon Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day by <hi>Fisher;</hi> but this day we have past in Parliament the great Act of putting this Kingdom into a posture of Defence, under pretence whereof we mean to raise our Army: the Colonels and Committees of War in several Counties are to be named on <hi>Friday</hi> next. Besides this we have presented to the Parliament a large Declaration to be emitted to the Kingdom, containing the Breaches of Covenant and Treaties, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which upon them we mean to make to the Houses, and our Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in case of a Refusal. I confess it is clogged with many Impertinencies, to which we are necessitated for satisfying nice Consciences; yet it drives at a right end. <hi>Argyle</hi> and the Minsters are still uncapable of Satisfaction, and with horrid violence oppose all Loyal Motions: and though the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour hath intirely deserted us, and not only joyned with them, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by all means imaginable to divide us among our selves; yet we are both fixed to our Principles and Friendships, so that in despight both of Apostacy and Knavery we carry on the Work. I confess it is neither in so quick nor so prudent a way as is fit, and that we have already lost our greatest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; yet we can never move so late, but that we will make our selves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable. We hear there are strong endeavours to separate His Majesty from our Interests: I confess we deserve no better from him, yet possibly he may find it not unfit to own us, even though we do not him as we ought. This I swear, I urge more out of my Duty to Him, than kindness to our selves.</p>

We have made an indifferent good progress in our Parliament here, for we have stated all the Breaches of Covenant and Treaties: we have resolved upon some Demands to be sent to the Houses of Parliament, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for His Majesty, and for Disbanding of the present Army of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries; and we have pressed a Declaration, containing the Grounds of our Resolutions. In order to all these, we likewise Voted the present put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Kingdom into a posture of War, and this Week we are to nominate and make choice of all the Officers of our Army. The Church doth still violently oppose us, and threatens us with cross Declarations, if not the extremity of Church-Censures. <hi>Argyle</hi> and his Party maintain them in their Obstinacy, or rather they do him in his Disloyalty: but neither the fear of their Curses, nor want of their Prayers can fright us from our Duty, so soon as we are ready to act, which possibly may be sooner than you imagine.</p>

                        </hi> of the next Moneth; which is the time limited for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of our Messenger from <hi>London,</hi> who this day parts from hence with the three Demands to the Houses of Parliament, wherof my last made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with a positive Command to stay only <hi>15</hi> days for his Answer. We intend likewise in the beginning of the next Week to dispatch Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Fleming</hi> to the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Prince,</hi> to give them an account of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and to know his Highness's Resolution concerning his coming hither, and to desire the present sending of Arms and Ammunition to us, whereof we are absolutely unprovided; so that if the <hi>Queen</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> (to whom we beg Your Majesty would write) do not supply us, it will infinitely retard the Service. We have passed a Declaration, which is full of many rude Restrictions both in order to Your Majesty, and Your faithful Servants.</p>
                     <p>But we are forced to them for the satisfaction of the Nice Consciences of the Clergy, and their Proselytes, whom we find still so inflexible, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can perswade them to a Conjunction with us in the Work; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we meet with all imaginable Opposition from them: yet as we have carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Declaration and all that is yet done, against their strongest Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; so we hope, in despight of them, to be Instruments in accomplishing the chief end it drives at, which is Your Majesties Rest and Restauration. Our next will certainly bring you the Knowledg of some Acting in order to that which we dare not hazard to this Cypher, lest there may be more Copies of it than what we have with Your Majesty.</p>

               <p>The slowness of their Motions in <hi>Scotland</hi> begun to give great Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies of their Proceedings every-where.<note place="margin">Jealousies of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Proceedings.</note>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> was much courted to go to <hi>Ireland,</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved rather to go to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and designed to go first to <hi>Holland.</hi> Yet there were some about him, who studied to give him ill Impressions of all that passed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> grounding them on the old Calumnies that had been cast on the Duke, and on the slowness of their Procedure at that time in <hi>Scotland,</hi> together with the extraordinary Cajolery they gave the Church-party: all which were made use of for alienating his Highness from that Resolution. But he resolved to obey the Kings Commands, and sent them new Assurances of that by Sir <hi>William Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>; and to oblige the Duke the more, a Book being dedicated to his Highness, containing some passages much to the Dukes dishonour, he refused to accept of it, and ordered it to be called in.</p>
               <p>While things were thus preparing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> His Majesty in the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> was contriving an Escape, being resolved if it succeeded to have come to <hi>Scotland</hi>; but the means failed oftener than once, which being discovered made his Prison the straiter. He was also courted under hand with new Propositions from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> but refused to enter into any Treaty without the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation. Yet it troubled him much to hear no more of the progress of their Designs, on which all his Hopes were then set; for in that disorderly time, it was not easy to transmit fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65282:183"/>
and clear accounts of all that passed. At length having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood from <hi>Scotland</hi> what advance was made in that Affair, he was satisfied with the Fidelity of those he had imployed there.</p>
               <p>At <hi>London</hi> there went various Constructions on the <hi>Scotish</hi> Actions. The Commissioners of the Two Houses that were at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> wrote up, that the Church-party would undoubtedly keep the Duke and his Party in play at least that Year, and that the zeal of the Ministers would make the Levies go slowly on; they either believing this them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or at least designing that others should do so. At this time there was a great Inclination all over <hi>England</hi> to shake off the Armies Arbitrary Yoke;<note place="margin">Great Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> Stirs were rising in every place. The Duke with his other Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> dealt earnestly with their Correspondents in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to get all kept quiet till they were ready to march, that so there might be an universal Rising at once, which would have undoubtedly divided the Army that was against them into so many Fractions, as might make way for their easier Overthrow. This Design was zealously promoted by many, who saw the great advantage it might produce; but many were too jealous of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Designs, and so did precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their own Ruin. Others apprehended from their Declarations, that the Bondage would be the same, only the Masters changed if they prevailed; and this made the Kings Party resolve rather to perish than receive any help from the <hi>Scots</hi> on these terms. Their slowness made others despair of their Sincerity, and the reports of the Power of the Church-party, made all suspect their Strength: so the untimely Rising in <hi>England</hi> was the Ruin of this Years Design, for they rose only to be destroyed, and to animate the Army with those many Victories they obtained over them. And as these Defeats did much discourage the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army, so it forced them to march into <hi>England</hi> before they were ready, and e're they had looked well to the Security of Affairs behind them. The first Rising was by <hi>Poyer</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> to whom <hi>Langhorn</hi> came within a little, and Commanded most of the Country.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Westminster,</hi> as they understood the state of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs better than the Rabble did, so they did more apprehend the Danger of it. And first, great pains were taken to reconcile the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Parties, at least to unite them against the <hi>Scots</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they Voted, <hi>that the Government should be by King, Lords, and Commons:</hi> yet the <hi>Independents</hi> opposed this, so that it was carried but by 45 Voices. They also appointed that the Propositions offered at <hi>Newcastle</hi> should be the Grounds of settling the Kingdom, and they Voted that it should be lawful, notwithstanding the <hi>Vote of Non-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses,</hi> to make new Applications to His Majesty. Their Design in this was visible, for they hoped the <hi>Scots</hi> could not pass from these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and they were assured the King would never consent to them, particularly to that of Religion, which was so dear to <hi>Scotland.</hi> But <hi>Cromwel</hi> was not at all pleased with these Votes, and as little with the City: and if the Stirs over <hi>England</hi> had not given him other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, he would have made a Journey to <hi>London</hi> with his Army, for the Purging the House a-new.</p>
               <p>They in <hi>Scotland</hi> were much straitned with want of Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Mony, therefore they sent Sir <hi>William Bellandin</hi> to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to see what could be had from the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi>: they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

Our Armie will be on foot about the end of the Moneth, and that the Raising of men may the more actively be gone about, we have adjourned the Parliament till the first of <hi>June.</hi> We have sent Commissioners with Instructions and Money, to invite our Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> to come and joyn with us in this Service. Our Opposition from <hi>Argyle</hi> and the Ministers is still as great as they can make: we are undone for want of Arms, and a little Money; if we be not supplied from <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> this glorious and most hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Vndertaking that ever this Nation had, may be in hazard to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.

               <p>The Differences that were among the Lords were adjusted,<note place="margin">The Levies are much retarded by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> and most of the Officers were also well named; yet the Levies went on dully, though many of the Lords were so cordial, that they who had
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65282:185"/>
allowance from the Publick but for 80 Horse, raised Regiments of five or six Troops on their own expences. And though it is not to be imagined, that the publick Expence of so great a Design was not likewise great, yet there was a sad want of Money; which the Duke and his Brother did all they could to supply, as far as their Credit could go, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed above two and twenty thousand pounds sterling for prosecuting of the Engagement; and were on all publick occasions so liberal of their own Money, as if some Bank had been put into their hands.</p>
               <p>The Curses the Ministers thundred against all who joyned in this Engagement, made the Souldiers very heartless, being threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with no less than Damnation. This obliged the Lords to use Force in some places, for carrying on their Levies: and indeed the Ministers counter-acting the State was such, that it is hard to judge, whether their Boldness or the Parliaments Patience was most to be wondred at. The Lords resolved to chastise them to purpose in due time, but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the present time improper for it; and to carry on the Levies the better, the Parliament adjourned for three weeks. So the Lords went to the several places of their Interests, leaving a Committee behind them at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; but before their Adjournment they wrote the following Letter to the Presbyteries.</p>

These things certainly cannot be pretended to by any Kirk-man, without a great Vsurpation over the Civil Magistrate, whereof we are confident the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any Iudicatory thereof, will never be guilty, nor fall
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65282:185"/>
into the Episcopal disease of meddling in Civil Affairs; and if any have already in these Particulars exceeded their bounds, we expect the ensuing General Assembly will censure it accordingly, and prevent the vilifying and contemning the Authority of Parliament by any of their Ministers, (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in or out of their Pulpits) who shall offer to stir up the Subjects of this Kingdom to disobey, or deny to give Civil Obedience to their Laws, it being expresly prohibited by the <hi>2</hi> and <hi>5</hi> Acts of King <hi>James</hi> the sixth, his eighth Parliament <hi>Anno 1584.</hi> That none of His Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects under pain of Treason impugne the Authority of Parliament.

They were kindly received by such of the Officers as had chief Power there; but most unwelcome to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Party, who had notice how averse the Kirk, to which they were addicted, had declared themselves from the Designs of that Parliament; nevertheless it was quickly agreed to, that about twelve hundred Horse, and two thousand and one hundred Foot, should be provided and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimented, and transported to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be conducted by Sir <hi>George Monro,</hi> in the quality of a Major-General, and to be joyned with the Dukes Armie.</p>

                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:65282:186"/>At <hi>Westminster</hi> they were in great Confusion, fearing that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclinations over <hi>England</hi> should prove too hard for them: but Mr. <hi>Marshall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Great Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> who was sent back from the <hi>English</hi> Commissioners in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> comforted them the best he could, giving them all assurance that the Designs there would meet with vigorous Opposition: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was moved that some of the Forces might be presently sent down, before the Army were drawn together, who might hope for good Assistance in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But he also told them, that nothing would be so likely to divide them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as to declare for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the Propositions sent to <hi>Newcastle</hi>: and indeed this was much dreaded by the Duke and his Friends, since there was nothing so popular in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as that the Parliament and Army of <hi>England</hi> had fallen from the Covenant; but they resolved, though that were granted, to accept of no Treaty till the Army were presently disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for which the former Years Transactions did furnish them with very good reasons. Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> did what he could to reconcile the Presbyterians and <hi>Independents</hi> in <hi>London</hi>; and that they might not fall out about Religion, it was Voted, that the Kingdom should be first settled before Religion was fallen upon. The City of <hi>London</hi> was generally well-affected to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Design, though some studied to alien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te them from it, by telling them that those in <hi>Scotland</hi> were in Correspondence with the Cavaliers in <hi>England.</hi> The City was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant, and the Citizens feared the Armies falling on them to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, so that they were easily over-awed; and at that time the Agitators of the Army were upon the Fining of the City in a Million of <hi>English</hi> Mony.</p>
               <p>A general Answer was returned to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Demands by the day they had prefixed, with the Promise of a more particular one to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low shortly; which was looked on as a Design to shift them off by Delays. At this time the Two Houses were much lifted up with a Defeat given to <hi>Langhorn</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> which was represented to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than indeed it was. But to allay their Joy, there came in Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from many Counties of <hi>England</hi> for a Personal Treaty with the King, and for being disburdened of the Army: one came from <hi>Essex,</hi> which was subscribed by twenty four thousand Hands; and eight thousand men came out of <hi>Surrey</hi> with their Petition, upon whom the Souldiers fell barbarously, and killed about Twenty of them, wounding above an Hundred. Next the <hi>Kentish</hi> men rose in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable number; but it was more terrible that the Navy was stagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and many of the Captains of the Ships declared against their Proceedings. This was sad News for <hi>London,</hi> by reason of their Trade, which was like to be blockt up. And now <hi>Cromwel,</hi> to please the City of <hi>London,</hi> drew the Forces out of it, and left the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London</hi> in their own Hands; only he got <hi>Skippon,</hi> who was of their own Cabal, made Major-General of their Trained Bands: and there was no small Disorder in the Army, the Agitators being for the most part Levellers, and against <hi>Cromwel,</hi> as was by some supposed.</p>
               <p>With all this Tragical visage of things they at <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> so they appointed a Day of Humiliation; and when they were naming the reasons for the Fast, one of the Members had a singular opinion, that notwithstanding the Self-denying Ordinance they had past, yet they had ingrossed all Places of Power and Profit to

themselves, by which Juggling God was mocked; wherefore he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they might devest themselves of these: but the rest were not of his mind. And if three Sermons and a great many long Prayers would reconcile God to them, they would be at the cost; but were resolved to quit none of their Power nor Places. All these Tumults in <hi>England,</hi> as they had hindered the Two Houses from sending down their Forces to <hi>Scotland</hi>; so they called aloud for hasty Relief from the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army, which from all places was called for. But the Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Clergy and their Party made, had so fore-slowed their Levies, that they could not overtake this fair opportunity; but were forced to leave the poor People in <hi>England</hi> to be knockt down by the insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army.</p>
               <p>The Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> re-assembled in <hi>Iune,</hi>

               <p>But the great matter now debated in <hi>Scotland</hi> was,<note place="margin">A present March is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by some,</note> whether they should first make all sure at home, or leave things in that disordered posture, and make haste into <hi>England. Lanerick</hi> was for taking order with the Opposite Party, and the Lords that headed them, before they stirred out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> lest otherwise assoon as they were gone, the Ministers might blow up the People into Sedition, which would either force them to send back a part of their Army for curbing them, or lose <hi>Scotland</hi> totally by their Tumults, while their Army should be strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with an uncertainty in <hi>England.</hi> Besides, they were neither well-furnished with Arms, Ammunition, nor Mony, but had good Assurances of large Supplies from the Queen and Prince, by Sir <hi>William Fleeming</hi>; and the Prince (though much disswaded by these who were both E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation in General, and the Duke in particular) continued still firm to his first Resolutions of going to them, when all things were brought to that Posture, that it were fit for him to hazard himself amongst them: and therefore in the middle of <hi>Iune,</hi> Sir <hi>William Fleeming</hi> was dispatched again from his Highness to <hi>Scotland</hi> with the following Letter, directed,</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>William Bellandin</hi> met with more Opposition in <hi>Holland,</hi> for Judgments were passed on the <hi>Scotish</hi> Proceedings from their Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and all he could say was not able to take off those Impressions, so that no good was expected from <hi>Scotland.</hi> The States of <hi>Holland</hi> had no great inclination to the Kings Party, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was at that time much influenced by the Dukes Enemies; yet <hi>Bellan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> got many promises made him of a large supply of Mony and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition.</p>
               <p>Upon these Expectations the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> was against a speedy March into <hi>England</hi>;<note place="margin">but much pressed by others.</note> but this was opposed by the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> who pressed a present Dispatch. They were called upon so earnestly from their Friends in <hi>England,</hi> that to linger still was to lose the Kings Party there: for now the <hi>Kentish</hi> men were broken, and some of them had passed over unto <hi>Essex,</hi> where many rose with them, and carried <hi>Colchester,</hi> and made a good Body both of Horse and Foot, but were not able to hold out long against the Army; yet they gave them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers foils. But that of the greatest Importance was, that most of the Navy had declared for the King, and desired a Correspondence with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Willoughby,</hi> who was made Vice-Admiral by the Prince, was a great Friend to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation. The Earl of <hi>Inchequin</hi> also, with his Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> had declared against the Parliament, and sent to <hi>Scotland</hi> a very kind Message for a good Understanding with that Parliament: and finally, a part of the <hi>English</hi> Army, being much sollicited by the Church-party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who complained that they were now exposed by them to Ruin, was coming North-ward, under the Command of <hi>Lambert</hi>; and <hi>Langdale</hi> had written to them, that he could not be able to stand long before <hi>Lambert</hi> if he were not speedily relieved, and that <hi>Carlisle</hi> also would be in great hazard: neither was the hazard only the loss of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> of which they made less account; but the Army which was with <hi>Langdale,</hi> whose Wives and Children were in <hi>Carlisle,</hi> did threaten to leave him and Capitulate if that Place were not preserved. Besides all this, they at <hi>Westminster,</hi> to temper the general Hatred against them, had called back the Secluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of both Houses, and were Levying new Forces, and had Voted a Personal Treaty with the King; at which time also one <hi>Osburn</hi> avouched, that there were Designs against the Kings Person, and that himself had been sollicited to assist in the poysoning him. All these Considerations were pressing, and could admit of no delays; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lauderdale</hi> insisted for a present March, and that the Dukes Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65282:187"/>
might shew it was the Kings Service, and not a Faction, he was designing, nor Resentments against these who withstood him in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: for so did <hi>Lauderdale</hi> mistake <hi>Lanerick</hi>'s advice for curbing of the Church-party, and punishing their Leaders.</p>
               <p>The Duke saw great reason on both sides,<note place="margin">and is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on.</note> and though his own Judgment went along with his Brothers Advice, knowing well it was easie for him to have forced all <hi>Scotland</hi> very soon into a Compliance with their Design; (which being once done, he could have marched into <hi>England</hi> upon greater advantages, and with a far better Army) yet he was content to be over-ruled, believing that if they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous in <hi>England,</hi> upon which depended all their hopes, it would be no great Work to Master any Opposition might be made in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And thus did the unripened forwardness of those in <hi>England</hi> force the Duke on a fatal Precipitation of Counsels. The resolution was taken, and a General Rendezvous appointed to be at <hi>Annan,</hi> near the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>England,</hi> on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this while my Lord <hi>Lanerick</hi> had not forgotten the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands about the Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> but the ill Opinion the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had of them, was such, that to have proceeded roundly in that matter, would have given greater grounds of Jealousie to that Party: therefore the <hi>Iunto</hi> sent him word to the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he was then Prisoner, that though at that time it was not fit to set him at liberty by an Order, yet they were willing he should make his Escape, and they offered their Assistance for conveying him safe away. But he said he was brought thither by Order, and he would not steal out as a Thief: and from this fatal stiffness they could not get him removed, yet they resolved to liberate him openly when they should be better able to avow their Actions.</p>

Some advised a March of the whole Forces, others thought a few Troops were sufficient for dispersing that Multitude; whereupon <hi>Middleton</hi> was commanded out with six Troops, who found them near two thousand strong, Horse and Foot; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill-commanded, they were soon disordered. <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Hurry</hi> gave the Charge, and were briskly encountered; so that they were made to retreat with the loss of some men, and both <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Hurry</hi> got slight Wounds: but the Party that had given them this rude Shock, having cleared a way for themselves, made their Retreat. The report of this Disorder was brought hot to <hi>Calender,</hi> who leaving the

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calander</hi>'s Character.</note>The Lieutenant-General was the Earl of <hi>Calander,</hi> who was bred from his youth a Souldier in the Wars of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> where he long commanded a Regiment of <hi>Scotish</hi> Foot, and had gained (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly) the reputation of a man of great Courage; and understood well the <hi>Dutch</hi> Discipline of War, which he observed with a strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that seemed not free of Affectation. The promptness of his Deportment, and the Authority he usually took on him, being judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far beyond his skill in the Conduct of an Army, he was made Lieutenant-General of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army, that went against the King under General <hi>Lesley, Anno</hi> 1640: and joyned with <hi>Montrose</hi> and the other Noblemen and Gentlemen, who signed the Bond men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the account of that Year: and from that time he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for some Years in a great Friendship with <hi>Montrose,</hi> which as it did alienate the Church-party from him, so it set him at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Duke, of whom he was ready both to receive and give ill Impressions. Yet he having made great and constant Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Loyalty, and having got himself to make a considerable figure among some Noblemen who were called the Kings Party, a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with him being also earnestly recommended by the Queen in her Letters to the Duke, he and some of his Friends (though many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the choice) were easily induced to such an opinion of the Reality of <hi>Calander</hi>'s Loyalty, and Military Conduct and Courage, as to accept of him for Lieutenant-General of the Army, though the Duke had no reason to have any confidence in his Friendship. But as he left
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:65282:188"/>
nothing undone to overcome all Obstacles that lay in the way of this loyal Expedition, so he complied with divers things that were uneasie to him, whereof this was none of the least; because he would leave no ground for Calumny it self to charge him with Slackness in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to do this signal Service to God, the King, and his Country. The Lieutenant-General was quickly observed to design a Faction in the Army for himself, and to oppose all that the General suggested; which he did so peremptorily, that he usually pressed all his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions with such warm Language, as that the Kings Service was ruined, if other Courses were followed: and this never failed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the Duke, and in effect he gave away almost his whole Power to him.</p>
               <p>But if he expected little Friendship from <hi>Calander,</hi> he had as much confidence in <hi>Middleton,</hi> Lieutenant-General of the Horse, who was a Person of great Courage and Honour; and none had been more gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly active in carrying on this Expedition than he was; for which and other Great Services he was by His Majesty that now reigns, created Earl of <hi>Middleton</hi>: nor had he less assurance of <hi>Baylie</hi> Lieutenant-General of the Foot, who had given many signal demonstrations of Valour and Conduct. The Inferiour Officers stood all divided according as their Affections led them, either to the General or Lieutenant-General: and thus was the Army modelled.</p>
               <p>The Regiments were not full, many of them scarce exceeded half their number, and not the fifth man could handle Pike or Musket. The Horse were the best mounted that ever <hi>Scotland</hi> set out, yet most of the Troopers were raw and undisciplined. They had no Artillery, not so much as one Field-piece, very little Ammunition, and very few Horse to carry it; for want of which the Duke stayed often in the Reer of the whole Army, till the Country-men brought in Horses, and then conveyed it with his own Guard of Horse. Thus the precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> forced them on a March before they were in any posture for it: but now they were engaged, and they must go forward, an account whereof follows, but not drawn, as the former Parts of this Work have been, from the Dukes Papers, and little Notes he used to take on all occasions: for if any of these were taken by him in this Expedition, they were either destroyed by himself, or fell into the Enemies hands when he was made Prisoner; so that the Writer was forced to seek help from others for supplying this Defect, and procured divers Relations from very worthy Gentlemen, who were Eye-Witnesses or Actors in the whole Affair, upon whose Informations he must rest, and therefore offers them as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>UPon the Armies march to <hi>Carlisle, Lambert</hi> drew back and we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to <hi>Crofton-Hall,</hi> where we lay about eight or ten days;<note place="margin">The account of the March of the Army.</note> from thence we went towards <hi>Penreith</hi>: but the Duke sent out a Party of some three hundred Horse, who discovered the Enemies Main-Guard of Horse, and gave the General notice of it; who thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the whole Cavalry to march, purposing to fall upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that very night, and he sent orders to <hi>Baylie</hi> to hasten the advance of the Infantry. A full discovery being made of the Enemy, our Cavalry was drawn up in their view, where expecting the advance of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:65282:189"/>
the Foot, we stood in Arms till night; but about midnight the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my drew off quietly. Next morning betimes a great rain falling, we advanced to a Bridge a mile beyond <hi>Penreith,</hi> with design to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Enemy; but missing our hopes, were forced for our acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation in Quartering to return to <hi>Penreith.</hi> Next day my Lord <hi>Levingstoun</hi> commanding a Party of Horse, discovered the Enemies Main-Guard, within a mile of <hi>Appleby-Castle</hi> in <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of about three hundred Horse, of which having sent advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the General, he ordered the Army to march immediately to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Enemy; and <hi>Middleton</hi> commanded the Captain of the Generals Troop to charge, who beat back the Enemies Horse into the Town of <hi>Appleby.</hi> That evening our whole Cavalry made a stand for several hours, expecting the advance of <hi>Langdale,</hi> who being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched up, did presently with his Foot engage with the Enemy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town till it was dark. Our Infantry Quartered that night on the Moor, near <hi>Appleby</hi>; but before the next morning the Enemy marched away both Horse and Foot, leaving only a Garrison in <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleby-Castle</hi>; and did cut the Bridge, so that it was impossible to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for the rains had fallen in such abundance that the Waters were not to be forded: whereupon we went to <hi>Kirby-thure</hi> in <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> where we lay three Weeks, expecting the rest of our Forces, who came up to us, yet far short of the Numbers appointed by the Parliament, of which there was wanting more than a third part; so that in all we were about Ten thousand Foot, and Four thousand Horse. This is the true account of the Strength of our Army. <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> who being our General-Adjutant did often muster the Infantry, avers on his Honour they were no more; and both <hi>Middleton</hi> and <hi>Lockhart</hi> did also assert there were not above Four thousand Horse; so far short was our Number of what was appointed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and generally given out to be the Strength of our Army.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We also waited for the <hi>Irish</hi> Forces, which <hi>Monro</hi> had brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. In the mean while <hi>Langdale</hi> besieged <hi>Appleby,</hi> and lest <hi>Lambert</hi> had faced about, <hi>Turner</hi> was ordered to lie near him with two Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades of Foot till the Castle capitulated, which it did in a very few dayes.</q>

As he stayed at that Village, Sir <hi>Philip Musgrave,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Tilslie,</hi> the one Lieutenant-General, the other Major-General to Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> with two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot then raised in the Northern Counties, joyned him.</q>

                  <q>Upon the day after our Army was thus divided, being the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August, Calender</hi> got some hint of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s joyning <hi>Lambert.</hi> Upon this <hi>Calander</hi> thought it fit to bring the Cavalry nearer the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, intending to go himself that night to the General; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon some Regiments of Horse were drawn into the Moor near <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> and commanded to stay there till further Orders, which late at night they got to return home to their Quarters: then <hi>Calander</hi> went to the General, and <hi>Middleton</hi> stay'd with the Horse, which was the Ruine of the Army; for all judged that <hi>Calander</hi> ought to have brought the Horse with him, since he had reason to apprehend the approach of so powerful an Enemy; yet when he came to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, he spoke nothing to him of the Advertisement he had got.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Next day about Noon we all drew up in Battalia upon the Moor, but had not ground enough: from us the General went and passed the Bridge to view the Field for a convenient Leaguer, and before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urn, <hi>Calander</hi> ordered <hi>Baylie</hi> to pass the Bridge with the Foot, to the place where the Leaguer was to be. The General returning, and thinking to have found the Foot still in the Moor, met <hi>Baylie</hi> on the Bridge, who told him he had received Orders from <hi>Calander</hi> to draw over the whole Body of Foot; but hearing that <hi>Langdale</hi> was hotly engaged with the Enemy, he had halted there, till he saw what the event of the Action might be: which the General approved, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to halt, wishing they had stayed still on the Moor. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while <hi>Calander</hi> came up, and asked why they did not March: <hi>Baylie</hi> gave him the Answer he had given the General, with which <hi>Calander</hi> was unsatisfied, and went away in a chafe. The General seeing him in passion studied to allay it, telling him that <hi>Baylie</hi> had stop'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Order: <hi>Calander</hi> answered, his Grace might do what he pleased,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:65282:190"/>
but he had given former Orders to march, which he conceived most fit to be done, pretending the necessity of having the Horse and Foot on one side of the River, to which the General gave way; and so <hi>Baylie</hi> marched over, and the Duke and <hi>Calander</hi> returned back to the Moor, where the Rere-guard of the Horse, together with two Brigades of Foot, stood all the while. By this time they got sure intelligence, from some Prisoners whom <hi>Langdale</hi> had taken, that the Enemy he engaged with was <hi>Cromwel</hi>; and the General ordered <hi>Turner</hi> to send out commanded Parties to <hi>Langdale</hi>'s Relief, who sent about seven hundred Foot with a good quantity of Ammunition, of which the <hi>English</hi> stood much in need, and were sore put to it, <hi>Cromwel</hi> gaining hedge upon hedge of them. But <hi>Langdale</hi> being over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by the growing numbers of the Enemy, sent to the General for a further Supply, who ordered <hi>Calander</hi> to send it: and he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to do it, yet did nothing. <hi>Langdale</hi> wondering at the delay, sent a second more pressing Message; and Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> shewing the General how necessary it was to send a speedy Supply, lest <hi>Langdale</hi> being beaten back the Enemy should fall in betwixt the Rear-guard of the Horse, and the Foot, who could not be now brought back, the Duke ordered him to draw out an hundred Horse from the Regiments that stood there, and charge with them. But <hi>Calander</hi> coming up, as he was advancing, asked who commanded that Party, and finding it was Sir <hi>Iames Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> who had no Charge in the Army, but rode in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Troop a Volunteer, he ordered the Horse back to their Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and went to the General, complaining that he gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to those who had no Charge, and all this on pretence that the few Regiments which stood there were not to be weakened. But the General shewing him <hi>Langdale</hi>'s extreme Danger, and the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of sending him Relief, <hi>Calander</hi> undertook with a Brigade of Foot to second him, though this could not be performed, the Foot being now so far from us: yet upon that colour he went along the Bridge, ordering his Waggons that lay in <hi>Preston,</hi> to be drawn over to the other side; which being done, he stayed on the other side. Mean while <hi>Langdale</hi> beat back the Enemy two or three Closes, still expecting Relief; but that failing, he was totally routed, and retired disorderly, and fell in betwixt our Infantry and the Moor, where the General stood with the Horse still expecting <hi>Calander</hi>: but now seeing a necessity of joyning himself to his Infantry, he got into the Town of <hi>Preston</hi> with his Guard of Horse, and <hi>Langdale</hi> and other Officers with him, with intention to pass the River below it, which at that time could not be ridden by reason of the Rains which fell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; for all this while there were such deluges of Rains not only over <hi>England,</hi> but over all <hi>Europe,</hi> that every Brook was a River, which made the March very heavy both to Horse and Foot: nor was it possible for the Foot to keep one Musquet fixed, most part of the time we were in a Body in <hi>England</hi>: but the Enemy pursued us fiercely into the Town; whereupon <hi>Turner</hi> endeavoured to rally some of the Musqueteers who had fled, and to line the hedges with them for keeping off the Horse. But the General perceiving they did small Service, did himself charge those who pursued him, being followed by all the Officers and his own Guard, and put two Troops
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65282:191"/>
of the Enemy to a speedy Retreat, and then turned to get to the Ford: but assoon as we turned, the Enemy faced about and turned again on us, and the General charged the second time, and put them again to the flight; but being pursued the third time, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Enemy so home, that he set him a good way off, and they could not soon overtake us. In all which he shewed as much Daring resolution and Courage, as any man could be Master of.</q>

                     </hi> and <hi>Turner</hi> perceiving the Enemies Foot advance, who would have lined the Hedges, and from them fired on us, pressed the General to think rather of retiring to his Army than staying in a Place where all he could do was to give proof of his Personal Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: whereupon he yielding to their Advice, we took the Ford and swimmed over, and got safely to the Place where our Infantry lay, whom <hi>Baylie</hi> had very advantageously drawn up on the top of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Hill, among fensible Inclosures. The Regiments that stood on the Moor were put to the rout by the Enemy, and got off disorderly in Parties. <hi>Calander</hi> Congratulated the Generals safe Escape from so eminent a Danger; who returned him thanks, but passionately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated the bad fortune of that unhappy Day, whose sad effects he said he very much apprehended. Before his Arrival, <hi>Calander</hi> had sent six hundred Musqueteers to maintain the Bridge, which was done without consideration; for they were to march through an open field of a quarter of a miles length, that lay betwixt the Hill we stood on and the Bridge, in which there was no shelter, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies side was all a Descent to the Bridge, that was full of Hedges, from which their Fire-men played uncessantly on our Musqueteers, who could do them no harm again. The General and <hi>Baylie</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this, did by <hi>Calander</hi>'s advice, who saw his Error, send <hi>Turner</hi> with some Musqueteers to make their Retreat, and bring them off; but he met them rather flying than retiring: nor did the Enemy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue eagerly, but divers of our Men were killed, and now <hi>Cromwell</hi> was Master of the Bridge.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This was the issue of that Day wherein our loss was great, many were killed, and many were taken Prisoners, and we lost more who run away; two Brigades of Foot were totally routed, and either killed, taken, or dispersed; nor did we ever hear any more of <hi>Monro,</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> Forces, nor of the Rear-guard of Horse that was on the Moor; so that we begun to look on our selves as broken, being in a Country where we might look for nothing but Unfriendliness and Treachery. Upon this sad Juncture, the General called a <hi>Council</hi> of War of all the chief Officers in the Army: there was one of two things to be done, we were either to wait for the Cavalry, or to march to them. Divers Messages had been sent to <hi>Middleton</hi> to come up with the Horse, yet he appeared not. <hi>Calander</hi> pressed a Retreat, and to him agreed almost all the Officers, except <hi>Baylie</hi> and <hi>Turner,</hi> who urged their staying till <hi>Middleton</hi> came up, which might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in a few hours. The General expressed much indifferency in that Particular, and if they had stayed they could not have forced <hi>Cromwel</hi> to fight, who knowing their wants would have let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone till Hunger had forced them away. So <hi>Calander</hi>'s Authority pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed for a March: the greatest Prejudice thereof was, that they could not carry their Ammunition with them, for the Countrey Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65282:191"/>
whose Horses carried it, had fled away; so that there was a necessity of leaving it behind them. To have fired it would have discovered their March, and so done them Mischief; therefore it was appointed to be blown up by a Train, which being neglected by him to whom it was trusted, it fell into <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s hands next day: all the Souldiers could carry with them was only their Flasks full. Our March was very sad, the way being exceeding deep, the Souldiers both wet, hungry, and weary; and all looked on their business as more than half ruined. The next morning we came to <hi>Wiggan,</hi> and found almost the half of our Foot had fallen off by the way, whom we saw no more. But our Misfortunes grew on us;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Middleton</hi>'s Gallantry.</note> for <hi>Middleton</hi> upon the advice he got, had marched to the Bridge of <hi>Preston</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, where he found the Enemies quiet, our Fires burning, and none by them but some Sutlers; wherefore hearing we were gone to <hi>Wiggan,</hi> he followed our tract, and was hotly pursued all the way by the Enemies Horse, with whom he skirmished all along till he came within a Mile of us: and indeed he made that Retreat, which was seven Miles long, very gallantly, and was well seconded both by Coll. <hi>Lockhart</hi> and Coll. <hi>Hurry,</hi> the last getting a dangerous shot in his Head, which occasioned his being taken Prisoner. The Enemy lost several Men, and among others one Collonel <hi>Thornly,</hi> accounted one of their best Officers. We meeting with our Cavalry drew up in Battalia in the Moor, and some thought of Fighting; but we found it impossible, the Place not being large, and environed with Inclosures, which we could not have maintained long for want of Ammunition. So we were resolved to march all night, and designed for <hi>Warring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>-Bridge, where we hoped we might either maintain the Bridge, or cut it, and so have gone whither they pleased; yet many of us apprehended we might be routed e're we got thither. Marching all night we got a false Alarm, which put us in no small Disorder; and <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Lockhart</hi> labouring to recover us, the one was wounded, and the other was trodden down, to the great danger of his Life: yet no Enemy came in the Rear, for they had taken up their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for that night; but next morning they pursued us, yet we passed <hi>Warrington</hi>-Bridge,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Warrington</hi>-Bridge.</note> the Enemy being close in our Rear. We main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it some time against the Horse, but were driven away from it when the Foot came up. And here <hi>Calander,</hi> and most of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Cavalry, pressed the General to March off, and leave the Foot to Capitulate; their Reasons were strong, they had marched two nights, both under an extraordinary Rain, and in very deep way, and were wet almost up to the middle, and had scarce eat any meat all that while; they had no Ammunition, the Powder in their Flasks being all wet; so that to study to preserve them was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt an impossibility and to lose all. The Horses were also so wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with their long ill March, that they were for no present Action, but they getting off; and turning either back to <hi>Scotland,</hi> or joyning with those who were in Arms for the King in <hi>England,</hi> might still prove useful for His Majesties Service. Upon which the General was moved, though with great reluctancy, to leave the Foot and <hi>Baylie</hi> to Capitulate; and in an account of this Business drawn by <hi>Baylie, which the Writer has seen,</hi> he sayes, <hi>Calander</hi> ordered his Capitulating, and <hi>Middleton</hi> advised it; but says nothing of any Orders he had
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65282:192"/>
from the Duke for it. <hi>Baylie</hi> upon this occasion lost some of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience he was usually Master of; but having recovered himself as much as he could, he sent Major <hi>Fleeming</hi> to <hi>Cromwel</hi> with Articles, who not agreeing to those, desired a Parly with <hi>Baylie</hi> himself: and they met on the Bridge, and agreed that the Infantry should lay down their Arms, and both Officers and Souldiers be Prisoners of War to the Parliament. Here <hi>Cromwel</hi> left <hi>Lambert</hi> with four Brigades of Horse to pursue our Cavalry, and himself marched after <hi>Monro.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>But I shall go through with the Tragedy of our Army before any further account be given of that March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Our Cavalry rode divers miles towards <hi>Westchester,</hi> with intention, as was supposed, to have gone to <hi>Wales</hi>; but putting on another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, we stayed all night at <hi>Malpas</hi> in <hi>Shropshire.</hi> And here it was debated, whether we should go to <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> or to <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> where we had intelligence, that Sir <hi>Henry Lingen</hi> had put himself in a considerable posture for the King: but this being contradicted, that very night vve resolved for <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> designing to try if vve could clear a vvay for our selves to <hi>Scotland.</hi> But next day many of the County Trained-Bands appeared against us, vvho vvere soon dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by <hi>Middleton</hi> vvithout any bloud-shed, and that day vve made a great March, and lodged all night in the Fields; next day vve marched betimes, and at noon made a great halt at <hi>Stone</hi> in <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>

                  <q>After this as vve vvere marching, <hi>Middleton</hi> rode in the Rear, for making it good against some Troops of the County-Militia; but unfortunately his Horse fell under him, and he vvas taken Prisoner. Thus the remnant of our unfortunate Army sustained an irreparable loss by the taking of that brave Man. The rest of that day vve marched to <hi>Vtoxater,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Horse came to <hi>Vto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xater.</hi>
                     </note> and the vveather being rainy, vvindy, and tempestuous, vve came thither in great Disorder. On the next day vve had not marched a mile, when both Horses and Men being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely weary, many of the Officers and Troopers expressed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness to march further, neither were we well-resolved whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go that night; and many surrounded the General in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion next to a Mutiny, desiring he would return to <hi>Vtoxater,</hi> from which he was very averse, and represented to them that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Capitulating with Sword in Hand in an open Field, than to be cooped up in a Town: but both he and <hi>Calander</hi> were forced by their importunity to return to <hi>Vtoxater,</hi> purposing to spend the rest of that day and the next night there, for refreshing Men and Horses, and after that to continue their March. And here <hi>Langdale,</hi> and some of the <hi>English</hi> Officers that were with us, seeing all hopes were gone, and knowing their own Danger if taken with us, left us.

But now our Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes must be compleated by our own Madness, and the Mutiny of our Souldiers,<note place="margin">A Mutiny.</note> among whom it was given out, that the General Officers intended an Escape from them, though they had often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested that they should never leave them, but live and dye with
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65282:192"/>
them. The Souldiers set double and treble Sentinels, both about the General's, and Lieutenant-General's Lodgings, and other chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; all which was done in the sight of the <hi>Stafford</hi>-Trumpeter. Next morning assoon as we could see, Collonel <hi>Turner</hi> by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's Order called out at the Window to them, and asked if they were not ashamed of the ignominy of that Action, and of the base and unworthy Usage they had offered their General, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt they had shown to all Discipline. He advised them, if for no other reason, yet for their own Safety, to return to their Duty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their Guards, go home to their Lodgings, and refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; which they instantly did, cursing those who set them on to mutiny, but named none. <hi>Calander</hi> protested he would hear of no Treaty, but prepared to be gone, with all who would follow him, who were at least half our number. The General pressed his Stay, that a joynt-Course might be followed, at least that night, and that he would not divide the Forces; and the next day they should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther March, Fight, or Treat, as should be agreed on in a Council of War, where he might freely deliver his mind. But all was in vain, for he marched away with as many as had good Horses to follow him, who quickly dispersed themselves; and <hi>Calander</hi> got secretly to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and from that to <hi>Holland,</hi> so that his Escape proved more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate than any Officers (of the Army) was.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now we concluded it impossible to return in a Body to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the County-Militia was every-where rising, our Horses were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and our Troopers both heartless and disposed to mutiny; so that we all told the General, there was a necessity of Capitulating, for though we might possibly have cleared a way for our selves, through those who then surrounded us; yet in every part of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> we would find a fresh Enemy before us, and it was impossible to cut out our way through all these Difficulties: to which, seeing it was unavoidable, the General yielded, and on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> sent three Collonels, <hi>Lockhart, Foules,</hi> and <hi>Turner,</hi> to Capitulate with the Governour of <hi>Stafford,</hi> who had environed us with about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men. They Treated in a House three Miles from <hi>Vtoxater,</hi> where <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> had been long kept Prisoner; they found those they treated with no Enemies to Monarchy, &amp; so they had reason to expect good Conditions from them: but that Treaty was interrupted by a Message from <hi>Lambert,</hi> who was now advanced ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near <hi>Vtoxater,</hi> and sent them word that if they would Treat it must be with him, which was no good News to our Collonels. Yet they went to him, and found him very discreet; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Lilburn, Hains,</hi> and <hi>Manwaring</hi> to Treat. They demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of us the delivery of <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Carlisle</hi>; and undertook if we would engage to deliver those Places, we should not only be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go back to <hi>Scotland,</hi> but conveyed thither. Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners answered, they had only Warrant to Treat about the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and those with him, and had no power to Treat about those Places: so our Commissioners were sent to know the Generals Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure about <hi>Berwick,</hi> and <hi>Carlisle,</hi> who answered, he neither could nor would engage for the performance of what was not in his power, since in that condition he was in, he had no reason to expect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Orders from the Deputy-Governours; adding, that he
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65282:193"/>
did not set that value on himself, or his Liberty, as for the Procuring of it, to do any thing might so far prejudice the Kings Service, as the Delivery of these Towns would do; whereupon he dismissed the Collonels with some very sad expressions. During this Treaty the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Grobie</hi> came towards <hi>Vtoxater,</hi> to whom the General sent Collonel <hi>Ker</hi> to tell him, he was in Treaty with <hi>Lambert</hi>; and those who were appointed to Treat, agreed on the following Articles.</q>

                  <hi>Lambert</hi> desired them to sign the Articles quickly, and he would go to <hi>Vtoxater</hi> to save the Duke from <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Grobie</hi>'s Men: but before he came they had fallen in, not regarding the Treaty nor the Cessation of Arms, and had taken the Duke; yet <hi>Lambert</hi> would not look on him as a Prisoner till the Articles were signed, which he ratified, and disclaimed <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Grobie</hi>'s taking him, as done in time of Treaty and Cessation, against the Law of War and Nations: neither was the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> empowered by the Parliament, so that <hi>Lambert</hi> having Authority from them, they were obliged by his Treaty and Articles. The Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65282:193"/>
were also signed, though not sent back, some time before <hi>Grey</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self came up.</p>
               <p>The Duke was carried to <hi>Derby,</hi> from that to <hi>Longhburrough,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke in Prison,</note> from that to <hi>Leicester,</hi> and from that on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> to <hi>Ashby de la Zouch,</hi> where he continued Prisoner till the beginning of <hi>December</hi> that he was carried to <hi>Windsor.</hi> He was kept under strict Guards, and in a close Restraint, not being permitted to go without the Castle, and but seldome to walk in the Court; for the second night after he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he was taking a turn in the Court after Supper, he had not walked half an hour, when a Serjeant came and commanded him to his Chamber, though many Souldiers were looking on: he immediately went to his Apartment, and said to the Lord <hi>Bargany,</hi> who was Prisoner with him, that the Serjeants carriage was a notable instance of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of worldly Greatness, and the instability of mans Condition in this Life; since he, who but a few days ago commanded so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, was now himself commanded by a private Serjeant.<note place="margin">and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers nothing.</note> Soon after his Imprisonment the Parliament sent two of their number, and <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> waiting on them, to examine him in order to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering those in <hi>England,</hi> who had confederated and corresponded with him in this Engagement: but the Examination held not long, for they could draw nothing from him, and found none of their Arts could prevail (though they spared neither Promises nor Threatnings) to make him think of redeeming either Life or Liberty at so base a rate, his Honour and Conscience being much dearer to him. He told them, he could not say he knew any thing worth their pains, but if he did, nothing, no not Torture it self, should ever draw it from him.</p>
               <p>Thus ended that Expedition,<note place="margin">The Censures passed on the Engagement.</note> the miscarriage whereof occasioned much Censure and Reproach; but those who did impartially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the whole progress of that Army, ceased to wonder, when they saw the ruin of a raw, undisciplined Army, which without either Artillery or Ammunition sufficient, was precipitated by an over-hasty March into an Enemies Country, harassed and wearied with a sad March, in such bad vveather and vvay, and encountered by so strong an Enemy; vvho as he had a vvell-disciplined and trained Army, so he had the vvhole Country on his side: and vvhere-ever any censura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miscarriage vvas to be fastened all that vvere impartial did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the Duke free of blame, except for yielding too much to other more experienced Souldiers, vvho upon every inclination he expressed of differing from their Counsels, told him he vvas ruining the Kings Service. And just observers, vvhen they considered hovv little care he expressed for preserving himself, and hovv much for preserving the Army, hovv ready he vvas to hazard his ovvn Person, hovv he vvould not abandon the broken Remainders of his Army, but stayed and run the same Fortune vvith them, vvhen others vvere more careful of their ovvn Preservation; hovv he vvould not preserve himself at the rate of delivering up <hi>Berwick</hi> or <hi>Carlisle,</hi> judging those Places of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance for His Majesties Service than his Liberty could be, or the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of that handful vvas vvith him; and in fine, hovv he abhorred so mean a thought as the ransoming himself by betraying others vvith vvhom he had corresponded; did very much condemn the too great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardness of some in believing those base Reports which vvere spread of his betraying that Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:65282:194"/>But in <hi>Scotland</hi> things changed no less strangely. The Clergy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Armies March, continued animating the People into an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the Engagement: but the Committee of Estates secured the Peace of the Kingdom, by some Troops they kept in suspected places, and seemed to connive at many things, which they resolved to punish to purpose when they had a good account of their Army. About the end of <hi>Iuly</hi> Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> came to <hi>Scotland</hi> from the Queen and Prince, with full assurances of their Friendship and Kindness to them, and told them that the Prince was ready to come assoon as he were sent for, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to send to him to <hi>Holland</hi> whither he was then going; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> was sent by the Committee of Estates to invite his Highness to come and Command their Army,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lauderdale</hi> is sent to bring the Prince to Command the Army.</note> giving him the Publick Faith of the Kingdom for his Honour, Freedom, and Safety, both during his stay with them, and for liberty to leave them when he would. He was also to desire his Highness would land at <hi>Berwick,</hi> and for satisfying the People as much as could be, that he would bring none with him who were hateful to the Nation, and would, as the King had always done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> conform himself to their Forms of Religious Worship.</p>
               <p>On the fifth of <hi>August</hi> he set sayl first for <hi>Yarmouth-Road,</hi> where he heard the Prince was with the Fleet, but that being contradicted, he held his Course for <hi>Holland</hi>; and as he was sayling into the <hi>Brill</hi> the Pilots Boat assured him, that his Highness was gone from thence, but he knew not whither: wherefore seeing a Man of War, who as they told him, belonged to the Prince, he turned his Course, and followed him, but he could not overtake him. At last a Frigat of the Prince's came a-stern of him, and told him he was in the <hi>Downs</hi>; so he sailed on with the Frigat, and came to the <hi>Downs</hi> on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> where he found his Highness, and Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> with some others of the Nobility, and of his Council, and a very good Fleet of about eighteen sail, commanded by the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> as Vice-admiral. His Highness gave him a very kind Reception, and expressed a great sense of the Loyalty and Duty of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation; all that were about him were likewise very well-affected to that Nation. The Prince called the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> to his Council, where he appointed him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Message, which he did; and the Prince after a days conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, gave him a very Gracious Answer to every particular, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to go quickly to <hi>Berwick,</hi> and from that to make all the haste he could to the Army; but he was first to go to <hi>Holland,</hi> where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to stay some few days. The Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> had got Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from <hi>Scotland</hi> to go to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the <hi>States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> to give them an account of their Affairs, and to crave their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in Money, Arms, Ammunition, and Shipping; to see also what Money could be borrowed upon the Publick Faith of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the prosecuting the Engagement, and to desire from them the three <hi>Scotish</hi> Regiments that were then in the <hi>States</hi> Service, and to settle a firm Alliance with them: and from them he was to go to <hi>France,</hi> with Letters to the Queen, and to treat with the Queen Mother of <hi>France</hi> for the Assistance of that Nation, according to the ancient Alliances between the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> All these Instructions being communicated to his Highness, he judged the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment might be of good use, but would not let the Earl of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65282:194"/>
                  <hi>Lauderdale</hi> leave him, intending to carry him with him to <hi>Holland,</hi> and was very well pleased that Sir <hi>Robert Murray</hi> was appointed to go to <hi>France,</hi> in case the other went not: yet he resolved to carry him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long likewise to <hi>Holland.</hi> Upon which the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> sent advertisement to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to make ready for his Highness Reception. This was done on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> and as the Prince was making ready, the sad news of the Defeat of the Army was brought him: so that Design vanished.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Scotland</hi> the news of the routing of the Army was received by the opposite Party, with all the insultings of Joy, they adding infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous opprobries to their Invectives. Some observing that the Division of the Duke's Army, which was its Ruin, was on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>August,</hi> the day in which the Covenant was first made, which from thence some used to call <hi>Saint Covenants day</hi>; this Conjuncture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs was held a visible Declaration of Gods Displeasure, (for their breaking the Covenant and their Juggling in it,) by those who took upon them to expound all Gods Providences. The Western Counties were commanded, and animated to an Insurrection by the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour and the Earl of <hi>Eglinton,</hi> together with their Ministers, who came leading out whole Parishes with such Arms as could be had, and when these failed, with Staves, and Pitch-forks, and Sythes.</p>
               <p>When the Resolutions for raising an Army were taken in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, divers of the Nobility did dissent from them,<note place="margin">An Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> the chief of whom were <hi>Lowdon,</hi> who was then Lord Chancellour, and <hi>Argyle:</hi> and now <hi>Lowdon</hi> upon the notice of the misfortune in <hi>England,</hi> gave out Orders for raising the Western Counties, and all others who would zealously own the Covenant against the late Engagement. Those that were raised were at first commanded by the Earl of <hi>Eglinton,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Argyle</hi> made all the haste he could to come down with his <hi>Highlanders</hi>: the Earl of <hi>Cassilis</hi> was slowest with his men, for though he had dissented from the Engagement, yet he was long unsatisfied with the Tumultariness of the Insurrection, but after some times consulting about it, he came up to them at <hi>Linlithgow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, together with the sad account of Affairs from <hi>England,</hi> did not a little disorder the Committee of Estates, who as they drew a few Troops that were kept in the Country for their Guard nearer them, so were not well resolved what to do. They looked on the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness as desperate by the ruin of the Army in <hi>England</hi>;<note place="margin">Many in the Committee of Estates incline to yield to them.</note> and though it was easie to scatter the confused Bodies were coming from the West, yet they apprehended, that certainly they finding their own weakness, would call for the Assistance of the <hi>English</hi> Army, before which they knew they could not stand. Most of the Committee were men of good Estates, who apprehending certain ruin to their Fortunes, were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to see to their own Preservation the best way they could. Others were much addicted to the Ministers, and though they had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the Service, notwithstanding the opposition of the Clergy; yet now that they knew they were resolved to excommunicate all who were for the Engagement, their hearts failed them. Many of the Ministers did also represent to them, and some of their Friends, that their Designs being blasted by God, why should they fight any longer against him? and assured them, that if they would lay down Arms, and accommodate matters without Blood, all should go well; that they
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65282:195"/>
would all own the Kings Quarrel, according to the Covenant: but if on the other hand they persisted in their opposition to the Church, the <hi>English</hi> Army would be called in, which would undoubtedly destroy both the Country and them. These things prevailed with most of the Committee of Estates.</p>
               <p>But the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> opposed all these Resolutions, judging it base and dishonourable to treat with those Rebels, and abandon so good a Cause because of a Misfortune. He thought it therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to recall Sir <hi>George Monro</hi> with his Forces, and secure themselves of <hi>Sterlin</hi> and <hi>St. Iohnstoun,</hi> and then to raise all the North, by which they might gather a new Army; and the time of the Year told them, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> durst not stay long in these Parts: so that upon his going to <hi>London</hi> they might make themselves Masters of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and force a new Army into <hi>England</hi> the next Year. Yet in this he was almost alone, and many of the Committee of Estates plied him hard, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with one Argument, that if more Bloud were shed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> their Enemies would undoubtedly revenge themselves on his Brother; and then all the World would say his Ambition to succeed him, had made him contribute to his Ruin. But on the other hand the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and their Adherents gave great Assurances, that they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Brother's Liberty, if matters were packt up. This being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly pressed on him, he yielded to be passive, and let them be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and so after some days Debate they resolved to prosecute the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement no more, and to pack up the business if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: therefore they sent the Lords of <hi>Lee</hi> and <hi>Humby</hi> to the Western Forces, (who were come in their March the length of <hi>Hamilton</hi>) to see what their Demands were, and to propose a Cessation in order to a Treaty; they also sent Orders to Sir <hi>George Monro</hi> to return to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But here I shall stop a little, to give account of the motions of his Army in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The account of the <hi>Irish</hi> Army.</note>
                  <hi>Musgrave</hi> had got intelligence that <hi>Cromwel</hi> with his Army was upon his March to stop the Duke's progress, and had advanced the length of <hi>Skipton-Castle</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire</hi>; which Advertisement was instantly dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Duke at <hi>Preston,</hi> and a small Party of about forty Horse was sent under the Command of one <hi>Galbreath,</hi> to examin the truth of these Reports; who returned with this Account, That having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed their Party within a Hedge near that Place, some of them came to a House of their acquaintance, from which they sent a Servant to <hi>Skipton,</hi> who brought them assurance of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s being there with an Army of about ten thousand men, and that he had commanded those of that Garrison excepting a few, to be ready to march with him next day.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George Monro</hi> being thus informed, sent Advertisement to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> by divers Messengers of both Sexes; but neither did this Intelligence, nor any sent before, ever come to the Duke's Army, which is attested by many Persons of Honour then in Command there; and indeed those of the Army rested wholly on <hi>Langdale</hi>'s Intelligence. But <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> considering that <hi>Skipton</hi> was equally distant from <hi>Kirbie Lumsdale</hi> where he lay, and <hi>Preston,</hi> judged that <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s first Design was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; which upon, and in pursuance of the Duke's Orders, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired softly upon the way towards <hi>Appleby</hi> about fourteen miles back: but the second day, having notice that <hi>Cromwel</hi> had taken the road to
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65282:195"/>
                  <hi>Preston,</hi> he returned to his former Station, where he kept both Horse and Foot night and day in readiness.</p>
               <p>Two days after that towards the morning, a small Party of Horse sent out from the Watch upon the <hi>Preston</hi>-road, were unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly ala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>med with the noise of Horse-feet, as it were at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; but those were presently discovered to be the scattered Troops of the Duke's Army. Some of them were Officers of Foot, who as they declared, were Commanded out from <hi>Preston</hi> to the assistance of Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> whilst he and <hi>Cromwel</hi> were engaged in a Hedge-sight: but before they were able to give him relief, <hi>Cromwel</hi> had forced them to retire, and had got in after Sir <hi>Marmaduke</hi> betwixt them and the Town, and so had separated them from the Duke's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. There were also some Troops of Horse who were the Rear-guard, of whom mention was made in the account of the business of <hi>Preston,</hi> in all about twelve hundred, belonging to divers Regiments of Horse: they were earnestly sollicited by Sir <hi>George Monro,</hi> to stay with him till they should hear what had become of the Duke and his Army. But they objected their Men and Horses were very weary, and that there was a great want of Horse-shoes amongst them; and so excused themselves, and said they should only go to some of the nearest Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, where they might be refreshed: but they went straight to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> through <hi>Westmoreland</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> spoiling and plundering all these Counties as they past; which made great out-crying, and was charged upon the Forces Commanded by Sir <hi>George Monro,</hi> (who not long after followed them,) but very unjustly.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Kirbie-Lumsdale</hi> Sir <hi>George Monro</hi> and the Gentlemen who were with him stayed a few days, to learn the certainty of the Duke's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the reports whereof changed hourly: but fearing the worst of the Duke, and the danger of being surprized, they retired to <hi>Kirbie-Steven</hi>; and getting no certain advertisements of the Duke or his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, thought it fit to send for advice to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to be still draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing North-ward through <hi>Northumberland.</hi> When they came to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth,</hi> Collonel <hi>Hamilton,</hi> General of the Artillery, came to them from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> with Orders from the Committee of Estates to take <hi>New-castle,</hi> or at least to fortifie themselves where they were, and attend the Duke's coming, whose Army they still judged to be safe, and that it was like he would return through <hi>Yorkshire</hi>: but they got soon after that the certainty that the Duke's Army was wholly lost, and that <hi>Cromwel</hi> with a great part of his Army was on his March to fall upon them. Upon this they took their way for <hi>Berwick,</hi> and met new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from <hi>Scotland,</hi> giving notice of a great <hi>Insurrection</hi> in the West, and thereupon requiring them with all possible speed to hasten to <hi>Cockburns-path,</hi> where the Committee of Estates was to meet them. They also ordered them to suffer none of the <hi>English</hi> Forces to come to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with them, which was executed at <hi>Berwick</hi>; great Complaints being made by the <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen of that inhumane Usage. Upon the way from <hi>Berwick,</hi> it was told Sir <hi>George,</hi> that he had need to look to himself, and those with him, since the Committee of Estates, even after they had called for him to their assistance, and were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by the multitudes of Armed men drawing from the West towards <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to fly to him for Safety; yet had passed an Act not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the Engagement any further, and that they had entred already
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65282:196"/>
upon a Treaty with the other Party, and had imployed the Lords of <hi>Lee</hi> and <hi>Humby</hi> to go to them with Propositions. He reflecting on these News, and the Orders he had received not to let any of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Nation cross <hi>Tweed,</hi>

He lay a night or two there, and got Orders to march to <hi>Hadingtown,</hi> where the Earls of <hi>Crawford, Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn,</hi> and <hi>Lanerick</hi> met him, who had got together some of the scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Troops belonging to the Regiments that had left the Duke at <hi>Preston.</hi> And at <hi>Gladesmoor,</hi> all the Forces were put in Order, which upon Rendezvous were above three thousand Horse, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot; from thence they advanced to <hi>Musselburgh,</hi> near which a Party of seven or eight hundred Horse of the Western Army were come from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to view the fields. They, upon discovery of the March of the Forces from <hi>Gladesmoor,</hi> retired, leaving a Troop at the Bridge, who at the approach of sixteen Horsemen run away in all haste, and so escaped with the loss of some few that were taken Prisoners.</p>
               <p>These Earls lodged that night at <hi>Inneresk,</hi> and agreed next day to march by <hi>Edinburgh</hi> upon the South-side, to shun the danger and Straits of the way by <hi>Leith,</hi> which was beset by that new Army from the West, though <hi>Monro</hi> offered with his Forces to clear the way to them; but the greatest part of the Committee were resolved not to engage in blood. The Western Army was now some way modelled, and Commanded by the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> as General, <hi>David Lesly</hi> as Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General, and <hi>Robert Montgomery</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Brown,</hi> as Major-Generals. Some of the Ministers were earnest for fighting, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but their Enemies would fly before them; but the Military men understood well enough their own weakness, and therefore would not engage. All this while the Lords of <hi>Lee</hi> and <hi>Humby</hi> were very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, posting night and day betwixt those in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Estates, to mediate an Accommodation betwixt both Parties, but hitherto without any effect.</p>
               <p>The Committee of Estates took their way by <hi>Pentland</hi>-hills, where they lay that night: next day they did march by <hi>Collingtown</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storphen,</hi> and so towards <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> purposing to hinder the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of some new additions of Forces from the West, led by the Lords of <hi>Cassilis, Kirkubright,</hi> and <hi>Argyle</hi>: as also to fix themselves at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> as a secure place, and convenient for maintaining their Army, and for raising the whole Country on the north of <hi>Forth,</hi> or fighting if occasion should offer.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Linlithgow</hi> the Earl of <hi>Cassilis,</hi> with about four or five hundred Horse, was almost surprized; but by the darkness of the night he escaped towards <hi>Burroughstownness,</hi> and the <hi>Queens-ferry,</hi> and so to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lieutenant-General <hi>Lesley</hi> with his new Army followed upon the others Rear near <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> but was loth to engage, having little Confidence in his Men, although he was hard pressed to it, for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger <hi>Argyle</hi> might fall into at <hi>Sterlin</hi>; and Sir <hi>George Monro</hi> would willingly have turned upon him, but that he was earnest once to be at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where he hoped to fall upon <hi>Argyle</hi> and his Party, and therefore hasted forward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:65282:196"/>At <hi>Larbour</hi> he was assured that <hi>Argyle</hi> with about sixty Horse, and a thousand Foot all <hi>Highlanders,</hi> was in the Town of <hi>Sterlin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">and fell on <hi>Argyle</hi> at <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi>
                  </note> keeping a Committee, and treating with the Castle (wherein was the Kings Garrison commanded by <hi>Norman Levingstoun</hi>) for a Surrender; upon that Sir <hi>George</hi> hasted on with the Cavalry, commanding the Foot to follow in order as fast as they could, which they did at a good pace. A Gentleman coming from <hi>Sterlin</hi> met Sir <hi>George</hi> about <hi>St. Ninians,</hi> and told him that the <hi>Barras-port</hi> was shut and manned, and that he must pass through the Park, round about the Castle, to gain the Bridge, and prevent <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Flight: and as he came near the Castle, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour displayed the Kings Colours upon the Walls, and caused the Cannon to play upon the Bridge, where he perceived some of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s People withdrawing. The difficulties Sir <hi>George</hi> met with in opening the Park-Gate, and breaking down some Stone-walls to make a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for the Horse, gave time to the Marquis of <hi>Argyle</hi> to get himself and his Troopers mounted. They pass'd the Bridge in haste, a very little before Sir <hi>George,</hi> who with five Horsemen pursued them a good way: the <hi>Highlanders</hi> marching close together, to pass after their Lord, were assaulted by the first Troop that came up after Sir <hi>George</hi>: they made some sort of confused resistance, but were instantly trod down, and scattered, and forced to call for Quarter; about a hundred were killed and drowned attempting to swim the River, the rest ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Prisoners, being betwixt eight or nine hundred.</p>
               <p>Upon this Orders were dispatched from the Committee of Estates for raising all the sensible men in the Northern Shires, to joyn with those at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and <hi>Lanerick</hi> went to <hi>Perthshire</hi> to invite the Nobility to joyn. Upon which the Lord <hi>Ogilvy</hi> and the Lord <hi>Drummond</hi> came with some Propositions to the Committee of Estates; yet all means were essayed to bring the Matter to a Treaty. The Earls of <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>Glencairn</hi> had drawn the Earl of <hi>Buckleugh,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Douglas</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Blair,</hi> two leading Ministers, from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conference with them, where <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>Glencairn</hi> moved, that the Committee sitting at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> might come and reside there for perfecting of the Treaty, whilst their Forces should continue at <hi>Sterlin</hi>;<note place="margin">A Treaty is pursued.</note> which was flatly denied them.</p>
               <p>Here the Ministers were very earnest with these Lords, that matters might be accomodated. The Lords moved, That nothing might be done to derogate from the Authority of Parliament, and Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Estates; That the Officers and Souldiers then in Arms by their Authority, might be provided for and entertained; That at least, if there was no further use for their Service, the Articles agreed to by the Parliament for these Forces that came from <hi>Ireland,</hi> might be duly kept to them, and that some consideration might be given to the rest of the Forces that were to be disbanded; That none who had entred into that Engagement might be questioned for it, but enjoy still their Offices, Honours, and Fortunes, and other Civil Places; That an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Course might be agreed on for the Relief of their Friends, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Prisoners in <hi>England</hi>; and finally, That the Committee might sit with Freedom in the ordinary Place, and by advice of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of the dangers of Religion, of his Majesty and his Posterity, and and of the Peace and Safety of his Kingdomes, that so by joynt advice such ways might be taken as would best secure Religion, preserve
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65282:197"/>
his Majesty and his Posterity, and quiet the Distempers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>The Ministers on the other hand proposed That all Armies, whether in the Fields or in the Garrisons of <hi>Berwick</hi> or <hi>Carlisle,</hi> should be presently disbanded; That the securing the Interest of Religion might be referred to the General Assembly, or their Commissioners, and all Civil Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Determination of a Parliament to be speedily called; That in the mean time there should be a Committee of Estates, in which none should be admitted that had concurred in the late Engagement: but withall they gave them good assurances, both for the Prisoners in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> and for themselves, that no Prejudice should follow on any for their accession to the Engagement; and when the Earl of <hi>Glencairn</hi> said, perhaps nothing would be kept of all that should be agreed to; Mr. <hi>Douglas</hi> answered, that if but a tittle of the Agreement were broken, all the Pulpits in <hi>Scotland</hi> should declare against it.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Argyle,</hi> having escaped from these who pursued him, was joyned to the Western Forces, commonly called <hi>Whiggamores</hi>; and he being irritated with what befell him at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> was for severer Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods. They resolved to invite the <hi>English</hi> Army to their Assistance, to which <hi>Cromwel</hi> was not backward, both that he might recover <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and destroy all the Kings Friends. The <hi>Whiggamores</hi> did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so know well how averse the Committee of Estates were from Engaging into Action, and that they intended to make Peace on any terms: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they grew high in their Propositions, and at <hi>Sterlin</hi> the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was much divided; for most of the Committee of Estates were for a Treaty, and most of the Officers of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Forces were Capitulating for themselves.</p>
               <p>The chief Arguments proposed to perswade the necessity of this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were the improbability, if not impossibility, of resistance if <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> should joyn the Enemy, who had already invited him to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> by a Message sent him to <hi>Berwick</hi> by <hi>Argyle, Elcho,</hi> and other two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, which they doubted not but he would accept; The fear this Conjunction would beget in the Country would hinder their Rising, and drive their Army either to a want of Subsistence, or to destroy their Friends, and turn them Malecontents first, and then Enemies: but above all, some pretended the fitness of preserving the Kings Friends and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers to a better opportunity for his Service, which they hoped would quickly offer it self.</p>
               <p>It was objected against the Treaty, That the Relief of their Prince from such a cruel Captivity, was a just cause; That they had Law and Authority upon their side, and so ought not to be diffident of success, or fearful that lawless Rebellion, how strong soever, should prosper; That their <hi>Enemies</hi> joyning with <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Army of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> would make them the more hated, and quickly discover that it was not Religion and Reformation they intended, as they always gave out, but that they sought the Government and Worldly ends, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many of both Nations would fall from them; That the Kings Safety, and the Preservation of their Friends then Prisoners in <hi>England,</hi> depended much upon them, and their Continuing in Arms; That they were bound to continue in their Duty, and wait for what Change God would bring about, and that suppose good Conditions were granted, what assurance could be given for the performance of them? Those who
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:65282:197"/>
opposed the Treaty were the Earl of <hi>Lanerick,</hi> and most of the <hi>Irish</hi> Officers. In end <hi>Lanerick</hi> was prevailed with to give way to it, which he did not only then declare was against his Heart, and done meerly to prevent a Rupture that had otherwise followed among themselves; but he continued to his Death condemning it, whatever seeming colours of reason might be given for it. The Officers of the Army brought from <hi>Ireland,</hi> seeing they would be infallibly ruined if they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Authority of the Committee of Estates, were likewise for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to give way to a Treaty; so the following Articles were agreed on and sent to the <hi>Whiggamores.</hi>

                     <p>WE have considered the Desires of the Officers and Souldiers at <hi>Sterlin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Answer sent to these offers.</hi>
                        </note> and do return this Answer:</p>
                     <p>That the Imputation of neglecting all Duties to Religion, and to the King, mentioned in the Preface to the Articles, cannot be charged upon us, who have never been wanting in the use of all lawful Means to prosecute the Ends of our <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant;</hi> but upon those who join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the prosecution of the late unlawful Engagement against our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Nation of <hi>England,</hi> which hath been destructive to all those Ends.</p>
                     <p>Touching the first Article we refer you to the Answer given in our former Papers; and do here again declare, that we shall not challenge any of your number for their Lives and Estates, but shall endeavour to secure them so far as we can, without approbation of their Actions, or breach of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Treaties. And for that which concerns Exemption from Church-Censures, we cannot meddle therein without breach of Covenant, but must refer you to the Iudicatories of the Kirk, to whom you may make your own Address, and receive Answer.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the second and third Article, we refer you to the Answer given by our Commissioners to the Commissioners on your side, which was, that we held it unreasonable that they should desire any thing from us, or any other who adhere to us, for satisfaction of their Officers and Souldiers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we will not involve our Selves in any thing which may import any accession to the late Engagement, or may be the ground of a Quarrel to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> against this Kingdom: but if they had real inclinations to Peace, they and their Adherents, might without our accession thereunto take course a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves for giving satisfaction to their Officers and Souldiers; and therefore we did desire, and do now again renew the same, that all their Forces, and the Forces of those who adhere unto them, may be disbanded betwixt this and the <hi>25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,</hi> at furthest the <hi>28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,</hi> of this Month <hi>September,</hi> and that none of them be found together after that time, in Troops, Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or Regiments; and we shall betwixt this and the said day disband all our Forces, and none of them after that time shall be found in Troops, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies or Regiments; for the punctual observance whereof on both sides mutual Pledges are to be given, and further we cannot say in answer to these Articles.</p>
                     <p>If you shall not agree to the Desires made in our last Paper of the <hi>16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                        </hi> of this Instant, and not rest satisfied with these Answers, but shall continue in Arms to the disturbance of the Peace of this Kingdom, and persist in the Causes in the which you are now engaged, contrary to the Declaration of the General Assembly and their Commissioners;</p>
                     <p>We do hereby certifie you, that all who have been Active in the late En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, as well those in <hi>England,</hi> as those in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and all such as have or shall hereafter joyn with you, are to be declared Enemies to both Kingdoms, and that this Kingdom will be necessitated to concur with the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> for punishing them accordingly as breakers of the Covenant and Treaties.</p>
                     <p>We leave it to you seriously to consider, whether the Ways and Courses you are upon be really for the good of the King and this Kingdom, or a safe way for the relief of your Friends that are Prisoners in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:65282:198"/>After some dayes treating upon the Heads wherein they differed, the Treaty was finished upon the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> those at <hi>Sterlin</hi> yielding to the Propositions made by the <hi>Whiggamors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was agreed that the <hi>Irish</hi> Army should be suffered to march to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and should have free Passage thither; that none should be questioned for what was past; only that all who had been in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, should lay down their Offices and places of Trust, and not be permitted to sit in any Judicatory, and that all Publick Matters should be referred to the Determination of the Parliament, and the General Assembly.</p>
               <p>It was very soon after the closing of the Treaty remarked, how small regard was had to it; for the Troops being once dissipated, and those who were to go to <hi>Ireland,</hi> being on their March thither, there came News that the Garrisons of <hi>Carrick-Fergus, Belfast,</hi> and <hi>Culrain,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Command of Major-General <hi>Robert Monro,</hi> were basely betrayed under Trust by his own Officers, and Countrey-men, into the hands of General <hi>Monk</hi> for the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being spread about, the people of the West Countrey fell upon those who were returning to <hi>Ireland,</hi> plundered, abused, and dispersed them in their way betwixt <hi>Glasgow</hi> and <hi>Air</hi>: and after a few days a Proclamation was issued out at <hi>Edinbourgh,</hi> commanding all persons, who had been in the Army, designed by the name of the unlawful Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to remove at least twelve Miles from Town under pain of Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, <hi>Cromwell</hi> being on his way thither.</p>
               <p>And thus ended the design of the Engagement, gallantly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and well contrived, but unfortunately and fatally brought to nothing. The <hi>Whiggamors</hi> having now possessed themselves of the Power, their Leaders did constitute themselves into a Committee of Estates, for hitherto they had acted in no Legal Character. There were divers among them, who were by Authority of Parliament commissionated to be of the Committee of Estates, but with this express Provision, that they should not be capable of Sitting there till they had owned the Resolutions and Declarations of the Parliament; for divers of those who dissented, were named to be of the Committee, that so there might be a fair way for bringing them off from their Opposition. But now all these without regarding that Provision, pretended they were a <hi>Quorum</hi> of the Committee of Estates, and that so they were warranted by Authority of Parliament to Act in that Supreme Authority. They sent a Message to the King in their usual style, and were very careful to give no Umbrage to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>; and so not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained <hi>Cromwell</hi> with all the expressions of Friendship and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence imaginable, delivering <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Carlisle</hi> to him, but sent Commissioners with the following Instructions to the Two Houses.</p>

them with our Proceedings in opposition to the late unlawful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and what Industry was used on the other part, for the Election of Malignants to be Members of Parliament, and how unlawfully some were admitted to sit in Parliament; and great numbers of Malignants were brought in from</hi> England, <hi>to over-awe the honest Party, and how many of the Army were corrupted.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And you shall further represent particularly the great Sufferings and Oppressions of honest men, and that before they heard any thing of the Defeat of the Forces under Duke</hi> Hamilton <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved on the manner and time of their Rising in Arms here in this Kingdom, against the Promoters and Abettors of that Engagement, and their Adherents. You shall also shew them the result of the Treaty betwixt us and those Armies about</hi> Sterlin, <hi>and how useful their Forces have been to us by being at so near a distance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You shall endeavour to take away all Mis-information or Mis-constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of any of our former Proceedings, and settle a good Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt them and the honest protesting Party in</hi> Scotland: <hi>and you shall show them the continued evil Principles, Malice, and Designs of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Party in this Kingdom, yet to trouble our Peace and interrupt theirs, and as they call it, not to live and outlive the not carrying on so pious and loyal an Engagement: and that some of them are going to</hi> Holland <hi>with an intention, as we are informed, to bring over Forces if they can: therefore we have caused deliver</hi> Berwick <hi>to be disposed of for the Good of both Kingdoms, and given the like Warrant for</hi> Carlisle; <hi>and that it is also surrendred, or presently to surrender for the use foresaid. So we agree during these Troubles, until the Peace of this Kingdom be settled, that the Honourable Houses may keep some Forces upon the Borders, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Garrisons in them both, upon a twofold assurance: First, that in case any new Troubles be raised in</hi> Scotland <hi>by the Malignants, both they and the Forces about</hi> Newcastle <hi>have Directions from the Parliament to come unto</hi> Scotland, <hi>to pursue the Common Enemy when they shall be desired by the Committee of Estates, as it is now constituted of the Protesting Party in</hi> Scotland: <hi>and Secondly, that the Parliament shall remove all Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons out of those two Towns, and from our Borders, and put them in the Condition agreed on by the Treaties betwixt both Kingdoms, whensoever the Troubles are at an end, and the Peace of the Kingdoms settled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You shall shew how desirous and willing we are to harken to any good Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that may conduce to prevent any such-like Breaches again betwixt the Two Nations, and that it may not be in the power of Malignants again ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to seduce, or to enforce upon the People the like Sin and Snare; and for mutual Consultation, we think it expedient, both that they should have some honest Noblemen, Commissioners, here to reside at</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>and that we shall have some at</hi> London, <hi>that by Commutation of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, our Common Peace may be the better settled and continued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You shall try if the Treaty betwixt the Kings Majesty and the Two Houses of Parliament be like to take effect, and shall study to preserve the Interest of this Kingdom in the matter of the settling of the Peace of these Kingdoms: and if you shall find there are real Grounds to hope an Agreement betwixt the King and the Two Houses, in respect both Kingdomes are engaged in the same Cause and Covenant, and have been, and still are under the same Dangers, and to the end our Peace may be more durable, you shall endeavour that before any Agreement of Peace

               <head>Anno 1649.</head>
               <p>ON the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> Orders were sent to bring him to <hi>Windsor,</hi> and he came thither the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of that Month. He was lodged in the House of one of the poor Knights of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and kept under strict Guards; yet on the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of that Month, as the King was carried through <hi>Windsor,</hi> he prevailed so far with his Keepers as to permit him to see his Majesty: and as he passed he kneeled down, and with a transport of humble Sorrow kissed his hand, and had only time to say, <hi>My dear Master</hi>; the King embraced him very kindly, and said, <hi>I have been so indeed to you:</hi> but they were parted, and suffered to have no discourse. It may easily be imagined, with what sorrow he followed the King with his eyes as far as he could see him, knowing he was to do so no more: nor did he much regrate his present Trouble or immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Danger, all his thoughts being swallowed up in sorrow at the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his Master's Ruin, which was then no more to be doubted; the Army and House (as it was then modelled, or rather forced) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving avowed their Design against his Person, and thrown off the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise with which they had long mask'd themselves.</p>
               <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had upon the matter condemned the Duke to perpetual Imprisonment,<note place="margin">Much pains is taken to draw discoveries from him, but in vain.</note> by setting an hundred thousand pound sterling for his Ransome, which sum could not be raised by him, at a time when by the Debts he had contracted in the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice his Fortune was fallen so low. <hi>Cromwel</hi> came several times to him, to draw from him some Discoveries of his Correspondents in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and gave him great assurances of Life, Rewards, and Secrecy; but he rejected the Proposition with horrour and disdain, though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated; and apprehending they might get his Brother into their hands, sent him at that time the following Note, which I set down though unfinisht, and written with the Juyce of a Lemmon.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Vnder the power of the Sword, and merciless men, no favour to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, oft examined, but nothing discovered, being ignorant; perhaps you will abide the same Trial, beware if you do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thirtieth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> was that fatal and never-to-be-forgotten Day wherein His Sacred Majesty, after the Pageantry of a Trial, to add the appearance of Justice to so base and barbarous a Murder, was beheaded, to the Amazement of all <hi>Europe,</hi> by an unexampled practice in any Monarchy. But the particulars of his Royal Constancy and Christian Patience, being so punctually related by others, I shall not stand to repeat what is already known: but having proposed to my self nothing more in this whole Work, than to let the World see the great Piety and strictness of Conscience that Blessed Prince carried along with him in all his Affairs, and to publish such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of his Pen as had not been formerly seen or known. I shall therefore insert a Copy of Verses written by his Majesty in his Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which a very worthy Gentleman, who had the honour of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him then, and was much trusted by him, Copied out from the Original, who avoucheth it to be a true Copy; but I shall first present that Royal Martyr to the Readers view, in the Posture which was most familiar to Him, and then set down those Verses, in which the mighty sense and the great Piety will be found to be beyond all the finest sublimities of Poetry, which yet are not wanting here.</p>

               <p>The News of that Murder sunk the Duke's thoughts into a deep Sorrow, which he carried with him to his Grave: he well saw his own Danger, knowing that those who had broken all the bonds of Loyalty and Duty, were not to tie themselves to the faith of a Capitulation or Articles, though granted by a person impowered by them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he designed an Escape from <hi>Windsor</hi> that night, which was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his faithful Servant Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> afterwards one of the Kings Quirries, who during his imprisonment had liberty to go and return from <hi>London,</hi> which he did very frequently, bringing him an account of what passed. And the Duke having gained his Keeper, ordered Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> to send a trusty Servant with two Horses to <hi>Windsor,</hi> which accordingly he did; advertising the Duke not to come to the City till seven a Clock in the Morning, and then Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> was to come to him near <hi>London,</hi> and bring him to some secure House in the City; whereupon at night about the time of shutting the Gates,<note place="margin">The Duke makes an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape from <hi>Windsor,</hi>
                  </note> the Duke made his Escape freely out of the Castle, without suspicion, and came to the Place appointed, where his Servant and Horses waited for him. But he fatally went from the Resolutions he had laid down with Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> and would needs go in the night to <hi>Southwark,</hi> thinking to have got to Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s House, who was acquainted with the business; not considering what had been told him of the Guards were about the City all the night, so that there was no coming to it but in the day: and all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to hasten him to his Grave, there was that night a Party of Horse and Foot in <hi>Southwark</hi> searching for Sir <hi>Lewis Dyves,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who had escaped the night before.<note place="margin">but is re-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi>
                  </note> Some of them meeting the Duke in the Streets about four in the morning, where he had long knocked at a door, took him, and examined him: he told them a very formal Story of himself and his business, which at first satisfied them; but they observed, that as he took a pipe of Tobacco by them, he burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several great Papers to fire it; whereupon they searched him, and found such Papers about him as discovered him. It was not before the next morning that he was missed at <hi>Windsor,</hi> for that night he made his Escape there came an Order from <hi>Cromwel</hi> to the Governour of <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> to make him close Prisoner, and put all his Servants from him, who thereupon ordered the Captain of the Guard to go about it; but he hearing the Duke was a-bed, delayed it till next morning, and then found he was gone. It being discovered that Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> had ordered the Duk's Escape, many advised him to go out of the way; but he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved rather to die than to leave his Master at such a time, and made a shift to come at him that same evening. When the Duke saw him, he lifted up his hands, and said, <hi>It was Gods will it should be thus.</hi> That night Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> was also taken, and Sir <hi>Hardress Waller</hi> examined him, but drew nothing from him, whereupon he was made close Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner; yet when the Duke was brought to his Trial he procured his Liberty, for the Averment of some particulars of his Plea.</p>
               <p>The Duke being thus unfortunately retaken, he was committed to Prison at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s,<note place="margin">and is kept in St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s.</note> in the same Room where the Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Owen</hi> were Prisoners, and then all saw in what danger his Life was: whereupon great endeavours were used and strong applications made in <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Marquis of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who had then
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:65282:203"/>
the chief Pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r there, that the Committee of Estates would so far study his Preservation, as to own that what he did was by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Kingdom, that so whatever other Punishment they would lay on him, his Life might not go for it: And it had been faithfully promised by all the Leaders of that Party, at the Pacification at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> either to save his Life, or to make his Death a National Quarrel. But the Marquis of <hi>Argyle</hi> would not interpose,<note place="margin">These who had the power in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> refuse to move for him.</note> and though the Dukes Daughter, the present Dutchess of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> left no means unessayed to prevail on him; yet all was in vain, for he pretended that since those in <hi>England</hi> had murdered their King, notwithstanding their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners protesting against it, it was not to be expected their interpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in other things could be of any weight; nor was it fit they should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more address to the Murderers of their Soveraign. So all hopes of any Mediation that way failed; and not only that, but <hi>Lambert</hi> being prevailed on by the offer of a good Sum, to claim the Duke as his Prisoner, some Letters came from <hi>Scotland</hi> about it, upon which <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was advised not to insist on that Demand. This was vouched to the Writer from several hands, who had it both from <hi>Lambert</hi> himself, and some other considerable men in the Two Houses.</p>
               <p>But now his Majesties Blood not having satisfied the Cruelty of the New Usurpers, their next design was against those who had served him faithfully; and therefore the Duke was brought to his Tryal, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured to be the first of those who followed his Master in that Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>The Usurpers ordained the pretended Court of Justice to proceed against him: so in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> he was brought to a Tryal. It will not be hard to perswade the Reader, without further inquiry, that those who embrued their hands in the Blood of their Soveraign, thereby breaking loose from all Ties Sacred and Humane, could not stand much at the effusion of meaner Blood; no, their Consciences were feared with their former Crime, so that nothing could be so wicked but they were stout enough for attempting it: yet they chose to varnish over their perfidious Cruelty with some Colours and Appearances of Justice; but the Disguise was so thin, that it served them to no other purpose, but to add hypocrisie to their former Villany: which will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear from the following Tryal, drawn partly from the Journal of the Court, and partly from Notes of what passed, taken by some Eye-witnesses. <hi>Steel</hi> and <hi>Cook,</hi> the Counsel for the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> did exhibit on the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> being <hi>Friday,</hi> the following Charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Cambridge <hi>about the</hi> 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>of</hi> July <hi>last, Traiterous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invaded this Nation in a Hostile manner,</hi>

               <p>To this the Duke put in the Declinatour and special Plea following,<note place="margin">The Dukes Plea.</note> intending at last to answer the Charge, if the Plea was not sufficient; having first told the Court, he was better known by another name

Secondly, that he was born in <hi>Scotland</hi> before the Naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Father in <hi>England,</hi> therefore he conceived himself an <hi>Alien,</hi> and not triable in <hi>England.</hi> Thirdly, that he had rendred himself Prisoner upon Capitulation and Articles with those who had Major-General <hi>Lamberts</hi> Commission; and that by these, he was, first, a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner of War; next his Life and the Safety of his Person was secured to him by the Articles, which were signed by the Commissioners of both sides, before he was their Prisoner, and that they could fasten neith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon this the Counsel of the People caused the Act of his Fathers Naturalization to be read, &amp; spake a little to aggravate and set out his Fact; but he desired a convenient time to procure Papers, Witnesses, and other Evidences material to his Plea, which he said was seldom denied to any in that condition; and it was well known to many there, how that since the beginning of this Parliament, many weeks were granted to an Eminent Man upon his Trial (by whom he meant the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who had time allowed him to send to <hi>Ireland.</hi>) The Court adjourned to the next day without giving him any satisfactory Answer. But the Dukes Carriage and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course that day gained much on all the Spectators, being so serene and calm that his very Enemies did applaud it.</p>

                  <hi>Thursday</hi> the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> his Grace being again brought before the Court, declared that their Order being offered to his Counsel, they all found themselves unable to plead for him, or to do what was otherwise fitting, and so had refused to come and speak with him at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s. The Court objected the time they had already granted, and alledged this was a meer delay: but his Grace protested it was true, and offered one of his Servants to attest it. Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> in Court declared, he would not be of his Counsel, by reason of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment under the Parliament. His Grace desired a convenient time as was usual in the like Cases, not only in respect of his Lawyers, but
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:65282:204"/>
that he might send to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and other remote Places for Witnesses, and Evidences, necessary for his Defence; since no prejudice could come by that Delay, and this was denied to none in Tryal for Life, and had been granted to <hi>Mac-Guire</hi> and <hi>Mac-Hun</hi> two <hi>Irish</hi> Men. But for his Counsel the Court Ordained, that any of the Six he should name might be Authorized to advise with him in private, and to speak in Court in the matter of Law arising out of the Fact of the Plea, after the matter of Fact was handled, which his Grace was to maintain next <hi>Saturday.</hi> And for the Time he craved, they said, he looked on the unreasonable time was granted to <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Canterbury,</hi> those grand Offenders, with whom he had been too familiar, as Precedents; but those were Precedents without a Precedent, and none were to expect the like at this time, especially since there were now so many Prisoners to be Tryed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday</hi> the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> His Grace was brought to the Court with some Witnesses, his Counsel being neer, but not present;<note place="margin">The Fifth Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</note> and in order to the Parts of his Plea, he first produced Duplicates of the Commission, and Orders from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> and Committee of Estates there. The Court demanded Evidence for both; his Grace answered, were time granted he would not only sufficiently prove these, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other points belonging to his Justification: but the Court answered, that unless they were presently attested <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> they would not suffer them to be read.<note place="margin">Witnesses ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</note> Whereupon his Grace desired that his Servant Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> might be examined, whose Testimony was accepted, and the Papers he produced were received for Evidences and read. Next, the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion containing the ends of the Engagement was read, and being proved by the same Witness was left in Court with the former Papers. Then the Court upon his Grace's desire produced the Original Articles of Capitulation, which were read; and Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> proved he saw them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to his Grace about nine in the Morning, before the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> came in.</p>
               <p>The L. <hi>Gray</hi> deposed, That two several Summons, which were sent by him to his Grace to yield upon Mercy, were both answered negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in respect of the Cessation and Treaty; That by a Letter from <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> dated <hi>Warrington August</hi> 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, he was enjoined to pursue the <hi>Scotish</hi> Forces with all vigour; That he had received Letters from the <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>-Gentlemen with whom the Cessation begun, intimating that they had condescended to it, on purpose to gain a few days time to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en themselves, in regard the <hi>Scots</hi> were so numerous; and that he dispatched away <hi>Wayte</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> that morning in which the Treaty ended to protest against it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peters</hi> was next examined, and answered, That going that morning to protest, by order from the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> he came accidentally to the Duke, where he found the Hostages in his Chamber, and asked if he was willing to be the Lord <hi>Gray</hi>'s Prisoner, who answered, he could not, in regard of the Treaty; but if he were afterwards to be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of, he had rather be his Lordships Prisoner than any others, being of his acquaintance; That he had seen the Summons, and the negative Answer to them; That this was about five in the Morning; and that <hi>Wayte</hi> and he went apart of the way towards the place of Treaty, where he heard the Articles were concluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lilburn</hi> was next examined, who deposed, That the Articles were

signed by himself, and the other Treaties, about five in the morning, and were to be ratified by the Duke and <hi>Lambert</hi>; and that his own meaning of Preserving the Dukes Life (he knew not how the rest meant) was only to preserve him from the violence of the Souldiers, and not from the Justice of the Parliament. At this <hi>Peters</hi> rose up, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing great dislike of <hi>Lilburn</hi>'s Gloss, saying, that much tenderness was to be used where the Life of so eminent a person was concerned; That he had seen many Articles of War, but had never heard of such ambiguity, and that it was clear by those Articles the Duke held his Life secured, as well from the Parliament as the Souldiers; and wished to God that if their Commissioners had meant otherwise, it had been so expressed in the Articles, it being most necessary that Articles were in a concernment of Life. The President answered, <hi>You say well for the future, but it is now too late.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Grace resumed what had been said, and spoke much on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles for weakening <hi>Lilburn</hi>'s Gloss.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Duke pleads for himself from the Articles granted him.</note>After this the Duke spake a little to all the three Branches of his Plea, reserving the fuller enlarging upon them to his Counsel. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted most on the Articles, which he doubted not were sufficient to protect him; he desired them to consider, how Sacred Articles of War were reputed in all Places, and among all Nations, and how invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably they were kept, all Princes and States being most careful to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them, not only to Strangers, but to Subjects; having great regard to Articles, though only for Quarter, much more when there was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation for Life, adding the following Instances. <hi>Elisha</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet would not suffer the King of <hi>Israel</hi> to kill the <hi>Syrian</hi> Captains, saying, <hi>Wouldst thou smite those whom thou hast taken Captive with thy Sword and thy Bow?</hi> The Blood of <hi>Abner</hi> lay on <hi>Ioab</hi>'s head, who kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one that had the Kings Safe-conduct.

                  </gap> Honour deeply concerned, and had often written to the Parliament to that end: therefore he did not doubt the like Justice would be done him. By this time it was late, and the President ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Monday</hi> next for the Duke to finish his Plea in matter of Fact, ordering his Counsel to be in the Court for their better Information; and so they adjourned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday</hi> the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Duke and his Counsel were brought to the Bar.<note place="margin">The sixth Appearance.</note> Collonel <hi>Wayte</hi> was examined, who deposed, that the Duke rendred himself to be the Lord <hi>Gray</hi>'s Prisoner, and desired <hi>Wayte</hi> to protect him from the Multitude, who thereupon left a Guard at his going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But during his Deposition <hi>Peters</hi> said, <hi>he lies, he lies</hi>; and <hi>Peters, Spencer,</hi> and other Officers who were with <hi>Wayte</hi> at <hi>Vtoxater,</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, did totally falsifie his Deposition. Divers were also that day examined about the place of the Duke's Birth, who all swore, they heard it always said that he was born at <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and that it was not a thing to be doubted of: others were examined about the Signing of the Articles, who all Witnessed, that they were signed long before the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> came; and Major <hi>Blackmore</hi> deponed, that the Duke's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord <hi>Gray</hi>'s Prisoner, was by an Agreement betwixt him and <hi>Lambert,</hi> whose occasions pressed him to go suddenly North-ward.</p>
               <p>After this the Duke spake a little, to shew how little weight was to be laid on <hi>Wayt</hi>'s Testimony, which was so evidently disproved. Next his Counsel asked the Courts Directions, how they should proceed; and the Court answered, that after the matter of Fact was handled, they might plead in Law upon all the parts of the Plea: and they told the Duke by the next <hi>Wednesday</hi> to finish his Evidence.</p>
               <p>He desired a Warrant for bringing some Gentlemen, then Prisoners in <hi>White-hall,</hi> who were his material Witnesses: but the Court adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and promised to consider of that Motion in the Painted Chamber; yet they granted it not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wednesday</hi> the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> the Court sate,<note place="margin">The seventh Appearance.</note> and the Duke was brought to the Bar. Some were interrogated about the time of his Birth, to prove him <hi>post-natus</hi>: but it was not proved, one person only swearing, that he heard him say he was some years younger than the King. Evidence was also brought of his Conjunction with <hi>Langdale,</hi> which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Treason; yet even that was not clearly proved, though it was much laboured. Some Letters of his to <hi>Langdale</hi> had been taken, and were brought into Court: but as the Letters proved no Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, so it did not appear that they were his Letters: only <hi>Peters</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted they were like his hand. Then a Vote of the Two Houses was read, repealing a former Vote of setting an hundred thousand pounds Sterling upon him for Ransome; and proof was brought, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Articles were given, yet some had been forced to take the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:65282:206"/>
Negative Oath, and thereby they studied to evince that the Parliament did not hold themselves bound to stand to Articles.</p>
               <p>After this his Grace resumed the substance of all those Evidences, and shewed that it was not proved he was a <hi>post-natus,</hi> nor that he joyned with Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> who neither received Orders nor the Word from him, but marched and quartered apart; and that though he had done otherwise, it could not be criminal in him, since he had no Orders to the contrary from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but was commanded by them to joyn with all who would concur with him for prosecuting the ends of the Engagement, of which Sir <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduke</hi> approving, he had no reason to refuse Concurrence with him; neither could this be made Treason by the Law of <hi>England</hi>: of all which it seemed the Parliament was once well-satisfied, since by a Vote they had fined him in an hundred thousand pound Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as the price of his Liberty; by which it appeared they look'd not on him as a Traytor, but as an Enemy who had Life granted him by Articles.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Court adjourned till <hi>Thursday</hi> the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel were appointed to plead, and he was to close his Evidence.

                  </gap>ytors, and with this he closed his Evidence: and since he was not to be suffered to speak any more, he enlarged on all the parts of his Plea, and spake at length as follows.</p>
               <p>That he was sent by the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was a free Kingdom,<note place="margin">The Duke pleads large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for himself.</note> and independent on <hi>England</hi>; That he having had his Birth, Honour, and Fortune there, was bound to give obedience to their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; That for himself he had lived much out of business, and was sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Publick Trust in that Kingdom, nor very desirous of any; but that being commanded to undertake the Charge of General, for ends which he conceived lawful, and no way contrary to the Peace or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of <hi>England,</hi> he was obliged to follow their Orders; and that by some Papers emitted by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> against that Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they declared they looked on it as a National Breach, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Scotland</hi> had violated their Leagues and Treaties with them, so that it was no private Act of his; That the entring of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Army into <hi>England Anno</hi> 1640 was accounted no Invasion, nor Treason, but on the contrary was acceptable to this Kingdom, which gave a Brotherly Assistance for it: and that the late unfortunate Army was designed ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for as good Ends, and would have been so looked on had it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered. And for his joyning with Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as was before set down. Therefore he being taken Prisoner in such a War, he conceived it without a Precedent that he should be Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Life, for serving his Native Kingdom in an open War. As for his being an Alien, he referred that to his Counsel, but said it was undeniable he was born in <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor was he proved a <hi>post-natus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:65282:206"/>
he was also born before his Father's Naturalization, and so not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it, and his own Naturalization had been in agitation in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Parliament: That his sitting in Parliament did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him an <hi>English</hi> Earl, for if questioned, he might probably have been expelled out of the House of Peers, as his Countryman Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Stuart</hi> was out of the House of Commons: and that his being an Earl did not naturalize him, that being the King's single Act, where as Naturalization was only by Act of Parliament. As for the Articles, it was clear, that <hi>Lambert</hi> being a General Officer, commissionated by Parliament, was impowered to Capitulate both by the Parliament and by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the L. <hi>Gray</hi> having no Authority from the Parliament, but only from <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Letter: that he became the Lord <hi>Gray</hi>'s Prisoner only by <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Order, and that he made no Surrender till the Articles were signed and delivered: that though the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> had protested against it, (and yet only an intention to do it was proved) he was not concerned in it, nor bound to take notice of it, <hi>Lambert</hi> being the Parliaments Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and sent against him by them. That Articles were to be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their plain meaning, and not by any mental reserves pretended by the Commissioners; That by the first Article, he was a Prisoner of War, and that it was seldom known that the Life of any such was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and that by the second Article, Life and Safety of Person were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly secured without any exception: That if Articles were now vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, it would make the sequel of the Wars, if any more followed, a down-right Butchery, since none would any more trust to a Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Mischief he prayed God to avert. That his Escape out of Prison was no Breach, he being only bound by the Articles to deliver himself Prisoner, which he did, but not to continue so: and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that he was confident, had he no better Plea, his Articles were sufficient, according to the Laws of all Nations to preserve his Life.</p>
               <p>Then the President asked him, if he had any thing to say as he was Earl of <hi>Cambridge:</hi> whereupon he and his Counsel moved, that if what he had said and proved was not satisfactory for the Averment of his Plea, he might answer the Charge exhibited, which he had not yet done. But to this, neither the Court, nor their Counsel would yield, though they gave no reason for it, save only that it implyed a desire of Delay: but the reason, as was said, was, that they knew had they yielded to that the Charge had been overthrown, since the Law of <hi>England</hi> does not admit that to be Treason which they charged on him, that he had assisted the King against the Kingdom and People by levying War. Then the Court told his Counsel, that <hi>Saturday</hi> was the longest time they allowed them for performing their part: but the Counsel answered, that it was impossible for them to undertake it, and discharge their Consciences to their Client, having so short a time allowed them; there being a necessity of searching divers Records for Precedents, which required a competent time, as had been allowed in former cases: but the Court refused to promise it, only they said they would take it into their consideration. The Counsel insisted, and said plainly, they declined the Imployment on those terms, and would be forced to declare it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday</hi> the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the other two Officers that had signed the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for the Duke and his Troops,<note place="margin">The ninth Appearance.</note> who had been sent for a great way off, were examined, who agreed with the former Witnesses in matters
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:65282:207"/>
of Fact, and also with <hi>Lilburn,</hi> that by signing the Articles, they only meant the Duke should be preserved from the Violence of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and not from the Justice of the Parliament. Then the Counsel began to Plead, and all four spoke on the several Heads of the Plea. Mr. <hi>Heron</hi> spoke cursorily and elegantly, but not very materially: Mr. <hi>Parsons,</hi> a young man, spoke boldly, and to good purpose: Mr. <hi>Chute</hi> the <hi>Civilian</hi> spoke learnedly and home: and Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> (since the much-renowned Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench) elaborately and at length. The Heads of their Arguments follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke's Counsel at Law plead for him.</note>The Duke being, as was granted, a born <hi>Scotch-man,</hi> his Tie of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation and subjection to that Kingdom, was indispensable and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble, so that his late Imployment could not be refused when laid on him by the Authority of that Kingdom; no more than a Native of <hi>England,</hi> living in it, can disobey the Commands of this Parliament; whereas any Subjection the Duke owed the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was only acquired, and dispensable: That since no man can be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of two Kingdoms, whatever Tye lay on him to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> it was not to be put in Competition with what he owed <hi>Scotland,</hi> it being a Maxim in Law, that <hi>Major relatio trahit ad se mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> and that <hi>Ius Originis nemo mutare potest:</hi> That there was an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance due to the King and another to the Kingdom, and no Treason could be without a Breach of Faith and Allegeance due to them against whom it was committed, for these Kingdoms were two distinct King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and though the Allegeance due to the King was the same in both Kingdoms, yet that due to the Kingdoms was distinct: nor was the Actual administration of the Kingdoms in the Kings Person when the Duke got his Imployment; therefore, as his Allegeance to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland</hi> was ancienter and stronger than any Tie that lay on him in <hi>England,</hi> so what he did by their Order might well make him an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to this Kingdom, but could not infer Treason. <hi>Yet all this of the Allegeance due to the Kingdom was founded on no Common or Statute Law, as Mr.</hi> Hales <hi>himself confessed afterwards: but he urged this well against those who asserted it, it being the universally received Maxim at that time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That whether he was a <hi>Post-natus,</hi> or <hi>Ante-natus</hi> did not appear: but though he were, it did not vary the Case, nor his obligation to the place of his Nativity; and so though he were <hi>Post-natus,</hi> or accounted a Denizen by his Fathers Naturalization, his Offence could not be Treason, but Hostility at most, and by that supposed Hostility, he could only lose his Priviledge of a Denizen, but could not be made a Traitor, there being no Precedent where ever any man was attainted of Treason for a hostile Invasion, and it was questionable if this Offence could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to that: nor could any case be alledged, where one born in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Independent Kingdome, acting by a Commission from that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and residing there when he received his Commission, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Body of his Army in that Kingdom, and coming into this, in an Open Hostile manner, was ever judged guilty of Treason. Naturalization was intended to be a Benefit, and not a Snare, so that one might well lose it, but was not to be punished for it. And so when <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> were under one Soveraign, divers of both Nations were naturalized in the other; yet when Hostility broke out betwixt them, many so naturalized fought on the side of their Native Kingdom, for which none were put to death, though divers were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:65282:207"/>
Prisoners. And in <hi>Edward</hi> the third's time, though he claimed <hi>France</hi> as his by Right; yet when the Constable of <hi>France</hi> invaded <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and was taken Prisoner, he was not tried, nor put to death, but sent back to <hi>France,</hi> as being a Native of that Kingdom. And when <hi>David Bruce</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> invaded this Kingdom, and was taken Prisoner, great endeavours were used to find a Legal ground for his Trial, he being Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; but this Plea was waved, for it was found that it could not be done justly, that being but a less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Honour, though King <hi>Edward</hi> claimed a kind of Homage from the Crown of <hi>Scotland.</hi> That if the Duke were on that account put to death, it might prove of sad consequence, in case there was War any more betwixt the Kingdoms; since most of the present Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration were <hi>Post-nati,</hi> and all would be so quickly; and yet if the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who was both a <hi>Post-natus,</hi> and had his Honour in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> were commanded to lead an Army thither, and being taken were put to death, it would be thought hard measure. For the Duke's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Naturalization, it was true, by the Statute of the 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made, that Children born without the Kingdom, whose Parents were then in the King's Allegeance, should be Denizens: but the Duke was born before his Father's Naturalization, which can never reach him, none but the Issue after his Father's Naturalization being included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it; and the word <hi>Haeres</hi> in the Act is only a word of Limitation, and not of Creation: nor did his making use of the assistance of some <hi>English</hi> Forces make him a Traytor. It is true, if an <hi>Englishman</hi> conduct a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Army, or if a Foreigner come of his own head, or in a Rebellious way, to assist an <hi>English</hi> Rebellion, it will amount to Treason: for the Act of such an Alien is denominated from the crime of those he assist here, where he owed a local Obedience, which was the Case of <hi>Shirley</hi> the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and of <hi>Lopez</hi>: but if an Alien come with a Foreign Force, though he make use of <hi>English</hi> Auxiliaries, that only infers a Hostility, but no Treason; and was the case of the Lord <hi>Harris</hi> a <hi>Scotchman</hi> 15 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and of <hi>Perkin Warbeck,</hi> both having <hi>English</hi> help: and though <hi>Warbeck</hi> was put to death, it was by no Civil Judicatory, but only by the Will of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, who erected a Court-Marshall for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. The present case was yet clearer, where the Alien had Authority from his Native Kingdom, and was commanded by them to make use of <hi>English</hi> help: so that though <hi>Langdale</hi>'s assisting the Duke did make himself a Traytor, yet the Duke's accepting of it only infers an Act of Hostility. And whereas it was objected, that the Parliament had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by their Act which constituted this Court for his Trial, declared him a Traytor; it was not to be disputed what the Parliament had Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do, but no Parliament had ever done the like before: and the meaning of the Act must be, that he should be tried whether guilty of Treason or not, since if the Parliament have already declared him a Traytor, further Trial was needless. And it was clear, the Parliament by their Act in <hi>Iuly</hi> last, which declared all the <hi>Scots</hi> who entred <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Enemies, considered not the distinction of <hi>Post-nati,</hi> nor judged that inferred Treason, since most of them all were <hi>Post-nati</hi>; That many of the Officers of that Army, who had been taken Prisoners, though clearly <hi>Post-nati,</hi> were ransomed, others banished, others still in Prison; why then should the imputation of Treason be fastned on the Duke when the rest were used only as Enemies?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:65282:208"/>And for the Articles they made it appear, they were the Publick Faith of the Kingdom, when given by persons publickly Authorized, upon the observing of which inviolably, depended the whole Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of all Nations, and their mutual Confidence, which is founded on all States being bound by the Acts of their Publick Ministers; That this was not a pure Rendition, but a Paction concluded upon Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein the Parliament lost nothing, but on the contrary were Gainers; That the Parliament had ratified this upon the matter, by Vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hundred thousand pound Sterling Fine to be the price of the Dukes Liberty; That the secret sence the Treaters pretended was not to be considered; since all Compacts are to be understood according to the clear meaning of the Words, &amp; the universal sense of Mankind, who look on Articles wherein Life is granted as a sufficient Security, not only from the Souldiers, but from the Civil Powers; and that these Treaters, when the Articles were agreed, should have made known their secret mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, otherwise it was not to be regarded: and it was a most dangerous Precedent to admit of collateral Averments of secret meanings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst express words, much more in a Case of Life, and yet much more in Military Agreements, wherein the Concernments of Armies and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were included, and which concerned the Honour and Security of all Souldiers; and for this divers Precedents were cited. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ended thus; That as the Court consisted of Gentlemen &amp; Lawyers, and of Martial men; so the Plea consisting of three Branches, was the more proper for their cognizance, a part of it being drawn from the Law of <hi>England,</hi> another part from the Civil Law, and a Third part from the Martial Law: and if the Plea, in any of the three Branches, was made good (and they doubted not but it would be found so in them all) the Court would be satisfied, there was Reason &amp; Justice for preserving the Dukes life.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Tenth Appearance.</note>The Court adjourned till <hi>Friday</hi> the second of <hi>March,</hi> and the Duke being again brought to the Bar, the Counsel for the People pleaded, but so poorly that all who heard them were asham'd: But they had one advantage, that neither the Duke nor his Counsel were allowed to speak after them, nor to discover their impertinent Allegations, which made the Dukes Counsel obviate all they could imagine they might say, though they said a great deal so far out of the way of Reason, that none could have thought of it; and yet it was so weak that it needed neither be obviated, nor replied to.</p>
               <p>Yet at the end of every Branch of their Pleading, I shall add the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers against them, as they are set down in some Notes taken by the Dukes Counsel.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Counsel for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Duke.</note>They begun with <hi>Alienage,</hi> and studied to make it appear, that though he was a <hi>Scotchman</hi> born, yet he was no Alien, having enjoyed all the Priviledges an <hi>Englishman</hi> was capable of, as being a Peer, a Privy-Councellour, possessing Lands and Inheritances, and Marrying in <hi>England. But Naturalization cannot be but by Act of Parliament, and not by the Kings single Deed; much less by those Priviledges of which any Stranger might participate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next they urged his Fathers Naturalization, and since his Name was not in that Act, as was in other Acts of Naturalization, that proved him to be no Alien, otherwise his Name had been put in. <hi>From that it rather appeared he was an Alien, since others found it necessary to insert their Childrens Names, which his Father not doing, proves the Son an Alien still.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:65282:208"/>They also urged his being <hi>Post-natus,</hi> which must be held true, since he brought no Evidence to the contrary; and it being so, his Tie of subjection was as great in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Scotland</hi>: That Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance was only due to the King, and not to the Kingdom: That there was a King when he entred into <hi>England,</hi> and that though he was secluded from the Government, yet all Writs were issued in his Name, so that this Expedition was a breach of the Allegeance he owed the King. <hi>This was the oddest part of all their Plea, since his Charge was, that he assisted the King against the Kingdom; and now they did plead he owed no Allegeance to the Kingdom, but to the King, whom they had so lately murdered, the Dukes coming with his Army being only to relieve him from the Barbarous Vsage he had met with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They also urged at large, That an <hi>Englishman</hi>'s Children in what place of the World soever they were born, were Denizens of <hi>England,</hi> and cited many Precedents. <hi>But the Mis-application of them was gross and palpable, those being of Persons who were</hi> Englishmen <hi>before their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were born, whereas the Duke's Father was naturalized after he was born: so that he could not communicate that Priviledge to him, which he did indeed transmit to his Children born after his Naturalization.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, they pleaded, that the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> had no power to commissionate him to enter into <hi>England,</hi> and that if some of them were there, they ought likewise to suffer for it, and it was fit he suffered for his Masters, who employed him; That it was pitty the King had not suffered sooner. They also produced many Precedents of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers being condemned as guilty of Treason, for Treasons committed in <hi>England,</hi> as the Queen of <hi>Scots, Lopez, Perkin Warbeck,</hi> the Lord <hi>Harris, Shirley</hi> the Frenchman, and the Spanish Ambassadour. <hi>All this was obviated in the former Argument, where distinction was made betwixt secret Practices, and an open Invasion with a forreign Force.</hi> They added, That <hi>Scotland</hi> belonged to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and so was to be look't on as some of the Counties of <hi>England. But</hi> Scotland <hi>had no subjection to the Crown, but only to the King of</hi> England, <hi>whom they had murdered, and so they had no Power to judge any</hi> Scotchman.</p>
               <p>As for the Articles, they pleaded it was not in the Power of the Army to absolve any from the Justice of the Parliament, which being above them, was not tied to their Articles: and therefore, though they confessed the words ought to have been less ambiguous, yet they said, the Exposition of those who Signed them was to be admitted, since every man was to be the Expounder of his own words; and pleaded some Precedents about the Exposition of ambiguous words. <hi>But the words here were plain and not ambiguous, only a treacherous Equivocation was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to break them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cook</hi> by a strange subtilty said, The Articles only secured his Life during Imprisonment, so that his breaking of Prison, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, put an end to the Obligation of the Articles: <hi>Though he broke not not Prison, but went out at Door and Gate, which was no Crime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus did the Counsel of the People plead against him, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of all who looked on, that they thirsted for his Blood, and were only seeking colours of Justice for it: which yet were so slight that they could serve for no Disguise, but only to abuse those who were blinded with Prejudice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:65282:209"/>The Court adjourned to <hi>Tuesday</hi> being the sixth of <hi>March</hi>: And then the Duke was brought to the Bar, and the Judges sate in Scarlet; they rejected the Dukes Plea in all its Branches,<note place="margin">The last Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, in which Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> and found him guilty of the Charge whereof he was indicted. But before Sentence, <hi>Bradshaw</hi> the President resumed all, and spoke long for aggravating of every particular, justifying every thing their Counsel had pleaded, as if it had been all both good Law and good Reason: then he caused read the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> his Commission, to shew how little Power was given him: <hi>(But spoke nothing of</hi> Fairfax <hi>or</hi> Lambert <hi>their Commissions, which had been more pertinent, but the reason was they were, ampler; and yet the Parliament had never refused to ratifie any Articles</hi> Essex <hi>gave.)</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the Dukes Articles were fuller than any others, therefore he would insist the more to invalidate them. He said, It was true, if there had been a War proclaimed, and prosecuted betwixt a Forreign Nation and Enemy, and <hi>England,</hi> then by the Law of Nations, to which their Law was consonant, Articles signed by the Commissioners of both Parties should have been kept inviolable: but the Prisoner was no Enemy, for when the ordinary Course of Justice was obstructed by the late Kings prevailing Party, so that neither Constables nor She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, nor other Civil Officers, could lay hold on such Delinquents as he was, or bring them to Punishment, the Parliament was forced to raise an Army, Commissionating their Generals to bring such to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign Punishment. This being the end and substance of their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, it was not in their Power, who were but the Sword of Justice in the Parliaments hand, to give Articles for securing any from the Justice of the Parliament, since it was never intended their Acts should limit that Power that gave bounds to them. He added also, that the Court was fully satisfied, that the Duke was naturalized. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident laid out also the Case of the other Prisoners then at the Bar, and spoke many hours; at last Sentence was given against them all, <hi>That their Heads should be severed from their Bodies on</hi> Friday <hi>next being the ninth Instant:</hi> yet it was remitted to the Parliaments Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what Mercy should be shewed to any of them, and so the Duke was carried back.</p>
               <p>The rest of that day, and the next day, the Duke was earnestly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to preserve himself by making Discoveries. And Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> who appeared concerned for him during his Tryal, did now insinuate himself on him to draw somewhat from him: but all was in vain, there being no choice to be made betwixt a Glorious Death, and an Infamous Life.</p>
               <p>On the Eighth of that Month, it being put to the Vote of the House, whether he should be Reprieved or not, it was carried in the Negative.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke prepares for Death.</note>That day the Duke spent in fitting himself for Death by Prayers and Spiritual Conferences, and that he might discharge himself of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cares, he wrote the following Letter to his Brother.</p>

               <p>He did also apprehend, that they might either be hindred to speak their Consciences freely on the Scaffold, or that the noise and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there might make him be ill-heard, or perhaps occasion disorder from the Souldiers, which might provoke Passion or Discomposure; and therefore delivered the following Speech before all in the Room, which his Brother published from the Original he sent him.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>I</hi> Know you that are here to be true and faithful to me, I will therefore in your hearing say somewhat in order to my self,<note place="margin">His Speech before his Death.</note> and to my present Condition, and give you also this Copy of it, which after I am gone may perhaps be thought necessary to be published, as the last Testimony of my Loyalty to my King, for whom I now die, and of my Affection to my Country, for the pursuance of whose pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and loyal Commands I am now to suffer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That my Religion hath always been and still is Orthodox, I am confident no man doubts; I shall not therefore need to say much to that particular, only that I am of the true Reformed Protestant Religion, as it is professed in the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I take God to witness, that I have been constantly a loyal and faithful Subject and Servant to his late Majesty, (in spight of all Malice and Calumny:) I have had the honour, since my Child-hood to attend and be near him, till now of late: and during all that time I observed in him as eminent Virtues, and as little Vice, as in any man I ever knew; and I dare say he never harboured thought of countenancing Popery in any of his Dominions, otherwise than was allowed by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and that among all his Subjects there could not be found a better Protestant than himself; and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also he was free from having any intent to exercise any Tyranny or Absolute Power over his Subjects: and that he hath been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, I rather impute the Cause of it to the sins of his People than to his own.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>For my own part, I do protest never to have swerved from that true Allegeance which was due to him, and that hath constantly been payed (to my Comfort I speak it) to his Progenitors by my Ancestors, for many Ages, without spot or dishonour, and I hope shall be still by my Successors to his Posterity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I do heartily wish well to and pray for his Royal Issue, and shall die a true and loyal Subject to his eldest Son <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, the unquestionable King by right of all his Father's Kingdoms. I hope (though I do not live to see it) that God's Justice and Goodness will in his own time establish him on the Throne of his Father, which I doubt not some of you will see come to pass; and I am confident,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65282:210"/>
till then, and so long as men deeply plung'd in Guilt and Self-interest usurp Power and Government, these Kingdoms will fall short either of Peace, or any other permanent Happiness.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I speak this from my just Affection to the Royal Race, and much Compassion to his Majesties Subjects; but not from any Malice, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or desire of Revenge, against any, for what I have, or am to suffer; for I forgive all men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is well known what Calumnies and Aspersions have been thrown upon me, by men of several Parties and Interests, not excepting those who would seem to carry much Affection to his late Majesty, as if I had expressed Disservice or Disloyalty unto him; the which how malicious and groundless they were, I appeal to God, who with my own Conscience clearly beareth witness of my Innocency therein; and I shall beg Mercy from him, to whom I am now to give an account of all my Thoughts and Actions, as I have still had a faithful and loyal Heart to my Master.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It hath been a General Complaint, that I perswaded His Majesty to pass the Act of continuing this Parliament. I dispute not, whether the doing of it at that time might have been reputed good or bad, but surely it was not I that did perswade it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Neither did I at all deal with His Majesty for his Consent to the Bill of Attainder for taking away the Life of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> whose great Parts and Affection, 'tis known I highly valued: yet some have been pleased to attribute to me the cause of that Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but were His Majesty now living, I am confident he would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly clear me in both these, as He hath been pleased many times in private formerly to do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And truly I am not conscious to my self (though I have been for many years a Privy-Councellour to him) of ever giving him any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that tended to other ends (as I conceived) than the Good and Peace of His Majesty and His Dominions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It hath been rumoured since my last Imprisonment, that I should confess my self to be the greatest Instrument under His Majesty (by making use of his <hi>Scotish</hi> Great Seal) for authorizing the War in <hi>Ireland</hi>: a Report so false and simple, as in my opinion judicious and honest men will not believe it. And truly as I am free from having hand therein in any manner of way, so I am of nothing more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, than that His Majesty was also absolutely free thereof, and that he was not in any case a Causer or Countenancer of those <hi>Irish</hi> Troubles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I have been often examined touching Persons of several qualities within this Kingdom, that (as is supposed) did invite into <hi>England</hi> the late Army from <hi>Scotland,</hi> or promised Assistance after their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and of late much Perswasion hath been used with me to that purpose, as that upon my Discovery thereof depended the only means of my Preservation. I will not say that I had any thing to reveal which would have been satisfactory, but this I desire you to attest to the World, that I have not accused or said any thing that may reflect on any man, of what degree soever, within the Kings Dominions: and indeed it was so contrary to my Conscience, and so deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to my Honour, that if I had been able, yet should I never have prejudiced any in that nature, though it had been to save me a hundred Lives.</q>
               </p>

                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:65282:211"/>
                  <q>Touching that foul and senseless Slander, that I betray'd the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my under my Conduct, the care and pains I then took to prevent the loss of it, and the near approach of my suffering for it, will, I suppose, abundantly contradict this Aspersion. I was satisfied with the Justness and Necessity of that Engagement, upon the grounds of the Declaration of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> fearing then the sad Confusions which have since followed here, both in Church and State; and particularly the fatal Fall of my Master, to the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whose Person I was by Obligation, and Natural Affections as passionately tied, as I could be by Duty and Allegeance.</q>

                  <q>And now I confess, I am void of all rancour or displeasure against any, though I am within few hours to die, adjudged by a lawless and arbitrary Court, of purpose erected (as is said) to destroy my Master and some of his Servants, and for a great pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:65282:211"/>This will more clearly discover the serene and composed Temper he was then in, than can be done by any Testimony of Spectators, who could only see the out-side, which, as many of them have witnessed to the Writer, was very calm and resolute. When he came to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s, three or four Officers were sent from <hi>Cromwel</hi> to him, desiring that he would discover what had been oft askt of him, and he should not only be preserved, but be made a Great man: but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected their Offers, with the same language he had formerly used on the like occasions; and said, if he had as many Lives as hairs in his Head, he would lay them all down rather than redeem them by so base means; which an Ear-witness vouched to the Writer. Then all went to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and they had some excellent good Preachers waiting on them, and praying with them. Some Wine was brought, and they all drunk one to another, and did embrace and kiss each other with much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness.</p>
               <p>The Duke was first led away to the Scaffold: on the way other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers came from <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Continued of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Life if he would make Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but they are rejected.</note> renewing the former Offers if he would make Discoveries; but all to no purpose, he rejecting them with scorn. Those many Offers as they were great temptations, which would have shaken any man whose Soul was not fully at Peace with God, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared for Death; so they discovered the baseness of those mens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. But as malice did ever pursue the Duke with the unjustest Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, so his Enemies, hearing that Messengers came often to him, did strangely misrepresent it, as if he had been even then in some Treaty for his Life. Being come to the Scaffold, the Earl of <hi>Denbigh</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to speak with one of his Servants, and Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> was sent to him: the Duke asked Mr. <hi>Cole</hi> what might the matter be, who answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he judged it was to know what Order he had given about his Children; the Duke answered, he might satisfie him if that were the matter.</p>
               <p>The Duke was during his stay at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s visited sometimes by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Sibbald.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Duke on the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> Him he chose now to accompany him in his last minutes, who encouraged him, <hi>to look to that fountain of the Blood of Christ in which he must be purged from all his Iniquities; the effusion whereof was for the Salvation of all, who by a true and lively Faith rested on him: he was the only Rock on which he was to build his Hopes, and though the waters of</hi> Jordan <hi>did run an impetuous Current, he was the Ark of the Covenant, that was to lead him through them to that sure Refuge, against which neither the Powers on Earth, nor the Gates of Hell could prevail.</hi> He desired him, <hi>to lift up the eyes of firm Confidence to the Crucified Christ, and with St.</hi> Stephen <hi>to behold him sitting at his Father's right hand, ready to receive his Soul:</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>who would be in love with Life, if they could but before-hand consider what it would prove? all being a heap of Cares, Anxieties, and Miseries, with which every rank of Men, and state of Life was beset: it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Happiness to be with much Ioy welcomed, when we found a quick and easie Passage for escaping these swelling Billows, and getting into that blessed harbour of eternal Happiness. We must pass through a Sea, but a Sea of our Saviour's Blood, in which never any Shipwrackt; and through which we are carried by the soft winds of the Divine Spirit, which can scatter all contrary blasts.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:65282:212"/>When the Doctor had thus ended his Discourse, the Duke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a greater silence than he expected, though he had resolved to make no Publick Speech, and therefore had, as was already told, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed himself in private; yet being invited by the Attention he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, he spoke to the People: but as he had not premeditated it, so no Copy of it remains, except what was printed from the Notes of the Hearers, and therefore I shall only set down the Heads of it. <q>He addressed himself to the Sheriff,<note place="margin">The Duke's last Speech.</note> and told him, he judged it not very necessary for him to speak much, his Voice was so weak and low, that few of the crowd that looked on could hear him; nor was he ever so much in love with speaking, or with any thing he had to say, that he took much delight in it: yet since this was his Last, he being by the Divine Providence of Almighty God brought justly to that End for his Sins, he would speak a little to the Sheriff, for his Voice could not reach others. He was now to suffer as a Traytor to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> a Country which he had ever loved equally with his own, not having intended either any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prejudice to it, or to any particular Person in it: his late Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were the Commands of his own Country, which he could not disobey. It is true, it had pleased God so to dispose of the Army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Command that it was ruined, and he for being cloathed with a Commission to be General stood now ready to dye. He would not repeat what he had pleaded for his own Defence, God was just; nor would he say any thing of his Sentence, but that he did willingly submit to Gods Providence, acknowledging that on many accounts he deserved Punishment in this Life as well as in the next, for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed himself a great Sinner: yet for his Comfort he knew there was a God in Heaven who was very merciful, and that his Redeemer did sit at his right Hand; and he was confident that he was media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for him at that very instant, being hopeful through his All suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Merits to be pardoned all his Sins, and to be received into his Mercy, trusting only to the Free Grace of God through Jesus Christ. He declared he had never been tainted in the Religion professed and established in the Land, in which he had been bred from his Infancy: it was not this nor that mode or fancy of Religion that was to be built on, but one that was right, and sure, and came from God.</q> 
                  <hi>Here he observed some taking Notes, and upon that said, he had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that, else he had digested what he had said into a better Method: but desired that what he had said might not be published to his disadvantage, since he had not intended to speak any thing when he came to that place. Then he went on, and said,</hi> 
                  <q>Many dreadful Aspersions had been cast on him, as if his Intentions had not been such as he pretended; but he thanked God, he was unjustly blamed: That for the King, he had ever loved him, both as he was his King, and his Master, with whom he had been bred many years, and had been his domestick Servant; and that there was nothing the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> declared for the King, that was not really intended by himself: and as he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded his Life for him one way, so he now was to lose it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that his Design of leading in the Army to <hi>England</hi> was really that which was published in the Declaration, in so far as concerned the King: he was not then to speak of the rest of the Declaration, which had many other particulars in it. And for
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65282:212"/>
what he said of his Duty to the King there was no reason to suspect him of Flattery, or any other end in saying it, (God having now so disposed of His Majesty) but though he could gain nothing by it, yet he owed the freeing himself of that Calumny to Truth, by which all men shall gain for ever. There had been many Discourses founded on a part of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Declaration, which mentioned an Invitation to come to <hi>England,</hi> upon which he had been much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for discovering the Inviters; but he had, and did still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself to the Declaration, without any other Answer. He was ever willing to serve this Nation in any thing was in his Power, which was known to many worthy Persons in it; and he would still have continued in those Resolutions, had those in whose hands the Power was then, thought fit to have preserved his Life. But since he was to be thence-forth of no more use, all he could do was, to wish the Kingdom Happiness and Peace, and to pray that his Blood might be the last should be shed: and though perhaps he had some reluctancy within himself at his Suffering for this Fact, yet he freely forgave all men, and carried no rancour with him to the Grave; but did submit to the Will of him who created Heaven and Earth, and himself a poor sinful Creature then speaking before him. He conceived it could contribute to no end for him to speak of State-business, of the Government of the Kingdom, or things of that nature; his own Inclinations had been still for Peace, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an ill Instrument betwixt the King and his People, nor had he acted to the prejudice of the Parliament. And as he had not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled much in those Wars, so he was never wanting in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Almighty God for his King's Happiness: and he earnestly prayed God, to direct his Majesty (that now Reigns) that he might do what should tend to his Glory, and the Peace and Happiness of the Kingdoms. He said he was of the Established Religion, which he had professed in his own Country where he was born and bred: but for particular opinions he was not rigid, he knew many godly men had scruples about divers things, wherein he had never concerned himself; nor did Difference of opinion (which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more than at that time) move him, his own was clear. He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord to forgive him his Sins, as he freely forgave even those against whom he had the greatest grounds of Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, remembring that Prayer, <hi>Forgive us our Trespasses, as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them that trespass against us.</hi>
                  </q> And to this purpose he spoke, if the Writers did him right in what was published in his Name: but how true the printed Papers were, the Writer is not able to judge, for he has three printed Relations of it before him, all varying some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what one from another. As he expressed himself thus, he discovered a great composure by his Looks and manner of Expression; and when he was desired to change the Posture he stood in, since the Sun shined full in his Face, he answered pleasantly, <q>No, it would not burn it, and he hoped to see a brighter Sun than that very speedily.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the Duke had done speaking, he called for the Executioner, and desired to know how he should fit his Body for the Blow, and told him his Servants would give him satisfaction. Then he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to his Servants, and commanded them to remember him kindly to divers of his Friends in <hi>England,</hi> particularly to his Mother-in-law
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:65282:213"/>
the Countess of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> to whom he had ever payed a Filial respect, and to the old Countess of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> who as the lived to a great Age, and to the Honour of her Nation, so was on all occasions a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and true Friend to him. He bade tell her, she would no more question his Loyalty, (which she had done sometimes in raillery) since he was now to seal it with his Blood; then he kneeled down, and prayed in these words.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His Prayer.</note>
                  <hi>MOst blessed Lord, I thy poor, and most unworthy Servant come unto thee, presuming in thy infinite Mercy, and the Merits of Iesus Christ who sits upon thy Throne; I come flying from that of Iustice to that of Mercy and Tenderness, for his sake who shed his Blood for Sinners, that he would take Compassion upon me, that he would look upon me as one that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously hears me, that he would look upon me as one that hath Redeemed me, that he would look upon me as one that hath shed his Blood for me, that he would look upon me as one who now calls and hopes to be saved by his all-sufficient Merits: for his sake, Glorious God, have Compassion upon me in the freeness of thy infinite Mercy, that when this sinful Soul of mine shall depart out of this frail Carcase of Clay, I may be carried unto thy everlasting Glory. O Lord, by thy free Grace, and out of thy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mercy, hear me, and look down, and have Compassion upon me; and thou Lord Iesus, thou my Lord, thou my God, and thou my Redeemer, hear me; take pity upon me, O Glorious God, and so deal with my Soul, that by thy precious Merits I may attain to thy Ioy and bliss: O Lord, remember me so miserable and sinful a Creature.

Now, O Lord, it is thy time to hear me, hear me, Gracious Iesus, even for thine own Goodness, Mercy, and Truth. O Glorious God, O blessed Father, O holy Redeemer, O Gracious Comforter, O holy and blessed Trinity, I do render up my Soul into thy hands, and commit it to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of my Redeemer, praising thee for all thy Dispensations, that it hath pleased thee to confer upon me; and even for this, Praise and Honour, and Thanks, be to thee from this time forth and for evermore.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">His Death and Burial.</note>After this, Doctor <hi>Sibbald</hi> entertained him with some pious Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and then the Duke prayed a short Prayer by himself.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus lived and died <hi>IAMES</hi> Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who was born at <hi>Hamilton</hi> the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Birth and Parents.</note> 1606. His Parents were <hi>Iames</hi> Marquis of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and Lady <hi>Anne Cunningham</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Glencairn.</hi> He was of a middle Stature, his Body well-shaped,<note place="margin">His Person and Constitution of Health.</note> and his Limbs propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and straight; in his last years he encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fatness; his Complection and hair were black, but his Countenance was pleasant, and full of Life, and shewed a great Sweetness of Disposition; his Health was regular, suitable to his Diet, and free of sickness or pain, only in his last years he was a little subject to the <hi>Stone.</hi> But when his Body was opened, all his Inwards were found sound and entire, so that had not that fatal stroak brought his days to a too early Period, he might probably have been very long lived.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His Education.</note>At the time of his Fathers coming to Court, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (being then in great favour with King <hi>Iames,</hi> and desiring to strengthen his Family with Noble Alliances) agreed a Marriage betwixt him &amp; the Lady <hi>Mary Feilding,</hi> Daughter to <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Susanna Villiers</hi> Sister to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> upon which his Father sent for him to Court, to be married when he himself was four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age; and the Lady designed for him but seven. This broke off the Course of Studies in which he had been educated till then in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and though he was sent afterwards to the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> yet the interruption, that his stay at Court put to his Education in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was such that he never recovered it. After the years of Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the intended Marriage were come, he was forced to it, not without great Aversion, occasioned partly by the disproportion of their ages, and partly by some other secret Considerations.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His Marriage.</note>He lived with his Lady for some years in no good terms, and that concurring with other Motives, made him leave the Court up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Fathers death: but her excellent qualities did afterwards over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that Aversion into as much Affection as he was capable of; and it was no wonder, for she was a Lady of great and singular worth, and her Person was noble and graceful like the handsome Race of the <hi>Villiers</hi>'s. But to such as knew her well, the vertues of her mind were far more shining. She was educated from a Child in the Court, and esteemed and honoured by all in it, and by
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:65282:214"/>
none more than the late King, who as he was one of the Chastest men (not to say Princes) so he was a perfect honourer of all vertuous Ladies. She was Lady of the Queens Bedchamber, and admitted by her Majesty into an entire Confidence and Friendship; and not only was her Honour unstained, but even her Fame continued untouched with Calumny, she being so strict to the severest Rules, as never to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of those Follies which pass in that style for Gallantry. She was a most affectionate and dutiful Wife, and used to say, <hi>she had the greatest reason to bless God, for having given her such a Husband, whom as she loved perfectly, so she was not ashamed to obey.</hi> But that which crowned all her other Perfections was the deep sense she had of Religion: she lived and died in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and was a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout person. Many years before her death, she was so exact in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her Retirements to her Closet, that notwithstanding all her Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and the Divertisements of the Court, (as the Writer was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by one that lived with her) no day passed over her without bestowing large portions of her time on them, beside her constant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the Chappel. She bore first three Daughters, and then three Sons; her Daughters were Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> and Lady <hi>Susanna</hi>; her Sons were <hi>Charles, Iames,</hi> and <hi>William:</hi> but all her Sons and her eldest Daughter died young.</p>
               <p>A year before she died she languished, which ended in a Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which after a few Moneths sickness she died: so that she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Death timeously.</p>
               <p>About a Moneth before her death she called for her Children, and gave them her last Blessings and Embraces, ordering them to be brought no more near her, lest the sight of them might have kindled too much tenderness in her, which she was then studying to raise above all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted objects, and fix where she was shortly to be admitted.</p>
               <p>She died the tenth of <hi>May</hi> in the year 1638, and left her Lord a most sad and afflicted person: and though his Spirit was too great to sink under any burden, yet all his Life after he remembred her with much tender Affection. She died indeed in a good time for her own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, when her Lord was beginning to engage in the Affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which proved so fatal both to his Quiet and Life.</p>
               <p>But the Distractions of the following years concurring with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Remembrance of his Lady, which rather increased than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with time, kept him from the thoughts of re-engaging in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried life. Neither did the death of his Sons shake him from that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, since he had so noble a Successor secured for his Family in the person of his Brother; and next to him he had two Daughters who were dear to him, far beyond the ordinary rate of Children, on whom he got his Dignity and Fortune entailed, in case his Brother died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sons.</p>
               <p>His Religion was Protestant and Reformed; and as he was a Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Enemy to Popery, so he was no less earnest for a good Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence among all the Reformed Churches,<note place="margin">His Religion.</note> in particular betwixt the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and therefore was a Great Patron and Promoter of the designs of Mr. <hi>Dury,</hi> who bestowed so much of his travel, and so many of his years in driving on that desired Union: for I find by many of <hi>Dury</hi>'s Letters to him, that as he owed a great part of his Subsistence to the Money and Places were procured for him by the Duke, both from
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:65282:215"/>
the King and my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> so his best Addresses to the <hi>Swedish</hi> Court and the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> were those he had from him; and therefore he continued giving him an account of his success, as to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron and Benefactor.</p>
               <p>As for our unhappy Differences which have divided this Island, he judged neither the one nor the other worth the Blood was shed in the Quarrel; and the excess he had seen on both hands cured him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Zealot for either. He was dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>atisfied with the Courses some of the Bishops had followed before the Troubles began, and could not but impute their first Rise to the Provocations had been given by them: but he was no less offended with the violent spirits of most of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; particularly with their opposition to the Royal Authority. As long as the King employed him for the preservation of Episcopacy, he served him faithfully; and though afterwards he pressed him much for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Abolition of that Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was not from any Prejudice himself had at it, but flowed only from the Affection he had to His Majesty, since he saw it could not have been preserved at that time without very visible hazard both to King and Countrey: and so he took the National Covenant at the Kings Command, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641, in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was all his life a great honourer of true Piety where-ever he saw it, notwithstanding any mistakes that might have been mingled with it; so that whatsoever particular ground of Resentments he had at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who (he judged) feared God, the consideration of that did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and stifle it: but his first Imprisonment in the year 1643 was the happiest time of his Life to him, for there he had a truer prospect of all things set before him, which wrought a Change on him discernible by those who knew him best. This made him frequently acknowledge Gods great Goodness to him in that Restraint: for then he learned to despise at the foolish pleasures of Sin, and the debasing vanities of a false World, which had formerly possessed too great a Room in his thoughts. It is true he chose to be Religious in secret, and therefore gave no other vent to it in his Discourse than what he judged himself obliged to, which was chiefly to his Children, to whom he always recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Fear and Love of God, as that wherein himself had found his only Joy and Repose. The following words are a part of one of his Letters to them, which he wrote a little before his last going to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IN all crosses, even of the highest nature, there is no other remedy but Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and with alacrity to submit to the good-will and pleasure of our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Creator, and be contented therewith; which I advise you to learn in your tender Age, having injoyed that Blessing my self, and found great C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>He was a constant Reader of the Scriptures, and during his Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were his only Companions, other books being for a great while denied him; and he making a vertue of that necessity became a diligent and serious Reader of those holy Oracles, and studied to take the measures of his Actions from them, and not from the foolish Dreams, and Conjectures of <hi>Astrology,</hi> though the enquiring after, and taking notice of these, be among the injurious Imputations Obloquy fastened
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:65282:215"/>
upon him. But so far was he from any regard to them, that an <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger</hi> coming to him in <hi>Germany</hi> with a Paper, wherein he said he should read a noble Fortune, he, after he had sent him away, threw it into the fire, without once openin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it: and indeed he was so far from flattering himself with the hopes of great success in any of his Undertakings, that he rather apprehended himself under some inauspicious Star, that cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all his Attempts, which made him in his latter years long for some secret Retirement out of the noise of business. And in his last Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into <hi>England,</hi> he was so far from promising himself great matters, that the night before he marched, when he was taking leave of one of his Friends, he said, he not only knew that such Attempts were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but apprehended that what he was then engaging in, might prove not only dangerous, but destructive to himself; nevertheless he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved either to go through with it successfully, or to perish in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and never survive it; adding, that the last was what he looked for, and therefore he took his leave as never to meet again.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding all the Misfortunes that either lay upon him, or did hang over him, he preserved the greatest calmness in his mind that could be imagined: which appeared in an unclouded serenity that dwelt always on his looks, and discovered him ever well pleased. And though the greatness of his mind, and the sweetness of his Natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per might have contributed much to that Tranquillity; yet certainly it took its rise from another Source, and flowed chiefly from his Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, and the Security he had in the innocency of his own Heart.</p>
               <p>His Accomplishments were great,<note place="margin">His Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments.</note> though cultivated only by his own thoughts, and improved by Experience; for he was no great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, neither was he bred abroad: his Judgment was profound, his Foresight great, his Style was smooth and without affectation, for he spoke with a native Eloquence. One advantage he had beyond all he engaged with in debating, that he was never fretted nor exasperated, and spake at the same rate without clamouring or eagerness. He had seen so much of the baseness of many men, that it inclined him in the end to Jealousie: which made him reserved with most people: and of this I find divers complaining in their Letters.</p>
               <p>For his Affection and Duty to his Prince it hath appeared so much in his History, that little remains to be said in his Character.<note place="margin">His Loyalty.</note> It is true some were pleased to say that he treated with forreign Princes, for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding him in his own pretensions to the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi>: but this Forgery was so ill-grounded, that he had signal proofs to the contrary. When he first engaged in the <hi>German</hi> Design one wrote to him from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court in the name of the Ministers of that Monarch, making him great promises if he would desist from it: but his Answer was, that Duty, Gratitude, and Inclination concurred to tie him inseparably to his Masters Interests, and that no consideration either of Hope or Fear was able to shake him from his fidelity to them. Neither did any thing obstruct his being more imployed and trusted in <hi>Germany,</hi> than his constant adhering to the Kings Pleasure and Interest; for had he given himself up to the will of the <hi>Swedish</hi> King, he would have been quickly put in another capacity, and might have had about him one of the best Armies in <hi>Germany</hi>; since all the <hi>Scotish</hi> Officers, who at that
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:65282:216"/>
time were many and considerable, inclined to have formed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my apart, and served under him, had the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> given way to it.</p>
               <p>When he was claiming his Estate and Rights of <hi>Chastleherault</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> appointed Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> whom he had sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to negotiate that Affair, to tell him that he should be not only set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in that, but have more likewise, if he would enter into a close Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with him, and be a faithful Servant to the <hi>French</hi> Crown. His answer was, that he owed indeed the greatest Duty and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the King of <hi>France,</hi> of any Prince next his own King; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would faithfully serve all his Interests after the Kings. But nothing was to be expected from him that might upon any consideration prejudice his Masters Service, neither would he engage in any Correspondence without his knowledg and allowance: adding, that he was confident his Eminence was too faithful a Minister to that Monarch whom he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to like him the worse for his Honesty to his own Master. These Instances will evince how far he was from pretending to any Interests in his Correspondence with forreign Princes different from the Kings, whom he served with as much Affection as Duty. And indeed the Love he bore his Person was no less than the Duty he payed to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for he did not deny but the former made him digest some things, which perhaps otherwise he had not born so well. This kept him far from vilifying His Majesties Person, or speaking unhandsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of him, as some accused him. It may be supposed that had he been guilty of that, it would have appeared more to his Friends than Strangers, since Prudence would have taught a reserve to them, though Duty had not enjoyned it: but those who conversed most with him, saw so much of his Affection and Esteem for that Prince, that many of them have told the Writer he was the furthest from it that could be, since he studied by all means to infuse that value in others for him, which possessed his own mind. It is true his Calmness made many, who knew not how natural that Temper was to him, suspect he was not in earnest, because he did not bluster out in heats of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon every occasion; for as he was not easily inflamed, so he could not well personate a Passion when he was free of it. All his Advices to the King were for settling matters without hazarding on a bloody Decision, knowing well, that no Quarrels are so mortal, as those that follow upon the closest Ties; therefore he was far from acting that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Office of Incendiary, which some fastned on him. And it was his suggesting and pressing gentler Methods, which engaged some fiery Spirits into such opposition to him: and from hence it was, that when he was put to a Review of those Advices he offered to his Majesty, he said, <hi>He would not study to justifie them all, since he was far from the vanity of magnifying his own Counsels; but all he could answer for, was his good Intention, which was not to be measured by Success.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his disclosing the Kings Designs to his Enemies, Hell could have devised nothing further from Truth: for not only does the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of all his Letters that are in my hands refute that, but when afterwards some who had been Leading men in the Covenant broke with him, with such Animosity, and when by some of those much pains was taken, to possess the King with Jealousies of him, it is not to be doubted but if there had been a shadow of truth for those Imputations, some Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:65282:216"/>
would have appeared, or some Letters had been preserved to have justified these Insinuations. But nothing was so much as ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for this, beyond Whispers and general Stories.</p>
               <p>If all his Friends were not at all times so fixed to their Duty as they ought to have been, that left no Blame upon him; for no man can be lyable for his Friends, nor charged with the faults of other men: but when any of them strayed from their Duty, his Friendship made him not the less but the more severe to them; and many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet alive, have witnessed with what honest zeal he always studied to engage them to a Cordial adherence to the Kings Service. But to sum up all, those who after they see how in his last Speech delivered at his Death, he begs <hi>Pardon and Mercy from God, as he hath been a faithful Servant to his Master,</hi> and do still retain their Jealousies, are beyond the cure of any Perswasion; for none but a desperate Atheist could have adventured so far with a defiled Conscience. Neither can it be alledged here, that all in those times pretended to be for the King: for perhaps many thought the methods they took vvere the best, for securing and settling his Throne. But had the Duke been faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the World accused him, it must not have been a Mistake in his thoughts, but a Crookedness of his Heart, a betraying of his Trust, and a falsifying of his Engagements: and who can suppose, that the Parties who were prevalent both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> at the time of his Death, and pursued him and his Memory with all the excesses of Malice, would not have discovered such Treachery to load him with the greater Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if there had been any grounds for it, since they were the persons who mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> have known it best?</p>
               <p>As for that ridiculous and Devilish Forgery of his pretending to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> never any were alledged to have heard a hint of it from himself, no not in raillery; and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tainly if so great a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign had ever been discovered to any person, it must have been to his Friends, and he must have taken pains to have made some Party sure for it: but for this nothing was ever whispered but Surmises, and those hanging so ill together, that they retained not so much as the shadow of Probability.</p>
               <p>For his Country,<note place="margin">His love to his Country.</note> as he had as great Interest in it as any Subject, so his Affection yielded to none. And it is certain, that if his Counsels to the King seem at any time to fall short of the higher ways of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nothing but his Affection for his Country gave him the byass; for he confessed, <hi>the thing in the World at which he had the greatest horror, was the engaging in a Civil War with his Country-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was far from any Designs of engrossing either Power or Places of advantage to himself, or his Friends; nor was he ever the occasion of any Burden to the Country, for the Assignments he had on some Taxations, were only for payment of the Debts he had contracted by his Majesties Command for his Expedition to <hi>Germany.</hi> And so little fond was he of being the Kings Commissioner in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that in divers of his Letters he proposed others to his Majesty for that Trust, protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was a Place which of all other he hated most; and when he saw Jealousies taken at his being so long in that Trust, as if the King had been to govern <hi>Scotland</hi> by a Commissioner, he pressed his Majesty to change him; so careful was he to avoid every thing which might
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:65282:217"/>
be a Grievance to his Country, and retard the Kings Service.</p>
               <p>He was the great Patron of all <hi>Scotishmen</hi> in the Court, which drew on several occasions a large share of Malice upon him: as appear'd particularly in the Case of one Colonel <hi>Lesley,</hi> whom Colonel <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s Friends were pursuing in the Court, alledging that <hi>Lesley</hi> had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that Colonel unworthily in <hi>Muscovia.</hi> The Crime was not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Kings Dominions, and <hi>Lesley</hi> was Legally acquitted from it in <hi>Russia,</hi> who upon a National account being a <hi>Scotishman,</hi> laid claim to the Dukes Protection; but this irritated Colonel <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (who pretends to have written the History of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First) into so much Rage against him, that forgetting the Laws of History, he breaks out on all occasions into the most passionate Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, that his spiteful, but blunt and impotent Malice could devise. And the best of all is, he bewrays his Ignorance as well as his Passion, in all the Account he gives of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs; so that it is hard to say, whether his Folly in attempting to write a History on such slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Informations, or his Impudence in forging or venting Lies with such Confidence, deserves the severer Censure.</p>
               <p>And since I mention this <hi>Lesley</hi> I shall only add, that though <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> tells a formal Story of the signal Judgments of God on him in his Death, he was alive many years after that Book was published, which can be well proved by many who knew him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note>The Duke was very sumptuous and magnificent in his way of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but abhorred that debauched custom of Entertainments by Drinking, and was an example of Temperance; which cost him dear in <hi>Denmark,</hi> where he refusing the ordinary Entertainments of that Court in drinking, was not only ill used, but made pay a great Sum under the pretence of Passage-dues. Temperance was particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him by his Majesty, when he went to <hi>Germany</hi>; and his returning from that Court without once transgressing these Laws, was such an evidence of his observing them, that afterwards few would tempt him to those Excesses.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His Ingenuity.</note>Of all Vertues he esteemed Ingenuity and Candor most, as that which was the Ground of all Confidence, and the only Security a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; and therefore recommended it chiefly to others, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to observe it most himself. I confess when I consider his whole method of framing and carrying on his Designs, how streight and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did they were, if I oft admire his Invention, I do much more esteem the Ingenuity of his proceedings; for I never find him vailing Truth with a Lye, nor carrying on business with a Cheat: and to speak freely, the greatest departing from these Rules appeared in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration emitted in <hi>April</hi> 1648; where among other things the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declared, <hi>they would not admit His Majesty to the exercise of His Royal Authority, till He by Oath obliged Himself to swear, and ratifie the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> The Duke stuck long ere he would give way to this, at length finding the violent Party that crossed the Engagement implacable, and being desirous to withdraw from them all colours or pretences for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that Design, he yielded to it; and at that time said to a Friend of his, that the Preservation of the King went so near his Heart, that he could refuse nothing which might make way for that. But it was far from his thoughts to seclude the King from the exercise of
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:65282:217"/>
his Royal Power, and therefore it was excused at the same time, both by the Letters his Brother wrote to the King, and in the Instructions sent by Sir <hi>William Fleeming</hi> to the Queen and Prince, and by Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Bellenden</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> I have also a Journal which he took with his own hand of what passed in that Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he wrote, when that Act was put to the Vote, <hi>that (though he gave his Vote to it) it was not his own Opinion.</hi> And thus I lay open both his Fault, and the Temptation that led him to it, so that if ever any Officious Lye was of a venial Guilt, sure this was: yet who knows if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the holy and wise Counsels, for which God might have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Armies Miscarriage as a Punishment for our other Sins, we not being ripe for a Deliverance, this departing from the severe Rules of Ingenuity and Vertue might not have been one procuring cause? but this is the only Instance of this Nature I have met with in the whole Survey of his Actions and Papers.</p>
               <p>As for the mildness and gentleness of his Nature,<note place="margin">His Temper.</note> no day went over him without giving new discoveries of it. For it was very hard to provoke him, but no less easy to appease him: he was not unequal in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, but as one left him they found him, being always cheerful and ever the same. And whatever Aspirings might have been in his mind, his Carriage was the freest of Haughtiness that could be both to Equals and Inferiours: he was both easy to address to, and affable in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and laboured to oblige all people. And in his Command he was far from the common Practice of many, who are very careful to raise all the Money they can, and to oppress the Countries where they march or quarter. It is true the Earl of <hi>Calander</hi> did draw as much Money as was possible from the Places they passed through with their Army, but the Duke would meddle with none of it: and when <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> offered 450 Pound to his Stewart, he would not touch it till he spoke with his Master; who charged him strictly not to meddle with it, and acknowledged he had done like a faithful Servant in not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it.</p>
               <p>It was so impossible for him to resent Injuries, that when some of his Vassals had offended him, so that he was resolved to make them sensible of it when-ever it lay in his way, it no sooner came to be so, but their first Address broke through all his Displeasure: and never did the settled Composure of his mind appear more than at <hi>Vtoxater,</hi> when in the midst of all that Disorder he preserved his usual Temper. The Generosity of his mind made him so tender towards all in trouble, even though deserved, that he was scarce capable of punishing any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for their Faults. A pretty Instance of this was, that a Woman having stolen some of his Plate, and being quickly found with it, he was asked what should be done with her; to which he answered, it seemed she wanted Money, wherefore he ordered to give her a Piece, and send her away. And when in the year 1648, a zealous Woman threw a Stone at him, as he passed through the Streets, all he said was, <hi>he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred what the Woman ailed, for he was never an enemy to the Sex:</hi> nor would he suffer any severe Sentence to be executed on her, but when her Hand was ordered to be cut off, he procured her Pardon, and said, <hi>The Stone had missed him, therefore he was to take care that their Sentence might miss her.</hi>

But the time he survived was so full of Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Confusion, that few Papers were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and these so imperfect, that without ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Supplements than the Writer hopes for, no clear account can begiven of those Times; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there shall be only added somewhat by way of Character, with a general Relation of the following Passages of his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> was born at <hi>Hamilton</hi> on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> in the year 1616. being ten years younger than his Brother,<note place="margin">The Character of <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton.</hi>
                  </note> and of the same Parents. He was of a middle Stature, his Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on black, but very agreeable, and his whole Air and Meen was noble and sprightful: his Youth discovered with an extraordinary Capacity so much Ingenuity, that Candor seemed in him not so much the effect of vertue as nature, since from a Child he could never upon any tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made to lye.</p>
               <p>When his Father died he left him very young to the care of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the kindness of his Brother, with a very small Provision: but he confessed he never missed a Father in his Brother, who kept him not only at the University of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where he was educated, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in his Travels at a rate, and with an Equipage, suitable to his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. He travelled some years in <hi>France,</hi> where he was very much
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:65282:221"/>
esteemed, and invited to stay in that Court with very honourable Offers. He had a good foundation of Literature, though he was no great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and what he once acquired, was rather improved than lost by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His appearance at Court.</note>He returned from his Travels when he was one and twenty years of Age, and was look'd on both by the King &amp; Queen as a rare and highly promising Gentleman; and now that he was of an Age capable of it, his Brother and he entred into an entire Friendship. And finding him so rarely accomplished, and fitted for the greatest Affairs, he kept him with himself at Court; and though he depended wholly upon his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Generosity for his Subsistence, yet he was far from making him feel that, either by upbraiding him with his Favours, or by dispara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him with any neglect, (Faults too commonly incident to Elder Broth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs, when the Younger are obliged to stoop to them.) But as Lord <hi>William</hi> was too high-minded to have endured the least appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of those, so his Brother was not capable of giving him any such hard Usage, but allowed him all things suitable to his rank, and carried towards him with Respect as well as Affection.</p>
               <p>He continued in the Court some years, being much esteemed by all sorts there: for as his Address was becoming, so his Converse was full of Life and Wit, and he was a great Master in all his Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. But his Brother was more careful to think of a Fortune for him than himself was, and therefore provided a Marriage for him, that had the expectation of a vast Fortune, Lady <hi>Elizabeth Maxwel,</hi> eldest Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Earl of <hi>Dirleton,</hi> (who had no Sons, and but one other Daughter.) It was not without reluctancy that he was engaged that way, but his Brothers Authority over him was absolute; so he was married to her in the year 1638, and continued still at Court. He had by her four Daughters that survived him, L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Ann,</hi> L. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> L. <hi>Mary,</hi> and L. <hi>Margaret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards he pretended to be made Master of the Horse to the Queen,<note place="margin">He is made Secretary of State.</note> but Her Majesty was engaged to another, which was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by him, and made him resolve on leaving the Court and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>France.</hi> This grieved his Brother extremely, and both the King and Queen sent him a promise, that if he would give over thoughts of that Journey, he should be preferred to what-ever Place fell, that were fit for him. And a little after that, the Earl of <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> died, who was Secretary of State for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Queen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King to advance him to that Trust, to which his Majesty did willingly consent: for as he was glad of all opportunities of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his kindness to his Brother, so he saw in himself that which made him judge him both worthy and capable of any Imployment; and thereupon he made him Secretary, and created him Earl of <hi>Lanerick.</hi> He had every thing but years to recommend him to the highest Trust, being Witty, Considerate, Brave, Generous, and resolute to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Degree. He saw his Engagement in Affairs fell to be in such a disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time, that he could not have appeared on the Scene with more disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. He had no experience at all in <hi>Scotish</hi> Affairs, but for that he resolved to trust to his Brothers Informations and Advices; which did not only continue till he came to understand Persons and Affairs better,<note place="margin">The Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship betwixt his Brother and him.</note> but that Noble Pair were all their lives united with bonds of Friendship straiter than those of their Blood. Calumny got no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:65282:221"/>
to their Ears, nor Emulation and Jealousie room in their Hearts; and as their Friendship was never broke off with a Discord, so it was not so much as marred by a Mistake. They had both Interests, Friends, and Quarrels in common; they were pleasant in their Lives, nor was their Friendship divided in their Deaths, as appeared from the interchanged Preferences they gave one anothers Children in their Last Wills.</p>
               <p>Both of them had peculiar Excellencies; yet even in those things, wherein the one was excelled by the other, there remained enough to term them both eminent. The Elder had the greater Temper and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Passions, but this made him sometimes fall short of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony and Authority which such Times and Services required. The Younger was more forward and resolute, yet sometimes this left his Temper behind it. The Elder as he had the advantage of Years and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, so he had the deeper Apprehensions, and the greater Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight; but the Younger had more Vivacity of Spirit and Readiness of Apprehension. The Elder was readier to forsee a Danger, and invent Objections, and the Younger quicker at Answering them, and finding Salvoes for all Difficulties. The Elders Converse was smoother, but more reserved; the Younger as he was the brisker, so he was the more frank, and was no less beloved: and in fine, the Elder spoke more gracefully, but the other had the better Pen.</p>
               <p>He was most assiduous in his Imployment,<note place="margin">His diligence in his Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to procure not only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Answers, but speedy Dispatches to all those who made their Addresses by him to the King. He frankly told every one whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would serve them or not, for where he meant no Assistance he never disguised it with general Assurances: but where he promised Service he needed no new Applications, either to refresh his Memory or quicken his Diligence; and he was wont to say, he was sure there was no Person, whose sight His Majesty had so little reason to desire as his, since he never saw him, when there was any possibility of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him apart, but he moved him in one Suit or another. But his Confidence was grounded on this, that he gave the King no trouble with any desires of his own: his Reality this way obliged his Friends exceedingly, who used to complain, that though his Brother as far as his own Kindness could go was most obliging, yet he was averse from doing them such Services with the King as they desired of him.</p>
               <p>He had a Vivacity of Apprehension beyond any about him,<note place="margin">His Abilities.</note> with a great conception of things, and quickly penetrated into mens Thoughts and Designs. His discourse was short, but nervous, witty, and full of Stings, when he had a mind to reflect on others; but he was soon heated, and kept his Fire pretty long. There was not a mean thought lodged in his Breast, all his Designs being noble and aspiring, which with the fervour of his Nature, made him pass for a very proud man among his Enemies. He was indeed gallant and generous to all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and none alive was capable of a higher sense of Honour and Gratitude, nor more unable to stoop to anything that was sordid or mean.</p>
               <p>For his Religion he was a true zealous Protestant,<note place="margin">His Religion.</note> and his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about our unhappy Differences at home were the same with his Brothers. He had a great dislike of Church-mens pretending to meddle in Civil Affairs, finding it hurtful on all hands; and therefore was much for confining them to their own Work. In those Times when
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:65282:222"/>
things were like to run a risque in the Committee of Estates, most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the sense of the Commission of the General Assembly was brought in to declare how far Religion and the Covenant was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in any Particular that was under Debate; and this swayed some, and over-awed others: but nothing was more odious to him than this Practice, and he wisely foresaw, and often said, that nothing could bring such a stain on Religion, in the minds of those who were too inclinable to receive bad impressions of it, as the officious and over-meddling Tempers of hot and indiscreet Church-men. His Practice in Devotion, in some of his last years, shewed him to be sincerely Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</p>
               <p>He had for many years great Convictions on his Conscience of the true excellence of Religion, but humane infirmity prevailed too much over him, and he was not free of Blemishes: yet he found he had to do with a merciful God, who gave him such a Victory over those Snares, and such tender impressions of his Love, that long before his Death he was come to have that assurance of the Divine Goodness, that he was not only ready and willing but longing for Death. But his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of it will appear better from his own Pen than any thing I can add, when he was entertaining himself in cold Blood with the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Apprehensions of that grave Object, and penned his Latter Will, which shall be set down in its own place.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His troubles proved happy to him.</note>The Afflictions he lay under in his last years, contributed not a little to the raising that sense of things in him, these having been the saddest years <hi>Scotland</hi> ever saw, in which he was overlaid both with publick and personal Troubles. Those which went nearest his Heart, and wounded it in its most sensible part, were first the Kings Murther, and then his Brothers; neither was he capable of so mean a thought, as to receive any allay to the last by the Dignity and Fortune which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by descended on him. The Friendship betwixt them had continued to the end sacred and inviolated, and as the Elder transmitted not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Estate and Honour, but left also his personal Estate, Jewels, Plate, and Pictures (which were of great value) to his Brother, giving only Portions to his Daughters, trusting even the Writings for these to his Brother, to lessen them as he found the Estate might bear it; so the Younger judged himself bound in Honour and Gratitude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn such of those as were still in his power, (many of them having been either disposed of for defraying his necessary Expence in that troublesome Time, or lost in the Invasion of <hi>Scotland</hi>) again to his Brothers Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereby he prosecuted his Brothers first Design, who had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Honour and Fortune to descend on his own Daughters if his Brother had no Sons. And so much did he honour his Brothers Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that Injuries done himself raised not such irreconcilable Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in him as those had been done his Brother: neither was any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress so welcome to him, as that which came with a respective Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Brother; and he entailed his Friendship for him on his Daughters, who have desired me to acknowledge to the World, that in him they met with the tenderness of a Father, the kindness of a Friend, and every thing that was generously noble and obliging. And so desirous was he to have his Neece enjoy her Fathers Estate and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,<note place="margin">His care of his Brothers Daughters.</note> that at his going to <hi>England</hi> he professed he was glad he had no Sons to lie in her way to it; adding, that if he had fourty Sons, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65282:222"/>
wished it to her, than he could do to any of them. And for proof of this, though many Evidences might be given, yet I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add one Letter he wrote to her; and the Orders he gave to all that depended on him, discovered it to be no Complement, for it was as really performed as it was generously offered.</p>

               <p>As for those Princes whom he served,<note place="margin">His Duty to the King.</note> he had even as much Justice from Fame as his heart could wish, since none did ever fasten any ill Characters on him in that particular, except that little which was done at <hi>Oxford.</hi> But he who of all living knew his Brother best, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that in this he had the better of him only by Fame, and that the longer he lived he discerned the more wisdom in his Designs, and honesty in all his Counsels: but that which made the difference was, that his Temper was more forward, and he often spoke out those Resentments which his Brother either had not with so much Passion, or chused to bury in his Breast.</p>
               <p>Nothing did so much support his spirit under the heavy Pressure that lay over it, as the desire he had to preserve his Life for His Majesties Service, of which he was prodigal, when he saw it useless to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, for his Life had been of a great while burdensome to him: and indeed it was no wonder to see Death so welcome to one who had so little reason to desire to live, and so much ground to hope in Death; for when the Tossings, and unjust unmerciful Usage he met with in those years he survived his Brother, are well looked into, it is a wonder they forced him not unto <hi>the horridest Resolutions imaginable,</hi> (I use his own words) <hi>and to pursue private and publick Injuries with a mortal Resentment:</hi> yet his zeal for the Kings Service, and the Countries Quiet, over-ruled all other thoughts. From <hi>Scotland</hi> he went to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> where he was scarce landed when he heard the sad and dismal news of the Kings Murder, nor had he recovered of the extreme
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:65282:223"/>
Grief that raised in him, when he heard likewise how his Brother was murthered, which afflicted him beyond expression; nor did any thing grieve him more than his laying down Arms at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> for when he saw too late how they had been abused in it, he censured it more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely than any of his Enemies could do.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">He was ill used by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the Preachers.</note>In <hi>Scotland</hi> the Parliament (if that Meeting could ever deserve that name, wherein there were scarce any of the Nobility present) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned the Engagement for the King, but passed an Act against all the Engagers, ranking them in several <hi>Classes,</hi> whence it got the name of an <hi>Act of Classes,</hi> whereby they were excluded from all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, publick Trust, and Vote in Parliament: nor were they ever to be admitted to Trust, till they had satisfied the Church by a publick professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Repentance for their accession to the unlawful Engagement, as it was then called, and were by them recommended to the favour of the State; and those that ruled were resolved to readmit none, but such as would depend on them, and adhere to their Interests. They were also particularly severe to the Duke, for breaking Confinement, and leaving <hi>Scotland</hi> without their Pass. The Duke upon his arrival in <hi>Holland</hi> offered his Service to his Master, (our Gracious Soveraign who now Reigns) which he received and entertained with so much Royal Goodness, as if the Affection and Confidence of their Masters had been the Inheritance of these Brothers; and what the late King was to the Elder, his Majesty was to the Younger, who continues to this day to honour his Memory with the highest Commendations. And indeed his Royal Favour was not misplaced on one that was either unsensible or ungrateful, for never Subject served Master with more Honesty, Zeal, and Affection; so that no consideration either of Hope or Fear wrought so much on him, as the Affection he bore his Master: neither expressed he anxiety for any thing at his Death, save for His Majesties Person, fearing lest he might fall into their cruel hands, whom he knew to be thirsting for his Blood.</p>
               <p>He stayed in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> till His Majesty came to <hi>Scotland</hi>;<note place="margin">He adviseth the King to settle with <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </note> and though those that governed there were so much his Enemies, that they would have the King stand to their <hi>Act of Classes,</hi> and made that one of the Articles of their Treaty at <hi>Breda:</hi> yet the Duke seeing the desperate posture the Kings Affairs were in, and that no visible hope remained unless His Majesty settled fully with <hi>Scotland,</hi> was not only satisfied to consent to that severe Demand, but did earnestly press His Majesty to agree with that Kingdom, whatever might become of him. Many were for extremer Methods, and pressed the Duke to concur for making a forcible Impression upon <hi>Scotland</hi>: but he well foresaw the mischief of that Course, and how little could be promised from it; for as no great Concurrence could be expected in the condition things were then driven to, so all that could follow, even on a little success, was to expose the Country to the rage of a prevailing Army from <hi>England,</hi> against which <hi>Scotland</hi> entirely united would have had work enough, though it had not been weakned by a Civil War; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was against all Divisions, which might also have tempted the prevailing Party to joyn with the <hi>English</hi> Army.</p>
               <p>The Treaty with the <hi>Scotish</hi> Commissioners was held at <hi>Breda,</hi> where things stuck long, their Demands being very high and uneasy to the King. The chief of the Commissioners was the Earl of <hi>Cassilis,</hi> who
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:65282:223"/>
did truly love the King and Kingly Government; so that when the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation proved sucessful by the Conquest of <hi>Scotland</hi> afterwards, though Usurper studied by the greatest Offers he could make to gain him to his Party, considering the high esteem he was in for his Piety and Vertue, could never prevail so far as to make him advance one step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, even in outward Civilities: yet he was a most zealous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanter, but of so severe a Vertue, and so exactly strict to every thing, in which he judged his Honour or Conscience concerned, that he would not abate an ace of his Instructions, but stood his ground so that nothing could beat or draw him out of it. But he did it with so much Fairness and Candor, that the King, though troubled enough with the difficulties that bred him, yet was much taken with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penness of his Proceeding with him, and conceived so high an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Fidelity to him, that nothing could ever cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge or lessen it: so so excellent a thing is Ingenuity that it begets an esteem wherever it is to be found, even when we are most displeased with the Instances in which it appears. The next in the Commission was the Earl of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> who though he was deeply engaged in Friendship and Interests with the Marquis of <hi>Argyle,</hi> yet was of a Noble Temper, had great Parts, and a high sense of Honour. The other Commissioners depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on them, and went easily along with them in what they agreed to.</p>
               <p>The Commissioners, seeing the good Offices the Duke did, were willing he should return with his Majesty to <hi>Scotland Anno</hi> 1650, and enjoy the common Priviledges of <hi>Scotchmen,</hi> only be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from all publick Trust, and from his Vote in Parliament. But the leading-men in <hi>Scotland</hi> judged it necessary for the Peace of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that the Duke might not return with His Majesty, and sent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for stopping his Voyage. These Orders came not to <hi>Holland,</hi> before most of the Commissioners were aboard, only the Earls of <hi>Cassilis</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> were ashore when they got them; they were much troubled to get such severe Commands, obliging them to break the Treaty they had so lately signed. But since most of their fellow-Commissioners were gone,<note place="margin">But is put from His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

But at His Majesties Landing, one appointed by the Parliament to put him from the King, required him to withdraw: and when the King pressed the Commissioners with the Articles of their Treaty, they said they could not oppose an Order of Parliament. The King was much offended with this, and was inclining to resent it, both as an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Usage and as a Breach of Treaty: but the Duke told him, that at that time <hi>Argyle</hi> was the person who was most able to render him considerable Service in <hi>Scotland</hi>; therefore though he knew he design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing so much as his Ruin, yet he advised His Majesty to use all possible means to gain him absolutely to his Party, and to neglect himself as much as <hi>Argyle</hi> desired, and not at all to seem much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in him; adding, that he knew when His Majesties Affairs were in a better posture, he would not forget his faithful Servants. (This particular His Sacred Majesty vouchsafed to tell the Writer.) It was in vain for him to claim either the benefit of the Treaty at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> or <hi>Breda,</hi> Interest and Jealousy prevailing more with these who then ruled than any other Tie; so the Duke was forced to retire to the Isle of <hi>Arran,</hi>

                  </note>But God who had suffered the Church-party to prevail long, did blast their Force and Success at once; for <hi>Cromwel</hi> upon the Parliament of <hi>Scotland's</hi> bringing home their King, entred it with his Army. The Church-party as they had no mind to invade <hi>England</hi> on the Kings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, so were very careful to declare that their Arming against <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> was not on the Kings account, which they excluded from the state of the Quarrel by an Act of their Committee; and declared that they stood only to their own Defence, against that Hostile Invasion which was contrary to their Covenant and Treaties. They were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so very careful to model their Army, so that neither Malignant nor Engager that had been of the Kings Party, should serve in it; for though when His Majesty came to their Army at <hi>Leith,</hi> the Souldiers were much animated by his Presence, and with the coming of two thousand brave Gentlemen with him to the Army, yet the Leaders of that Party pretended, that since the Malignants were in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my God would be provoked to give them up to the Enemy, and therefore forced the King to leave the Army. They also forced away all those Gentlemen who came and offered their Service. I shall not pursue this account further, but only add, that notwithstanding all their Confidence of their Army, and though they had the Enemy at great disadvantages, so that he and all his Officers gavethemselves for gone; yet they were with very little Opposition broken and routed near <hi>Dunbar</hi> on the third of <hi>September</hi> 1650,<note place="margin">

This vvas called the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the Commission of the General Assembly, and was rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the subsequent General Assembly. But against this many Ministers protested, and from thence arose great Heats and Divisions

among those of the Kirkmen, who owned the Publick Resolutions,<note place="margin">

               <p>It was about the end of <hi>Ianuary</hi> that the Duke was suffered to come and wait on the King;<note place="margin">The Duke is suffered to wait on the King.</note> but at that time <hi>Cliddisdale,</hi> with the other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where his Interest lay, were in the Enemies hands, who had put Garrisons in <hi>Hamilton, Douglas, Carnwath, Boghall,</hi> and other Houses of that Country. Yet the Duke got quickly about him a brave Troop of about an hundred Horse, made up of many Noblemen and Gentlemen. who rode in it, among whom were divers Earls and Lords, whose Lands being also possessed by the Enemy, they could do no more but hazard their own Persons in his Majesties Service; the rest were his Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals and Gentlemen of his Name: and they were commanded under him by a gallant Gentleman, Sir <hi>Thomas Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Preston,</hi> whom he sent with 18 Horse to <hi>Cliddisdale,</hi> to try if the Enemy could be catched at any disadvantage, and the People of the Country raised for the King. The Enemy kept so good Guards, and was so strong at <hi>Hamilton,</hi> that he could not fall in there; therefore he went to <hi>Douglas,</hi> where he took about 80 Horse that belonged to the Garrison, but could not sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the House, for it was too strong to be taken without Cannon. He likewise took all the Horse that belonged to the Garrison at <hi>Boghall,</hi> and killed twenty Souldiers. This made the Enemy keep closer at <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> upon which the Duke resolved to raise ten Troops of Horse, and appointed Sir <hi>Thomas Hamilton</hi> Lieutenant-Collonel; but the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Garrisons gave great interruptions to his Designs.</p>
               <p>At that time the Enemy landed at <hi>Innerkeething</hi> in <hi>Fife,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King marches to <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> and the great Loss the King had there, did both raise the Enemies boldness, and much daunt his faithful Friends: for now <hi>Cromwell</hi> was betwixt His Majesty and the Northern Counties of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which were both most affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate to his Service, and from whence he was to expect Provisions and Supplies; so that it was not possible for the King to maintain the War any longer in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore he resolved on a March to <hi>England,</hi> being put in hopes of great Accessions of force to his Army from the Royal Party there: and this gave a trial to the Fidelity and Courage of many of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation: but too many looking on the Attempt as desperate, being more careful of their Lives and Fortunes than to hazard either in the King's Service, shrunk away, though divers of them had Charges in the Army. Against these base Deserters of their King and Country, the Duke was moved with such just Indignation, that he vowed if ever he returned with Life and Liberty, he should make these in whom he had interest answer for it.</p>
               <p>But the Duke's thoughts of this March, and his sad apprehensions of the whole Business, will appear from the following Letter he wrote to his Neece that succeeded him.</p>

                     <p>INdeed I know not what to say to you, I would fain say something more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging than my last was; but I cannot lie, our Condition is no better, and since that time we have a thousand men (I fear twice that number) run from our Army. Since the Enemy shuns Fighting with us, except upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, we must either starve, disband, or go with a handful of Men into <hi>England.</hi> This last seems to be the least Ill, yet it appears very desperate to me, for more reasons than I will trouble you with: I fear your own Reason will afford you too many. Dear Neece, it is not your Courage I will desire you to make use of in this Extremity, look for Strength to bear it from a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Power, all your Natural Virtues will not resist it; therefore look to him who hath in former times assisted you to resist a great Affliction, and can do it again if you seek to him aright; you have already lost so much, that all other Earthly Losses were drowned in that. Those you meet with now are Christian Exercises, wherewith oftimes the Lord visits his own to wean their Affections from things here below, that we may place them upon himself, in whom we have all things; and if we could, as we ought, set our Hearts upon him, we should find our selves very little concerned in most things which bring us greatest Trouble here on Earth, where we are but for a minute in our way to Eternity. O consider that word <hi>Eternity,</hi> and you will find we strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle here for that, that's even less than nothing; why trouble we our selves for Earthly Losses? for when we have lost all we have, there are thousands as dear to God as we, as poor as we. We are rich though we lose the whole World if we gain him: let us set before our eyes the example of those, who to give testimony to the Truth, rejoyced to lay down their Lives; nay, let us with humble presumption follow the Pattern of our Blessed Saviour, who for our sakes suffered more than man can think on, the burthen of all our Sins, and the Wrath of his Father: and shall we then repine to lay down our Lives for him, when he calls for it from us, to give us a nearer admittance to him, than we can hope for while we are clog'd with our Clay-Tenements. Dear Neece, I should never be weary to talk with you, though this be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I confess I cannot speak of well; but even that Happiness is bereft me, by the importunity of a Crowd of Persons that are now in the Room with me, grudging the time I take in telling you, that while I am,</p>

               <p>The Duke waited on the King in the whole March, and gave Order that the Troops which he had levyed should follow with all possible haste. Seven of them came up, and joyned the Army at <hi>Moffet,</hi> but the interruptions the Enemy gave, made that the rest could not be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; nor were these Troops full. The Duke welcomed them with great affection, and assured them they should be as dear to him as his own Life, and that if God blessed the King with Success, he should be very careful to see them rewarded as they should deserve: but seeing they made in all but betwixt two and three hundred, he feared too many Standards would make them look like the remains of a broken Army; and therefore he set up only his own Standard, and so turned his small Regiment into a great Troop, and marched on with the Army.</p>

Then it was debated, which way the King should hold: the Duke pressed that they should March streight to <hi>London,</hi> which was the desire of the whole Army, and that which <hi>Lambert</hi> apprehended, for in his Retreat he took the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>-Road. There were also many other reasons used to enforce it, but the <hi>English</hi> Nobility and Gentry, who were in the Army, and the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> who with many Gentlemen came to the Army that night, gave many reasons against that March. The Duke seeing them so much against it, though his Reason could not go along with theirs; yet that he might not oppose so many brave and LoyalGentlemen, went out of the Kings Tent, for he would not by his Presence seem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to that which he apprehended would prejudice the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: but was so far from disparaging the other Counsels, and enhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the value of his own, that he went and laboured with all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army, to engage them to a cheerful Concurrence in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions that were taken, and studied even to perswade them to assent to that which had not yet prevailed on his own Reason.</p>

The day after <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> came before <hi>Worcester,</hi> the King called a great Council of War, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what was to be done, where the Duke spoke first, and after he had in as short terms as was possible opened the state of Affairs, he said one of three things must be done; Either they were to March out and fight, to lie still and provide for a Siege, or to March to <hi>London,</hi> the other side of the <hi>Severn</hi> being then free. He proposed the Difficulties of all these, yet said one of them was to be done, and desired that his Majesty might put it to the debate, which of them was fittest. None proposed a fourth Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. But the Duke did afterwards suggest, if the Marching into <hi>Wales</hi> might be adviseable; but as they were in the debate, before the half of the Council of War had delivered their opinions, there came an Alarm to the door that dissolved the Meeting. This was four days before the Fight, the Enemy grew daily stronger, and raised the whole Country to his Assistance; and as the Kings small Army was utterly disproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:65282:226"/>
to their Strength, so the Courage of the Souldiers did daily abate; and the Duke as he clearly foresaw the ruine of the Kings Affairs at that time, and the Captivity of his Country that would follow; so he desired not to out-live it,<note place="margin">The Duke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenns and prepares for Death.</note> which he plainly told to some of his more intimate Friends, though for incouraging others, he put on a great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Cheerfulness on his looks: but apprehending that his End drew nigh, notwithstanding all the Attendance he was obliged to at Court, and with the Army; yet he set off large portions of his Time for reviewing his Life, and fitting himself for Eternity; and when his Imployment all day denied him the conveniency of such long and serious Retirements as that Work required, he took it from his sleep in the night, being more solicitous for rest to his Mind than to his Body And the night before the often fatal third of <hi>September,</hi> which was the day of <hi>Worcester</hi>-Fight, though he had stayed very late in the Court; yet when he came to his Lodgings, the apprehensions he had of what was before him kept him awake and serious, as will appear from the following Paper which he wrote, and was found in his Pockets when they were searched after his Death.</p>

                  <hi>WHEN sadness for any Worldly Cross lies heavy upon thee, remember thou art a Christian, designed for the Inheritance of Iesus; or if thou be an obstinate impenitent Sinner, as sure as God is just thou must perish; if this be thy Condition I cannot blame thee to be sad, sad till thy heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings crack. But then why art thou troubled for the loss of Friends, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or for any Worldly want? what should a damned man do with any of these? did ever any man upon the wrack afflict himself because his Mistress slighted him, or call for the particulars of a Purchase upon the Gallows? if thou dost really believe thou shalt be damned, I do not say it will cure all other Sadness, but certainly it will, or ought to swallow it up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if thou believest thou shalt be saved, consider how great is that Ioy, how infinite is that Change, how unspeakable is the Glory, how excellent is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for all thy Sufferings in the World. So let thy Condition be what it will, compared to thy future possibility, thou canst not feel the present smart of a cross Fortune to any great degree, either because thou hast a far bigger Sorrow or a far bigger Ioy. Here thou art but a Stranger travelling to a Country, where the Glories of a Kingdom are prepared for thee; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a huge folly to be much afflicted, because thou hast a less convenient Inn to Lodge in by the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us prepare our selves against Changes always expecting them, that we be not surprized when they come. O death, how bitter art thou to a man that is at rest in his Possessions; to the rich man, who had promised himself ease and fulness for many years, it was a sad Arrest that his Soul was surprized the first night. But the Apostles who every day knockt at the Gate of Death, and lookt upon it continually, went to their Martyrdom in peace and evenness.</hi> Anytus <hi>and</hi> Miletus <hi>may kill me, but they cannot hurt me: we are troubled on every side, but not distressed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed: and who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Consider that Afflictions are oft-times the occasions of great Temporal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and we must not look upon them as they sit heavy us, but as they serve some of Gods ends, and the purposes of Vniversal Providence: and when a Prince fights justly, and yet unprosperously, could he see the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

               <p>
                  <hi>The last great Trial is Death, for which should we grieve, of all griefs it is the most unreasonable: for why should we grieve at that which is absolutely unavoidable? and it is not so much to be cared for how long we live, as how well we live, for that Life is not best which is longest. The shortning of our days is an Evil wholly depending on Opinion, for if men did now naturally live but Twenty years, then we should be satisfied if they died about 16 or 18. We call not that Death immature in any who live to Seventy, and yet this Age is as far short of the old Period before and since the Flood, as he who now dies of eighteen is of Seventy. Let us still be ready for it, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come too soon, for let us die young or old, still we have an Immortal Soul, and do lay down our Bodies for a time, as that which was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of our Sorrow and Trouble, and the Scene of Sickness and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases: let us not then fear that which rids us of all these, for by fearing it we shall never the more avoid it, but make it the more miserable to us.</hi> Fanius <hi>who killed himself for fear of Death, died as certainly as</hi> Porcia <hi>who eat burning Coals, or</hi> Cato <hi>who tore out his own Bowels. To die is necessary and natural, and may be honourable; but to die poorly, basely, and sinfully, that alone is that which can make a man miserable, for no man can be a Slave but he that fears pain, or fears to die; to such a man nothing but peaceable times can secure his Quiet, for he depends upon things without him for his Felicity, and so is well but during the Pleasure of his Enemy, a Thief or a Tyrant: but blessed is he who willingly resigns his Soul and Body into Gods hands, as unto the hands of a blessed Creator and Redeemer.</hi>

               <p>O <hi>Blessed Iesus, thou didst die for me, grant that I may with Ioy submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Summons, when thou shalt call me to Death, for thou art my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate as well as my Iudge, and camest into the World to save sinners, whereof, O Lord, I acknowledg I am the greatest: but thy Mercies are infinite, O God of Mercy and God of all Comfort, with much mercy look upon the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sorrow of thy Servant; my Sins lie heavy upon me, and press me sore, by reason of thy hot displeasure; my Miseries are without comfort, because they are the punishments of my Sins: my Sin hath caused my sorrow, and my sorrow doth not cure my Sin, and unless thou for thy own sake, and meerly because thou art good, pity me, I am as much without Remedy as without Comfort.

pardon me, and let not my portion be among helpless and accursed Spirits, for thou art good and gracious, and I throw my self upon thy Mercy; suffer me never to let my hold go, anddo then with me what seems good in thy own eyes.

Lord, make me the object of thy Mercy, both in my Life and in my Death; &amp; if even this day thou shalt think fit to remove me from this valley of miseries, either by the violent hand of this merciless Enemy, or any other way which in thy Providence thou hast ordained, when my Soul shall go out from the Prison of this Body, may it be received by Angels, and preserved from the horrour and amazements, and the surprize of Evil Spirits, and be laid up in the Bosom of our Lord, till at the day of thy second Coming it shall be reunited to the Body; which is now to be laid in the dust, yet I hope shall be raised up in Ioy to live for ever, and behold the Face of God in the Glories of our Lord Iesus, who is our Hope, our Resurrection, and our Life, our Blessed and ever-Glorious Redeemer, to whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit be all Honour and Glory, for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>In these Exercises he continued till it was almost morning; and then he threw himself down on the Bed, where he did not lie above two hours when he was called on to make ready, and assoon as he was Dressed and Armed, he waited on the King into the Field.</p>

The Duke being near the Kings Person, and observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that passed, inquired who they were, and being told it was his own Regiment,<note place="margin">His great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> he thought it unworthy of him to be too far from Danger, when they were so put to it, and galloped all alone from the King to the place where they were; where he found them retiring, and did all he could either by words or threatnings to make them keep their Ground. But the Enemy did still bring up more Foot, and Fired uncessantly on them, and most of the Officers were either wounded, or had their Horses killed under them; particularly the Lieutenant Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, who had all the while Charged very gallantly, had his Horse shot under him, and so they were beaten back. The Duke himself keeped in the Reer, with such as were in a Condition to wait on him, to the great hazard of his Person, and gave signal demonstrations of a high Courage: but the Enemy following him close in great Bodies, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded some Foot to make good the Hedge against them, and rode up and down among them, and encouraged them to stand and die for the

But the Enemy pressing on, he rode again with his Pistol in his hand to the Hedge, where he received the fatal Shot that quite disabled him.<note place="margin">He is wounded</note> His Majesty hearing of the extreme Danger he exposed himself to in these Charges, and knowing well how great a loss he would suffer, if so brave a Commander and such a wise and faithful Counsellor were killed, sent once &amp; again to call him away from that Hazard he was in, but he choosed to prefer his Majesties Service to these most obliging Commands; yet being disabled by the Wound he got, he was forced to retire to the Town.<note place="margin">And taken.</note> The total routing of the Army quickly followed, and by the taking of <hi>Worcester</hi> that night he fell into the Enemies hands.</p>
               <p>When he came to his Lodgings his Wound was searched by the Kings Surgeon, Mr. <hi>Kincaid,</hi> who found that by a slug-shot the Bone of his Leg, a little below the Joynt, was crushed, and so broken that many Splinters with the Bullet were taken out at first dressing, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more fragments were at several other dressings separated from the Bone; and the Surgeon told him, the only way to save his Life, was to lose his Leg. But <hi>Trappam, Cromwel's</hi> Surgeon, being sent by him to wait on the Duke, assured him there was no hazard. Two days after the Duke was wounded, the Kings Physitian, Sir <hi>Robert Cunningham,</hi> being found out among the Prisoners, was brought to him, who found he had lost much blood by his Wound, and therefore opened a vein in his Arm, which diverted the Course of the Blood. Then the Duke asked his opinion about him, who told him plainly, there was no hope of saving his Life but by cutting off his Leg, and if that were done some hopes remained; but <hi>Trappam</hi> having assured him there was no hazard, he was not willing to submit to so severe a Sentence, till he were further satisfied of its being absolutely necessary: therefore he sent to <hi>London</hi> for Mr. <hi>Dickson,</hi> who was an expert Surgeon, in whom he had great Confidence, and he came to him with all possible haste; but it was too late, for the Dukes Strength and Spirits were so wasted that they durst not adventure on the Operation. During these few days of the Dukes Life, he expressed great Composure of mind, and a chearful willingness to welcome his approaching End, which drew on a-pace; nor shewed he anxiety or concern in any thing but his Majesties Preservation, for which as he prayed constantly, so he still enquired News concerning him, and blessed God that he heard none, judging from that that he was safe and had escaped. On the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> finding his Strength failing him, and looking on himself as a dead man, he sent his last thoughts to his Lady and Neeces in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letter written with his own Hand.</p>

The total cessation of the Arterial Motion, together with a Marmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous coldness, that was creeping up by degrees from all his extremities, made his Physician warn him that Death was approaching; the Duke answered, that from the beginning he apprehended his Wound would prove Mortal, but he could not think Death was so near him, since he found neither sickness, pain, fainting, nor oppression trouble him. He had been during his Sickness oft waited on both by the Ministers of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and the Ministers who waited on the Kings Army, whom he called for; and as they Prayed and ministred Divine Consolations to him, so they were much comforted and edified with the Christian Courage and Joy he exprest in these his last and closest Conflicts. From six in the morning on the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> he lay quiet speaking little, but was observed all the while by these who looked often to see what he was doing, that he was well imployed in mental Prayer and devout Ejaculations.

                        <hi>I William</hi> Duke of <hi>Hamilton, &amp;c.</hi> being, I thank God, in perfect Health; yet considering the uncertainty thereof, and the many Dangers that all men are subject to, and few more than my self, am desirous to leave my World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs at the time of my Death in the best order I can, as it shall please the Lord to direct me, to whose Providence and Dispensation I humbly and wholly submit my self, falling down before the Throne of his Mercy, who is both the just Inflicter of Death upon us, and the merciful Saviour of us in it, and from it; who is the fountain of Eternal Life, and in whom there is no shadow of Death. Thou, O my Saviour, who knows what it is to die with me as a man, make me to know what it is to pass through Death to Life with thee, my God: make me content to leave the World's Nothing, that I may come really to enjoy All in Thee, who hast made Christ to me in Life gain, and (trusting only in his Merits, and Mediation) will in Death be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Charge me not, O Lord, with the Sins of my Parents, nor with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and hainousness of my Transgressions, which I acknowledge before thee. Remember thy Compassions of old, and thy Loving kindness which have been for many Generations. Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for my Soul trusteth in thee; though thou shouldest kill me, yet will I trust in thy Mercy, and my Saviour's Merits, for I know that my Redeemer liveth: though thou leadest me through the valley and shadow of Death, yet shall I fear none Evil, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the Arms of thy tender and Eternal Mercies. O withdraw not thy Favour from me, which is better than Life; be not far from me, for I know not how near Death is to me. Lord, let thy Servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy Salvation.</p>
                     <p>My Body I bequeath to the Grave, and desire to have it buried in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Burial-place of my Ancestors at <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and that no Ceremony nor Pomp at all be used at the interring of my sinful Carcase, which hath so much offended and dishonoured God; yet through Faith I hope it shall be sprinkled with the precious Bloud of Iesus Christ, and being re-united with my Soul, shall together rise in Glory, reconciled with the Father, to enjoy Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness with him in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And now, O Lord, pity me in my low Condition, and bring me out of my Troubles; though the number of my Enemies be great, yet thou canst disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their Counsels; keep them, Lord, from prevailing, and turn them back that persecute my Soul. If it be thy Will, O Lord, restore me to my Country, that there in peace I may finish the course of my Pilgrimage in thy fear, and live loyal and obedient to my Gracious King <hi>Charles the Second,</hi> and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dutiful to my Country: and as I trust that through the Merits and

                        </note> thou hast forgiven all the errors of my Life, so I beg and hope thou wilt save me from the terrors of Death. Let not, O Lord, at that last hour my Soul be desolate and forsaken; let not those saving Truths I have formerly learned then fail my Memory, nor the sweet effusions of thy Spirit which I have sometimes felt, then be wanting to my Heart; be with me at that time, O Lord, in a special manner, and send the blessed Comforter to assure me of Salvation, that I may die with Ioy, and leave this World with Contentment, since I shall be confident of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of my sins through Christ Iesus, and of my going to that place of eternal Happiness, which thou hast prepared for all them that fear thee in Christ; to which place bring me for his sake, to whom with thee and the blessed Spirit of Grace be all Honour, Praise and Glory, for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi> Written by my self at the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> the <hi>21<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

Continue (as I have often been a witness to) your daily practice in reading the Word of God, which will be a <hi>Lamp unto your feet, and Light unto your paths.</hi> Look not with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice upon any of the Messengers of his Word, but reverence them for their Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage sake: be not too confident of your own Opinions, but examine them by the Touchstone of Gods Word, and refuse not to hear the admonition of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Repine not at Gods ways or dispensations to you, but be patient in Affliction, that you may say with <hi>David, I held my tongue, I opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.</hi> For you may have this Comfort that whom God loves he Chastens, and really if God had not said it, man would hardly believe that Affliction cometh from his Love. But if we admit his Truth, and consider Experience, we shall find that he often afflicteth them most, whom he loveth most, and who most love him. As for those whose eyes stand out with fatness, and have more than their hearts can wish, he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them on slippery places, and feeds them as Oxen to the Slaughter. He is nearer to us in Affliction than in Prosperity, and weare nearer unto him: it is his menage to bring us home from our Wandrings, at least I have lookt upon it so as to my self, which makes me thus desire you may so receive his Visitations. Be frequent in Prayer, &amp; limit not the Spirit in you to the conceptions of other men: shun all vain and idle Company and Conversation, and pray to the Lord to set a watch before your mouth, and to keep the door of your lips. Forget and hate the empty pleasures of a licentious Court, or of <hi>London,</hi> and with

Examine your self every night what good you have done the preceding day, and remember still that you are one day nearer that in which you must give an account to God of all your Actions, on whose Mercy to you let your earliest and latest thoughts be always fixt. Sweet Heart, much more I would say, but you know I am pressed by time; but seek to God, and in him you will find all things.</p>
                     <p>The next Duty I shall recommend to you, is, that which you must pay your King: I know you need no Incitements to this Duty, else I would insist longer upon it; but I conceive it mine to recommend it to you as the Earthly thing which in the first place you ought to study.</p>
                     <p>Next unto that prefer your Duty to the preservation of the House of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> to all things else in this World, and make no difference in the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of your kindness to it, whether the Lord shall think fit to continue the memory of that House in your own or my dear Brothers Issue. And I do conjure you, if you have any respect to my desires, not to suffer any difference or mistakes to arise betwixt you and them; but remember him who prefer'd me to them, and what consequently my Duty and yours is to his.</p>
                     <p>Next I recommend to you the care of the Education of our Children: for the Lords sake study to get them acquainted with God in their young years, and to imprint his fear in their tender hearts, keep all light and idle company from them, and labour to make them rich in Piety and Vertue, Loyal to their King, and dutiful to the House of <hi>Hamilton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As I hope all my Friends and Kindred will be dutiful to you, so I intreat you for my sake continue your respects and kindness to them.</p>
                     <p>Be careful to keep none but pious and discreet Servants in your Family, that the Lord being served and worshipped in it according to his Will, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to dwell in it, and to bless every member of it.</p>
                     <p>And now, Sweet Heart, seeing you know that these divers years my Life hath been a burden to me, receive my Removal as a Mercy from God, with that moderation which he commandeth, and the hope of a Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meeting in our Resurrection perswadeth; being confident that the Lord hath placed me in Eternal Happiness with himself in Heaven, where he hath already laid up some pieces of my self, little <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Diana.</hi> The Lord who hath wounded you, bind up your sores, and pour the Balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> in your Heart; even the Comforts of the Holy Spirit, in the assurance of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of your sins, and peace with him in Iesus Christ, that his Grace in you may shine to the World in a godly and vertuous Life, which having finished in his fear, you may hereafter enter with him into that Glory, which I trust in the Mercies and Mediation of Iesus Christ my Redeemer I shall be shareing of, when you shall be reading these last words and expressions from, Dear Heart,</p>
