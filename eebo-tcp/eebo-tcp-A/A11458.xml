            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Which words giue vs occasion to consider of Three points,<note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>And diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Text.</hi>
               </note> which according to the number and order of the seuerall clauses in this verse, are these. <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Qualitie</hi> of Gods Creatures, as they come from him, and are giuen to vs: [<hi>Euery Creature of God is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> good.] Secondly,</hi> the <hi>vse</hi> of Gods Creatures, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in their <hi>lawfulnesse</hi> vnto vs, and our <hi>libertie</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, [<hi>And nothing to bee refused.] Thirdly,</hi> a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

that all the Creatures of God stand in the nature of things <hi>Indifferent:</hi> that is, such as may indifferently bee eyther <hi>vsed</hi> or <hi>not vsed,</hi> according as the rules of godly discretion, circumstances duely considered, shall direct.</p>

An argument, wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> often enlargeth himselfe: as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. the whole Chapters throughout, and in a great part of 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. The resolution euery where is, that <note n="p" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.26.</note> 
               <hi>all things be done to edification:</hi> that things lawfull become <note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.23.</note> 
               <hi>inexpedient,</hi> when they offend rather, then <hi>edifie:</hi> that though <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 14.20.</note> 
               <hi>all things indeed are pure, yet it is euill for that man which vseth them with offence:</hi> that albeit <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> and other things be lawfull, yet <note n="s" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid. vers.</hi> 21.</note> 
               <hi>it is good neyther to eate flesh, nor to drinke wine, nor to doe any thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a mans brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weake.</hi> Hitherto appertaineth that great and difficult common-place of <hi>scandall,</hi> so much debated and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of by Diuines. The <hi>Questions</hi> and <hi>Cases</hi> are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; not now to bee rehearsed, much lesse resolued, in <hi>particular:</hi> But the Position is plaine in the <hi>generall,</hi> that in case of <hi>Scandall,</hi> for our <hi>weake brothers</hi> sake, we may, and sometimes ought, to abridge our selues of some part of our lawfull Libertie.</p>
            <p>Besides these two, <hi>Sobrietie</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi>; there is yet one restraint more, which ariseth from the <hi>duty</hi> wee owe to our Superiours, and from the bond of <hi>Ciuill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:</hi>

               </note> it is needfull we should haue in remembrance the whole storie of this present Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; of which storie these words are a part. And thus it was. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> commeth with <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife and their family, as a Stranger, to sojourne among the <hi>Philistims</hi> in <hi>Gerar:</hi> couenanteth with her before-hand, thinking thereby to prouide for his owne safetie, because she was beautifull, that they should not bee to know that they were any more then <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>Sister. Abimilech</hi> King of the place heareth of their comming, and of her beauty; sendeth for them both; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth whence and who they were; heareth no more from them, but that shee was his <hi>Sister</hi>; dismisseth him; <hi>taketh her</hi> into his house. Hereupon God <hi>plagueth</hi> him and his house with a strange Visitation; <hi>threatneth</hi> him also

with Death; giueth him to vnderstand, that all this was for taking another mans wife. Hee <hi>answereth</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: God <hi>replyeth.</hi> The <hi>Answere</hi> is in the two next for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Verses: the <hi>Reply</hi> in this, and the next following verse.</p>

Something he had <hi>done</hi>; and something he had <hi>not done:</hi> he had indeed <note n="b" place="margin">Vers. 2.</note> 
               <hi>taken Sarah</hi> into his house, but he had <note n="c" place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> not yet <hi>come neere</hi> her. For that which he had done, in <hi>taking</hi> her; he thought he had a just <hi>excuse,</hi> and he pleadeth it: hee did not know her to bee another mans wife; and therefore, as to any intent of doing wrong to the husband, he was altogether <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> But for that which he had not done, in <hi>not touching</hi> her; because hee tooke her into his house with an vnchast purpose: hee passeth that ouer in silence, and not so much as mentioneth it. So that his <hi>Answere,</hi> so farre as it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, was <hi>just:</hi> but, because it reached not home, it was not <hi>full.</hi> And now Almightie God fitteth it with a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> most conuenient for such an <hi>Answere: admitting</hi> his Plea, so farre as hee alledged it, for what he <hi>had done,</hi> in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife, hauing done it simply out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>Yea I know that thou diddest this in the integrity of thy heart:</hi>] and withall <hi>supplying</hi> that which <hi>Abimilech</hi> had omitted, for what hee <hi>had not done,</hi> in not touching her; by assigning the true cause thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full restraint, [<hi>For I also with-held thee from sinning against me, therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</hi>]</p>

               <hi>First</hi> the <hi>manner of the Reuelation</hi>; namely, by what meanes it pleased God to conueigh to <hi>Abimelech</hi> the knowledge of so much of his will, as he thought good to acquaint him withall: it was euen the same, whereby he had giuen him the first informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>vers.</hi> 3. it was by dreame [<hi>And God said vnto him in a dreame</hi>] and then after the <hi>substance of the Reply</hi>; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of againe the generall parts are two. The former, an <hi>Admission</hi> of <hi>Abimelechs</hi> Plea, or an <hi>Acknowledgement</hi> of the integrity of his heart, so farre as he alledged it, in that which hee had done, [<hi>yea I know that thou diddest it in the integrity of thine heart.</hi>] The later; an <hi>Instruction</hi> or <hi>Aduertisement</hi> to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> to take knowledge of Gods goodnesse vnto, and prouidence ouer him, in that which he had not done: it was God that with-held him from doing it, [<hi>For I also with-held thee from sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</hi>

               <hi>plagued</hi> him and his, for that hee had done: and God doth not vse to punish the <hi>carkasse</hi> for that, wherein the <hi>heart</hi> is single.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, <hi>Sarah</hi> was taken into the house, and there kept for <hi>lend</hi> purposes: and how can truth and puritie of heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with a <hi>continued resolution</hi> of sinfull vncleannesse? <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech</hi> then cannot be defended, as truly and absolutely <hi>innocent:</hi> though hee plead <hi>Innocency,</hi> and God himselfe beare witnesse to <hi>the Integrity</hi> of his heart: For had his <hi>heart</hi> bin vpright in him and sincere, in this very matter of <hi>Sarah,</hi> hee would neuer haue taken her into his house at all, as he did. But that hee pleadeth for himselfe is; that in this <hi>particuler,</hi> wherewith it seemed to him God by so threatning him did charge him, in <hi>wronging Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by taking his wife from him, his Conscience could witnesse the <hi>Innocency</hi> of his heart, how free he was from any the least iniurious <hi>purpose,</hi> or so much as <hi>thought,</hi> that way. It was told him by them both, that shee was his <hi>Sister</hi>; and hee knew no other by her then so, when hee

tooke her into his house, supposing her to bee a <hi>single wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> if hee had knowne shee had beene any mans <hi>wife,</hi> hee would not for any good haue done <hi>the man</hi> so foule an iniury, nor haue sinned against his owne <hi>soule,</hi> by defiling anothers bed: <hi>In the integritie of his heart, and innocency of his hands</hi> he did, what hee had done. This is the <hi>substance</hi> of his allegation: and God approueth <hi>the integrity of his heart</hi> so farre; <hi>viz.</hi> as free in this particular from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, eyther to <hi>iniure Abraham,</hi> or to <hi>sinne</hi> against the light of his owne Conscience, by committing <hi>adultery</hi> with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife.</p>

In any of the three there may be a fault, all of them being depraued in the state of corrupt Nature; and the very truth is there is in euery sinne (euery <hi>compleat</hi> sin) a fault in euery of the three. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>all sins,</hi> by reason of the <hi>blindnes</hi> of the Vnderstanding, may be called <hi>Ignorances</hi>; and by reason of the <hi>impotency</hi> of the Affections, <hi>Infirmities</hi>; and by reason of the <hi>peruersnes</hi> of the wil, <hi>Rebellions.</hi> But for the most part it falleth out so,

            <p>This <hi>Restraint,</hi> whether we consider the <hi>measure</hi> or the <hi>meanes</hi> which God vseth therein;<note place="margin">§. 31. <hi>With the measure and meanes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
               </note> is of great variety.

For, betweene this <hi>restraining Grace,</hi> whereof we haue now spoken, and that <hi>renewing Grace</hi> wherof we now speak; there are sundry wide <hi>differences.</hi> They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> differ <hi>first,</hi> in their <hi>fountaine. Renewing grace</hi> springeth from the <hi>special loue</hi> of God towards those that are his in Christ: <hi>restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning grace</hi> is a fruite of that <hi>generall mercy</hi> of God, whereof it is said in the Psalme, that <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 145.2.</note> 
               <hi>his mercy is ouer all his workes.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> They differ <hi>secondly,</hi> in their extent: both of Person, Subiect, Obiect, and Time. For the <hi>Person</hi>; Restraining Grace is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to good and bad: Renewing Grace <hi>proper</hi> and peculiar to the <hi>Elect.</hi> For the <hi>Subiect</hi>; Restraining Grace may bind <hi>one part</hi> or facultie of a man, as the <hi>hand</hi> or <hi>tongue,</hi> and leaue <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12503:67"/>
their <hi>ends.</hi> Restraining Grace is so intended chiefly for the good of <hi>humane society,</hi> (especially of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and of the members thereof;) as that indifferently it may, or may not doe good to the Receiuer: but Renewing Grace is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially intended for the Saluation of the <hi>Receiuer,</hi> though <hi>Ex consequenti</hi> it doe good also vnto others. They differ <hi>fourthly,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and lastly, in their effects. Renewing Grace <hi>mortifieth</hi> the corruption, and <hi>subdueth</hi> it, and <hi>diminisheth</hi> it; as <hi>water</hi> quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth fire, by abating the heate: but Restraining Grace only <hi>inhibiteth</hi> the exercise of the corruption for the time, without any <hi>reall admonition</hi> of it either in substance or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as the <note n="c" place="margin">Dan. 3.25.</note> 
               <hi>fire</hi> wherin the <hi>three Children</hi> walked, had as much <hi>heate</hi> in it at that very instant, as it had before and after, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by the greater power of God, the naturall power of it was then <hi>suspended</hi> from working vpon <hi>them.</hi> The <hi>Lions</hi> that spared <hi>Daniel</hi> were Lyons still, and had their rauenous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position still, albeit God <note n="d" place="margin">Dan. 6.22.</note> 
               <hi>stopped their mouthes</hi> for that time, that they should not hurt <hi>him:</hi> but that there was no change made in their <hi>naturall disposition</hi> appeareth by their entertainement of their next guests, whom they deuoured with all greedinesse, <note n="e" place="margin">Ibid. vers. 24.</note> 
               <hi>breaking their bones</hi> before they came to the ground. By these two instances and examples, we may in some measure conceiue of the nature and power of the <hi>restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Grace of God</hi> in wicked men. It <hi>bridleth</hi> the corruption that is in them for the time, that it cannot breake out, and <hi>manacleth</hi> them in such sort, that they doe not shew forth the vngodly disposition of their heart: but there is no <hi>reall change</hi> wrought in them all the while; their heart still remaining <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified,</hi> and their naturall corruption <hi>vndiminished.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>renewing</hi> and sanctifying <hi>Grace</hi> of God, by a real change of a <hi>Lyon</hi> maketh a <hi>Lambe</hi>; altereth the naturall disposition of the soule, by draining out some of the <hi>corruption</hi>; begetteth a new <hi>heart,</hi> a new <hi>spirit,</hi> new <hi>habits,</hi> new <hi>qualities,</hi> new <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi> new <hi>thoughts,</hi> new <hi>desires</hi>; maketh a <note n="f" place="margin">Eph 4 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
