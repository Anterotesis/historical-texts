            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS Cities receive great Princes with Showes and Pageants, so I welcome your Honour into the world with this Dramatick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement. Perchance a more serious present had not been so becoming your age, as having but newly shaken off the infant blossoms of a hopefull fruit, which in all reason is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, if your Honour contemplate the actions of your Illustrious Ancestors, whose greatness and glory were first rooted by the munificence of Majesty, especially for stifling
<pb facs="tcp:44726:3"/>
and confounding the Rebellions in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Third. Never was bounty better bestowed; for Loyal gratitude in the highest degree has been by it constantly intailed on the house of <hi>Huntley:</hi> there needs no further demonstration then the actions and sufferings of your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Grandfather, Father, and Vncles in our late Fanatick Commotions: For, upon all occasions they and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were still in the greatest readiness to assert the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Interest: And that which rendred them most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable (next their Loyalty) was their number, who of themselves, without regard to Dignity, compos'd intire Squadrons of Horse and Foot. And for their sufficiency, let any reflect upon the Battels of the great <hi>Montrose,</hi> they'l find them so conspicuous, that it lies not in the power of the cunningest and blackest Malice to rase their glorious Memories out of the lasting Monuments and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our time. This is so great a Truth, that I am delighted to think there's none can justly contradict me: So, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever sees all their Vertues summed up and inherited by you, shall never doubt that in any active capacity for the service of your Prince, your whole Name and Family un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a Head will still continue in the first rank of the best Subjects.</p>
            <p>My Lord, this same Comical Trifle, which I dedicate to your recreation, like most other Playes, has its useful moralities. If the way I have used in ordering them be satisfactory, I esteem my self happy, humbly begging your Honour wou'd be pleased to accept it as a small part of the great Thankfulness I owe for the many Reliefs,
<pb facs="tcp:44726:3"/>
Shelters and Protections, I received from your Family during the time of His Majesties Service in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which I shall die acknowledging, to be the duty of,</p>

               <p>He's a Stranger, and my Master.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>He must be a bold Stranger indeed that will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his reputation to the Censures of our Criticks.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Serv.</speaker>
               <p>Heaven forbid that any honest mans reputation shou'd depend upon the making of a Play; But, I must tell you Sir, he had never ventur'd, if he had not seen the Wit of the times so easily acquired.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>But why is modern wit so easily acquired.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Serv.</speaker>
               <p>Because a Trivolino, or a Skaramuchio that's dextrous at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of mouths will sooner raise a Clap then a high flown Fancy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Play.</speaker>
               <p>All the better for us if that be true, for we shall have new Playes come on like fresh Herring and Mackarell, all the year about, so that our Wits shall never be out of Season.</p>
               <stage>aside.</stage>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>But Friend, you are in a monstrous errour; for if your Masters Play be not provided with requisite Materials, both he and it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Nursery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Serv.</speaker>
               <p>I pray what do you reckon them Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>The Plot must be new, the Language easie, the Fancies intelligible, and the Comical part so delicately enterwoven, that both laughter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light may each of them enjoy their proportions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Serv.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard my Master say, that since the restauration of the Stage, he has seen all you have said represented to perfection, and yet blown upon with disdain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>That's only by the young sucking fry of Wits; But tell me, has your Masters Play the qualifications I told you of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Serv.</speaker>
               <p>Not one of them, for the Plot is like all others of the time; <hi>viz.</hi> A new Toot out of an old Horn; and in regard he saw smal things so acceptable, he has dub'd his Trifle with the rest, in hopes that it will prove less considerable then any that's gone before, and consequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects a better approbation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>By that Character I perceive he's not ambitious to bear up with the Flag-wits.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Serv.</speaker>
               <p>Right, onely a small Privatier to skulk among Creeks and Clifts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>My advise is then, that he quit the English Shore if he intend to thrive at Wit Capring, for the Natives of that Trade has left so little now to pilfer, that the purchase will not defray the rigging of Ink and Paper, and let him try when he pleases, he'l find the Wit almost as scarce a commodity as the Money.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Serv.</speaker>
               <p>My Master was lucky then at his first setting out to cruise the Coast of <hi>Spain.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>If he has done so, he could not miss of a good Prize.</p>

               <p>A small Caravel from <hi>Sevill</hi> which he freely bestows upon this good company, and that his present might be entire, he has given the Prize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Office the go-by.</p>

               <p>He might have saved that labour; for not being matter of money they wou'd ne're a look't after him. But tell me friend, without any more circumlocutions, what way is the Play drest?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. Serv.</speaker>

since our Faiths were plighted, but I am resolv'd against marriage so long as he practises this barbarous jealousie against his Sister, who among all the Ladies in Town is reputed the great example of Virtue; Therefore (dear Cousin) I sent for you that we may consult either to dispossess <hi>Patricio</hi> of this new taken up humour, or find a means to fetch <hi>Liviana</hi> out of her Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; That your honourably begun love may be finish'd, and haply by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of either, <hi>Patricio</hi> may be convinc'd of his Error, and I in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to terminate my enjoyment.</p>

                     <p>Madam, you can dispose of me at all times: yet I could have wish'd their Cabinet Council had lasted till my love to her Maid had been more advanc'd; for (if I be not mistaken) her frozen Chastity was beginning to thaw.</p>

                     <p>Because I suppose he fancied me a Dutch bottom, who for not stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at first, he was ready with his Grapler to have laid me aboard; and I verily think had made me prize, if the Authority of your call had not so sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably come to my relief.</p>

                  <p>AS for its operations upon the faculties of the Soul, that varies accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the several Climats; for in <hi>Spain,</hi> when the steam is apply'd to the eyes, it renders the Inhabitants there most foreseeing and perspicatious in forreign Discoveries; and when under the Ears of a <hi>French</hi>-man, it fills his head so full of Pantaloons, and Sarabands, that he can no more forbear Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, then if he were bit with a Tarantula. In <hi>England</hi> agen it has more politick Effects in appearance, but little to the purpose, for every Pragmatical fellow will be cementing the Cracks and Flaws of the Government, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the vapour mounts into the Noddle of a snivelling Lay Elder; for there commonly it fixes till it has dissolv'd all the ligaments of Loyalty. But 'tis most usefull to the Hollanders; for when their brains are stupifi'd with condens'd Clouds, by eating and drinking too much Hair-grout and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee, then they use it by way of Glyster to remove these knotty impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but instead of making these Dull vapours transpire through the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the head, by way of repercussion, they come tumbling down the body, and fly into the Breeches with as great fury as a Cork does from English Bottle-Ale.</p>

                        <hi>Venner</hi> in Coleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street, and the good man with his Whigs in <hi>Galloway.</hi> So this <hi>Hocus</hi> is but small comfort to the Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of both kinds.</note>

                  <p>So I did; but the agility of the Enemy in point of wheeling, made me then become the forlorne of our left Wing; by all good Tokens, at my first onset I defeated 1500 Curasseers that commanded the Redoubt which flank'd th'Enemies Cannon.</p>

The truth is, the Claret-Philosophers (though they be few) are my best Customers, for when they come reelingin, no less then half a score Dishes they require to settle their Stomacks. Well, I'le try it yet a month longer, and if I fail then, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to take a House near a Pump, and with a stock of rotten Raisons and <hi>Salsa-parilla,</hi> set up a brewing of Dyet-drink, and Stipone, which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident will prove a good Commodity, if I be not interferr'd by a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly.</p>

                  <p>Be not too confident in so dang'rous undertakings; for love is like a frozen Snake taken up by a compassionate Pilgrim; who trusting to its weakness, gives it the heat of his Bosome, and whilest the poor wretch is

cheerfully marching on his way, he then finds the force of the Serpents poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by a fatal sting in his breast: how often has love been known to begin with trifling and indifferent addresses, yet has swell'd to such heights when not ending with enjoyments, has brought on certain death: and though Loves firstlings be not violent, yet his motions never cease till he has made a purchase of the heart; so, when the desir'd object cannot be acquir'd, the soul of the poor Lover is nothing but a compound of griefs and anxieties.</p>

                     <p>Being already inform' of my fatal Charm, you must needs conclude, its consequence debars the satisfaction of Matrimony.

                     <p>Take notice Sir, the noise we heard last night, was not as we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poss'd, occasion'd by night Rats.</p>

                     <p>It was this same <hi>Don Alonzo,</hi> and his Kinsman, who were set upon by the <hi>Lucina's, Alonzo</hi> was separate from his friend, which it seems was the noise we sought after first; and that which was towards the Garden-door, was <hi>Alonzo's</hi> Kinsman, hardly put to it by his Enemies. But upon our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, they fancied a relief from the <hi>Figueros,</hi> and so betook themselves to flight; the Gentleman finding himself weak with the loss of blood by a wound in his Arm, laid hold on the opportunity of your Garden-doors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open, and came to the seat of the West-corner to rest himself.</p>

                     <p>This is a strange accident; I am apt to believe it; for <hi>Don Balthaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar</hi> who is head of the <hi>Lucina's,</hi> is a person of a low spirit, and has made seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral unworthy attempts of this kind to murder <hi>Don Alonzo;</hi> but pray what's become of the Gentleman.</p>

            <p>THere is a Fate accompanies Play-makers, like the Curse upon the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Holland;</hi> which is, besides the Authors true birth, the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will not be satisfied without a Soutterkine, and that forsooth trimm'd to a better advantage with trappings of Rhime then the Play it self. The truth is, our Poet bids me tell you, bee'l rather run the hazard of being thought no Wit, then garnish the corners of his sence with such canting Gingles: And if happ'ly he shou'd pop upon a revery of <hi>Dactylus</hi> and <hi>Spondaeus,</hi> there's none knows h m wou'd believe it his. Therefore in his own way, he sayes, that having brought his Present from <hi>Spain,</hi> and having' scapt the boisterous Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the Bay of <hi>Biscay,</hi> he hopes at this time neither to dash or split upon these Boxes, nor be ingulfed in this Pit. And for his Friends above in the exalted Stalls, he expects the best from them, since he has complemented them with a Monky and a <hi>Jigge.</hi> All the Clap he expects from you is, not to be hist, and say with an indifferent Grimasse, 'tis well enough for a Novice. I am sure if you knew him so well as I, this cou'd never be refused, for he is a person that honours your good Men, and never boyled at the coursest of your Women.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>If this prevail not, he hopes he's safe from danger,</l>
               <l>For Wit and Malice, ought not to reach a stranger.</l>
