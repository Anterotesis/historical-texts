            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

John, <hi>and</hi> Frances, <hi>The Lord, and Lady HAVERSHAM.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it please Your Honours,</salute>

            <p>THE <hi>Request</hi> of the <hi>Mournfull Widow,</hi> and <hi>other Relatives,</hi> of the <hi>worthy Person,</hi> deceased; concurring with my <hi>own Inclination,</hi> left, with me, no room to deliberate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this <hi>Inscription.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I easily apprehend, how <hi>quick,</hi> and <hi>deep,</hi> a sense You <hi>both</hi> have, of the loss of <hi>such another</hi> valuable person, from off this Earth; having so lately born Your part, in lamenting the Decease of one You much valued also. Upon which account, I put into Your Hands, a Discourse on those words, <hi>John 11. 16. Let us go, that we may die with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49196:3"/>
               <hi>Such Persons</hi> leave this World so fast, that it grows a more difficult choice, <hi>with whom to live,</hi> than <hi>with whom to die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When, on that sad occasion, I did set my self to consider, that passage of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> I had seen some <hi>Expositors,</hi> that made it <hi>a doubt,</hi> whether <hi>that</hi> were meant of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or of <hi>our Lord himself.</hi> Some, of good note, thought <hi>the latter.</hi> For which, was plausibly to be alledg'd, what we find, <hi>vers. 8.</hi> and that, in this <hi>verse 16.</hi> the words were spoken, not <hi>to Christ,</hi> but to the <hi>Fellow-Disciples</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Doubt</hi> was not to have been mov'd <hi>in an Assembly,</hi> where was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>time,</hi> nor a <hi>sit season</hi> to discuss it. And tho' I might more conveniently, I shall not say much to it, now. Only I iudge, that, without necessity, the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent coherence</hi> was not to be torn. When, by <hi>the series</hi> of Discourse, the same <hi>[him]</hi> seems plainly to be referr'd to, in the close of the <hi>15. verse,</hi> and of <hi>this 16.—Lazarus is dead,</hi> v. <hi>14.—ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, let us go to HIM,</hi> vers. <hi>15.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49196:3"/>
               <hi>—Let us also go, that we may die with HIM.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was little needfull to say to <hi>Christ, Let us go,</hi> whose Mind appeared set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on going, already, but <hi>to the Disciples,</hi> who drew ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k. Besides that <hi>Reverence</hi> might restrain from saying this to <hi>our Lord,</hi> when what was to be propos'd was matter of <hi>Hortation,</hi> not of <hi>Enquiry.</hi> Tho' sometimes <hi>they feared</hi> even to <hi>ask him a Question,</hi> also; as <hi>Luk. 9. 45.</hi> And they might the rather, be now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>present awe,</hi> from the rebuke, or expostulatory answer, he had given them, for their objecting against <hi>going into Judea.</hi> Especially, so as not to signifie a <hi>remaining fear,</hi> which he had so newly check'd Therefore <hi>Thomas</hi>'s speech, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to his Fellow-Disciples, but not out of Christ's hearing (for we have no reason to suppose, that he separated them from him, that he might say <hi>this</hi> to them apart) is so ordered, as not to import <hi>fear of death,</hi> but <hi>Love to the Deceas'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any should object, that <hi>Thomas</hi> could not mean <hi>dying WITH Lazarus,</hi> when he was told, he <hi>was already dead.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49196:4"/>
               <hi>That</hi> scarce deserves answer, to any one that understands the latitude of the Particle render'd <hi>WITH,</hi> especially, that it frequently signifies <hi>after,</hi> and not always <hi>with.</hi> And very often notes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of time at all. And therefore may here, mean no more, than <hi>let us go</hi> that we may <hi>die too,</hi> or, <hi>die, as well as he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this I say, not that I have heard any Person, in our days, <hi>object against,</hi> or <hi>plead for, this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> sense of these words: But knowing they have been <hi>differently</hi> understood; and <hi>this</hi> being the first opportunity I had to take publick notice of the <hi>difference,</hi> I am not ill pleased, that I have <hi>now,</hi> this occasion of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting it, to so <hi>competent Judges,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>prevent Objection,</hi> or at least, to shew with <hi>what temper of mind,</hi> any such <hi>different apprehensions,</hi>in matters of no greater moment, ought to be look'd upon.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I <hi>here</hi> vye Authorities of <hi>Commentators,</hi> that have gone <hi>this way,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> in this matter. Therefore I name none: Only <hi>some,</hi> of as <hi>great name</hi> as any, have judg'd <hi>this</hi> the more
<pb facs="tcp:49196:4"/>
probable Opinion, which I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd.</p>
            <p>Many Instances might be given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, when matters, extra-essential to the Summ of our Religion, are deliver'd, <hi>one Sense</hi> must be pitch'd upon, tho' <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> very <hi>divers,</hi> (of which there cannot be <hi>two)</hi> is not to be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>impossible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which case, I much prefer a tacit following <hi>that</hi> which one chooses, before a conceited Confidence, and crying down of the <hi>other.</hi> For confident Clamour nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>admits light,</hi> nor tends to <hi>enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the present case, it makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to any disadvantage. For if we desire to be <hi>united in death,</hi> or in <hi>that state,</hi> to which it introduces, with this or that H. Man: To be <hi>with our Blessed Lord,</hi> in that state, must be much more desirable.</p>
            <p>But the departure of the <hi>excellent Ones of the Earth,</hi> from it, leaves us less, <hi>here,</hi> of <hi>present attractive,</hi> and gives us a very <hi>threatning prospect,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of what we are to expect, for the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

            <p>These latter words hold forth the <hi>double end</hi> which a Minister of Christ is to pursue, the saving his own, and his Peoples Souls.</p>

               </note> literally import, which we read, <hi>he is to give himself wholly to them.</hi> He is to be continually increasing in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and that so as not to know only to himself, but so as to make known what he knows. He is especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (tho' that be the common duty of Christians) to turn all to <hi>the use of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying,</hi> Eph. 4. 29. that <hi>his profiting may appear to all.</hi> For tho' <hi>Timothy</hi> was at this time a young man, yet the most grown, did always need to be still growing: None have <hi>here,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd their <hi>Ne plus ultra,</hi> but may still write for their <hi>Motto, Plus ultra,</hi> all their days; even <hi>Paul the Aged,</hi> as he writes himself to <hi>Philemon,</hi> tells the <hi>Philippians</hi> (both those Epistles being dated from <hi>Rome,</hi> and supposed to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49196:8"/>
written about the same time, when he was first there) <hi>that he had not yet attain'd,</hi> in point of the transforming <hi>knowledge of Christ, chap.</hi> 3. 10, 11. And unto what pitch soever he grew, it was still in order to communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He writes to the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> that he <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>to know nothing among them;</hi> which is <hi>so to know,</hi> as to <hi>make known,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Jesus Christ and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd.</hi> And to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that he would <hi>have them</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>understand, his knowledge in the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ;</hi> no doubt that their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation might be promoted thereby. And hereupon, in great part, depends a Minister's own Salvation; as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after will further appear. But besides, <hi>he is to take heed to himself,</hi> and see to the good state of his own Soul; he is to take heed to his Doctrine, <hi>not to corrupt,</hi> or <hi>handle deceitfully the word of God,</hi> but represent it sincerely, <hi>and as the truth is in Jesus.</hi> He is to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in them,</hi> i. e. in the things he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exhorts him to meditate on, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49196:8"/>
be wholly in them; to continue <hi>in the Faith,</hi> of what was to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>the Practice,</hi> of what was to be done; and in pressing and insisting on both. And all for the mentioned Ends, that he might both <hi>save himself, and those that hear him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is this <hi>two-fold End</hi> of a Minister's Care, and Labour, that will take us up at this time. This is that therefore, which as God shall help, I am to <hi>evince</hi> and <hi>apply, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That a Minister of Christ is to make it his business, both to save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his hearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am, as the Text directs, to speak of these two Ends conjunctly: And here I stall not spend time, or use a a liberty, beyond what is obvious, and useful; in enquiring into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God, why he makes use of <hi>such</hi> in order to the <hi>saving of others,</hi> as need to be <hi>saved themselves,</hi> also.</p>
            <p>But shall principally insist, that <hi>since it appears to be God's pleasure to</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49196:9"/>
               <hi>make use of such,</hi> they should, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, most earnestly concern themselves,</hi> and be very intent upon carrying on this design; <hi>viz.</hi> of their own, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly with that of their Hearers Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Yet as to the former of these,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Somewhat it may be requisit to say, concerning <hi>this Course and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> which we find the Wisdom and Good-pleasure of God have pitch'd upon, for the carrying on a saving De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in this World; to make use of <hi>such</hi> for the saving of others, as do need to endeavour the saving of themselves. And here I shall briefly shew;</p>
            <p n="1">1. How it is to be understood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How the fitness of this Course may be evinced.</p>
            <p>As to the former we shall briefly note;</p>
            <p>That we must be cautious to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand aright, <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>in what sense</hi> any one can be said, to save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or another. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It must be understood <hi>so,</hi> as to keep at a remote and awful distance from intrenching upon a <hi>Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49196:9"/>
It being most expresly said, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 11. <hi>I, even I, am the Lord, and besides me there is no Saviour:</hi> and Chap. 45. 21, 22. <hi>There is no God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side me, a just God, and a Saviour, there is none beside me. Look to me, and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth: for I am God, and there is none else.</hi> Which plainly signifies, that in the highest sense, <hi>to save,</hi> is most appropriate to Deity, especially, with an <hi>everlasting Salvation,</hi> as 'tis express'd, <hi>v.</hi> 17. of this <hi>Chap.</hi> 45. <hi>Israel shall be saved, in</hi> or <hi>by the Lord, with an everlasting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> And that to be <hi>so</hi> a <hi>Saviour,</hi> is equally incommunicable, as <hi>to be God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How gloriously doth he triumph in this <hi>excellent peculiarity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> in his Expostulations with <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 40. 9. <hi>Hast thou an arm like God!</hi> q. d. <q>Come let us compare; stretch out that weak withered ulcerous Arm of thine. <hi>Deck thy self now with Majesty and Excellency, array thy self with Glory and Beauty;</hi> try if thou canst make thy self shine in God-like splendor: <hi>Cast abroad the</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49196:10"/>
                  <hi>Rage of thy Wrath: behold every one that is proud and abase him.</hi> Try thy power upon thy fellow mortals. See if thou canst crush all the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ones of this World, bring them down, and bind their Faces in the Dust of the Grave. And (to recall thee to the greater things mention'd before) try if thou canst form me such another Earth as this, establish its Foundations, lay its corner Stone. If thou canst countermand the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, bind up the Influences of the Stars in the Heavens.</q> 
               <hi>Then will I confess unto thee, that thy own right-hand can save thee,</hi> vers. 14. It is, it seems, as much above created Power <hi>to be a Saviour,</hi> as to be the Creator or Ruler of the World.</p>
            <p>And how should we dread to think of usurping the <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of the great Emanuel, <hi>the Saviour,</hi> who is therefore call'd <hi>JESUS,</hi> because <hi>he was to save his People from their sins,</hi> Matth 1. 21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet there is <hi>a true sense</hi> wherein the saving Act and Power, are <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49196:10"/>
and <hi>very variously</hi> ascrib'd. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>Faith,</hi> Luk. 7. 50. <hi>Thy Faith hath saved thee;</hi> sometimes to <hi>Hope, We are saved by Hope,</hi> Rom. 8. 24. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>Baptism,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. <hi>Baptism doth also now save us, not the putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the filth of the flesh,</hi> &amp;c. sometimes to <hi>Husbands and Wives</hi> in reference to one another, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 7. 16. So is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel call'd the <hi>Gospel of our Salvation,</hi> Eph. 1. 13. <hi>And to you is the word of this Salvation sent,</hi> Act. 13. 26. So are <hi>we exhorted to save our selves,</hi> Act. 2. 40. and others, <hi>Jud.</hi> 23. <hi>Others save with fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in lower matters, is <hi>the act,</hi> of <hi>Writing,</hi> for instance, ascribed to the <hi>Pen,</hi> to the <hi>Hand</hi> that uses it, and to the <hi>Writer himself,</hi> that moves both; and we have no difficulty to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand those different forms of Speech: Nor is there a greater difficulty in the present case; so to ascribe to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the low subordinate Agency, which in distinct capacities may belong to it, as in the mean time to reserve to God and Christ the supream Agency, which is most peculiar and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49196:11"/>
to <hi>Divine Power</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5. Eph. 2. 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We now come next to shew, That it was very manifestly agreeable to the most accurate Wisdom of God, to imploy <hi>such</hi> in the design and work of saving others, as were <hi>themselves</hi> concern'd, and needed to be saved too, that were to be upon the same bottom <hi>themselves</hi> with the rest; and to venture their own Souls, and their everlasting concernments the same way, and into the same Hands.</p>
            <p>And this we shall labour to clear and make evident by degrees.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was fit, since Creatures were to be employ'd in this work, to make use of Intelligent Creatures, such as could understand their own errand, and act with design in pursuance of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mankind was universally lost, so as all do need being saved themselves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore no intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures else, could be employed herein, but the unfall'n Angels.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49196:11"/>
4. We may adventure to say after God, and when he hath so determined the matter himself, though it was not fit for us to have said it before him, as if we would <hi>direct the Spirit of the Lord, or as his Counsellours would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him,</hi> Isa. 40. Rom. 11. that it was more suitable to make use to this purpose of sinfull Men, than of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Angels.</p>
            <p>Let us sever and lay aside herein, what may at first sight, seem speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but is really not considerable in this matter, as that <hi>men,</hi> in the same miserable circumstances with those whom they are to perswade, that they may save them, will be so much the more earnest, and importunate, use so much the more pressing arguments, as having been upon the brink of hell, and the borders of destruction, for we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such as are most likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the salvation of others, to have been made sensible of their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done lost state, and to be in a way of recovery themselves. But hereupon it may also be supposed, they will
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49196:12"/>
therefore so much the more patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally plead with sinners. <hi>Their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the terrors of the Lord will urge them to perswade men,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. and make them eloquent at it. But what? more than Angels? When the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. supposes one speaking <hi>with the tongue of Men and Angels,</hi> doth he not intend a gradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and signify the latter far to excel? And are we to suppose that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity of their own natures, their kindness to man, and their perfect conformity, and obediential compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and subjection to the will of their sovereign Lord, would not have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd them to do their uttermost, if he had sent them upon such errands? we cannot doubt it. But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is apparent that what the Blessed God doth in pursuance of this saving design, he doth <hi>to the praise of the glory of his grace,</hi> and that it might appear the more conspicuous, in the whole conduct of this affair.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of any created, no not of angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49196:12"/>
power, to change the hearts of men, and turn them to God. If An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were the constant Preachers in all our Assemblies, they could not with all their heavenly eloquence convert one sinner, if the immediate Divine Power did not exert it self. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are willing in the day of <hi>his Power,</hi> who was <hi>God-man,</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3. The <hi>Jews</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> received the Law by <hi>the Dispensation of Angels, yet kept it not,</hi> Act. 7. 53.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet if God should put forth his own power, by such a Ministration: If Angels should appear in glorious aray among us, and speak to men with greater advantage, and more perswasive eloquence, than we can conceive; and marvellous effects, by divine concurrence, should ensue; Those great effects, among a sort of creatures led by sense, and who judge by the sight of the eye, would all be ascribed to the visibly glorious Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to the supreme Agent, who is invisible and out of sight; even as in effects of <hi>another kind,</hi> the <hi>invisible</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49196:13"/>
               <hi>Power and Godhead,</hi> that do all, are little regarded by stupid man, whose dull eye stays, and rests in the visible outside, and fixes his mind there too.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore the rich treasures of the Gospel are put <hi>into earthen vessels,</hi> that the <hi>excellency of the power might be,</hi> i. e. might appear to be <hi>of God, and not</hi> of the inferiour Instrument, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In this way of dispensation, wherein God speaks to men <hi>liable to the same passions with themselves,</hi> he accommodates himself to their frail state, who cannot bear glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; and to their own option and desires, who say to <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 20. 19. <hi>Speak thou to us and we will hear, but let not God speak to us lest we die.</hi> When they had heard the sound of the trumpet, and the voice of words accompanied with thunders and lightenings, they <hi>entreated that they might hear no more,</hi> Heb. 12. 19. The celestial glory, while our mold and frame is dust, doth more astonish,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49196:13"/>
than instruct. Those soft and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant words, <hi>This is my beloved Son—hear him,</hi> spoken by a <hi>voice from the excellent glory</hi> in the Transfiguration, made the Disciples that heard them <hi>sore afraid,</hi> and <hi>fall on their faces,</hi> Matt. 17.</p>
            <p>How would it unhinge the world, and discompose the whole state of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil affairs if all conversions were to be as <hi>Saul</hi>'s was, when he became <hi>Paul,</hi> with such concomitant effects, not only on himself, but all others present, especially being wrought (as most Conversions may be) in nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Assemblies, the Convert struck blind for some days, and all that were in the place, speechless! Perhaps we have one such instance to let us see how inconvenient it were, such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances should be common; or that this should be God's ordinary way of converting, and saving sinners.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The holding of men in this world under the <hi>ministery of Men,</hi> not <hi>of Angels,</hi> in reference to the affairs of their Salvation, is certainly more su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49196:14"/>
to the condition of <hi>Probationers;</hi> for eternity, and another world; and more aptly subservient to the business of the Judgment-day, when all the talents men were entrusted with, their natural endowments, and faculties, as well as additional advantages, are to be accounted for. We shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after understand better, but may, in good measure, conjecture now, why there is so <hi>fix'd a gulf</hi> by the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Counsel of God, between the two Worlds, the <hi>visible,</hi> and the <hi>invisible,</hi> and so little commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
            <p>And whereas in the Old Testament, the apparition of Angels was more frequent, that passage, <hi>the world to come,</hi> being said, <hi>not to be put in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Angels,</hi> seems to signify <hi>the time after the Messiah</hi>'s appearing should be more entirely left to the conduct of a <hi>Gospel-ministery,</hi> as the connection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5. inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And tho' the compassions of men, who have been in danger to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49196:14"/>
themselves, cannot be supposed more powerfully to influence them, unto an earnest endeavour of saving them that are in the like danger, than the kindness and benignity of Angels would do, if they were so employ'd; yet their concern to save others, who are also to be saved themselves the same way, is likely, more easily, more generally, more sensibly, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by <hi>those others,</hi> to whom they are to apply themselves, upon this account. They have kinder thoughts of one another, than they are like to have of a superiour order of creatures. Their own <hi>flesh and bloud,</hi> is nearer akin to them. Yea they are more apt to love one another (and consequently to apprehend one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love) than the Blessed God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Which is more than intimated in that of that II. Apostle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 20. <hi>He that loveth not his Brother, whom he hath seen, how shall he love God, whom he hath not seen?</hi> Things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us, not meerly <hi>as they are,</hi> but <hi>as they are understood.</hi> Ministers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49196:15"/>
be kinder to mens Souls, than the Blessed Angels, among whom there is a joy for the conversion of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, much more pure, exalted, and sublime, than an humane breast is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and in proportion, more servent desire of such conversions: But their propensions towards us, tho' they should be expressed by Counsels and Precepts that tend to our good, would be less apprehended by most men; they carrying a severity with them, which makes them need such insinuative recommendations, as slide more easily into their minds, from crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of their own Order.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Our Lord himself was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the saving of Souls, as who could be besides? But tho' before the Floud he is said to have preached to the Old world, 'twas, <hi>by his Spirit,</hi> in the Ministery of <hi>Noah,</hi> a Man like <hi>themselves,</hi> to whom he preach't. But when he thought sit to preach immediately himself, he <hi>put on flesh;</hi> and <hi>dwelt,</hi> or did tabernacle, among men as one of them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. So
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49196:15"/>
               <hi>Moses</hi> foretold. <hi>A Prophet like to me shall God raise up,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 3. 22. <hi>from</hi> Deut. 18.</note> 
               <hi>him shall you hear.</hi> So his <hi>terrour was not to make us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid.</hi> And tho' his compassionateness towards us is argued from <hi>his being tempted,</hi> and <hi>compas't with infirmities,</hi> as we are, that <note place="margin">Heb. 4. &amp; 5.</note> cannot be understood, as if hereby he became more gracious and mercifull towards us <hi>in himself;</hi> but his being so, was the <hi>more apprehensible to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. The steadiness of the Course God hath taken in this matter, shews, what his Judgment was of the <hi>fitness of it;</hi> who doth all things <hi>according to the counsel of his will,</hi> Eph. 1. 11. 'Tis observable, that when our Lord was now about to ascend, he fixes a <hi>Ministery</hi> that he promises his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence unto, <hi>always, or every day, unto the end of the world,</hi> Matt. 28. 19, 20. <hi>Ascending on high</hi> he gave (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) these <hi>gifts to men,</hi> (even <hi>to the rebellious,</hi> Psal. 68.) <hi>Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers,</hi> Eph. 4. 8,—11. And that he might
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49196:16"/>
put an honour upon <hi>this Ministery,</hi> when he designed the Gospel to be preached to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;</hi> tho' he prepares <hi>Peter,</hi> by a Vision, and sends an Angel to <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> 'twas not to preach to him, but to direct him to send for <hi>Peter,</hi> to preach to him and his; who tells him, when he fell at his feet, <hi>I also am a man,</hi> Act. 10. We are <hi>humane Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> tho' from a <hi>divine Master and Lord;</hi> and of a <hi>divine Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But now the Mind, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God being sufficiently evident in this matter, both in the <hi>fact,</hi> and in the <hi>fitness</hi> of it, to make use of such, for promoting the <hi>common salvation,</hi> as do need themselves to partake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; we come now to shew, <hi>That the Ministers of the Gospel of Christ, ought to be very intent upon the business of their own salvation,</hi> conjunctly, <hi>with that of them that hear them;</hi> and <hi>of theirs</hi> with <hi>their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>double obligation</hi> meeting upon a Minister of the Gospel; that of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and of the <hi>Law of his</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49196:16"/>
               <hi>Office;</hi> he is to comply with both. <hi>Nature</hi> obliges him to intend his own Salvation; <hi>his Office,</hi> theirs that hear him. The same Authority lays him under the one obligation, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For he that is the <hi>Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> is the <hi>Author of his Office</hi> too.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He ought so to mind the concern of his Peoples Salvation, as not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his own.</hi> This is so evident in it self, that it would be supersluous to speak to it, were it not that <hi>we,</hi> as well as <hi>they to whom</hi> we preach, do need to be <hi>put in remembrance</hi> of very important things, <hi>tho' we know them,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 12. <hi>To know,</hi> and <hi>to consider,</hi> we not only <hi>may distinguish,</hi> but do, too often, <hi>separate.</hi> And there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things to be considered to this purpose.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Royal Law,</hi> as 'tis call'd, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 8. which requires us <hi>to love our Neighbour as ones self,</hi> makes <hi>love to our selves;</hi> i. e. not meerly <hi>which we bear,</hi> but <hi>which we owe</hi> to our selves, the <hi>measure</hi> of that which we ought to have for our Neighbour. And that

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They have <hi>special advantages, for it, from their very Calling,</hi> being <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to the Gospel;</hi> taken off from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther business, to give themselves (as in this Context) <hi>wholly to this.</hi> They

are supposed therefore, to know more of the concernments of Souls; <hi>of the terrors of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. <hi>whence, therefore, they are to perswade men;</hi> of the <hi>nature of Sin,</hi> and how it entang'es mens Spirits; <hi>of the wiles of Satan,</hi> and how he waits for advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to destroy them; <hi>of the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion,</hi> and by what Arts they are endeavour'd to be subverted, or shaken: and by what <hi>means and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,</hi> they are to be demonstrated, and establisht.

to our Lord Christ, than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of this saving work, he will bountifully reward them that faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serve him in it. That <hi>if they be stedfast and immovable, abounding in</hi> this <hi>work of the Lord</hi> (as he hath not a greater, now in doing, in this world) <hi>their labour, in him, shall not be in vain.</hi> They shall hear from him, <hi>well done good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of thy Lord. If they turn many to Righteousness</hi> (or endeavour it with sincere minds) <hi>they shall shine as Stars in the Firmament.</hi> And in the mean time, the <hi>honour, and the pleasure,</hi> of serving that mighty <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> of Souls, in so glorious a design, have in them a very excellent reward; and which cannot but be esteem'd <hi>such,</hi> by a right mind.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>They are oblig'd by the exigency of their own case.</hi> They cannot, as that is stated, neglect the design of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving other mens Souls, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting their own. If they <hi>warn them not, over whom, as Watchmen they are set, they</hi> perish, but <hi>their bloud will be</hi>

            <p>And now from this <hi>conjunct</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of these <hi>two great ends,</hi> which a Minister of Christ is to propound to himself. I might proceed to consider them <hi>severally, and a part;</hi> but <hi>this</hi> the case doth not require, it being easie to sever what hath been said to <hi>the one</hi> and <hi>the other;</hi> nor do our limits al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it.</p>
            <p>We, therefore, go on to the (more necessary) <hi>Use of the whole.</hi> To this purpose, we collect,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That this World is universally in a very miserable state.</hi> For it is the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness

               <hi>believing that he is, and will be, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that diligently seek him; being redeemed</hi> to God, <hi>by the bloud of his Son,</hi> Rev. 5. 9. <hi>And who suffered once,</hi> the <hi>just for the unjust,</hi> to bring us to God, 1 Pet. 3. 18. and who upon his suffering, intercedes, for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and <hi>is able to save to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most them that</hi> come to God <hi>by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he ever lives to make intercession for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>Salvation of the Soul,</hi> this <hi>coming to God,</hi> or <hi>redemption by Christ,</hi> and his intercession thereupon, who looks after? neither the <hi>end,</hi> the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Souls, coming</hi> back <hi>to God;</hi> nor his <hi>Method</hi> for attaining this <hi>end,</hi> are regarded, or so much as thought on. To have this Flesh saved from any thing that is grievous to it, every one covets, and endeavours, in vain. It must, however, rot in the Dust, and be, in the mean time, a prey to Worms. Its own <hi>Father, Mother,</hi> and <hi>Sister,</hi> will devour it, <hi>Job</hi> 17. 14. The <hi>Father of their Spirits</hi> would <hi>save, and satisfy</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49196:26"/>
them, but <hi>him</hi> they shun, and will not know.</p>
            <p>Who that observes how men spend their days, even under the Gospel, which makes their time <hi>a day of Grace,</hi> wherein they should be <hi>working out their Salvation,</hi> can think they have any concern to be saved? Their life is continual trifling, some pass their days in mirth and jollity; doth this signify any sense of misery, or fear of perishing, and that <hi>destruction from the Almighty is a terrour to them? These</hi> are not more idle, than <hi>others</hi> are idly busie, to get Estates, and a Name on Earth; but what is this to their <hi>being saved?</hi> They are liable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, more sensible, miseries of life, and they are <hi>without God;</hi> but <hi>this</hi> is no misery with them. This misery is <hi>their element,</hi> and <hi>burdens them not.</hi> Were their <hi>present case,</hi> and <hi>future dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> in this respect apprehended, and felt, how full of outcries would this World be; <hi>O we are lost, and perishing!</hi> Such cries would ring through the Earth, and pierce Heaven! But the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49196:26"/>
same <hi>carnality that is death,</hi> and makes them miserable, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 6.</note> makes them <hi>stupid</hi> too, and <hi>insensible</hi> of their misery.</p>
            <p>And are these reasonable Souls, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent, immortal Minds and Spirits, that are thus stupify'd! turn'd into such Clods, and Stones! O deplorable case! Methinks such <hi>an Office,</hi> set up in the World, of men that are to <hi>save their own, and other mens Souls,</hi> should make them consider, and bethink themselves, <hi>what is it for?</hi> It must have had an original; and <hi>so,</hi> it hath a Divine Aspect; <hi>a tast</hi> of Heaven upon it, and must have an <hi>end,</hi> suitable to the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of Heaven, which claims to be entertain'd otherwise, than with neglect, and contempt!</p>
            <p>And indeed, this leads to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <hi>more expressly,</hi> in a further Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That there is a saving design on foot in the World.</hi> Set a foot by the Blessed God himself. Otherwise in so great a ruine as is come upon this wretched World, what could it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie?
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49196:27"/>
for <hi>any man,</hi> to offer at saving ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>himself</hi> or <hi>others?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How vain an attempt were it! for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, out of so deep and horrid a gulf, of impurity, misery, darkness and death, to think of lifting up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and of plucking up others as high as Heaven! <hi>This intimation,</hi> carries hope with it. It is a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to such as are so imploy'd, as <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> was: <hi>O save thy self, and as many as thou canst besides.</hi> It takes away all pretence for despair. God puts not men upon vain attempts. A <hi>lively hope</hi> ought to spring from hence. <hi>And we are saved by hope,</hi> Rom. 8. 24. As without Hope no man would ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign for Salvation, or any thing else. Hope is the <hi>Engine</hi> that moves the World, keeps the <hi>intelligent part</hi> of it, in action, every where. No man could rationally stir in pursuit of any design, whereof he despair'd. But as to <hi>other designs,</hi> mens hopes are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly self-sprung, and end in shame. But when one can say, <hi>Lord, thy word hath caused me to hope.</hi> Thou hast put me
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49196:27"/>
upon aiming to be saved, and to save others, it speaks this to be a just and a hopefull undertaking. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set about working out my <hi>own sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> (and with my own, <hi>other mens,</hi> as far as is within my compass) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting he will graciously set in with me, and work in order hereto, <hi>to will, and to doe, of his own good pleasure,</hi> without which, <hi>all mine</hi> will be lost labour.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We further collect, <hi>That the Blessed God is most intent upon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which this supposes, and that which it <hi>imports,</hi> speaks him <hi>intent.</hi> It <hi>supposes</hi> he hath appointed a <hi>Sovereign Saviour</hi> set over this work; otherwise, there could be none <hi>subordinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It <hi>imports,</hi> he hath settled an <hi>Office on purpose.</hi> Made it <hi>some mens</hi> special business, to intend (as every one ought) his own salvation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>to give himself up</hi> to this great work, <hi>the saving all he can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An Office</hi> set up for the <hi>saving of Souls,</hi> ought to be a great thing in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49196:28"/>
our eyes; and is a standing testimony for God, how willing he is men should <hi>come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>They that bear this Office should be highly honoured for their works sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For how glorious an employment is it, to be instrumental to Salvation! To be, in any kind, <hi>Saviours.</hi> I could tell you of some <hi>great Princes,</hi> in the <hi>Pagan</hi> world, that to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther splendid Titles, have had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, of <hi>Soter,</hi> a <hi>Saviour;</hi> as to some other, the <hi>Destroyer of Cities,</hi> hath been given as a name of reproach. And you do know who hath the name of <hi>Apollyon,</hi> or <hi>Abaddon.</hi> Rev. 9. 11</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>It highly magnifies the Wisedom, Power, and Sovereignty of God, that he can, and will, make use of so mean In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, for so high and glorious a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi> For what <hi>end and purpose</hi> can be greater, than the Recovery, and Salvation of Souls, so deformed, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, and lost, as the Souls of men, universally, were? <hi>And what Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could be meaner,</hi> or <hi>more vile,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49196:28"/>
than such as needed <hi>to be saved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> with the <hi>same Salvation?</hi> That God should make use of them <hi>who were darkness,</hi> Eph. 5. 8. <hi>to enlighten the world</hi> Matt. 5. 14. of such as were but <hi>sinfull flesh,</hi> Joh. 3. 6. to be <hi>able Ministers of the spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. of such as had <hi>minds</hi> that were <hi>cumity against God,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. <hi>to reconcile men to him!</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. These are some of the wonders he works among the children of men. When he hath <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted some</hi> to use them (first for the converting of others, and then) for the strengthening of their converted brethren.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>The Ministers of Christ are to be examples to them over whom they are set.</hi> They are to be so <hi>in the beginning of their course,</hi> in their first turn to God, tho' then, in a more passive sense, <hi>that I might be a patern,</hi> &amp;c. saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. and <hi>in their after-course;</hi> as in this Context, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation,</hi> &amp;c. They must be Leaders in the whole way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from <hi>first</hi> to <hi>last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49196:29"/>
8. <hi>Pride, in the Ministers of the Gospel, and in them that live under a Gospel-Ministery, is a most monstrous absurdity:</hi> For what are we all of us, but a company of wretched creatures, just perishing, and only (at the best) but in the way of being saved! What have such to be proud of!</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Both Christ's Ministers, and their Flocks, are under the greatest obligation imaginable unto union.</hi> For <hi>their case</hi> is one and the same; their <hi>miseries</hi> were the same, their <hi>dangers</hi> the same. They must all have the <hi>same Saviour, the same way of salvation,</hi> and the <hi>same end;</hi> the same state of salvation, which all the <hi>nations of the saved</hi> are to be brought to at last, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 24.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>'Tis an unquestionable thing, that salvation is to be designed for, by all sorts.</hi> Ministers must aim to save <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> and their <hi>hearers.</hi> And is the Minister to design his Peoples salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not <hi>they, their own!</hi> They have mean thoughts of Salvation that stumble <hi>here,</hi> as if they were only to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49196:29"/>
be saved from hell-flames! but to be saved <hi>from sin</hi> that makes us <hi>unlike God!</hi> to have his <hi>Image,</hi> and his <hi>Love</hi> perfected in us, to be with the rest <hi>of the elect, partakers of salvation,</hi> with <hi>eternal glory,</hi> is that mean? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>The Ministers of the Gospel must, sometime, or other, be taken away from their work.</hi> It is <hi>time,</hi> a limited du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, within which their work and business lies, for the <hi>saving themselves and those that hear them.</hi> They are to <hi>save themselves.</hi> This end they are to pursue; and it must sometime be attain'd. They are not alwaies to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and never rest: sometime, they are to receive the fruit of this their Labour, and the <hi>end of their Faith, the salvation of their Souls.</hi> As more time passes, their <hi>salvation</hi> draws nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer <hi>than when they believed;</hi> they are not always to be <hi>in saving,</hi> and <hi>never saved. In mercy to them,</hi> God will translate them; and may it not be in <hi>judgment</hi> to many, whom they earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured to save, but who rejected
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49196:30"/>
their counsels, and strove against their own Salvation! <hi>That they may not,</hi> always, labour in vain, <hi>for themselves,</hi> and because they have laboured in vain <hi>for many others,</hi> they must be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from their hard and toilsome labour, and <hi>enter into rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>The loss is great, and grievous, beyond all expression, above all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, when such are taken away as have made it their business, to save themselves, and those that heard them.</hi> In their endeavour <hi>to save themselves,</hi> they have been great <hi>examples.</hi> In their endeavour to <hi>save others,</hi> they may have been <hi>great Instruments,</hi> of much saving good to many a Soul. How few are they that drive such designs! how fast doth their number decrease! How fitly may we take up that of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> when the <hi>godly man ceases, and the faithful fail from among the children of men?</hi> And what could be said with greater <hi>Pathos,</hi> I sal. 12. 1. <hi>Help, Lord,</hi> as in a common Ruine; help, help, for God's sake, help, Lord, help! My Friends, are you not sensible
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49196:30"/>
you have lost such a one, even while you are not yet sav'd! while you yet need to be <hi>working out your Salvation!</hi> The effectually <hi>called,</hi> 'tis true, are saved, 2 Tim. 1. 9. <hi>Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling.—</hi>And (which is, in substance, the same thing) the <hi>Regenerate</hi> are saved: <hi>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but of his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the H. Ghost;</hi> Tit. 3. 5.</p>
            <p>But, if this were the case of you all, how much yet remains to be done, in order to your <hi>full, and consummate Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation!</hi> You have yet mighty diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to overcome. A <hi>body of death,</hi> which you are not yet delivered from.

Your <hi>adversary the Devil,</hi> that goes about seeking <hi>whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:</hi> All the Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Kingdom of Darkness, that you are to contend with, and with whom you are to dispute every step
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49196:31"/>
of your way to Heaven. And do you not need such a Leader, in that way?</p>
            <p>And if any are fall'n into drowsie Slumbers, do you not need his <hi>awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ministry?</hi> If dead, how often hath the blessed Spirit breathed life into you, by his <hi>quickening Ministry?</hi> How often hath God us'd him, to enlighten you, when you have been in the dark; to clear up the great Doctrines of the Gospel, when you have not distinctly understood them? to establish you in the Faith, when you have wavered, to resolve you in matters of practice, when you have been in doubt, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you in your fears and faintings, to comfort you, in your sadness, and sorrows! I wonder not that there are many weeping Eyes, and should much wonder, if there be not many aking, trembling Hearts among you, for what you have lost, and from an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, how hard, and, almost, hopeless it is, your loss should be soon, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually supply'd.</p>
            <p>He was long in <hi>preparing,</hi> and <hi>form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:49196:31"/>
to be <hi>what he was</hi> when you lost him.</p>
            <p>His Station among you in <hi>this Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,</hi> when first he undertook the <hi>Pastoral Charge</hi> of this <hi>Church over which the Holy Ghost made him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer,</hi> requir'd a man of as much <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> as any such Station could well be supposed to do. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how numerous, how intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and well instructed a People, he was to take the care of. I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that about 3 or 4 and 40 years ago, being desir'd to give some help, <hi>on a Lord's-day,</hi> to that eminent Servant of Christ, Mr. <hi>Greenhill,</hi> whose <hi>praise</hi> is still, in <hi>all the Churches,</hi> I then first heard <hi>him</hi> preach; and (if my Memory fail not) he had about that time in hand, some part of that excellent Discourse, of the <hi>Almost Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;</hi> I had then the opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning an acquaintance with him.</p>
            <p>His excellent good <hi>natural Parts,</hi> his <hi>ingenuous Education,</hi> his <hi>Industry,</hi> his <hi>early Labours</hi> in preaching the Gospel of Christ, in his <hi>native Country,</hi> in <hi>the</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:49196:32"/>
               <hi>City,</hi> and <hi>in this place.</hi> His <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Society,</hi> for some years, with that excellent Servant of God before named; above all, the gracious assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances he had from Heaven, gave him great advantages, to be a Minister of Christ, <hi>approved unto God, a Workman that needed not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And his multiply'd years, unto the 70th, with the continual addition thereby, to the rich Treasury of his Experiences, still improv'd him more and more: So that there being no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of his <hi>natural Endowments,</hi> and a continual increase, of his <hi>Supernatural;</hi> you had the <hi>best of him,</hi> at last, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, indeed, your loss was the greater, but your obligation was also the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that God continu'd to you the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him so long: and that in a serviceable state. But when he could be no longer serviceable in his stated, delightful work, it was by the decay, not of the <hi>inward,</hi> but the <hi>outward man;</hi> so that when he could preach to you, and converse with you no longer, he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49196:32"/>
could earnestly, and servently pray for you, to the end. And God did not afflict you, by leaving, long among you, only the shadow, the outside of the man, and of such a man!</p>
            <p>He took little pleasure in embroiling <hi>himself,</hi> or <hi>his Hearers,</hi> in needless, and fruitless Controversies. The great, substantial, Doctrines of the Gospel, were his principal study, and delight; such as lay nearest the <hi>Vitals,</hi> and the <hi>very Heart</hi> of Religion, and Godliness; and most directly tending to the <hi>saving them that heard him.</hi> The Subjects which he chose to insist upon, from time to time, in the course of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, shew'd, as to this, his Spirit, and Design. Having formed, from the H. Scriptures, that Scheme of Thoughts which satisfy'd him, and gave him a clear ground, whereupon to preach the Gospel, with an unrecoiling Heart, he lov'd not to discompose it. His Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in things which had that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, being constantly moderate, and unexceptionably sound; remote from rigorous, and indesensible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49196:33"/>
on the one hand, and the other.</p>
            <p>Hereupon he drove at his mark, without diversion; not so much aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to proselyte Souls to a <hi>Party,</hi> as to <hi>Christ.</hi> And to engage men, as much as in him lay, to be <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>thorough Christians.</hi> Hitherto tended his Sermons, from Year, to Year. The great Subject he had in hand, and which he left unfinish'd, when God took him off from his publick work, was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly pointed this way, <hi>viz. Of the Covenant of God in Christ.</hi> And his annual course, of preaching a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on <hi>May-day,</hi> to <hi>Young Men,</hi> had the same manifest scope, and aim, with which his publick Labours were concluded. God so ordering it, that his <hi>last Sermon,</hi> was this Year, on <hi>that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Judgment in reference to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Church Order, was for Union, and Communion of all <hi>visible Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, viz.</hi> of such as did visibly <hi>hold the Head,</hi> as to the principal <hi>credenda,</hi> and <hi>agenda,</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> The great
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49196:33"/>
things belonging to the <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of a Christian, so as nothing be made necessary to <hi>Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> but what Christ hath made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; or what is indeed necessary to <hi>one's being a Christian:</hi> What he publickly essay'd to this purpose, the World knows. And many more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate endeavours and strugglings of his, for <hi>such an Union</hi> I have not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with. The unsuccessful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of which endeavours, he said, not long before his last confinement, <hi>he thought would break his Heart.</hi> He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving openly, among divers persons, and with great earnestness, sometime before, exprest his consent to <hi>some Proposals,</hi> which if the Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, had agreed in the desire of the thing it self, must unavoidably have inferr'd such an Union, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to their Principles; and on such terms, as must have extended it much further; else it had signify'd little. But this must be effected, as is too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, not by meer humane endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but by an Almighty Spirit
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49196:34"/>
pour'd forth, which <hi>(after we have suffered a while)</hi> shall <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, put us into joynt, and make every joynt know its place in the Body, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. Shall conquer private Interests and Inclinations, and over-awe mens Hearts by the Authority of the Divine Law; which now, how express so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, little availeth, against such prepossessions. Till then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity will be (among us) a languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, withering thing. When the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son comes, of such an effusion <hi>of the Spirit from on high,</hi> there will be no Parties. And a midst the <hi>Wilderness-Desolation</hi> that cannot but be, till that season comes, it matters little, and signifies to me scarce one straw, what Party of us is uppermost. The most righteous (as they may be vogu'd) will be but as Briars, and scratching Thorns; and it is better to suffer by such, than be of them.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, it is a mark of God's heavy displeasure, when persons of so healing Spirits are taken away. And if it awaken any of us, <hi>that</hi> will
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49196:34"/>
tend to prepare us for the effects of it, which <hi>Preparation,</hi> seems a thing more to be hoped, <hi>than prevention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this worthy Servant of Christ sees not the woful day, whatever of it he might foresee. His removal makes, to many, indeed, <hi>a woful day,</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> all about him, did long foresee. He was long languishing, and even <hi>dying daily.</hi> But amidst surrounding death, as a Relation told me, there was no appearance of any the least Cloud upon his Spirit, that obscured the evidences of his Title to a Blessed Eternity. Being asked <hi>how he did,</hi> he said, <hi>Going home, as every honest man ought, when his work is done.</hi> He was much in admiring God's Mercies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his afflicting hand, saying, <hi>every thing on this side Hell is Mercy.</hi> That <hi>the Mercies he received were greater than his Burthens, tho' in themselves grievous.</hi> That he rested upon that promise, that his Father <hi>would lay no more upon him than he would enable him to bear. That he expected to be saved only by the Righteousness of Christ im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49196:35"/>
               <hi>to him.</hi> Tho' he well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as I had sufficient reason to know, that Christ's Righteousness is never imputed to any, but where, if the Subject be capable, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteousness also, that is no <hi>cause of our Salvation,</hi> but the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the saved.</hi> And having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore precaution'd some as were about him, not to be surpriz'd, if he went away suddenly, he repeated the Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, <hi>Come, Lord Jesus, come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and renewing the former caution, by saying, <hi>Remember what I said before;</hi> as he sat in his Chair, with all possible composure, he bow'd his head, and without sigh, or motion, expir'd in a moment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>sighing part,</hi> he left to others that stay behind. And I do even feel the Sorrows of his most afflicted Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, his mournful Widow, his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing Sons and Daughters, his desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Church, with all others that got good, or might have done by his quickning, spiritful, piercing Ministry, or had the advantage, and satisfaction
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49196:35"/>
of his acquaintance, and converse.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Grief</hi> cannot but be measured, by your <hi>Love;</hi> and your <hi>Love</hi> by <hi>his</hi> in the several kinds, and objects of it. His Conjugal, Paternal, Pastoral, Friendly Love, as he was an affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Husband, a tender Father, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant Pastor, and a pleasant Friend.</p>
            <p>But withall, let your Consolations be measur'd by the proper grounds thereof. It is a most improper, irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, unchristian way of being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in such a case, only to let time wear away our sorrows. It is but a <hi>negative,</hi> an <hi>heathenish,</hi> yea <hi>a worse than heathenish</hi> method of receiving Comfort. For I have observed it to be animadverted on, as an intolerable absurdity, by some among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that <hi>time</hi> should work that cure of Grief and Sorrow, which Reason and Prudence work not.</p>
            <p>And thus 'tis plain, we shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, not by holy <hi>thoughts,</hi> but by <hi>not thinking.</hi> So it may, in time, be forgotten, that ever such a Man as Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> was Minister in <hi>Stepney!</hi> And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49196:36"/>
what is this to Christian Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
            <p>But we need not wander from the Text for a <hi>positive,</hi> and a <hi>solid ground</hi> of Comfort. Remember it was his business <hi>to save himself, and those that heard him.</hi> As you have no doubt of <hi>his.</hi> Salvation, which I believe none of you have, <hi>make sure of your own.</hi> Put on, with the <hi>breast-plate of Faith, and Love, that helmet, the hope of Salvation.</hi> You are <hi>of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>the day, watch, and be sober, as those that are not appointed to wrath, but to obtain Salvation by Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then consider (as I doubt not many a Soul will bless God for him for ever) how glorious a sight it will be, to see him, one day, appear in the Head of a numerous company, of <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ones;</hi> and say, (as a subordinate Parent in the Apostle's sense, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15.) <hi>Lord, here am I, and the children thou hast given me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion For you of his dear, and beloved Flock, this may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective to you as well as consolatory;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49196:36"/>
would you have a Pastor after God's Heart? put your selves under the conduct, as much as in you is, of such a Pastor, as you apprehend will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, in all his Ministrations, upon this double end, to <hi>save himself,</hi> and <hi>them that hear him.</hi> And labour to <hi>be perfect, be of one mind,</hi> and <hi>live in Peace, so the God of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Love and Peace shall be with you.</hi> And <hi>remember him as one that hath had the Rule over you, and hath spoken to you the word of the Lord, and follow the Faith of such, considering the end of their Conversation;</hi> and that <hi>Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, and to day, for ever.</hi> As you change Pastors you will not need to change Christs, so as to have one yesterday, another to day, and a third to morrow. <hi>Pastors</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, as well as <hi>Priests</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law <hi>were many, because of death.</hi> But our B. Lord, <hi>because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Priesthood,</hi> Heb. 7. 24. Therefore do you never think <hi>of another</hi> Christ, as their doubt was, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 3. but cleave
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49196:37"/>
to this your great <hi>Lord with purpose of Heart,</hi> till he give you at last, <hi>an abundant entrance into his everlasting Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let his mournfull Relatives, and all of you to whom he was dear, consider, what our Lord offer'd as matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, in the most trying case, of this kind, that ever could occur to poor mortals; <hi>i. e.</hi> when <hi>he himself</hi> was to be taken away, from his <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing Family,</hi> and <hi>Followers. It is but a little while,</hi> q. d. my words have a plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <note place="margin">Joh. 16.</note> 
               <hi>A little while, and you shall not see me, and again, a little while, and you shall see me: and because I go to my Father—Ye now have sorrow, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy, and your joy no man taketh from you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the God of Peace, that brought again from the dead, our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the Bloud of the everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, make you perfect in every good work, to do his will: working in you</hi>

               <hi>that which is well-pleasing, in his sight, through Jesus Christ; To whom be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for ever, and ever.</hi>
