            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>IN the beginning when the Lord of hostes,</l>
               <l>After his image liuely face and feature;</l>
               <l>Created man in all the lands and coastes,</l>
               <l>And for their succors euery liuing creature.</l>
               <l>He did ordaine in lue thereof each day,</l>
               <l>That they should praise his blessed name for ay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>All lands and people then he did deuide,</l>
               <l>And parted them with watrie surging seas,</l>
               <l>Asundry language ouer and beside,</l>
               <l>He did appoint to men for better ease.</l>
               <l>With vnderstanding of each others minde,</l>
               <l>That so they might be to his lawes enclinde.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Which lawes or statutes were by him erected:</l>
               <l>Declaring them to man on <hi>Sinay</hi> mount,</l>
               <l>Through <hi>Adams</hi> sinnes from <hi>Paradise</hi> abiected,</l>
               <l>He vowd aday of Iudgement for account,</l>
               <l>Of euery sinne or vaine offence Comitted,</l>
               <l>Which Cannot be without his mercy quitted.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And knowing well that man of his owne nature,</l>
               <l>Was most vnapt t' obserue his holy word:</l>
               <l>He did erect his plagues for euery Creature,</l>
               <l>Ordayning for them hunger, fire and sword,</l>
               <l>And finding waighty sinnes of man abound,</l>
               <l>The whole world men and all he deeplie drownd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Sauing his seruants whome he did apoint,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Noah</hi> and his family to be in arke:</l>
               <l>God of his mercie only did anoynt,</l>

               <l>This is most credible the time is past,</l>
               <l>Approu'd of truth before we liu'd in age:</l>
               <l>The sinnes of man yet being apt to last,</l>
               <l>Procure the Lord to anger, wrath, and rage,</l>
               <l>But what should I of these things meane to write,</l>
               <l>The holy Scriptures plainly them recite.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>Considering by the aboundance of our dayes:</l>

               <l>Which is a meane that Sathan sprenges layes,</l>
               <l>To catch the sonnes of men by subtile guile,</l>

               <l>In euery land true duty to encrease,</l>
               <l>Hath plac'd a Prince to rule the people right.</l>
