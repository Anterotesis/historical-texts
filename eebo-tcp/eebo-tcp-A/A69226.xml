         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THat I may ſpeak ſomwhat of the cauſes of Atheiſme, They are many: Some men are become Atheiſts by building vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a falſe ground, by miſconſtruing and wreſting that place of <hi>Tully</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De natura De orum. lib, 1.</note> to their owne perdition: <hi>Sunt qui negant Deos habere procurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem rerum humanarum, quorum ſententia falſa eſt, quia ſic omnis religio inanis eſſet, religione autem ſublata tolleretur hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſides, &amp; magna ſequeretur vitae perturbatio &amp; confuſio.</hi> There are ſaith <hi>Tully,</hi> ſome men which deny that there is a God which taketh vpon him the care of humane affaires, whoſe opinion is euicted to be falſe, for as much as if it were ſo, all religion were in vayne, and were it not for religion, there would be no fidelitie or hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie among men, nothing but diſorder &amp; confuſion through the whole worlde. I cannot deny but religion doth maintaine ciuill gouernment, and kingdomes are beſt gouerned where men haue the greateſt feeling of religion, becauſe the feare of God hauing taken a deepe roote in mens hearts by the often preaching of the worde, doth binde ſubiects to their Princes farre more faſt then humane lawes, &amp; the feare of the Princes diſpleaſure. And I muſt needs confeſſe that the King and the whole ſtate of <hi>England</hi> are to aſcribe this long peace which we haue had, and yet doe inioy, as alſo this great increaſe of wealth, and loyaltye of the ſubiectes, more to the diligent preaching of the Miniſters then to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Magiſtrates, to Diuines then to Polititians, how little ſoeuer now Diuines be regarded, and how highly ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Polititians be eſteemed. Subiects are now more obedient to Lawes and loyall to Princes then in times paſt they haue bene, becauſe the Goſpell is more preached among them then it was in former ages. So then, it is not for feare, but for conſcience ſake, not becauſe they feare him that can kill the bodie, but becauſe they feare him that is able to deſtroy both bodie and ſoule in hell <note place="margin">Math, 10.</note> fire. And yet the Prouerb in many hath bene fulfilled, <hi>Filia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorauit matrem,</hi> that the daughter hath deuoured her owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, For religion is the mother of peace, and peace is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10639:7"/>
of religion, becauſe the preaching of Chriſtian religion hath brought peace into the worlde. All godly Diuines preach the doctrine of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul: <hi>Si fieri poteſt, quantum in vobis eſt, cum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus</hi>

                  <hi>pacem habetote,</hi> if it be poſſible and as much as lyeth in you, haue peace with all men. But this long peace which we haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed hath increaſed our riches, &amp; riches haue made vs to forget God, and ſo (like an vnnaturall daughter) peace hath deuoured religion, which bred and maintayned peace in the world. The Prophecie is verifyed: In theſe laſt dayes, ſince the mountaine of <note place="margin">Eſay, 2.</note> the houſe of God hath beene prepared in the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and hath beene exalted aboue the hilles, and all nations haue flowed vnto it, and many people haue gone &amp; ſaid: Come let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and he will teach vs his wayes, and we will walke in his pathes: our ſwordes haue beene broken into mattocks, &amp; our ſpeares into ſythes, nation hath not lifted vp a ſworde againſt nation, neither haue they learned to fight any more. The Lamb dwelling with the Wolfe hath beene in ſafetie, the Kid with the Leopard, the Cow feeding with the Beare, the Calfe with the Lyon, the ſucking Childe hath plaied vpon the hole of the Aſp, the weaned Childe hath put his hand into the hole of the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice <note place="margin">Eſay, 11,</note> without any hurt, and the reaſon is alleaged by the Prophet: Becauſe the earth was full of the knowledge of the Lord, euen as the waters that couer the ſea. This Prophecye you ſee is fulfilled. But theſe ſayings are by them miſtaken. For <hi>Tully</hi> doth not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue in this manner: that we muſt holde there is a God, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine religion, that ſo ciuill gouernment may be maintayned, and men may liue orderly in a common wealth. But his meaning is cleane contrary: that we muſt performe all ciuill duties in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth for religion ſake, and we muſt be religious for Gods ſake, becauſe there is a God which hath ingraffed religion in our hearts, whereby ciuill ſtates may be the better maintayned, and which will puniſh all ſuch as are not religious, that is, which haue not a true feeling of religion. And it was not the meaning of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> that after the knowledge of true religion had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted peace among vs, and peace had brought proſperitie, then we ſhould ceaſe to be religious, &amp; ſo forget God, but rather increaſe our zeale, and hauing receiued ſuch benefits at his hands whome
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10639:7"/>
we ſerue, continue faithfull in his ſeruice.</p>
               <p>A ſecond cauſe of Atheiſme may be the want of due &amp; right hearing of the worde preached, becauſe faith commeth by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore where there is a want of hearing faith fayleth, <note place="margin">Rom, 10.</note> and, by a conſequent, Pagiſme and infidelitie increaſeth. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them doe not heare, but abſent them-ſelues, or if they be preſent, they ſtand not for figures but for cyphers, they doe not by the worde preached as the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did by the ſayings of <note place="margin">Luc, 2.</note> our Sauiour Chriſt, which layed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp in her heart: or as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen, 18.</note> did by the Angels, which receiued them into his houſe, or as the <hi>Sunamite</hi> woman did by <hi>Elizeus,</hi> or the widowe by <hi>Elias,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Reg, 4. 1 Reg, 17.</note> which entertayned them with willingnes. The worde to them is not as the raine of heauen falling vpon the earth, or the deawe of <note place="margin">Deut, 11. Pſal, 133. Math, 7, &amp; 15 Matb, 13. Math, 10.</note> Hermon vpon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> but as the Childrens bread caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whelpes, or pearls caſt before ſwine, ſeede ſowen by the high way ſide, &amp; the peace of the Apoſtles beſtowed vpon vnworthye houſes, and therefore returneth backe againe. They ſtop their cares with the Adder, or ſleep with <hi>Eutichus,</hi> or make loue as the <note place="margin">Act, 20. Ezech, 23.</note> Egiptians did to <hi>Aholah</hi> and <hi>Aholibah,</hi> cloathed with blewe ſilke and diuers ſuites, pleaſant young men, that they may ſet <hi>Aholah</hi> and <hi>Aholibah</hi> on fire, bruiſe the breſtes of their virginitye, and powre out their adulterie vpon them, as the Prophet ſpeaketh. Some heare the Preacher with great attention, but as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies <note place="margin">Math, 22.</note> did our Sauiour to intrappe him in his ſpeech, to take excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt his wordes, as the Athenians did S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſcoffe at <note place="margin">Act, 17.</note> his ſimplicitie, they read the Bible but as <hi>Porphurye</hi> did, to finde (as they prophanely call them) abſurdities and contradictions in the worde of God, not as the Bee which gathereth honye, but as the Spider which ſucketh poyſon out of wholſome flowers.</p>
               <p>A third cauſe of Atheiſme, proceedeth from the long ſuffring of God, which doth not preſently puniſh Atheiſts. For he doth not onely with patience ſuffer them to blaſpheme his holy name, but alſo in his wiſdome which no man can ſound, &amp; in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes whome no man can ſearch, bleſſeth them with worldly bleſſings, as if he did reward their vngodlines. It is not my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint alone, but it is the complaint of the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> which <note place="margin">Pſalm, 10.</note> cryeth out in this manner: Why ſtandeſt thou ſo farre off ô Lord and hydeſt thee in due time, euen in affliction? the wicked hath

made boaſt of his owne hearts deſire, and the couetous bleſſeth himſelfe, he contemneth the Lord, he is ſo proud that he ſeeketh not for God, he thinketh alwaies there is no God, his wayes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies proſper, he ſaith in his heart: I ſhall neuer be moued, nor be in danger. Nay it may very well be ſaid, as it was of <hi>Iob:</hi> that the Lord hath made an hedge about him &amp; his houſe, and about <note place="margin">Iob, 1,</note> all that he hath on euery ſide, he hath bleſſed the worke of his handes, and his ſubſtance is encreaſed in the Land. The Lord ſuffred his owne Arke to be taken by the Philiſtins his enemies, <note place="margin">1, Sam, 4</note> and his owne people the Irae<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lites which fought his battle, to be ouerthrowne in the battell. And this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation is giuen of the godly King <hi>Ioſias,</hi> that he read the lawe of the Lord before the people, he made a couenant with the Lord that the people ſhould <note place="margin">2, Reg. 23</note> walke after the Lord, and keep his commandements, his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies &amp; ſtatutes, with all their hearts, all their ſoules, &amp; all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtood to the couenant, he purged the Temple, and put downe the Idols, he ſlewe the idolatrous Prieſts, he kept ſuch a paſſeouer in honour of God, as neuer the like was holden, from the daies of the Iudges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iudged <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor in al the daies of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> &amp; the Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> he tooke away the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which had familier ſpirits and the ſooth-ſayers, and the Images, and the Idols, and all the abhominations that were eſpyed in the Land of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> that like vnto him there was no King before him that turned to the Lord with all his heart, all his ſoule, and all his might, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> neither after him aroſe there any like him. And yet, ſee how the Lord rewarded him. The very next thing which followeth in the ſame Text, is this: <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao</hi> ſlewe him at <hi>Megiddo.</hi> Thus you ſee how the Lord rewarded faithfull <hi>Ioſias</hi> which ſerued him, &amp; truſted in him, with death in this worlde, and ouerthrowe in ſighting of his owne battell, and gaue the victory to <hi>Pharao</hi> an heathen King, which put no truſt nor conſidence in him. Likewiſe <hi>Nabucodonozor</hi> burned Gods <note place="margin">2, Reg, 25</note> houſe, robbed his Temple in contempt of him and his ſeruice, &amp; yet God proſpered him as if he had rewarded him for ſo dooing, <hi>

landes as he did <hi>Egipt</hi> for not letting his people goe, no dout but <note place="margin">Exod, 8</note> Atheiſme would ceaſe, and vngodly men would confeſſe that there is a God. It is a ſigne that our ſinnes are great, and God doth not loue vs as he loued them.</p>
               <p>And yet the Atheiſts haue but miſtaken all this while, for theſe be arguments rather to proue vnto them that there is a God. For this is the Lords long ſuffering to bring them to repentance as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth ſaying: The Lord is not ſlack as ſome men <note place="margin">2 Pet, 3.</note> account ſlacknes, but is pacient towards vs, and would haue no man to periſh, but would haue all men to come to repentance. And as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: Thou ô man, deſpiſeſt thou the riches of <note place="margin">Rom, 2.</note> his bountifulnes, and patience, and long ſuffering, not knowing that the bountifulnes of God leadeth thee to repentance? but thou after thine hardnes, and heart that cannot repent, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt vp as a treaſure vnto thy ſelfe wrath againſt the day of wrath &amp; of the declaration of the iuſt iudgement of God. But therefore the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Pſalme aboue rehearſed, where he <note place="margin">Pſal, 10.</note> ſaith: The wicked hath made boaſt of his hearts deſire, his waies alwayes proſper: he inſerteth theſe wordes in the middle of the ſentence: Thy iudgements ô Lord are farre aboue his ſight. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth fully ſatisfie this point, where he ſaith: <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na miſerecordia ad impios &amp; ingratos peruenit.

Secondly, that ſome of them conſidering theſe thinges, might repent them of their ſinnes. Thirdly, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome deſpiſing the riches of his longanimitye might heape vp
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10639:9"/>
wrath vnto themſelues. Fourthly, the patience of God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and allure the wicked to repentance, euen as the ſcourge of God doth inſtruct the godly vnto patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Fiftly, becauſe thath ſeemed good to the prouidence of God to prepare in an other worlde ioyes for the righteous, whereof the vnrighteous ſhall not be partakers, and puniſhments for the wicked which the godlye ſhall not feele. And, laſt of all, if all offences were now puniſhed with temporal puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, it wold be thought that nothing were reſerued for the day of iudgement, as contrarywiſe, if nothing were puniſhed temporallye in this worlde, men would make a dout of Gods prouidence.</p>
               <p>A fourth cauſe of Atheiſme is the malice of Sathan, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſheweth vs: If (ſaith he) our Goſpell be yet hidden, it is <note place="margin">2 COL 4.</note> hidden to them which are loſt, in whome the God of this world hath blinded the mindes, that is, of the infidels that the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould not ſhine in them. Beholde Sathan his malice and cunning, from time to time. In the firſt two hundred yeares after the Paſſion of our Sauiour Chriſt, he buſied himſelfe about the firſt Article of the Creed to ouerthrow that, and therefore ſtirred vp the Marcioniſts, the Gnoſties, the Maniches to teach that there was not one God the Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightye maker of heauen and earth, but diuers Gods. But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not his ſucceſſe therein anſwerable to his malice, ceaſed there and went to an other Article, and ſo ſtirred vp <hi>Praxeas, Noetus, Paulus Sanioſatanus</hi> to ouerthrowe the diuinitye of our Sauiour Chriſt his Sonne, afterwad haeretickes to diſproue his conception by the holy Ghoſt, his birth of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the other Articles of fayth which are to be beleued concerning him. Being not able to preuaile therein, he deſcended to the Article of the holy Ghoſt, and ſo ſtirred vp <hi>Macedonius</hi> to deny the Godhead of the holy Ghoſt. Being not able to preuaile therein he went to the Articles concerning the Church, and ſo in ſundrye ages hath gone from one Article to an other, vntill he hath gone ouer all the Articles of the Creed. Now, being diſproued in them all, he doth not ſo reſt, but returneth againe to the firſt at which he began, not to proue a multiplicitie of Gods as he did before ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, but to proue a nullitie of any God, by diſprouing the God-head either of the Father, or of the Sonne, or of the holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10639:10"/>
of all three; But he goeth to worke with greater violence, to chop off all fayth, all religion at one blowe, by prouing that there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a God, and to this purpoſe hath he armed his Polititians with arguments againſt the Bible. But to them may be applyed the wordes of <hi>Policarpus</hi> to <hi>Marcian</hi> the haereticke, who being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him: <hi>Agnoſcis me</hi> ô <hi>Policarpe?</hi> Doſt thou acknowledge me ô <hi>Policarpus?</hi> anſwered him: <hi>Agnoſco te eſſe primogenitum Satanae,</hi> I knowe thee very well, thou art the ſonne and heire of the Deuill.</p>
               <p>The laſt cauſe of Atheiſme is the lenitye and ouer great mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Princes and Gouernours, which doe ſuffer Atheiſts to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape vnpuniſhed. I may iuſtly ſay it is their fault that there are Atheiſts that will ſuffer Atheiſts, For ſo ſaith the holye Ghoſt concerning <hi>Azariah</hi> the King of <hi>Iudah:</hi> He did vprightly in the <note place="margin">2, Reg, 15</note> ſight of the Lord, according to all that his Father <hi>Amaziah</hi> did: but the high places were not taken away, for the people yet offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and burned Incenſe in the high places. And the Lord ſmote the King, &amp; he was a leper vnto the day of his death. The King him-ſelfe you ſee is commaunded to be a godly man, not he, but his ſubiects committed idolatrye, yet God puniſheth him for the idolatrye of his ſubiects, But that could not ſtand with the iuſtice of God to puniſh the King for his ſubiects offences vnles it were the Kings faulte that the ſubiects offended. Where the Spaniſh Inquiſition is, it is a very rare thing to heare of an Atheiſt, which I ſpeake not to that end as if I did wiſh that Inquiſition to be brought into any Chriſtian Kingdome, but onely to ſhewe that it is better to liue where there is too much ſeueritie rather then too much looſenes, and where nothing is lawfull, rather then where all things are permitted as if they were lawfull. The Lord of his mercy ſtirre vp the hearts of all his annoynted Princes, &amp; inflame their Zeale, that they may not onely hate Atheiſme, as I hope they doe, with a perfecte hatred, but alſo baniſh ſuch impietye, that heereafter not onely the opinions but alſo the verye name of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt may be as it were buried in hell, and no more heard of in their Kingdomes.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How Atheiſme may be rooted out of all Chriſtian landes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS proſperitie cauſeth many men to forget God, and others to denye God: ſo aduerſitie, ſicknes, impriſonment &amp; ſuch like chaſtiſements of God for ſinne, will make wicked men not onely to acknowledge &amp; confeſſe God, but alſo to ſtoop downe before him, and to flye for ſuccour vnto him. When <hi>Iulian</hi> the apoſtata was deadly wounded by a dart from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he could not be ſilent, but that plague extorted out of his mouth a confeſſion of the power of Ieſus Chriſt whome before he had denyed, &amp; he cryed out: <hi>Viciſti Galilaee,</hi> Ieſus of <hi>Galile</hi> the conqueſt is thine. Though <hi>Pharao</hi> in his proſperitie had ſaid: who is the Lord? I <note place="margin">Exod, 5.</note> knowe him not, I will not let the people goe: yet when his land was plagued with Frogges, he called for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> and ſaid: Pray ye for me vnto the Lord, that he may take away the Frogges from me and from my people, and I will let the people <note place="margin">Exod, 8.</note> goe, that they may doe ſacrifice to the Lord, But as ſoone as God gaue him a little reſt, that the plague ceaſed, he was hardned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. When the hand of the Lord was heauye vpon the men of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> and he deſtroyed them and ſmote them with Emeroides <note place="margin">1 Sam, 5.</note> they remoued the Arke out of the houſe of <hi>Dagon,</hi> and ſaid: Let vs ſend the Arke of God vnto his owne place, that he ſlay vs not, and our people. When <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> was depriued of his <note place="margin">Dan, 4.</note> Kingdome, and turned into an Aſſe to graze in the field for the ſpace of ſeuen yeares: then he began to be humble, to vnderſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and himſelfe better, to lift vp his eyes to heauen, to giue thankes to the moſt high, to praiſe and honour him that liueth for euer, to confeſſe that his power is an euerlaſting power, that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome indureth from generation to generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nts of the earth are reputed as nothing, that according to his will he worketh in the armye of heauen, and in the inhabitants of the earth, that none can ſtay his hand, nor ſay vnto him, what doſt thou? Then he could make both an humble &amp; a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and ſay: I <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> prayſe, and extoll, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10639:11"/>
the King of heauen, whoſe workes are all truth, and his waies iudgement, and thoſe that walke in pride he is able to abaſe. But for as much as now ſuch miracles doe ceaſe, and it belongeth to Gods annointed Kings to be ielous of his glory, if they wil aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Atheiſme out of their Kingdomes: firſt of all they muſt withdrawe their countenace from all vngodly liuers. For ſo long as the Prince dooth looke cheerfully vpon them, the eyes of the people will be defixed vpon them alſo, they will admire them, and think their vices to be vertues. You know what <hi>Hamon</hi> ſaid: <note place="margin">Eſther, 6.</note> Thus ſhall he be honoured whome the King doth honour: and againe the argument muſt followe aſwell on the contrary ſide: Thus, and thus, ſhall he be diſhonoured whome the King doth diſhonour, You are not ignorant of the ſaying of <hi>Salomon: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignatio</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pro, 19, &amp; 20</note> 
                  <hi>Regis eſt nuncius mortis,</hi> The diſpleaſure of the King is but a fore-runner of death. If the King giue countenance to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, the people will reſpect them by his example, if he frowne vpon them, the people will trample ouer them. The King is like the <hi>maior</hi> prepoſition in a Sillogiſme, the people are like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. But it is a moſt certaine rule in Logicke: <hi>Concluſio ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur deteriorem partem.</hi> If the <hi>maior</hi> be negatiue or perticuler, the concluſion will bee ſo, if any thing bee worſer then other in the King the people wil be ſure to followe that.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they muſt be aſſiſting vnto their Miniſters. For God in the Primitiue Church gaue them the gift of working miracles to credit their office and calling whereby they did chaſtiſe Gods enemies. So S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtroke <hi>Elymas</hi> the ſorcerer with blindenes <note place="margin">Act. 13.</note> for peruerting and ſeducing the Deputye from the fayth. And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> ſtroke <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saephira</hi> with preſent death for telling a <note place="margin">Act, 5.</note> lye to the holy Ghoſt. And becauſe miracles after a ſhort time were to ceaſe, our Sauiour Chriſt left the ſworde of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in his Church to be in place of miracles, and to continue vnto the end of the worlde. And ſince the Church hath no other ſword now, but the ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſure of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, which is ſo greatly diſpiſed: if it would pleaſe God to put it the hearts of Princes to ſtrengthen excommunication with their Princely authoritye, to adde the ſworde of the Kingdome to the keyes of the Church, not to ſuffer any perſon that is noted of impietye to dwell in the lande, none that is <hi>tanquam Publicanus &amp; Ethnicus,</hi> as an heathen
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10639:11"/>
or infidell to dwell among Chriſtians, but to deliuer them ouer to the hang-man whome the Church hath deliuered ouer to Suthan, vnles they he heartily openitent, and ſpeedily reformed: no dout but then God would be better knowne in <hi>Iuda,</hi> and his name in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> would be greater. I ſay, if any man be an Atheiſt, let him not be honoured among the people, but let him haue <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Reg. 21.</note> his entertainment, which was to be fed with the bread of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and water of affliction, or let him be baniſhed out of the lande, not by <hi>Ostraciſme,</hi> as <hi>Ariſt<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>des</hi> was for his vertues, but as <hi>Ouid</hi> was for his vices, and that I may vſe the phraſe of the holy Ghoſt, let his houſe be made a Takes. As <hi>Tully</hi> wiſhed, that it <note place="margin">Dan, 3.</note> were written in euery mans forhead what he thought of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſo true-hearted ſubiectes might be knowne from Traytours: ſo, I wiſh it were written in all mens forheads, what they think of God and of Chriſtian religion. We can iudge no farther of them then wee heare by their blaſphemy, and prophane wordes which they vtter, &amp; ſee by their looſe liues and conuerſations. But ſo farre we may iudge as we heare and ſee, and we finde there are ſo many, that we haue good cauſe to crye out with the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> and to ſay: Help Lord help, there <note place="margin">Pſal. 12.</note> is not a godly man left, for the faithful are fayled from among the children of men, they ſpeak deceitfully euery one with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, flattering with their lippes, and ſpeake with a double heart, the Lord cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that ſpeaketh proud thinges. Thus much I am fare: there is no policye to religion, no wiſdome to well doing, and moſt firme is the eſtate of that man, be he high or of lowe degree, which procureth God to be his freind.</p>

and firme vnder our feet that we cannot ſinke, we muſt confeſſe ô ſonne <hi>Tatius</hi> that there is one which is Lord &amp; maker of theſe thinges, for it is impoſſible that euery thing ſhould continue in due place, number and meeaſure, and ſo iuſt a preportion ſhould be obſerued without a maker, and who could make theſe thinges but God? therfore there is a God. To this booke of nature agreeth the booke of the Bible, who ſaith: The heauens <note place="margin">Pſalm, 19.</note> declare the power of God, the firmament ſheweth the worke of his handes, one day teacheth another, &amp; one night giueth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to another. Againe, the wrath of God is reuealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <note place="margin">Rom, 1.</note> againſt all vngodlynes and vnrighteouſnes of men, which detaine the truth of God in vnrrighteouſnes, for aſmuch as that which may be knowne of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it vnto them, for the inuiſible thinges of him, that is, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall power and Godhead are ſeene by the creation of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lde, being conſidered in his workes, to the intent that they ſhould be without excuſe. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith: he couereth him ſelfe with light as with a garment, and ſpreadeth the heauens like a curtayne, he <note place="margin">Pſal, 104.</note> layeth the beames of his chamber in the waters, maketh the clowdes his chariots, and walketh vpon the winges of the winde. In which wordes, I doe not preſſe them with the authoritye of the Scriptures, becauſe the Scriptures are not of ſufficient credit with them, but with the reaſons which are vſed in the Scriptures, which if they cannot anſwer, they muſt yeild vnto, and confeſſe that there is a God. And therefore I conclude againſt them in this manner: We ſee dayly effects before our eyes in all the elements, continuall motions in the heauens, but there can be no effecte without a cauſe, there can be no motion without a mouer, no action without an agent, no worke without a workeman: theſe be relatiues, and therefore one could not be without the other. <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus</hi> could ſay: <hi>Statuam ſiue imaginem fieri ſine ſtatuario aut pictore nemo dicit.

It is blindenes, it is impietye, it is groſſe to entertaine ſuch a conceit. So then we take theſe for vndouted principles in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10639:13"/>
naturall Phioſophye that they may not be denyed, to witte: Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect hath his cauſe, euery action his agent, euery motion his mouer. But, as there be many ſecondary cauſes, agents &amp; mouers, ſo there muſt needes be one principall and aboue the reſt. There is <hi>ordo cauſarum, qui in rerum natura non procedit in infinitum,</hi> an order of cauſes ſub-ordinate one to an other, and therefore there is no infinite aſcention vp in the ſubordination of cauſes, but at the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth by aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we muſt come to the higheſt, &amp; we muſt in <hi>ea conſiſtere,</hi> ſtay when we come there, becauſe we can goe no higher, and that is God. What naturall body ſoeuer is moued, I ſay it is moued by ſome other which is higher then it ſelfe. For example: The ſphere of the Moone which is the loweſt of the heauens, is moued by the ſpheare of <hi>Merc.</hi> which is higher the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, <hi>Mer.</hi> is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by <hi>Venus</hi> which is higher then it, <hi>Venus</hi> by the Sun, the Sun by <hi>Mars, Mars</hi> by <hi>Iupiter, Iupiter</hi> by <hi>Saturne, Saturne</hi> by the ſphere of the fixed ſtaries, and ſo we aſcend vntill we can goe no higher, that is vnto the heauen which is called <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> firſt &amp; higheſt body w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is ſubiect to motion &amp; volubility. That alſo is moued aſwell as the reſt, not of it ſelfe, becauſe no naturall bodye can moue it ſelfe, therefore it hath motion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome other, not from any other bodye, becauſe there can be no other bodye aboue the higheſt, therefore it muſt of neceſſitye be moued by that which is a Spirit and not a bodye, not naturall but meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſicall, <note place="margin">Phiſic: l, 2. c, 1</note> and that can be nothing elſe but God. In like manner, the Sunne and a man doe beget a man, the Sunne &amp; putrifaction doe engender Flyes, and theſe thinges being ſubiect to outward ſenſes are therefore naturall bodyes, and becauſe they are naturall bodyes they haue foure cauſes, two inward which are matter and forme, and two outward efficient and finall, and there is nature which hath his ſecret motion, tell me therefore what is that? You will ſay peraduenture that is nature which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defineth to be <hi>principium motus</hi> the beginning of motion: you ſay rightly, but that is inward, therefore you muſt beſides this aſſigne an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſe of motion, and what is that? If you ſay the ayre, that is but a middle cauſe, and therefore you muſt aſcend higher, for, if there be <hi>cauſa media,</hi> there is alſo <hi>prima,</hi> if there be a midde or ſubordinate cauſe, there is alſo a principall and firſt cauſe. And what is that, but onely God, that is <hi>cauſa cauſarum</hi> the cauſe of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10639:14"/>
all other cauſes, and from whence all other thinges haue their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Againe, all agents doe not worke alike, for one thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of neceſſitye, and that is nature, an other thing worketh (in theſe outward and indifferent thinges) partly of will, and partly of neceſſitye, &amp; that is man, there you ſee <hi>medium participationis,</hi> a meane which participateth with the extremitye, but there can be no meane without two extreames, and there can be no one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame without the other, and therefore of neceſſitye there muſt be a third agent which worketh freely as nature worketh of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitye, and man partly of will &amp; partly of neceſsitye. And that can be nothing elſe, but <hi>Deus liberrimum agens,</hi> euen God which worketh freelye that no power is able to withſtand his worke. Therefore I conclude this point with <hi>Iob:</hi> Aske the beaſtes and they will teach thee, the foules of the heauen, and they will ſhewe <note place="margin">Iob, 12.</note> thee: ſpeake to the earth, and it will tell thee: the fiſhes of the ſea, and they ſhall declare vnto thee: who is ignorant of all theſe, but the hand of the Lord hath made all theſe?</p>
               <p>Secondly, to leaue the work-manſhip of the whole worlde, and to come to man alone which is but one little part of the ſame. If man goe no farther then him ſelfe, he ſhall ſee God moſt liuely in him ſelfe three manner of wayes: Firſt in his conſcience and vnderſtanding, Secondly in his naturall inclination he hath to religion, Thirdly in the excellencye of the work-manſhip both of his bodye and his ſoule. Concerning the firſt: I ſay there is in euery man at ſome time or other an inward feeling of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which wil he nill he, maketh him to confeſſe there is a God. For, ſuppoſe a man for his wickednes to be a monſter of men, a very ſlaunder and reproch to mankinde, as <hi>Nero</hi> was that ſlewe his Mother, his Maſter and him ſelfe: when he hath committed any haynous crime, he doth in his conſcience ſee that God doth behold it, that God doth purſue him, that God wil worke reuenge although there be no witnes to accuſe him, no humane power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue him to execute iuſtice vpon him. I will not dwell vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, neither wil I inſtance in <hi>Adam,</hi> which as ſoone as euer he had eaten the Apple hid him ſelfe from the preſence of God <note place="margin">Gen, 3.</note> in the thicket: in <hi>Herod</hi> which when he had beheaded <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt wrongfully, did think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was haunted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt <note place="margin">Math, 14.</note> his ghoſt, ſaying of Chriſt: ſurely this is <hi>Iohn</hi> riſen from the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10639:14"/>
dead, nor in <hi>Cain</hi> which but intending to murther his brother, <note place="margin">Gen, 4.</note> watched a time when he was in the field out of the ſight of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. I will not alleadge the authoritye of the Prophet which ſaith: <hi>Impius fugit, nemine perſequente.</hi> The wicked man flyeth <note place="margin">Pro, 28.</note> when no man doth purſue him: And of the Apoſtle which ſaith, <note place="margin">Rom, 2.</note> The Gentils which haue not the lawe written (meaning the Bible) yet haue by nature the effect of the lawe of God written in their hearts, their conſcience bearing witnes, and their thoughts accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or excuſing one an other: becauſe they thinke the Bible to be a partiall iudge, and no way competent betweene them &amp; vs, and therefore I will alleadge one or two examples out of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Authors tending to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>Tully</hi> pleading for a <note place="margin">Oratione pro. <hi>S. Roſcio</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morine.</note> man which was accuſed as a Parecide, or one which had murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his owne father, alleageth this as an eſpeciall proofe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, that in the whole courſe of his behauiour after his father was ſlayne, nothing could be obſerued in him which did ſauour of a troubled conſcience. And for the better cleering of <hi>Sextus Roſcius</hi> whoſe cauſe was then in hand, he alleageth a former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a father and his ſonne, which in their trauayle tooke vp their lodging, and after ſupper lay together in one bed: the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe after, the maſter of the houſe comming by chance into the chamber, found the father ſtrangled in his bed and the ſonne ſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by his ſide: when the matter was examined by the Iudges, the ſonne was acquitted by the equitye of the lawe as a man inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, becauſe it was then held and by them ſo adiudged to be a matter impoſſible, that he ſhould in ſo ſhort a time haue ſlept if ſo be that he had committed murther. A man ſaith <hi>Tully</hi> which <note place="margin">Pro, 15</note> hath ſlayne his father, ſhall feele a thouſand vexations and furyes of hell tormenting his conſcience, according to that ſaying of the <note place="margin">Eſay, 57.</note> wiſe man: A good conſcience is a continuall feaſte, but <hi>non eſt pax impijs,</hi> no inward peace, no quietnes of conſcience with ſuch men as are notoriouſlye wicked.

And for this cauſe namely, that men by the inſtinct of nature doe incline to religion, and a man is as much diſtinguiſhed from a beaſt by his feeling of religion as by his reaſonable ſoule; After the floud, <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus</hi> and <hi>Menna</hi> preſcribed lawes and rules of religion to the Aegiptians, <hi>Meliſſus</hi> to the Cratians, <hi>Ianus,</hi> to the Latines, <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Pompilius</hi> to the Romanes, <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Cadmus</hi> to the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, aſwell as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to the Hebrues, the difference onely this, that the Hebrues were in the right way, al the reſt in the wrong.

               <p>And that I may deſcend vnto the work-manſhip of man to ſhewe that there is a God, It is truely ſaid, that <hi>hominis fabricatio eſt innumeris Dei teſtimonijs ornata,</hi> the verye work-manſhip of man him ſelfe doth aboundantly witnes that there is a God. Let vs therefore firſt of all looke into the ſoule of man, and afterward into the ſtate of his bodye. There is in it not onely an infinite ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitye, in ſo much that the more it knoweth, the more it is able to learne, It is able to conceiue not onely the whole worlde, but alſo two worldes, yea infinite worldes, It is of infinite deſire <note place="margin">Pro, 27.

by the ſame artes. An Arithmetician cannot proue by Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticke that <hi>Omnis numerus eſt par aut impar,</hi> euerye number is euen or odde. The Muſitian cannot proue by his owne Arte that two crotchets make a quauer, becauſe theſe be principles of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticke and Muſicke.

But foraſmuch as Diuinitye is the higheſt, it is enough for vs to belceue the principles thereof without farther ſerching, and happy is the man which ſeeth not the reaſon how they ſhould be ſo, and yet belecueth that they are ſo. No man hath ſeene God at any time, becauſe he is inuiſible. <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith: <hi>Vtioculus, it a anima, ſereliqua videns ſeipſum non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det,</hi>

               <p>The Philoſophers, as S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, ſeeking after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Magiſter ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. L. 1. diſt. 3.</note> of God, found that he could not be a body, &amp; therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that he was farre more excellent then all bodyes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Spirit: that he could not be ſubiect to change, and therfore that he was aboue all bodyes and ſoules which are ſubiect to alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: that all mutable thinges haue their beginning from that which is without all ſhadowe of change or mutabilitye, and that hee which is not thus ſubiect is ſimply of him ſelfe depending of nothing but all other thinges haue their dependance on him.</p>
               <p>Againe, they conſidered that al ſubſtances are other bodyes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10639:21"/>
or Spirits, and that a Spirit is more excellent then a bodie, but that to be moſte excellent which hath made both the bodie and the Spirite. They conſidered likewiſe, that the ſhape of the body is diſcerned by the outward ſences, and the ſpirit is perceaued by the vnderſtanding, but that which is onely vnderſtood is better then that which is ſeene, and that there was ſomething more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then both theſe, &amp; by ſo many waies God is known. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for aſmuch as God is one ſimple eſſence, not compounded of any partes, not conſiſting of any accidents, and yet ſubſiſting, and the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of him in the plurall number ſaying: <note place="margin">Ro. 1</note> the inuiſible things of him are ſeene by the creation of the worlde becauſe the truth of God is knowne and perceaued by many meanes through the thinges which he hath made: by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his creatures is vnderſtood his eternitie, by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them his omnipotencie, by the excellent order wherby he hath diſpoſed them his wiſdome, by his gouernment and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of them in that comely and decent order, his goodnes, and all theſe thinges doe belong to the vnitie of his ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Therefore not to ſpeake of the authoritie of the holy Bible, where at the Baptiſme of our Sauiour, the bleſſed Trinitie did ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly appeare, the Father in a voice, the Sonne in a man, the holy <note place="margin">Mat. 3,</note> Ghoſt in a doue, how in the beginning the Father made, the Son ſpake, and the holy Ghoſt mooued vpon the waters, <hi>Bara elohins</hi>

                  <hi>creauit dij, ſeu Deus Trinus,</hi> a verbe of the ſingular number is Ioyned to a nominatiue caſe of the plurall to ſhew that theſe three <note place="margin">Gen, 18</note> are one, how when three Angels came to <hi>Abraham</hi> his houſe, he proſtrated himſelfe to them as vnto God, which could not bee <note place="margin">Eſay, 6.</note> without the crime of idolatrie, vnleſſe they had bin God: howe ſometimes he ſpake to them in the plurall number as vnto three perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; ſometimes in the ſingular as vnto one God: how the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels crie in heauen, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth, three times holy &amp; once Lord to ſhow that there were three perſons &amp; one God. But if I come onely to ſhewe the backe partes of God, ſo farre as by earthlie compariſons he may be made manifeſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinfull man: the Atheiſt doth aske how it can ſtand, with ſence &amp; reaſon that three ſhould be one, and one ſhould be three? Firſt let the Atheiſt take example by <hi>Olimpius</hi> the <hi>Arrian,</hi> which waſhing himſelfe in the Bathe contempteouſly asked how this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10639:21"/>
might be? but was ſuddenly diſtroyed by three fierie dartes ſent <note place="margin">Saballius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oe ad, 8, L. C. 11,</note> from heauen, and the pointes of theſe three ioyning all in one, to teach others by his example, howe it is neceſſarie to beleeue, but no way ſafe to make a doubt of the principles of Diuinitie, and to call into queſtion ſuch deep miſteries of our faith, and yet to ſhew that three might be one, and one three.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the number of three are one number, &amp; yet three vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Arithmetic, a triangle is three angles and one figure in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie, three gimballes compacted together are one ring, &amp; yet three as they be diſioyned, and concerning theſe things do doubt is made. So you ſee by familiar examples how one may be three, and theſe three notwitſtanding one.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the Sunne which ſhineth in the firmament, there are the bodie of the Sunne, the brightnes which proceedeth from the body, and the heate which procedeth from them both. So in the Trinitie, there is the Father from whome all thinges are, the Sonne which is the brightnes of his Fathers glorie, and ingrauen forme of his perſon, and the holy Ghoſt, which is the heate and <note place="margin">Heb, 1</note> loue of them both.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the fire there are light, flame, &amp; heate, the fier can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deuided, neither can the Trinitie. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, there are three powers and faculties of the ſoule of man, the memorie, the vnderſtanding, and the will, theſe three are ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faculties, yet the ſoule is one. All theſe three doe comprehend <note place="margin">Aug: de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate, Lib. 4</note> one another. For man remembreth that he hath memorie, will, and vnderſtanding. The vnderſtanding likewiſe comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth al three, for man vnderſtandeth that he hath vnderſtanding, will and memorie. The will comprehendeth all three, for man is willing that he ſhall will, vnderſtand, and remember. So the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comprehendeth him ſelfe, the Sonne &amp; the holy Ghoſt, the Sonne comprehendeth himſelfe, the Father and the holy Ghoſt, the holy Ghoſt comprehendeth himſelfe, the Father &amp; the Son.</p>
               <p>Sixtlye, that which vnderſtandeth, &amp; that which is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, are all one, when the minde reflected vpon it ſelfe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth it ſelfe. So, God the Father from euerlaſting vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe begat his Sonne coeternall with himſelfe: as a vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is not of any other, but of it ſelfe, and yet begetteth a vnitie of it ſelfe: ſo God the Father which is of none, yet vnderſtanding
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10639:22"/>
of himſelfe, <hi>alierum ſe, non aliud generat,</hi> begetteth of himſelfe an other, not in nature, but in perſon from himſelfe, which yet is all one with himſelfe. Againe that which vnderſtandeth and is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood is all one with that which is beloued, when the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth loue it ſelfe, and then it is one and the ſelfe ſame thing which loueth, and is beloued, and there is the holy Ghoſt, all one with the Father and the Sonne.

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Bookes of the Bible are the word of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Made mention before, of the Booke of nature, which might worthily be called Gods booke, becauſe as I ſaid, it was a letter or Epiſtle wherein God did make himſelfe knowne vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and did inſtruct vs ſo farre as to knowe and confeſſe that there was a God. But becauſe that knowledge was but bare and naked and no way ſufficient to bring vs to ſaluation, onely it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to make vs ſearch and inquire farther, that by inquiring far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we might bee ſaued: there is an other booke which is more eſpecially called Gods booke, I meane his holy Bible, wherin we are taught not onely to knowe God in his viſſible creatures, but alſo, in his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt whereby wee are ſaued. And it ſtood verſe much with his Diuine wiſdome ſo prouiding for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye thing, as the ſeuerall nature and quallitie of each creature doth require, to write ſuch a booke for mans inſtruction in his feare &amp; true worſhip, becauſe man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth of a body as wel a of as ſoule, and conceaueth viſible things eaſier then ſuch things as are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirituall and are not ſeene, and by ſuch things as are ſubiect to his outward ſences, man is brought to vnderſtand. It pleaſed him therefore of his great mercie to inſtruct vs by theſe viſible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and written Letters which dayly we doe reade. And as S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith: <hi>De illa ciuitate vnde peregrinamur, hae literae</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>nobis venerunt, ipſae ſunt Scripturae quae nos hortantur vt bene viuae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> Theſe letters ſent vnto vs from that Cittie the heauenly <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> from whence yet wee doe wander, &amp; they are the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which doe exhorte vs to liue well. And I cannot denie, but the writers themſelues of theſe holy bookes, were ſo immediately inſtructed from God himſelfe which is the fountaine of all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly wiſdome, that they needed no writings. But yet with vs it is otherwiſe, they are the foundation, wee are but the walles which are builded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that foundation, we (ſaith the Apoſtle) are buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Epheſ, 2,</note> vpon the foundation of the Prophets and the Apoſtles. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by their writings we are edified, but they by whoſe meanes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10639:24"/>
we are edified &amp; builded, doe leane their ſelues immediately vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the chiefe corner ſtone which is Ieſus Chriſt. There are great oddes betweene the high mountaines and the little hillocks, and lowe valleyes, they are lightned immediately vpon the firſt riſing of the Sunne, but light &amp; heate commeth by degrees from them to the lower partes. As alſo God foreſawe in his wiſdome, and we know by experience of the former ages fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the worlde vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> when there was no written worde, that there could not be <hi>veritatis et doctrinae puritatis ſalua cuſtodia ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſcripto,</hi> ſoundneſſe of doctrine could not be preſerued, but by committing of it to writing. And therefore it pleaſed God that theſe Volumes of the Bible ſhould bee written. And that theſe are the holy Scriptures giuen by inſpiration of God, profitable to teach, to conuince, to correct, and to inſtruct, that the man of God <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> may be abſolute to all good workes: That the man of God which writte them, ſpake inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, that they were written for the ſaluation of mens ſoules, &amp; not for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <note place="margin">2 <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <p>The firſt is the truth of all the prophecyes which haue fayled in nothing, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſpake of things long before they came to paſſe, ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely as if they had bin already fulfilled.

I will inſtance for breuitie ſake in ſome one or two eſpeciall thinges which may beſt ſerue for this purpoſe. The Scriptures foretolde long before the time that the world ſhould be conuerted to Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all Nations ſhould beleeue and ſubmit themſelues to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Faith, a thing in mans iudgement not to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.

For the Prophet ſaide concerning the Kingdome of <note place="margin">Pſal, 2.</note> Chriſt, I meane his Kingdome of the Goſpell or of Grace. The Heathens raged, &amp; the people murmured againſt the Lord and his Chriſt, but in vaine, the Kinges of the earth ſtood vp &amp; ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them ſelues, and the Princes aſſembled themſelues togeather. But he that ſitteth in heauen ſhall laugh them to ſcorne, the Lord ſhall haue them in deriſion. Euen I haue ſet my King vpon <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> mine holie mountaine, I will declare the decree: that is, the Lorde hath ſaide to me, thou art my Sonne, this day haue I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee, aske of me, and I ſhall giue thue the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the endes of the earth for thy poſſeſſion. There could not be a more vnlikely thing foretolde, and yet it was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled long ſince, no Atheiſt can denie it. <hi>Tertullian</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſaith: who was able to gouerne the world, but onely Chriſt <note place="margin">Aduerſus In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeos. C. 7. 8</note> of whome it was foretolde that his Kingdome ſhould be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ouer the whole world? The Kingdome of <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith her was confined within the Land of <hi>Iudaea</hi> from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> and his territories did reach no farther. <hi>Darius</hi> raigned ouer the <hi>Pabylonians</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> but no farther, <hi>Pharao</hi> ouer the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians,</hi> and there his dominion ceaſed. <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> was a great Monarche, yet he reigned not ouer the whole worlde, but onely from <hi>India</hi> vnto <hi>Aethiopia:</hi> the like may bee ſaide of the Greekes &amp; the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which were called the Lords of the world, and yet the whole world was not knowne vnto them, much leſſe ſubdued by them. But as for the Kingdome of Chriſt, it hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it ſelfe farre and wide, the Goſpell hath bin preached in al <note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> places, and receaued of all Nations of the <hi>Parthians, Medes, Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> the inhabitantes of <hi>Meſopotamia, Armenia, Phnygia, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia, Aegipt, Pamphilla, Aſia, Africa,</hi> and the vttermoſt <hi>Indies.</hi> Of this aſſertion there bee ſo many recordes, that it cannot bee denyed. As for ſome few things which are foretolde in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures &amp; not yet fulfilled, as namely, the conuerſion of the Iewes, and the deſtruction of Antichriſt, the time is not yet come to paſſe that they ſhould be fulfilled, for all thinges muſt be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in that due time which God in his ſecret wiſdome hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. There are other thinges alſo foretolde which muſt goe immediately before the ende of the world, which are not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed becauſe as you ſee the ende is not yet. But it is a ſufficient
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10639:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
argument to induce Infidelles to beleeue that all theſe thinges ſhall come to paſſe, becauſe they ſee all other things alreadie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their time and order. For as hee that ſometimes lyeth ſhall not bee beleeued though hee tell the truth ſo hee which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hath tolde the truth, cannot without impietie bee ſuſpected of fallhood, God cannot deceaue or bee deceaued. And which is not to bee omitted: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> did prophecie that at the latter end there ſhould bee ſuch Atheiſtes, which ſhould denie theſe <note place="margin">2, Pet, 3.</note> thinges, and the Prophecie is now verified, otherwiſe this my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour might haue bene ſpared, their impiety maketh it good which the Prophet hath foretolde.</p>
               <p>Againe there is in <hi>Daniel</hi> an auncient Prophecie concerning the death of our Sauiour Chriſt, euen the verie time and compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">Dan, 9.</note> of yeares is defined when hee ſhould be put to death. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty weekes, (ſaith hee,) are determined vpon thy people, and vpon the holy Cittie, to finiſh the wickedneſſe, and ſeale vp the ſinnes, and reconcile the iniquitie, and bring in euerlaſting righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, &amp; to annoynt the moſte holy. From the going foorth of the commaundement to bring againe the people, and build <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> to <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Prince ſhall bee 69. weekes, and after he ſhall bee ſlaine, but ſo, that for one weeke hee ſhall teach, but in the middle of the weeke hee ſhall cauſe the Sacrifice and oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ceaſe.

whole 482. yeares that is 69, were fullye complete and ended. In the next weeke or 7. yeares, our Sauiour taught the people, and in the middle thereof, that is in the fourth yeare he was put to death: What Iewe or Atheiſt can except againſt the truth of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecye?</p>
               <p>A ſecond proofe that the bookes of the Bible are the worde of God, is the generall conſent and agreement of ſo many writers, which writ at diuers times, in diuers places remote one from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in diuers languages, and vpon diuers occaſions, all writing of one and the ſelfe-ſame ſubiect, all agreeing in Doctrine, none contradicting other, that they might not ſo fitlie bee termed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers writers as diuers pennes of the ſame writer.

               <p>A third proofe is the ſtile, and manner of writing, the olde Teſtament being written in Hebrue, becauſe it was written to the Iewes, The newe in Greeke, becauſe it was written to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, to whome that language was moſt familiar, and beſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, although they were not Grecians that did write it. And yet the tongues in which the olde and newe Teſtament were written, ſo differing one from the other: the ſame idiotiſme and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etye of ſpeach in both Teſtaments vſed, continuall Hebraeiſmes aſwell in the newe as in the olde, doe ſhewe that they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by one and the ſelfe-ſame ſpirit, that ſtill God might ſpeake like vnto him ſelfe.

that wee might vnderſtand and conſter them diuers wayes. But the word which is thus ambiguous in the Hebruew or Greeke, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee fitted by a worde in latine or any other language which ſhall bee anſwerable to it in ambiguity, and becauſe it cannot bee ambiguous in the interpreter as well as in the Originall, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto vs maymed and as it were defectiue, which the holy Ghoſt would haue to be more full and perfecte, containing this varietie of ſenſes, by reaſon of the ambiguitie. And therefore all tongues ſauing the Greeke and Hebrue, in compariſon of them, are vnworthie of that great maieſtie of the holy Ghoſt. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the word <hi>Barac</hi> in the Hebrue tongue ſignifieth both to bleſſe and to curſe, the worde is vſed in the ſtorie of <hi>Iacob</hi> which <note place="margin">Gen, 49, 28.</note> called his Children before him as he lay in his death-bed, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied to them, in which Prophecie ſome hee bleſſed and ſome hee curſed.

               <p>Likewiſe, beſides the two tongues Hebrue &amp; Greeke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bible is written, and the idiotiſme or propryetye of the Hebrue onelye in both, to ſhewe that the ſame ſpirit writte both, that God, whether hee ſpake Hebrue or Greeke vnto vs, ſtill he might ſpeake after one manner, and ſo be like none but him ſelfe: the verye ſimplicitye of the ſtyle not fauouring of humane elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the verye diſcretion which is vſed in euerye booke concerning the ſtyle, ſtill applyed to the capacitye of them who eſpeciallye and aboue others were written vnto, doe argue that men could not be the authors of theſe books. If we doe examine the wordes, the ſentences, the arguments, the matter, forme: we ſhall finde many times that there is difficultye in the wordes, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitye in the ſentences, acutenes in the arguments, rare inuention and great choyce in the matter, a ſcholler-like methode obſerued in the forme of writing, tropes, grammer figures, exornations of rhethoricke, all thinges proued according to the rules of logicke, and yet notwithſtanding all theſe, a vulgar and familiar kinde of ſpeech is vſed. For God him ſelfe, the Angelles, the Prophets ſpeaking vnto men, doe accommodate them ſelues to our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, to the vnderſtanding of plow-men, of ſhepherds, of women, of children, that the conuerſion of the world may not be aſcribed vnto mans wiſdome, or humane eloquence, or any other thing that is in man. The holy Ghoſt doth not write like <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> that it may be ſaid: Where is the Scribe, the ſubtil diſputer? &amp;c. he hath made their wiſdome fooliſhnes.

               <p>Fiftly, the argument followeth well which <hi>Necodemus</hi> vſeth to confirme the doctrine of our Sauiour Chriſt. Maſter ſaith he, I knowe thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can doe <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> theſe thinges which thou doſt vnleſſe God were with him. And, therefore our Sauiour ſaith in an other place: <hi>Operibus credite</hi> Beleeue the workes. And therefore againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> the great,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10639:28"/>
and <hi>Domitian</hi> the Tyrant, which would haue beene accounted Gods, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vſeth this arguement: Doe theſe and theſe thinges, and then I will confeſſe that ye are Gods. When <hi>Canutus</hi> the King of Danes had conquered <hi>England,</hi> and ſitting in his Chayre by the ſea ſide, had boaſted the like of him ſelfe that he was a God: It was ſaid vnto him, Sit in this place one houre lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and I will confeſle you are a God, but if you cannot ſit vntill the full tyde, and commaund the waters that they ſhall not carye you away, you are no God. But the Scriptures haue beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be the worde of God, by ſuch miracles as no power of man or deuill could effecte. The birth of our Sauiour Chriſt was confirmed by the appearing of a Starre which troubled all the Star gazers of the worlde, The reſurrection of our Sauiour by an Eclipſe which troubled the great Aſtrologians of the world, the <note place="margin">Math. 2.

               <p>Sixtly, the antquitye of the Bible proueth it ſelfe to be Gods worde, for as God is <hi>antiquus dierum,</hi> the ancient of dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Dan. 7.</note> he was before all other, ſo the bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> are more ancient then all other brokes. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of certaine Pillars: in which ſome thinges were written by the ſonnes of <hi>Seth</hi>

But as for the Abedarye letters, that is Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall letters, whereby we write wordes and ſentences, they were not deuiſed before <hi>Moſes</hi> deliuered them to the Hebrues, <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Euſeb:</hi> de temporibus et 10. de praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat: euang et Lib 8.</note> from whence the Phaenicians learned them, and the Greekes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them from the Phaenicians, and the Romans did learne to write of the Grecians.

Now, foraſmuch as no lawes, no precepts of life, no Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, no rules co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the worſhip of God, no contract betwene man &amp; man, no antiquitye can be kept in memorye but by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: Therefore it was neceſſary for the true knowledge &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, that ſuch a booke ſhould be written wherein God might be knowne, and in what ſorte he would be worſhiped. But there is no booke of that nature beſides the Bible which is of any antiquitye, neither the Alcaron of the Turkes, nor the Talmod of the Iewes: witnes the Talmod and Alcaron them ſelues, nor any other booke of religion, but they were written long ſince the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Religion cannot be newe, as God him ſelfe cannot be newe, therefore that is onely the true religion which is the ancienteſt of all, and it is impoſſible to knowe or iudge of the antiquitye of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but by the antiquitie of the bookes and recordes wherein the precepts of Religion are deliuered and ſet downe, and againe it is impoſſible to know what is religion, or how God is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped, but by bookes wherein are contained the rules of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For as much therefore, as the bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> are more auncient then all other bookes, therefore that religion is the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt which is contayned in them, and becauſe there can be but one true Religion, the onely truth is in them, therefore they are the word of God. And, as for the other bookes of the Bible which were written long ſince, they handle the ſame ſubiect, they holde the ſame doctrine as the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and are but all partes and members which make one body of the Bible, written by the ſame Spirit, and of the ſame nature, and therfore are alſo the word of God, and there is no other written booke of God, but the Bible.</p>
               <p>In the ſeauenth place, I could alleage for witneſſe that the Bible is Gods word, the great multitudes of Martyrs, which haue dyed in the defence of the Bible, and ſealed the ſame with their owne bloud, both before, and in, and after the times of the ten bloudy perſecutions, to whome God gaue the gift of patience to ſuffer death willingly for the teſtimony of the worde. Neither could ſo manye of them haue ſuffered in ſuch manner, vnleſſe God had ſtrengthned them in ſo good a cauſe. But becauſe this argument is not ſo forcible to perſwade Atheiſts, as it is to exhort chriſtians, I paſſe it ouer.</p>

Laſt of all, the teſtimonye of the Gentiles proueth the Bible to be the worde of God. For, becauſe God the Father had eternally decreed to ſend his Sonne to take fleſh for the ſaluation both of Iewes and Gentiles, and vnleſſe they beleeued in him, there could be no ſaluation purchaſed by his death, neither for Iewe nor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile: That he might be receiued by the conſent of each people, it could not ſeeme good vnto his heauenly wiſdome, vnleſſe he did long before our Sauiour ſhould come publiſh his comming both to the Iewes and Gentiles. And therfore Chriſt was publiſhed to the Iewes many wayes, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, by dreames, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Angels, but eſpecially by their owne Prophets, <hi>Dauid, Eſay,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb, 1</note>

               <p>You haue heard it (I hope) ſufficiently prooued, that the bookes of the Bible are the worde of God, and I am ſure we haue them among vs very true &amp; vncorrupted. If any Iewe or Atheiſt ſhall dare to ſay that they are not now ſo pure and free from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and corruptions as from the beginning they were: I argue againſt them in this manner: If they had been corrupted before the time of our Sauiour, or in his time, no dout but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <note place="margin">Ioh, 5.</note> vs to ſearch the Scriptures, he would haue giuen vs warning to take heed of ſuch corruptions.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10639:32"/>
alſo agree with the originall out of which they are cyted. To ſay that the Iewes haue corrupted the olde Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it were madnes, without proofe or juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion. I would that ſuch men as ſuggeſt theſe thinges, would either certiſie vt <hi>eus bono?</hi> vnto what end the Iewes ſhould now in the latter end of the worlde corrupt the Hebrue, or elſe how it ſhould bee poſſible for them being ſo ſcattered, and diſperſed in places ſo farre diſtant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote one from an other, corrupt their owne bookes without no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the whole worlde? much leſſe then were they able to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the bookes which were in the handes of Chriſtians. But, for as much as our Hebrue Bibles and theirs doe agree, and all newe Teſtaments doe likewiſe agree, it is manifeſt that neither the olde nor the newe Teſtament are corrupted. Wherfore we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we haue (prayſed be God) his worde pure and intyre without any corruption or diminution, as it was left vs by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which (as the Apoſtle writeth) is able to make vs wiſe <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.</note> to ſaluation through the Fayth which is in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

This is all one as if they ſhold ſay: becauſe the profeſſers of humane artes and liberall ſciences cannot aſſigne to euery ſpecies their eſſentiall differences &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per paſſions, therefore there are no ſuch differences nor proper paſſions belonging vnto them, and by a conſequent there are no ſuch thinges, and by an other conſequent no ſuch ſpecies: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that theſe things be not knowne vnto nature, becauſe they are not knowne vnto vs. So mans ignorance ſhall ouerthrowe the certaintye and vndouted truth of liberall ſciences, &amp; make the ſecrets of nature to be no ſecrets.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10639:32"/>
the thinges which haue no difference. In man I confeſſe that will is one thing, and ſufferance is an other, becauſe man is not ſo powerfull, but that his will is often with-ſtood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſuffereth againſt his will. So <hi>Moſes</hi> his will was, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note> ſhould haue beene obedient, but they were rebellious, and he did ſuffer their rebellion which he could not hinder. As alſo men doe ſuffer oftentimes againſt their will, that which is in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to hinder, but not without a greater miſcheife, and ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> his will being they ſhould keep their wiues, yet did ſuffer them <note place="margin">Dent. 24, Math. 19.</note> by a bil of diuorcement to put them away, but he did ſuffer them for the hardnes of their hartes, becauſe, had he not ſuffered them they would haue ſlayne their wiues. But, God is omnipotent as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh: why doth he yet complayne? for who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his will? he will haue mercye vpon whome he will haue <note place="margin">Rom, 9</note> mercye, and whome he will he hardne<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And, as our Sauiour <note place="margin">Math, 11, Luc, 10,</note> ſaith: Thou haſt hidden theſe thinges from the wiſe men of the worlde, becauſe it was thy will and pleaſure. So God ſuffereth ſo much as he is willing to haue effected, and he willeth no more then he ſuffereth, and, if he had not this omnipotencye, he were not God, and therefore with God to will and to ſuffer, are all one. But, <hi>idem reſpectu eiuſdem non poteſt differre a ſeipſo,</hi> the ſame thing in the ſame reſpect cannot differ from it ſelfe. Theſe things be <hi>lippis &amp; tonſoribus aeque nota,</hi> ſo common and obuious to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye ſimple mans vnderſtanding, that I meruayle how any man ſhould be ignorant of them.</p>
               <p>But as for Gods reuealed will, it is often contrarye to his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in as much as it is contrarie to his ſecret will which is all one with his ſufferance. For example, in his reuealed will he ſaith: Thou ſhalt not ſteale, thou ſhalt not commit adulterie, murther, <note place="margin">Exod, 20,</note> Idolatrie, and yet, in his ſecret will hee ſuffered the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to ſteale, <hi>Aaron</hi> to commit idolatrie, <hi>Dauid</hi> to commit murder and <note place="margin">Iob, 1, Exod. 33, 2, Sam, 16</note> adultery, for had it not ſtood w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his wil they could not haue done theſe thinges, becauſe he is omnipotent, and nothing can be done againſt his will. Neither can the Atheiſts ſcoffe at this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods ſecret will and his reuealed will, becauſe th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y ſee it ſo plainely proued. For they finde his reuealed will reuealed vnto them in his written worde, where he ſaith: Thou ſhalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <note place="margin">Exod, 20</note> adulterie, and againe they finde his ſecret will to be centrarie
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10639:33"/>
to that which he publiſhed and reuealed in his worde, becauſe he ſuffered <hi>Daniel</hi> to commit adulterie, vnleſſe they will blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, and contrarie to ſence and reaſon, ſay that the power of God was ſo weake, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was not able to hinder <hi>Dauids</hi> adultery, ſo indeed it might follow that there were neuer a God, for vnleſſe he be omnipotent he is no God. Now his reuealed wil is many times contrarie to his ſufferance, becauſe he ſuffereth that which he hath willed and commanded to the contrarie, as I haue ſhewed you in <hi>Dauid</hi> and the reſte. And this will and his ſufferance do differ in theſe pointes, firſt, in reſpect of our knowledge, ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly in reſpect of the diuers ends wherunto lie willeth and ſuffereth. Concerning our knowledge, wee know his reuealed wil, euer ſince it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and publiſhed in his worde, but what he will ſuffer contrarie to that his commaundement, is hidden from vs, and vntil it come to paſſe, and wee ſee that hee hath ſuffered it. As for diuerſitie of endes which he purpoſeth in his will and his ſufferance, I will ſhew you by a familiar example. He willeth that no man ſhall ſteale, that ſo no theife may excuſe himſelfe by pleading igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and yet hee ſuffered the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> to ſteale <hi>Iobs</hi> Cattell, that ſo hee might make open triall of <hi>Iobs</hi> patience. Hee willed that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould not betray him, that if hee did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him hee ſhould not bee excuſable, yet ſecretly hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Math, 26, Act, 1, Math, 7,</note> the contrarie and ſuffered the contrarie, that ſo might he wrought the worke of our redemption. And that this diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wills may not ſeeme impoſſible in God, we finde it alſo in man, when a earthly Prince many times maketh a publike Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation that this or that lawe ſhall bee executed, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witſtanding hath a ſecret meaning to hinder many particulars, contrarie to that which he hath publiſhed and to diſpenſe with his owne Proclamation although the people take no notice thereof.</p>
               <p>Againe theſe thinges are ſayed to differ in this manner, onelye in regarde of our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, as his will &amp; his ſuffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly apprehended by vs, but as they are in God himſelfe, they cannot differ, becauſe in him, power, wiſdome, will, ſtrength, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, and all other thinges, are all one with himſelfe. In God, and with God there are no accidents, his will is his ſelfe, his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is his ſelfe, and his ſufferance is his ſelfe, I proue there can be no accidents with God or in him, becauſe hee is not anie vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOſes</hi> writeth, that in the beginning God made heauen and <note place="margin">Gen, 1.</note> earth. That is, in the firſt moment of time, or, when time firſt began, then God began his worke of the creation of the worlde. Which time, foraſmuch as it is defined to be <hi>Numerus</hi> or <hi>menſura motus,</hi> the meaſure of the motion of all naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, and the ſubiect of time is the very body of heauen which is firſt moued, and by which all other naturall bodyes are ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily moued: time was not before nor after the heauens, but they were created both together: and, becauſe after the end of the worlde motion ſhall ceaſe: euen as before the beginning, ſo after the ending there ſhall be no more time. So then, whereas it is ſaide: in the beginning God made heauen and earth, it is all one as if he had ſaide, that once he made them.</p>
               <p>By this making is meant creation, which is to make a thing of nothing, hauing no matter praecedent out of which he ſhould make it, and this muſt neceſſarilye followe, becauſe if there had beene any matter before wherof he ſhould haue made the world, that matter had beene in ſome place, ſo then, if there were place and matter, there was a worlde before the creation of the worlde, and the worlde could not be the firſt thing that was made. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an action of God, not intentionall but reall, not inward but outward, not immanent but tranſient, by the which he giueth to thinges their being. For, although the will of God alone with reference to the thinges which are made, were ſufficient, yet there
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10639:34"/>
is a kinde of influence of Gods power executing his will, which doth afterward followe in his worke. It is an action both neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye and voluntarye: neceſſarye becauſe hee decreed, and yet vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarye becauſe it was his will to create the worlde. And that it was no hard thing for him to create the world of nothing, neither abſurd to ſay that God did create any thing of nothing, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, foraſmuch as we ſee creat on in the Angels, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall, and therefore cannot be of any praecedent matter, as alſo the ſoules of men, which he then did, and now continually doth, create, which are a manifeſt argument to proue creation.</p>
               <p>Out of this doctrine alſo followeth an other concluſion, that God onely is eternall and before time, becauſe he did once create the heauen and the earth, and gaue them their beginning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before they were not, neither was there anye thing beſides him-ſelfe.</p>
               <p>God before the worlde was made, was in him ſelfe, and vnto him ſelfe inſteed of the worlde, and he was alone, becauſe there was nothing but him ſelfe, and yet not ſo alone, but that he had all power, wiſdome, and happines in him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>He had no need of the worlde or any thing contayned in it, for as much as he was eternally without it, and therefore could ſtand without it, and had not his dependance of it. He was infinitely happy in him ſelfe, and therefore the creation of it could adde no happynes vnto him, and if he had needed it, he could haue made it before. Neither did he then make it becauſe he was wearye of being without it, or that it diſpleaſed him that he had not made it before, becauſe he did not make that which he would not, but he would haue that which he made, and that which he would he did make in order, and therefore he made it not raſhly but deliberat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not caſually but wiſely, and in time he did all thinges, and in time, eſpecially he made thee ô thou Atheiſt, that whilſt thou haſt time to liue, thou ſhouldſt acknowledge and worſhip him.</p>
               <p>The manner how he made it, euen as Kings doe, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement onely. He ſaid the worde, and it was done. If you aske how God ſhould ſpeake? or who ſhould heare his voyce when there was nothing beſides him ſelfe? he ſpake, that is, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed with him ſelfe that it ſhould be ſo. If you aske what moued him to create it, when he could be aſwell without it? being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10639:34"/>
with the reflection of his owne glorye which he ſawe in him ſelfe, made creatures, becauſe he would haue ſome to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers alſo of that his happines, as men and Angels, and for their ſakes he made the worlde, that they might be contayned in it, Angels in heauen, men vpon the ſuperficies of the earth, and all other creatures for the vſe of man, that ſo Angels and men ſeeing his goodnes, whereof they were made partakers, ſhould prayſe him.</p>
               <p>As for the Philoſophers, and Poets, and great wiſe men of the worlde, although they enioyed not the Bible, as were <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus, Homer, Heſiodus, Ariſtotle, Tully, Ouid,</hi> they all held that the world had a beginning, and that God was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of it. How then is it that now our Atheiſts denie the ſame? Surely they thinke themſelues wiſe, and are become fooliſh, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. For they thinke there may bee an effect <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> without a cauſe, a motion without a moouer, a worke without a workeman. But becauſe diſputation is not to be held with them which are ignorant, but with the learned, and the learned will not preiudice their knowledge ſo much, as to be thought not able to yeild a reaſon of their aſſertions: let vs examin the reaſons which they alleadge, why they ſhould holde that the world w<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (ſay they) affirmeth, that there can be no motion without a mouer, and there muſt be a due proportion <hi>inter moto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem &amp; id quod mouetur,</hi> betweene that which is moued and that by whome it is moued: there is one Sphere which is called <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum mobile,</hi> the firſt bodye which is moued, ſo there muſt be one firſt agent to moue the ſame, but he did moue from eternitie, there was therefore ſome thing which from eternitye was to be moued by him, and that is the higheſt Sphere. For (ſay they) if he did not from all eternitye moue this Sphere, but began the worlde, then <hi>non agens factum eſt agens,</hi> of no agent he was made an agent, which could not be without alteration, but that could not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is not ſubiect to alteration, for then ſhould he alſo be ſubiect to corruption, and ſo ſhould be no God. The argument I ſay, doth not followe, for, although that God is ſaid to be <hi>primus motor ab aeterno,</hi> the firſt mouer from eternitye, yet he did not <hi>actu mouere ab aterno,</hi> this motion of his was not in action eternallye,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10639:35"/>
and therefore it is not rightly inferred that there ſhould befor that cauſe anye change in God. For God what-ſoeuer in his eternall fore-knowledge he intended to doe, is ſaid to doe it in the ſame maner as he intended it, and that motion which was not <hi>in rerum natura ſubſistens,</hi> ſubſiſting in the nature of things as they terme it, yet in God was alwayes ſubſiſting, with whome all future thinges are preſent, which called the things that were not, by their names, as if they were. He ordayned euery thing that it ſhould be, euen before the foundation of the worlde was layed, the reaſon is, becauſe that eternall and diuine eſſence doth not acknowledge time, he ſeeth thinges paſt, preſent, and future, not ſucceſſiuelye, but all at once. Therefore they haue not yet attayned to the true vnderſtanding of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> meaning, which argue in this maner.</p>
               <p>Naturally I confeſſe, motion is without beginning, becauſe one motion cannot begin without an other precaedent motion, ſo likewiſe it cannot end without alteration, becauſe <hi>in omni vere continuo phyſico,</hi> in euerye true naturall thing whoſe partes haue their coherence together, as this hath, there is a perpetuall ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which may be diuided into infinite partes of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. For euen as in time, and euery part thereof, there is one preſent moment or inſtant, which argueth that there is an other paſt, and an other future: ſo in euerye motion which is meaſured by time, there is one preſent mutation, which argueth one motion precedent, and an other ſubſequent, becauſe euery motion is a change, either of ſubſtance, or of quantitye, or of qualitye, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place. And therfore the firſt moment of time cannot be aſſigned, nor the firſt mutation which is in motion. The naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers could not diſcerne by nature, whether was firſt the Hen or the egge, becauſe one cannot be without the other, &amp; therfore they ſuppoſed that eternallye the generation of one was the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of an other, and ſo there ſhould be an eternall reuolution of thinges, which indeed naturally muſt be ſo, but metaphiſically it is not ſo, becauſe there is a God aboue nature by whome nature is ouer-ruled. Neither is it meruayle though Philoſophye and Fayth doe not ſpeake alike concerning the beginning of the worlde, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Metaphyſics and their principles differ ſo much from the Phyſics &amp; their principles, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> diſſenteth ſo much from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> one and the ſelfe ſame man from himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:10639:35"/>
It is one thing to affirme that the worlde ſimply had no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and an other thing to ſaye that nature did not make the worlde, and that by the power of nature it ſhall haue no end, for, God and Nature are diuers thinges. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confeſſed that the worlde began, and ſhall haue an end, in reſpect of the diuine and ſupernaturall power, becauſe he ſaid that God as he is the firſt mouer, ſo he is the firſt cauſe of motion, and actuallye infinite, a moſt free agent, not tyed to any ſecondary cauſes, inſtruments, &amp; meanes whereby he worketh. He which is eternall was before all motion, &amp; can be without motion or time, becauſe he made both motion and time. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> denyeth that any thing which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall can be meaſured by time, he denyeth God to be in time, and by a conſequent he denyeth him to be tyed vnto motion which is meaſured by time.</p>
               <p>God moued eternallye, but his motion was metaphyſicall, which was nothing elſe, but to will, to nill, and to vnderſtand. The worlde therfore is not without beginning in reſpect of the firſt cauſe which is God, but of the ſecond cauſe which is nature, for then nature ſhould be iniurious vnto her ſelfe, if ſhe ſhould doe vyolence vnto her ſelfe, and be a cauſe of her owne deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore, according to nature there is a reference and due proportion betweene him which mooueth and that which is mooued, and the motion it ſelfe, and ſo the eternitie of the mouer muſt argue the eternitie of the thing which by him is mooued, &amp; of the motion, but God hath, &amp; exerciſeth his metaphyſical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authoritie ouer all thinges, whereby he counterchecketh, and ouer ruleth theſe thinges.</p>
               <p>The arguments therefore which the Philoſophers produce to proue the eternitie of the worlde, are reduced vnto theſe. Firſt, if there were any firſt motion, the mouer and the mo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ued body from whence this motion proceeded had their beginning, or they were without beginning, if they had a beginning they began by a precedent motion, becauſe nothing can begin but by motion, and ſo that which is called the firſt motion could not be the firſt becauſe another went before it. But if they were without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it is a great abſurditie to ſay that hee which was an eternall mouer, yet did not mooue, and that which was alwayes mooued, notwithſtanding was without motion. Secondly, time is eternall,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10639:36"/>
for it is in the definition of time, that there is alwaies in it a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtant or moment, which ioyneth together that which is paſt and that which is future, and therefore the firſt inſtant of time cannot be aſſigned, and therefore motion is alſo eternall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a iuſt proportion betweene the meaſure which is time, and the thing meaſured, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is motion. Thirdly, there muſt be a proportion between the cauſe and the effect, the mouer and that which is mooued, becauſe there can bee no compariſon betweene that which is infinite and that which is finit, that which is eternall and that which is temporall. But this one anſwer is inſtead of <hi>Dauid</hi> his ſling to kill <hi>Golias,</hi> of <hi>Iudeth</hi> hir ſworde to cut of the <note place="margin">1. Sam. 17. Iudith. 11. Exod. 7.

               <p>Let this therefore be the ſtate of the queſtion. God had eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the verie ſhape and Idea of the worlde which he conceaued in his minde, and he eternally decreed when and how it ſhould bee, euen as when a workeman determineth to frame a peece of worke, he firſt frameth it in his minde, but doth not preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the ſame: ſo hee decreed eternally, and before all time, when, and how the worlde ſhould bee in time. Hee which is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fountaine of goodneſſe, which fountaine notwithſtanding did not eternally iſſue foorth into ſtreames, but in time, did not eternally communicate vnto others, this his goodneſſe, but was a Fountaine of water, which for a long ſeaſon lyeth hidden in the earth before it doth guſh out. But hee was not as a Carpenter which maketh an houſe becauſe he hath neede of an houſe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did not eternally create, not becauſe he could not but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not, and he would not becauſe hee had eternally decreed that the world ſhold be in time, and he ſo decreed, that ſo hee might bring vs to the knowledge of himſelfe, for as much as when wee knowe that the worlde was not alwaies, wee are forced to confeſſe that there is a ſuperiour cauſe from whence it had his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10639:36"/>
beginning, whereas if it had bin created from eternitie, and had had no beginning, wee could not ſo eaſily haue diſcerned how God ſhould haue bin the creator of it. And therefore it cannot followe in this place, that there was in God any mutation or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie, becauſe before the worlde was made he was not willing that it ſhould bee made, and afterward when it was made hee was willing.

And againe, reaſon doth tell vs that becauſe God is of an infinit nature, his eſſence is ſimple, not tyed to meanes by which hee worketh (for according to the rules of Philoſophie, that agent is moſte noble which needeth the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt meanes), and being not tyed to meanes he needeth no matter to worke by. Alſo reaſon doth tell vs that as euerie thing is, ſo it worketh, but God is of himſelfe abſolute and not depending of anye, and therefore worketh in the ſame manner, that he is a free agent and therfore cannot be compelled, that he is omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; therefore nothing can be held or difficulte vnto him, &amp; becauſe he is infinite, hee is tranſcendent aboue all the boundes of nature. Out of all theſe principles I conclude. The world had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, God which is euerlaſting made it in time, and hee made it of nothing, that is, without anie matter precedent or going before the creation of it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Soule of man, what it is? whence it commeth? and the immortallitie of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AN Atheiſt hauing heard a Preacher in his Sermon make mention of the ſoule: the Sermon being ended, asked him what the Soule was? and whether it were any thing or nothing? After diſputation betweene them both, the Atheiſt ſaide: I will ſhewe you what it is. So hee cauſed a candle to bee lighted and brought to the Table, hee blew it out, and ſayd: your ſoule is no more then the flame of that candle, you ſee an ende of that, it is blowen out, and ſo ſhall it be with your ſoule when you die. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture, ſome cauſe of this vngodly aſſertion might bee the ambiguitie of the worde. For S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in diuers places calleth the Soule by no better name then <hi>Flatus</hi> which properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth no more then a breath, or a blaſt, <hi>Deus fecit omnem flatum</hi> ſaith hee, God made euerie blaſt, meaning euerie ſoule, and it is <note place="margin">Adoptatum epist. 157. Gen 2</note> written that God breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> the breath of life. And in the Scriptures it is ſometimes confounded with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is a breath, and ſo <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>anima</hi> and <hi>ſpiritus,</hi> a Soule &amp; a breath or a blaſt, in ſignification are all one. Therefore that I may diſtinguiſh the aequiuocation or ambiguitie of the word, that nothing may be miſtaken, it ſignifieth theſe thinges, 1. the life of any thing, <hi>anima mea eſt in manibus meis</hi> ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi> my ſoule is in mine handes, meaning his life. 2 a deſire, ſo the ſoule of <note place="margin">Pſal. 18.</note>

And it was ſaid of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychus</hi> which fell downe dead for ſleeping at S. <hi>Paules</hi> Sermon, <hi>anima eius eſt in ipſo,</hi> his ſoule is yet in him, that is, there is yet breath in his bodie that he may bee reuiued againe. 5.

                  <hi>ſpiritum,</hi> that is nothing, becauſe the ſoule or ſpirit although it bee ſome thing, &amp; a moſt excellent thing, yet becauſe it is not viſible, nor any ſenſible thing, he calleth it nothing. 6. It is taken for that which is regenerate by the ſpirit of God, ſo ſayth the Apoſtle: <note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. the ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh, that is, the ſpirit as it is guided by God, doth ſtriue and wraſtle with it ſelfe. 7. when the ſoule and the ſpirit doe concur together in the ſame ſentence, the ſoule ſignifieth mans will, and the ſpirit his vnderſtanding, ſo the Apoſtle ſaith: I pray God that your whole ſpirit and ſoule and <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5</note> body may be kept blameles, &amp;c. But laſt of all, and in this place it is that which is defined by <hi>Ariſtotle: Actus corporis organici in potentia vitam habentis,</hi> an acte or perfection of the body which giueth vnto the bodie life, ſenſe, motion, vegetation, &amp;c. And of this ſignification of the ſoule we are to diſpute in this place.</p>
               <p>Concerning the originall of the ſoule, which I propoſed in the ſecond place, it is agreed vpon by the beſt Diuines and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, that ſince the firſt Sabaoth, God ceaſed from creating any more viſible things, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he doth <hi>Quotidie noues animas cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are,</hi> create new ſoules querie day &amp; houre, &amp; mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for aſmuch as euerie moment young Children are quickned in their mothers wombes, and that <hi>Anima hominis creando infunditur et infunden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do creatur,</hi> mans ſoule is in one moment infuſed by creation, and created by infuſion of it into the bodie. But <hi>Optatur</hi> deſireth to bee reſolued by S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> concerning this doubt of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">Auguſt epiſt. 157</note> of the ſoule: <hi>vtrum animae vt corpora, propagàtione naſcantur, ſint<expan>

He anſwereth: that in the ſame manner as God made <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule of nothing, ſo hee made all mens ſoules of nothing, and he proueth it thus. 1. When <hi>Adam</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen, 2,</note> ſaith of <hi>Eue:</hi> fleſh of my fleſh and bone of my bone, hee dooth not ſay, ſoule of my ſoule. 2. If any man holde that the ſoule of man commeth of man, hee muſt ſhewe that as one light is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of an other, and one fier lighted of an other without dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10639:38"/>
of their former light and heate: ſo the ſoule muſt proceede out of an other ſoule, the ſame ſoule out of which it proceedeth being not diminiſhed, which cannot bee expreſſed how it might be by the wit of man. And beſides, ſaith hee, it is dangerous to holde ſo, leaſt ye fal into the error of <hi>Tertullian</hi> which deemed the ſoule to be a bodie and not a ſpirit, for ſo it muſt be borne <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of ſeede, as the bodie is. If they ſpeake of <hi>ſemen incorporeum</hi> a ſpirituall ſeede infuſed inuiſibly into the body at the time of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s conception: ſuppoſe that which is often ſeene, that that which is conceaued doth prooue an obortiue and vntimely fruit when it is <hi>Embrio,</hi> or <hi>non homo,</hi> not a perfect man, not fully ſhaped in the wombe that ſpirituall ſeede muſt either returne whence it came, which it cannot doe, or periſh with the bodie, and then wil follow this abſurditie, that an immortall ſoule is borne of corruptible &amp; mortall ſeede. <hi>Tolet</hi> the Ieſuit ſheweth that mans ſoule cannot come <hi>ax traduce,</hi> by any Propagation, for theſe cauſes. 1. No na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <note place="margin">De anima Lib 3</note> agent can produce and bring foorth that which is aboue it ſelfe, but the ſoule of man is aboue nature, becauſe it comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſupernaturall thinges. The <hi>maior</hi> is plaine becauſe no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall agent can worke, but it muſt worke vpon matter, the action muſt bee a materiall action, whereas the ſoule is immateriall. 2. Euerie natural agent, as I haue ſhewed, doth work vpon matter and the matter is capable of diuiſion, but the ſoule of man is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible. 3. God hath created ſoules in the ſame manner as hee created Angells, but the Angells were created of nothing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mens ſoules were created of nothing.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I haue entred into this diſcourſe concerning the ſoule, that I may leaue the Atheiſt for a little ſeaſon, &amp; handle one point for the inſtruction of the Diuine. The queſtion ariſeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this diſcourſe, how the ſoule commeth to bee infected with ſinne? Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the great diſputeth in this manner: <hi>Si ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma oriatur cum carne ex ſubſtantia Adae, cur non ſimul moritur</hi>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10639:38"/>
be originally and naturally ſinfull, as is the fleſh which original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcendeth from a ſinfull man? <hi>Optatus</hi> deſireth to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how, when, and where, the ſoule which of it ſelfe is pure, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to take infection? <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> anſwereth that hee is not able to giue him full ſatisfaction therein. <hi>Pelagius</hi> obiecteth againſt S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in this manner. If the fleſh onely deſcended from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> then is the fleſh onely polluted with ſinne, and not the ſoule, <hi>quia iniuſtum eſt vt hodie nata anima non ex Adae maſſa tam anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum peccatum portet alienum, quia nulla ratione conceditur vt Deus qui propria peccata dimittit vnum imputet alienum,</hi> becauſe it cannot ſtand with the iuſtice of God, that the ſoule which is newly borne and not deſcended of <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore hauing no ſinne of her own, ſhold beare the ſinne of an other man, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was committed ſo long before, For it is not to be thought that God which forgiueth vs our owne ſinnes will impute an other mans ſinnes vnto vs. The ſoule ſaith hee, at the firſt creation is eyther pure or corrupted, impure it cannot be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it commeth immediately from God, and being at the firſt cleane, how commeth it to be vncleane? how can a ſpirit bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by a body? that which is immateriall bee polluted by that which is materiall? But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Caluin</hi> doth ſatiſfie that doubt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <note place="margin">Iuſtitut Lib. 1</note> that although corruption be inherent both in the ſoule and the body, yet the cauſe of that hereditarye corruption is not in the ſubſtance eyther of the body or the ſoule, but onely it was orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God that the imperfections of the firſt parents ſhould bee common to all the Children, euen as according to the lawes of earthly Princes ſuch as are deſcended of parents attainted of high treaſon, are alſo ſtayned in their bloud, preiudiced in reſpect of their landes and honors by their fathers offences committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time, and wherof they were ignorant, and it is but <hi>imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio diuinae iuſticiae,</hi> an imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that iuſtice w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is with God. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are borne of impure ſeede as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> teacheth, and not <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> onely the bodie, but alſo the ſoule is infected with ſinne, by reaſon of this our birth, although ſinne be more apparent in the body, then in the ſoule, and the onely cauſe why the ſoule is thus infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is this our impure and vncleane birth, and yet the ſoule is not of ſeede, or any materiall thing, but it commeth immediately from God. And it is a weake argument which <hi>Pelagius</hi> vſeth: that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10639:39"/>
becauſe beleeuing parents doe ſanctifie their Children, therefore <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> Children cannot receaue infection from their Parents which are regenerate. For the children doe lineally deſcend from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents by carnall generation, but not by ſpiritual regeneration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe regeneration is not from beneath, but from aboue, not from men, but from the holy Ghoſt. Sanctification is an eſpecial bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Iohn. 3,</note> giuen in particular: but ſo, that the general courſe of al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde may take holde of all men, for as much as they all are the Sonnes of men. <hi>Natus eſt homo natura, ſanctificatus ex ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali gratia,</hi> that wee are borne, it is the worke of nature, that we are ſanctified it is ſupernaturall, &amp; of the eſpeciall grace of God. But I returne to the Atheiſt.</p>
               <p>The ſoule I ſay, as it appeareth by theſe premiſes, is of a more excellent and diuine nature the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it ſhould be ſubiect to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie and corruption. And therfore, that we may not complaine with <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> who accuſed Nature becauſe ſhe gaue to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens and Harts a long life whome length of life did no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life of that ſhortnes, <hi>vt tum extingueretur qùum incaepiſſet ſapere,</hi> that euen then hee was cut off and vtterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed when hee did but begin to be wiſe: I will produce theſe arguments which are alleadged by naturall Philoſophers to prooue the immortallitie of the ſoule, that I may refute <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus,</hi> and ſhew plainely that wee are not vtterly extinguiſhed by death, and that although wee doe but then begin to bee wiſe when we are neare our death, yet wee doe not then ceaſe to bee wiſe, but then we increaſe in wiſdome when the ſoule is ſeparated from the bodie. My reaſons are theſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is drawne from the vnderſtanding of man, for mans ſoule is of infinit capacitie, the more it vnderſtandeth the more it is able to vnderſtand. It is able to comprehend not onely the whole world, but infinit worldes. In numbring it can adde and multiply ſo farre, that of addition and multiplication there ſhall bee no end. It is able to imagin infinit perfection. But, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is infinit in capacitie, is alſo infinit in continuance, becauſe, as the proprietie of any thing is, ſo is the exiſtence of the ſame. But, for aſmuch as it is infinitlye capable in this life, and cannot bee ſatiſfied in this life, therefore it muſt bee ſatisfied in the life to come.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:10639:39"/>
2. The obiect of mans vnderſtanding is truth, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaketh, not in particular, but in general, which is the way wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">Officiorum lib. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> all thinges are knowne, And therefore it cannot be ſatisfied vntill it come vnto that in which all truth conſiſteth, and that is God, which is truth it ſelfe according to his eſſence, for no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are in him. And for aſmuch as this cannot be attained vnto in this life, therefore it is reſerued vnto a better life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The obiect of mans vnderſtanding is ENS, euerie thing that is, but becauſe there are ſome thinges material, and ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, it muſt conceaue them both, and as for the thinges which be immateriall and without bodies, it cannot diſtinctly conceaue them in this fraile body, therfore the conceiuing of them belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the ſoule when it is ſeparated from the bodie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All men by nature deſire knowledge as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſpeaketh, but <hi>ſcire eſt rem per cauſas cognoſcere,</hi> to knowe <note place="margin">Metaphiſico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. L. 1. C. 1. Poſtereorum. Lib. 1. C, 2</note> a thing is to iudge &amp; diſcerne of the cauſes of it. So then becauſe it is naturall to euery man when hee ſeeth any effect, to ſearch out the cauſes of that effect: and againe, when hee hath found out the cauſe, to ſearch farther, and examine what is the cauſe of that cauſe, and ſo to aſcend higher vntill he come to the higheſt cauſe which is God. And that cannot be in this life, becauſe the eſſence of God is not conceaued by diſcourſing of him, but by perfectly ſeeing of him, and beholding of him face to face euen as he is.</p>
               <p>My ſecond reaſon is drawne from the will of man. That alſo is infinite, for he can loue that which is good, not onely in the firſt degree, but alſo in the ſecond and third, neyther can there be any end of his loue, but ſtill his louing and liking may increaſe, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith in his Meditations: <hi>En amo te Domine, et ſi hoc non ſufficit, amo teplus, et ſi hoc parum eſt amabo te validius,</hi> Behold Lord I loue thee, if this be not enough, I wil loue thee more, and if that be not yet enough, I wil ſtil loue thee more. Man may deſire that which is infinitely good, &amp; this infinite capacitye of the will muſt bee fulfilled, and becauſe not in this life, therefore after death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The libertie alſo and freedome of mans will (I meane not in Diuine but in ciuill and Domeſticall affayres) is of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit power, which is a ſufficient argument to proue the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſoule. For if man will not, no creature is able to force his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10639:40"/>
will to loue this thing or that, <hi>voluntas poteſt cogi,</hi> who can impoſe a neceſſitie vpon man to bee willing or vnwilling to do this or that? but onely God which hath created both the will and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and is therefore aboue them both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The obiect of the wil is that whatſoeuer is good, I meane all goodneſſe in generall, and therefore neuer reſteth, but ſtill willeth &amp; deſireth, vntill it come to the perfect fruition of God in whome all goodneſſe is included, who is eſſentially good in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The will of man mooueth it ſelfe to one thing and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is not mooued by any naturall agent, and as the will is, ſo is the eſſence it ſelfe, and therefore not ſubiect to corruption.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon, the verie appetit of man is alſo infinit, it findeth no contentment among al the things which are vnder the Sunne, it is neuer ſatisfied with the deſire of happineſſe, knowledge, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, glorie, riches, and eternitie, that it may liue after death. But to whatſoeuer nature hath giuen this appetite, it hath alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed how this appetite ſhall bee ſatisfied, and that muſt bee onely after death.</p>
               <p>A fourth, the verie operations of the ſoule it ſelfe without any reference vnto the bodie. As for example, to beleeue, goeth farre aboue ſence, and is an act ſeparated from it. To diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a body and a ſpirit, to imagin thoſe thinges which are but onely imaginarie, as <hi>vacuum, infinitum, in rerum natura,</hi> emptines, infinitenes in worldly and naturall thinges, mathematicall lines, to make <hi>ſillogiſmes,</hi> to define, deuide, demonſtrate. And theſe thinges it doth without the conditions and proprieties of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, &amp; it doth theſe thinges the better, the more it is abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the body, and therefore doth then, beſt of all when it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together out of the bodie, and at full liberty, theſe thinges which do not depend vpon the body neither can bee accompliſhed by the Organs and Inſtruments of the body.</p>
               <p>A fift, nothing can be deſtroyed by that wherein the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it doth conſiſt, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very perfection of the ſoule doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt it, the abſtraction &amp; ſeperation of it from the body which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the iudgement of all morall Philoſophers which holde the very higheſt perfection of vertue to be then when man doth not follow the paſſions and perturbations of the body, but doth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10639:40"/>
ſubdue them wholy to the minde and vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>The ſixt, There is a kinde of reflection of the minde and al the faculties thereof, aboue it ſelfe the vnderſtanding vnderſtandeth that it doth vnderſtand, the wil willeth that it ſhal be willing, the memorie remembreth that it doth remember, ſo it vnderſtandeth that it willeth and doth remember, which no bodily nor mortall thing can performe, it is therefore ſpirituall and immortall.</p>
               <p>The ſeauenth. Beſides the vſuall manner of attaining to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is proper to it ſelfe, the ſoule hath alſo a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine knowledge by the influence of an higher cauſe, which is by reuelation and infuſion. But when it hath ſuch reuelations it is abſtracted from the body, and therfore it is in a more perfect eſtate when it is not at all in the body.</p>
               <p>The eight. The firſt originall or beginning of the ſoule is not by any naturall agent, becauſe it is more perfect then the bodye, for no effect which is more perfect can proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a cauſe which is of leſſe perfection. Therfore as it proceeded not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any natural cauſe, ſo it cannot be deſtroyed by any naturall cauſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot dye by ſeperation of it from the bodye.</p>
               <p>The nynth. The ſoule ſubſiſteth by it ſelfe, and therefore it cannot die by any accident: The antecedent I proue, becauſe it hath operations proper to it ſelfe, as I haue ſhewed.</p>
               <p>The tenth. Euerie thing which is corrupted hath his bane &amp; deſtruction eyther by that which is contrarie to it ſelfe, as heate by colde, drynes by moiſture, or by the abſence of that whereby it is preſerued and nouriſhed, as the lampe goeth out for want of oyle, or by the corruption of the ſubiect in which it is, as the heate of the fire when the fire is extinguiſhed, but nothing is contrarye to the ſoule becauſe it is a ſubſtance and not an accident, neither doth it depend vpon any material cauſe, but onely on God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it any ſubiect becauſe it is no accident.</p>
               <p>The eleuenth. That which dyeth with the body muſt alſo lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and decay with the bodie, and wax olde when the body is olde, as it appeareth by ſence, motion and vegetation, which in olde men doe faile, but vnderſtanding doth increaſe in age.</p>
               <p>The twelfe is the verie conuenience and agreement which the ſoule hath with God, and the Angells it argueth the immortality thereof, for why are they ſayd to be immortall, but becauſe they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10639:41"/>
are as the ſoule is, ſpirituall, immateriall, ſimple, no way mixed or depending of the bodye?</p>
               <p>The thirteenth. What is more common in this life, then the proſperitye of the wicked and the aduerſitye of the godlye? But it cannot ſtand with Gods iuſtice nor his prouidence, that there ſhould be no rewarde for wel-doers, and no puniſhment for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, therefore becauſe it is not in this life, it muſt needes be in an other life w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cannot be vnles the ſoules of men be immortall.</p>
               <p>To conclude, It is incident to good men to hope well, to euill men to feare and be troubled in their mindes becauſe of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, there is Conſcience. But there cannot be Conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out immortality of the ſoule. Therefore I conclude, that the ſoule of man is immortall.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe Atheiſts diſpute againſt the ſtorye of <hi>Noah</hi> his Arke, &amp; the maner of the drowning of the worlde with water, ſaying: it was an impoſſibilitye that ſo many creatures ſhould be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ſo ſmall a veſſel, or that the worlde ſhould be ſo deſtroyed. For the better ſatiſfaction of ſuch vngoldly men, concerning that ſtorye, I obſerue theſe thinges which folowe.</p>
               <p>Concerning the multitude of Beaſtes which were in the Arke, of thoſe which were cleane were 7. of euery ſorte, that is, 3, couples for increaſe, for meat when it ſhould be permitted to eat fleſh, for labour, and other vſes of man, and the odde beaſt for Sacrifice. Of vncleane beaſtes, 2. of euery ſorte for increaſe. As for Fiſhes, they were in the Sea, and not deſtroyed, becauſe they were farther ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſinnes of men, for they were in an other element, as alſo ſuch other creatures as can liue in the waters, as Otters, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolues, Swannes, water-ſoules &amp;c. Agairie, from the kindes of beaſtes which were in the Arke were excluded ſuch as bred not by generation, as Mules, ſuch Serpents and creeping thinges as are ingendred by the Sun out of putrifaction, ſuch as being who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye periſhed might be reſtored agayne in other creatures which were preſerued, as Mules which are ingendred of an horſe and a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10639:41"/>
ſhee Aſſe. Therefore theſe beaſtes which were in the Arke, were onely ſuch as liued vpon the drye, and proceeded by generation. The number of beaſtes (according to <hi>Plinye</hi> and <hi>Geſner)</hi> are not <note place="margin">Naturalihist. Cap. 10. De Animalibus.</note> knowne to be aboue one hundreth and fiftye kindes. And it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye likely that they which are not known, ſhould be neither great, nor manye. And of them which are great, there are not aboue fortye kindes.</p>
               <p>As for the capacitye of the Arke, it was 300. cubits in length, 50, in bredth, 30. in height: there were 3. chambers or floores in it, therefore there was roome enough to receiue all theſe beaſtes, and many more, and meate for them for a long time, that we need not for the defence of this ſtorye to flye to Geometricall cubits, ſaying: that <hi>Moſes</hi> being learned in Geometrye and all the artes of the Egiptians, did vnderſtand Geometricall cubits, but playne <note place="margin">Act, 7.</note> cubits. Such a cubit is the length of a mans arme from his elboe to the top of his middle finger. Though (no dout) ſuch cubits were longer then now they are, becauſe men were of higher ſtature then now they are. But the length therof being 300. cubits, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that it was 5. times the length of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple which <note place="margin">1 Reg, 6.</note> was but 60. cubits long, the bredth of it being 50. it was twice &amp; an halfe as broad as being but 20. cubits broad. But, the length of it being 300. cubits and the bredth 50. being ioyned together, do make of ſquare meaſure, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon rules of arte 15. thouſand cubits. Moreouer, it contayned in the height of it 3. ſtoryes as I haue ſhewed, one being aboue the other, in regard whereof, it was 3. times as capable of the creatures, contayning 3. times the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the loweſt roome, excepting onely the thickneſſe of the boordes which made the partition betweene the floores, that is in the whole 45. thouſand cubits, and euerye ſeuerall floore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning 10. cubits in height. The food of the beaſtes, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it was before, it might behaye, hearbes and berryes, for what food would not hunger cauſe them to eat?</p>
               <p>The worke-manſhip, though it were aboue the knowledge of man to deuiſe it, and contriue it in ſuch ſorte, and aboue his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſtrength to guide ſo great a veſſell on the water, and to keepe it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrackes: it was an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeares in building, it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to be lanched out into the water as Ships are, becauſe the water of itſelfe did beare it vp whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the earth was ouerflowen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:10639:42"/>
From whence had God ſuch great quantity of water to drowne the worlde? There were two immediat cauſes, the Sea beneath, becauſe the fountaynes of the deep were opened, and the heauen aboue, for the windowes of the heauen were alſo open. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the waters from beneath: The vaynes and pores of the earth were broken vp to ſend forth more abundance of water, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which were before gathered together into certayne places began to ſwell, and being rarified ouer flowered the bankes, that, as before, according to nature the water was to hide and couer the whole earth, yet, <hi>ſecundum naturae conſilium,</hi> according to the counſell and diſpenſation of nature, for the preſeruation of theſe creatures the water and the earth made but one globe: ſo now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for the deſtruction of theſe creatures, the waters did hyde &amp; couer the whole earth, as according to nature they ought to doe. And we ſee by our owne experience, though not in generall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath promiſed otherwiſe, yet in particular, how often <note place="margin">Gen <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> the water goeth beyond the bankes, &amp; maketh breaches into the land. And it is in mans reaſon impoſſible how it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but that the water being a liquid and fluid ſubſtance, ſo farre in quantitye exceeding the earth, and in place higher then the earth, ſhould preſentlye drowne the earth. But onely God doth ſupernaturally gouerne it, &amp; reſtrayne it againſt the nature of the firſt creation. The windowes of heauen were open, that is, as the Text doth expound it, it rayned 40. dayes and 40. nights, all the cloudes were melted and diſſolued into rayne, and wheras before God ſeparated and diuided the waters from the waters that ſome <note place="margin">Gen, 1.</note> were beneath in the Sea and riuers, and parte of the earth &amp; ſome in the ayre frozen and congealed into cloudes: now to make a deluge and generall ouer-flowing, he brake the partition, and let them be at libertye as they were before.</p>
               <p>I could for their better contentment ſtand vpon ſuch natural cauſes as are beſides the Text, as ſome Diuines &amp; Philoſophers haue done, which by the windowes of heauen vnderſtand <hi>Cancer Piſces, Heiades, Pleiades,</hi> and <hi>Orion</hi> among the ſtarres, <hi>Mars, Venus</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> among the planets. Alſo I could alleadge <hi>Mech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> the ſcholer of <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> in his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaryes, which <note place="margin">In magnas Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bumaſaris con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctiones.</note> writeth that before the floud there was a Coniunction of <hi>Iupiter</hi> &amp; <hi>Saturne</hi> in the end of <hi>Cancer,</hi> contrary to the Ship called <hi>Argo,</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:10639:42"/>
which repreſented the Arke, and that this Coniunction did por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an inundation, although I need not to ſtand vpon theſe thinges, becauſe the naturall cauſes which I haue alleaged out of the Text are ſufficient.</p>
               <p>But they obiect, that the waters couered the mountaynes 15. cubits vpward, as it is in the Text, and they aske how that could be, ſeeing there were but two cauſes, the ſwelling of the waters beneath, and the rayne from aboue. For ſome mountaynes are higher then the middle region of the ayre, and by a conſequent <note place="margin">Selius Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiſt: Cap. 18. Herodian.

Againe, though the cloudes are not aboue theſe fewe mountaines, yet the firmament or middle region of the ayre it ſelfe is farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue them, and although ſome of theſe mountaynes are found to be by the plum-lyne or perpendiculer 15. ſurlonges aſcending from the playne, and the cloudes are commonly lifted vp but 10. furlonges aboue vs, yet ſometimes they are lifted vp 40. furlonges as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſheweth. Againe, the very waters of the deep doe ſtand <note place="margin">Lib: 2 cap 23.</note> aboue the mountaynes. You aske how that may be? you ſay they are beneath the firmament, &amp; that therfore they cannot be aboue the mountaines, ſeeing theſe aboue the firmament are the clouds which are a great deale lower then the mountaynes, vnleſſe the waters which are beneath the firmament, ſhould be aboue the waters which are aboue the firmament? To this I anſwer, that the miſtes which are in the vallyes are reckoned among the waters which are aboue the firmament, and yet are ſometimes diſſolued into rayne before they are drawne vp ſo high as the mountaynes, for which cauſe they ſeeme to them which be in the vallyes, to be gathered together in the tops of the mountaynes, and doe hyde the mountaynes with darknes: in the tops of which mountaines, yet Springes doe ariſe, which are of the waters beneath the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament.</p>
               <p>For an other cauell, they obiect, that the floud began the 17. day of the ſecond month, that the rayne continued 40. dayes, that the waters preuayled 150. dayes, where-vpon they aske how it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10639:43"/>
could be that the Arke reſted vpon the mount of <hi>Armenia</hi> the 7. day of the 7. month, which by this account was 4. dayes before the falling of the water? to them I anſwer: the waters preuayled on the earth 150. dayes, albeit they began to be diminiſhed before the full end of 150. dayes. albeit they began to be deminiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ful end of 150. dayes. For nothing letteth but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might well be ſaide to preuayle, that is to be ſtrong and deep vpon the earth, albeit they were in parte diminiſhed, and that the Arke might drawe ſo deep of water, as the mount being high, to reſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it. And where it is ſaid after the Arke reſted vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne then the waters were abated, that is, it might then more plainly &amp; ſenſibly be perceiued and apeare to the eyes of <hi>Noah.</hi>

This is the ſlorie of the Bible, and what ground hath any Atheiſt to deny it? The Chriſtian may eaſily confound the Atheiſt, becauſe the reliques of it doe yet remayne, and the place doth ſhew it ſelfe. Concerning the time when it was done, it is ſet downe in the Text, that it was burned in the dayes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> which aroſe early in the morning and beheld the ſmoke of it mounting vp as the ſmoke of a Furnace. And by iuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation it is well knowne to haue beene about 392. yeares after the ſloud. The place is well knowne to all Coſmographers, and is daylye ſeene by many trauaylers: it is one of the three famous Lakes which are in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which are commonly by the figure <hi>catachreſis</hi> called ſeas.

The nature of it is ſuch that if any bordes be throwne into it, they will preſently ſinke to the bottom, if any veſſell be vpon it which hath men in it, ſo long as the men liue it will bee aboue the water, but as ſoone as the men are dead being poyſoned with the ſtinke of it, the veſſel wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſinke. In ſo much that when <hi>

The qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie of this ſtinking lake is about 8. high <hi>Almaigne</hi> miles, with in the compaſſe of it were ſcituated theſe fiue Citties, <hi>Sodom, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morah, Adama, Seboim,</hi> and <hi>Segor,</hi> which were deſtroyed with fire and brimſtone, of the which the cheife and principal was <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> In this water ſtandeth a Rocke, which to them that behold it, repreſenteth the image of a woman, that is <hi>Lots</hi> wife.

Some Trees doe growe there, and bring fruite, but the fruites thereof neuer come to rypenes: if a man gather one of the Apples and cut it with his knife, they are full of nothing but ſparkles of fire and noyſome ſmoakes. And therfore, for the confirmation of this ſtory, beſides the witnes of the Scriptures, we need no more then the teſtimony of the place it ſelfe, which doth moſt plainly diſcouer it ſelfe. And therefore, the beſt counſaile that I can giue the Atheiſt that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this ſtorye is this: that hereafter he doe no more denye the truth of it, or make anye queſtion how it might be, but rather thus: <hi>Quotiescun<expan>

               <p>I Haue (I truſt) ſufficiently proued that there is a God, that the Atheiſts might be conuerted vnto the true God. But, becauſe this knoweledge of God in his creatures, is onely ſufficient to giue them occaſion to ſeeke further, and no way in it ſelfe able to ſaue their ſoules, they muſt alſo knowe him in his Sonne, by whome onely ſaluation commeth. When the fulnes of time was <note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> come ſaith the Apoſtle, God ſent his Sonne made of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c That I may therefore proue vnto them God in his Sonne our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, by humane authorityes and reaſons, becauſe they will not ſtand to the authoritye of the Scriptures: I will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage the teſtimony of the deuils out of the Goſpell, which ſayd: Ieſus thou Sonne of God, what haue we to doe with thee? art thou come hither to torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vs before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time? but out of prophane <note place="margin">Mat, 8.</note> hiſtoryes, which ſayd in effect the ſame thing.

               <p>Our Sauiour ſhewed himſelfe many waies to the Infidels to be God, &amp; yet to be borne, but they vnderſtood him not. <hi>Tully</hi> citeth <note place="margin">De diuina Hone.

Lib 37</note> from heauen, writings in grauen in Marble pillers were blotted out. But they had not ſomuch light as to vnderſtand that the Kingdome of Chriſt his Goſpell ſhould ouerthrow idolatrie, and preſcribe new Chriſtian lawes, whereby his Church ſhould be gouerned. Great was the blindenes of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> which could
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10639:45"/>
erect an altar to the Sonne of God, &amp; yet could not acknowledg the Sonne of God whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was borne and publiſhed to the world, and being himſelfe a tipe &amp; figure of Chriſt, yet did not ſee chriſt in his ſelfe, of whome hee was a figure. And, that it may not ſeeme to any man abſurde which I haue ſaid, that <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> was a tipe of Chriſt, wee finde the like in the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> concerning <hi>Cyrus</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia:</hi> I haue likened thee to my ſelfe, thogh thou haſt <note place="margin">Eſay, 45.</note> not knowne me. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was a tipe of Chriſt though hee knewe not Chriſt, in that he deliuered Gods people out of Captiuitie, by giuing them leaue to returne to their countrie and to builde the Temple. So was <hi>Auguſtus</hi> a tipe of Chriſt in his happie &amp; peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gouernment of the Empire, in that hee was ſaluted firſt by that name of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the ſixt day of Ianuarie, and the ſame day was Chriſt worſhipped as a God &amp; King by the wiſe men which came from the Eaſte: that vnder him were burnt the recordes and <note place="margin">Mat, 2.</note> ſpecialties of the debts w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were due to the treaſure houſe or cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Empire; for ſo by our Sauiour was cancelled the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing <note place="margin">

L, 6, C, 20.</note> of ordinance which was againſt vs, and it, was nayled on the Croſſe, when our Sauiour was borne: greate quantitie of oyle did miraculouſly iſſue out of the earth, what was that but the birth of the Lords annointed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was annointed with the oyle of gladnes aboue al his fellowes? vpon that miracle <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was ſo aſtoniſhed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after that time no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhold <note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> call him Lord, &amp; what was that but a manifeſt acknowledgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that a greater Lord was borne then <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was?</p>
               <p>To this alſo I may adde the teſtimonye of the ſtarces and conſtellations in heauen, to ſhew the Atheiſt the birth of the Son <note place="margin">Mat. 2.</note> of God vpon the earth. The wiſemen, as I haue ſhewed before, ſought out our Sauiour Chriſt by the leading of a Starre, which Staire I haue proued to bee miraculous. And yet although the birth of the Sonne of God was not ſubiect to conſtellations, but was farre aboue the capacitie of Aſtrologers and the courſe of the heauens: yet the verie Aſtrologicall predictions, and Aſpects of other naturall Starres were enough to giue occaſion to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to ſeeke farther and ſo to come to the knowledge of the birth of Chriſt, for aſmuch as they did yeelde <hi>benignos influxus et ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca lumina,</hi> as the Aſtrologers call them; the beſt influences; and moſte fauourable Aſpects vnto the natiuitie of him, of whome
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10639:46"/>
they receaued their influences, their lights, their Aſpects, and all their heauenly vertues. The wiſe men which came from <hi>Perſia</hi> to <hi>Bethleem,</hi> although they could not knowe Chriſt by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, yet the heauens gaue them two manner of wayes to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that a man ſhold be borne, which in glorie &amp; honour, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and pietie, ſhould farre exceede all other men. For firſt, the ſixt yeare before our Sauiour was borne, there was a coniunction of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturne</hi> in <hi>Cancer,</hi> which mooued all the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers then liuing, to ſay, that ſhortly after there ſhould inſue a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great change and alteration of Religion. Secondly the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the heauen which was at the time of our Sauiour his birth in the 42. yeare of the Empire of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the 24. of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a little before midnight did teſtifie the ſame. For in it the <note place="margin">Petrus Alia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Card: quest in Gen. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Horoſcopus</hi> was the eight part of <hi>Virgo,</hi> which ſignifieth change of Religion, <hi>Saturne</hi> was in the higheſt part of the heauen, <hi>Sol</hi> in the loweſt, which did ſhewe that ſuch a Childe was borne which might cauſe the world to wonder. And as <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> citeth out of <hi>Albumaſar</hi> the great Aſtrologer: <hi>aſcendi in prema</hi>

               <p>Thus, haue I proued the comming of Chriſt by manie wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10639:46"/>
of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of deuils, of ſtars &amp; ſenſeles creatures, cyted out of prophane ſtories, becauſe the Atheiſt wil not beleeue the teſtimony of God &amp; Angels in the holy Bible. Yet for their better ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerning diuers particulars, I will alleage them reaſon ſo far as faith may bee made manifeſt by reaſon, that if poſſibly it may be, they may be brought to the acknowledgment of the truth.</p>
               <p>They aske vs what neede there was that the Son of God ſhould take our fleſh? and whether God was not able to ſaue vs by other meanes? I anſwer, Man offended God, &amp; therfore it behoued man to make ſatiſfaction, but ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone was not able to ſatiſfye, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were ioyned together. I proue the <hi>minor,</hi> that man alone was not able to ſatiſfie, becauſe God would not be ſatiſfyed but by ſacrifice, &amp; no ſacrifice vnleſſe it were infinite, could ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. That an infinite ſacrifice was requiſit, I proue by theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: An infinite offence cannot be purged but by a ſacrifice an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the offence, but mans offence was infinite in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, firſt, of the infinite God-head w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was offended, ſecondly of man himſelf w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was the offender, which although he be finite, yet <hi>voluntate peccandi in infinitum rapitur,</hi> hee hath an infinite wil &amp; deſire to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit offences. And againe, as man alone was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſo it was not for God alone to worke this worke of our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe there was no ſacrifice ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to pacifie God but by death, &amp;, as man without God could not ouer-come death, ſo God without man could not ſuffer death, &amp; therefore it was required that the Sauiour of the worlde ſhould be God incarnate, and ſo God and man to make one Chriſt might be vnited together.</p>
               <p>They aske how it came to paſſe that man offended? For their ſatisfaction I anſwere: God made two eſpeciall creatures to his owne Image, indued with vnderſtanding, Angels and men: hee gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two giftes wherby they might continue their happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, knowledge to diſtinguiſh betweene good and euill, &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of will to chooſe one &amp; leaue the other, ſo that they might chooſe whether they would fall or ſtand. The Angelles firſt fell, the cauſe of their fall was pride, the obiect by which they were puffed vp, the reflection of themſelues vpon their own ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding their owne glorie and that excellencie whereunto they were created. For they could not be proud without an obiect, &amp; there could be no other obiect to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proud but themſelues.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10639:47"/>
For God was ſo farre aboue them in glorie, that the ſight of him would make them rather to haue a meane conceite of themſelues and as for man he was farre beneath them, that they took no ſuch delight in looking ſo ſtedfaſtlye vpon him, as to compare him with themſelues. And therfore they beheld themſelues in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ſo being delighted with their owne glory, manie of them forgot their owne ſelues how they were ſubordinate vnto God, and ſo their ſeruice &amp; duetie towards God was interrupted, which did conſiſt in perfect loue, ſincere adoration, and imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him. And for this cauſe they were caſt downe. After their fall they enuied that man ſhould ſtand, and mooued him to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, the outward obiect which allured him to diſobedience being an Apple, they mooued him to take the Apple by falſe ſuggeſtions; that ſo his eſtate ſhould bee aduanced. Now both Angells &amp; men had fallen, it pleaſed God to reſtore man againe, but not Angells, for theſe two cauſes: Firſt, the Angells being firſt in the praeuarication ſeduced man, and were the cauſe of his fall. Secondly, the Angells being Spirits and not bodies were of greater perfection then man was, &amp; therefore better able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſinne and all manner of temptations then man was, and therefore God was more highly diſpleaſed with the ſinne of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells then he was with the ſinne of men. And therefore hee ſent his Sonne for the redemption of Man, but not of Angells.</p>
               <p>They aske why the Father tooke not fleſh rather then the Sonne? why the Sonne being incarnate had his conception of the holy Ghoſt without begetting how he could be borne of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and wherefore he was ſo borne? to which queſtions I anſwer as followeth:</p>
               <p>The incarnation of the Sonne was the worke of the whole Trinitye, yet one perſon was incarnate, as if three ſiſters ſhould make a Coate, and one put it on. <hi>Pater &amp; Spiritus imple erunt carnem Chriſti maieſtate, Filius tantum aſſumptione,</hi> The Father and the holy Ghoſt filled the fleſh of Chriſt by their maieſty, but the Sonne by aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it vnto him ſelfe <hi>Quia congruum fuit, vt qui erat in deitate Filius Dei, eſſet in humanitate filius hominis,</hi> It was moſt fit that the Sonne onely ſhould be incarnate, and not the father, nor the holy Ghoſt, that he which in his diuinity was the Sonne of God, might be in his humanitye the Sonne of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:10639:47"/>
He could not haue beene man, had he not beene conceiued. And foraſmuch as he came into the world to redeeme mankind, which he could not doe vnles he were without ſinne, &amp; he could not haue beene without ſinne, had he not beene conceiued onely and not begotten, For if man had begotten him he had begotten him in ſinne, becauſe <hi>omne ſimile generat ſui ſimile,</hi> euerye thing which begetteth doth beget that which is like to it ſelfe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was not begotten, but onely conceiued without the helpe of man, and he could not haue beene ſo conceiued, but by the holy Ghoſt. He was therefore conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, that he might be conceiued without ſinne.</p>
               <p>As he was conceiued by the holy Ghoſt that he might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued without ſinne, ſo he was borne of a Virgin that he might be borne without ſinne. But they aske how he could be borne of a Virgin? I could aske them how <hi>Eue</hi> could be borne of <hi>Adam</hi> without a mother? or <hi>Adam</hi> of the earth without father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? why could not Chriſt aſwell be borne of a mother without a father, as <hi>Eue</hi> of a man without a woman, or <hi>Adam</hi> without man or woman? And becauſe this doth not onely concerne the A theiſt, but alſo the Iewe and the <hi>Maniche,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of them both ſayth: <hi>Ego tibi oſtendam incredule Iudaee &amp; deteſtande Manichaee, peperiſſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginem,</hi> I will proue to the vnbeleeuing Iewe, and the curſſed Maniche, how a Virgin may bring forth a Childe.

I will not therfore cyte the authorityes &amp; exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of the ſcriptures, how Chriſt aroſe out of his graue, the graue being ſhut vp, &amp; the ſtone not rolled away: how after his reſurrection he went into the houſe where his Diſciples were, the doores being locked: how at his aſcenſion he peirced the heauens: how he is (as before I haue <note place="margin">Math, 28, Luc, 24, Marc, 16, Ioh, 20. &amp; 21</note> ſhewed) <hi>liberrimum agens, &amp; medijs non alligatum,</hi> a free agent, and not tyed to meanes whereby he worketh: how he hath <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicum imperium in ſingula,</hi> a ſupernaturall power whereby he ouer-ruleth all creatures.

And becauſe vnderſtanding creatures are in three places, deuils and damned ſoules in hell, men vppon earth, Angelles and bleſſed ſoules in Heauen, due courſe required that he ſhould deſcend into hell to triumph among the Deuils &amp; damned ſoules, ariſe from the dead to triumph before men, and aſcend vp into heauen to Triumph among the Angells, &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoules which are in heauen. It was no ſtrange thing for him to deſcend into hel, becauſe that deſcenſion was onely in ſoule, &amp; therefore an eaſie paſſage. Of his reſurection from the dead we ſee manie reſemblances, for out of the aſhes of the dead Phoenix doth ariſe a liue Phoenix, of the Corne buried and rotted in the earth, foringeth vp Corne againe in greater meaſure then it was ſowed, all theſe thinges being as vnlikely, and as impoſsible as the reſurection from the dead.

That man declineth, it is manifeſt, for men are of lower ſtature, leſſer bones and ſtrength, and ſhorter life then their fore fathers were, but whatſoeuer is languiſhing, faynting &amp; declining, doth growe to an end, &amp; whence commeth this but from the declining eſtate of the greater world?

Theefe which was crucified by him, but hel fire to vngodly men. But to perſwade theſe vnbeleeuers that there is an hell, my reaſons are theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, I haue manifeſtly prooued that there is a God, and it cannot ſtand with the nature of God, but that he muſt be iuſt, and there can be no iuſtice in God vnles he puniſh offenders, they for the moſte part do eſcape puniſhment in this worlde, Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe not ouer take them in this life therefore that God may be iuſt, their iudgement is reſerued vnto another world that they may be puniſhed in an other place, and where is that, but in Hell-ſire.</p>
               <p>Secondly whereas <hi>Tully</hi> a Philoſopher, <hi>Claudius Claudianus</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, witnes the Atheiſt that there is a hell for wicked men. For many times hauing committed heynous offences, though ſo ſecret that no man can detect them, &amp; he ſo mightie that he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no man that ſhould puniſh him, yet he is inwardly troubled &amp; vexed in his Conſcience: what is this his Conſcience but a ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cret feare that God will puniſh him? he ſoeth that God doth not puniſh in this world according to the qualitye of ſuch an offence, therfore he feareth puniſhment in an other world, then witnes the Atheiſt his owne Conſcience there is a hell.</p>
               <p>Fourthly witnes, the Atheiſt that there is an hell, all be it hee denyeth Hell. For hee knoweth, and alſo verye well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10639:51"/>
that in the time of his health he is ſubiect to ſicknes, pouertie, impriſonment, a whole ſea of gall and bitternes, nay a worlde of diſcontentments, yet he would not dye Nay whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is grieuouſly ſicke, his panges intollerable, his diſeaſe vncurable, he would giue a great ſumme of money yet to prolonge his paine vpon earth, to liue heere continually though in continuall ſickenes. And why is all this, but becauſe hee is loath to die? why is that, but becauſe he feareth death? But if hee thought his ſoule were extinguiſhed by death, that after death there ſhould be no iudgement, no hel, no feeling of ſorrowe, then why ſhould hee feare death? Nay why ſhould not an Atheiſt which is ſo worldly wiſe, and which loueth his own eaſe ſo much, deſire to die, and ſo to be at reſt rather then to liue in continuall ſicknes, if he thought that death were an end of ſorrowe? Therefore it followeth as a neceſſarie conſequent, that he feareth death, becauſe he thinketh that a farther reckning is to be made of the thinges which he did in this life, that greater panges and torments ſhall enſue after death then could bee inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vnto him in this life, and that can bee nothing elſe but Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, let the Atheiſt for his better ſatisfaction concerning this point, but trauaile into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to beholde the lake <hi>Aſphaltites,</hi> where <hi>Sodom</hi> ſtood, and he ſhall ſee the verie Image and Idea of Hell before his eyes ouen in this life. When he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth thither theſe thinges ſhall preſent themſelues vnto him: <hi>Tetrus odor, aſpectus horrendus, lacus fietidus, fumus venenoſus, poma quae morſu tentata, in fumum et fauillam or to fatiſcente vaneſcunt.</hi> An vgly and loathſome ſmel of brimſtone, horrible &amp; dreadful proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, a ſtinking lake poyſoning ſmoke, Apples full of filthie va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and ſparkes of fier, the thinges which hee ſhall ſee with his eyes, ſmell with his Noſtrells, and taſte with his tongue, wil make him to confeſſe there is an hell.</p>
               <p>To them which aske whether hell be a materiall place or no? I anſwer, it muſt of neceſſitie be ſo, becauſe in it are to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented not onely ſoules, but alſo bodies. It is no imaginarie thing, becauſe when they come there, it ſhalbe no imaginarie puniſhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which they ſhall ſuffer. If they aske where hell is? ſurely it is in the loweſt parts of the earth, becauſe they are fartheſt from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
