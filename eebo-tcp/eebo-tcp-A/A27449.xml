         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>May it Pleaſe your Excellency,</opener>
            <p>
               <hi>ROME,</hi> who in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

               </gap>s now corrupted not only in
<pb facs="tcp:47218:3"/>
Her Manners, but alſo in
Her Doctrine. Yet She is ſo
Confident, as to accuſe of
Impiety and Hereſie all the
Proteſtant Churches of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Holland, Germany,</hi> and
other Countries; and perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily
affirm, unleſs they be
of Her Communion, they
muſt never expect to be ſav'd.
And ſo I may ſay without
any paſſion, that She is like
thoſe Lewd and Naughty
Women, who quarrelling
with thoſe, that are Honeſt,
do immediately call them
infamous and opprobrious
Names, leſt the ſame ſhould
be juſtly retorted upon Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
I do not here intend
to ſpeak of the Vices of the
<pb facs="tcp:47218:3"/>
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince moſt
of 'em, to our Shame, are
too frequently found amongſt
us; I will only make mention
of Her Tyrannies, Idolatries
and Hereſies, which, thanks
be to God, are not yet ſeen
in Reformed Churches, and
were the true Reaſons, why
I left my Native Country,
and came hither to live and
end my days.</p>
            <p>I know a different Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
will be made by the
Papiſts, as alſo by ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;
for, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
newly converted to the
Chriſtian Religion, was not
only hated by the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſome
of them making an Oath,
they would neither, eat nor
<pb facs="tcp:47218:4"/>
drink, till they had kill'd him;
but even was ſuſpected by the
Apoſtles themſelves, who
were for ſome time afraid to
converſe with him. So when
a Man leaves the Errors of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
the Truths of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, then all the
Zealots of his former Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
do preſently Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
him; and thoſe, who
were his moſt intimate
Friends, become his greateſt
Enemies. And that, which
moſt aggravates his Trouble,
is, that the Proteſtants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom he came to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
himſelf, do commonly
doubt of the Sincerity of his
Converſion, and are very ſhy
<pb facs="tcp:47218:4"/>
of putting Confidence in him.</p>
            <p>He that has powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
ſtands in need of a
mighty Protection; and this
is the reaſon, My Lord, why
I do here, under God, implore
yours; which I do not in the
leaſt queſtion, ſince you are
an Enemy to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and have a great Love
for the Truth of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion, and no leſs
Tenderneſs and Affection for
them, that couragiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it.</p>
            <p>The Three Sermons, I
have lately preſented to your
Excellency, were ſo kindly
receiv'd, that I thought, I
was obliged upon the firſt
opportunity to make ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
<pb facs="tcp:47218:5"/>
to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
by dedicating this
ſmall Treatiſe. I ſhould not

Gift, but the Intention in

            <p>I do not here intend to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

will only ſay, that every one
admires your ſolid Judgment,
extraordinary Prudence, and
wiſe Conduct in the high
Places you are in, as well as

            <head>ROME,
Tyrannous, Idolater, and Heretick.</head>
            <p>THE Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
may be now compared
to the Image of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar;</hi>
for as his
Head was of fine Gold, his Breaſt
and Arms of Silver, his Belly and
his Thighs of Braſs, his Legs of
Iron, and his Feet part of Iron and
part of Clay: So, when we look
upon the Ancient Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
She was then as pure as Gold. But
when we come to the following
Ages, we do find in her ſo notable
a change; that we do now ſee in
her an Iron-Age, and quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the former. I do not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47218:8"/>
here intend to imitate ſeveral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
who even, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
but a ſmall Book, are wont to
make a long Preface. They build,
as the Proverb ſaith, the Door
bigger than the Houſe. They do
promiſe much, and perform but
little. That I may not be guilty
of the fault, which I do here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to others, I immediatly enter
into my Subject, and prove <hi>per
Argumentum ad Hominem,</hi> that is,
by the very Principles of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that She is <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous,
Idolater,</hi> and <hi>Heretick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I ſhew that She is Cruel and
Tyrannous; for all thoſe, that
contrary to the Doctrine of Jeſus
Chriſt and Law of Nature, do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
Men, and cauſe them to die,
meerly becauſe they are not of their
Opinion and Religion, are Cruel
and Tyrannous.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary
to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and
Law of Nature, does perſecute
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47218:8"/>
Men, and cauſe them to die, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe they are not of her Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Religion:</p>
            <p>Therefore She is Cruel and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous.</p>
            <p>The Major Propoſition of this
Argument is true; as for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
which is in queſtion, I prove
it thus.</p>
            <p>It is evident, that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church does perſecute Men, and
cauſe them to die, meerly, becauſe
they are not of her Opinion and
Religion. The rigorous Laws of
her Inquiſition, whereby She did
perſecute an innumerable number
of Men, and cauſe them to die,
meerly, becauſe they were not of
Her Opinion and Religion, is a
convincing proof of what I ſay.
And that it is contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Jeſus Chriſt and Law of
Nature to perſecute Men, and
cauſe them to die, becauſe they
are not of our Opinion and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
I ſhall endeavour to prove it
evidently.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47218:9"/>
1. I ſay that this Doctrine of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church, by Perſecuting Men,
and cauſing them to Die, meerly
becauſe they are not of her Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Religion, is contrary to
Chriſt's Doctrine. For Jeſus Chriſt
going to Worſhip at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>
the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Religion, refuſing to receive
him in his Journey, two of his
Diſciples, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took Fire, and out of a well-meaning
Zeal for their Maſter, and
of the true God, and of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>
the true place of Worſhip, asked
leave to diſpatch out of the way
theſe Enemies of God and Chriſt,
and the true Religion. And to
this end they deſired our Saviour to
give them Power to call for Fire
from Heaven to conſume them.
Jeſus Chriſt ſeeing them in this
heat, which ſeem'd to be well-meaning,
did very calmly, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
reprove this Temper of
theirs; ſaying, <hi>The Son of Man is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47218:9"/>
not come to deſtroy Mens lives, but
to ſave them.</hi> Luke 9. 56. You
own your ſelves to be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but do you conſider what
Spirit now Acts and Governs you?
Not that ſurely which I do teach
you, which is not furious Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and deſtructive Spirit, but
mild, gentle, and aiming at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to ſave Men's Lives, even
of our greateſt Enemies. This
Spirit of Perſecuting and Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another about Religion, is
contrary to the Intention, for which
I came into the World. <hi>For I am
not come to deſtroy Men's Lives, but
to ſave them.</hi> Ye ought to love one
another, even your greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and far from giving you
leave to Perſecute them, I forbid
you to hate thoſe who Perſecute
you. If I would deſtroy my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and the Hereticks that are not
of my Religion, could I not do it
by the Power which I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from my Father; and could I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47218:10"/>
not obtain of him a Legion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to deſtroy them? But my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is not that Religion ſhould
be propagated in this cruel Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
but by Meekneſs and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.
I will have Men to be
drawn to the Profeſſion of it by the
Bonds of Love and Conviction. <hi>If
any Man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
if any Man will come after me.</hi>
And when his Diſciples were lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him, he does not, as they do
in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> ſet up an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to Torture and Puniſh them
for their Defection from the Faith;
only ſays, <hi>will ye alſo go away?</hi> And
in imitation of this bleſſed Pattern
the Chriſtian Church continued to
ſpeak and act for ſeveral Ages. This
was alſo the Language of the Holy
Fathers and the Style of Councils;
they ſaid that <hi>the Chriſtian Law
doth not avenge it ſelf by the Sword.</hi>
Lex nova non ſe vindicat ultore
gladio; <hi>and that we muſt not offer
Violence to no Man, to compel him to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47218:10"/>
Faith.</hi> Nemini ad credendum vim
inferre. And <hi>Gregorius</hi> ad <hi>Epiſc.
Conſtant,</hi> Writes thus. <hi>Nova &amp;
inaudita praedicatio quae verberibus
exigit Fidem.</hi> This ſort of Preaching
is new and ſtrange, which extorts
Faith by Whips and Scourges. If
<hi>Hereticks</hi> were to be Perſecuted
and Deſtroyed, the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
who were true Hereticks, and had
affronted our Saviour himſelf, the
Honour of God and of Religion,
ought certainly to be puniſhed.
And to ſhew the contrary, Jeſus
Chriſt does ſeverely rebuke his
Diſciples that had a great mind to
deſtroy them, ſaying unto them,
<hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit
ye are of;</hi> and he gives them ſuch
a Reaſon, as ought in all Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Religion, how wide ſoever
they be, to deter Men from this
Temper; for, ſaith he, <hi>The Son
of Man is not come to deſtroy Men's
Lives, but to ſave them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:47218:11"/>
What can then the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> plead for her Perſecution to
Men for the cauſe of Religion,
which <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> might not
much better have pleaded for
themſelves againſt the <hi>Samaritans?</hi>
Does ſhe practice theſe Severities
out of a Zeal for the Honour of God,
of Chriſt, and the true Religion?
Upon theſe very Accounts it was
that <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> would have
called for Fire from Heaven to have
deſtroyed the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> Is ſhe
perſwaded, that thoſe whom ſhe
Perſecutes are Hereticks, and that
no Puniſhment can be too great
for ſuch Offenders? So <hi>James</hi> and
<hi>John</hi> were perſwaded of the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans;</hi>
and upon much better
Grounds than thoſe of the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> for Jeſus Chriſt does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
them, ſaying, <hi>Ye know not
what manner of Spirit ye are of.</hi> But
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the Governing part of it;
this Excuſe cannot be brought for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47218:11"/>
a good Plea; for the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which they do Profeſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
them Perſecution. And it is
no more evident in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
that Jeſus Chriſt was
born, died, and roſe up for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
than it is manifeſt that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ought not to Perſecute one
another for the Miſ-belief of any
Article of Revealed Religion;
much leſs when theſe Articles are
invented by Men, or are impoſed
as only Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>I know that thoſe that live in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, are not all of
this Opinion, that all Hereticks, or
thoſe that are not of their Opinion
ought to be Perſecuted and put to
Death. I knew ſome of them in
<hi>France,</hi> which were of a better and
more Chriſtian Principles; yet it
is too true that this helliſh Doctrine
is taught and practiſed among
them. Their ſeveral and frequent
Conſpiracies in <hi>England,</hi> their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
and horrible Maſſacres in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

does neglect it, let him be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
by the Metropolitan
Biſhop; and from that time let him
Denounce his Subjects, diſcharged of
their Allegiance, and let him give his
Country to be Poſſeſſed by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi>
And in the next words, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Priviledges and great Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
are granted to all Men that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47218:13"/>
ſhall endeavour to deſtroy the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</p>
            <p>2. I make it appear, that this
Doctrine of Perſecuting and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
thoſe which are not of
our Opinion and Religion, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Law of Nature. For
this is the Law of Nature, <hi>As ye
would that Men ſhould do unto you,
ſo do you unto them.</hi> We would not
be Perſecuted and Deſtroyed for
our Opinion and Religion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought not to Perſecute
and Deſtroy others.</p>
            <p>But ſome will object, we have
a Law, and by this Law they
ought to be Perſecuted and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, if that were a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Reaſon to warrant Perſecution,
we could not blame the <hi>Jews,</hi> when
they Crucified Jeſus Chriſt; for
they ſaid, <hi>They had a Law, and that
by this Law he ought to die.</hi> And we
could not blame Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who
by a Law in her days, cauſed ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47218:14"/>
many to ſuffer Martyrdom; nor
could we now blame the Papiſts,
who by their Laws in <hi>France, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>Spain,</hi> eſtabliſh Cruelty and
Oppreſſion, and as ſo many <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi>
give Order, that all
Perſons that will not Worſhip their
God of Bread, or refuſe to bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Images, or will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what they believe, be Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
Tortured, and put to Death
by the moſt cruel Torments.</p>
            <p>If any Man be found a Plotter,
or breed Sedition and Diſturbance
in a Kingdom; if he contrive any
Evil againſt the King or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he ought to be Puniſh'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
But if he only be found Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
concerning ſome Articles of
Religion, he ought to be Taught
and Admoniſh'd by the Biſhop,
and afterwards rejected from the
Congregation, if he will not be
perſwaded. But he ought not to
be caſt into Priſon, nor deprived of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47218:14"/>
his Eſtate, nor ſent to the Gallies,
nor Condemned to Die. For this
Cruelty, as I have already ſhewed, is
not only contrary to the Doctrine
of Jeſus Chriſt, but to the Law of
Nature alſo. And therefore it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is
Cruel and Tyrannous; ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Chriſt's Doctrine and the
Law of Nature, ſhe Perſecutes
and puts Men to Death, meerly
becauſe they are not of her Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Religion.</p>
            <p>The Origine, or the Author of
this helliſh Doctrine was a Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
Fryar, or rather the King <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar;</hi>
for as he that would
not Worſhip his Image, was caſt
into a fiery Furnace, ſo thoſe that
will not Worſhip the God of Bread
of the Papiſts, and bow to their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
are Condemn'd to be
burnt alive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhew that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church is Idolater.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:47218:15"/>
All thoſe, that do Worſhip the
Creature for the Creator, are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Creature for the Creator;</p>
            <p>Therefore ſhe is an Idolater.</p>
            <p>The Major Propoſition of this
Argument is true, and is granted
by all Divines. As for the Minor,
which is in queſtion, I prove it
thus.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
a bit of Bread baked upon the
Fire, and takes it for her God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe does Worſhip the Creature
for the Creator, therefore ſhe is
an Idolater.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
a bit of Bread baked upon the
Fire, and takes it for her God;
this does clearly appear, ſince ſhe
believes that the Bread being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
by her Prieſts, is really
Tranſubſtantiated, or changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt,
and renders unto it the very ſame
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47218:15"/>
Adoration that we render to the
Godhead. And that it is falſe that
this Bread Conſecrated by her
Prieſts, be really changed into the
true Body of Jeſus Chriſt. I will
make it evidently appear, becauſe
this Doctrine of theirs is contrary
to the Holy Scripture, to Senſes, to
Reaſon, and to the Holy Fathers.</p>
            <p>1. I ſay that it is contrary to the
Holy Scripture, that the Bread
Conſecrated by her Prieſts, be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
changed into the true Body of
Jeſus Chriſt, and conſequently be
here ſtill upon Earth; for Jeſus
Chriſt being about to leave the
World, and his Diſciples afflicting
themſelves upon this account, he
doth not comfort them by ſaying,
I leave you my Body under the
Species of Bread and Wine, but he
tells them, <hi>The Poor ye have with
you, but me ye have not always; I
came forth from the Father, and am
come into the World, again I leave
the World and go to the Father.</hi> He
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47218:16"/>
tells them that his Father will Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
them, will ſend them his holy
Spirit, and that he is going to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them a place in Heaven. He
tells them of his interceſſion, and of
his ſecond coming to Judge both
the quick and the dead, and <hi>that the
Heavens muſt receive him until the
time of the reſtitution of all things.</hi>
John 12. 8, 16, 28. Acts 3. 21.
and in the 24th Chapter of St. <hi>Mat.
26</hi> Verſe, it is written, that a time
will come, when they ſhall ſay,
<hi>Lo, here is Chriſt, or there, behold
he is in the ſecret Chambers, and
that we muſt not believe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe words, it appears clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it is contrary to the holy
Scripture, that the Body of Jeſus
Chriſt be yet here upon Earth, and
conſequently, that the Bread Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
by the Prieſts, be really
changed into his Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, took Bread, and
gave Thanks, and ſaid, <hi>Take ye and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47218:16"/>
eat, this is my body which is broken
for you.</hi> Matth. 26. 1 Cor. 11. 24.
Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, is true, he has ſaid in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Bread, <hi>This is my Body;</hi>
therefore this Bread ought to be
changed into the true Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt; therefore he is here
ſtill upon Earth. And to ſhew, ſhe
ſaith, that it is not the Figure of
Jeſus Chriſt, and theſe words, <hi>This
is my Body,</hi> are not Metaphorical,
becauſe he ſaid, <hi>which is broken for
you.</hi> Now it is not the Figure of
Jeſus Chriſt, which was broken
for us, but his true Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is certain that Jeſus
Chriſt is true; and though he ſaid,
<hi>This is my Body which is broken for
you,</hi> and that it was the true Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Jeſus Chriſt which was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for us, and not the Figure;
yet that doth not hinder theſe
words from being Metaphorical;
and to let you ſee it clearly, obſerve
my Reaſon. <hi>This is my Body which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47218:17"/>
was broken for you,</hi> (is) that is to
ſay, <hi>ſignifieth or repreſenteth.</hi> As
you may ſee in ſeveral other Texts
of the holy Scripture; as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in this. <hi>The Rock was Chriſt,</hi>
where this word, <hi>(was)</hi> means,
<hi>did ſignifie or repreſent. Which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for you;</hi> the Relative, <hi>(which)</hi>
does not ſerve to ſhew the Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation;
or that the Bread is
changed into the true Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, becauſe it is related to
this Word <hi>(Body)</hi> and not to the
Propoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>This is my Body.</hi> It
has a relation to the Attribute, and
not to the Subject. That which
hinders not this Propoſition from
being Metaphorical, no more than
<hi>this, the Rock was Christ.</hi> For if
the Evangeliſt had added, which
was Crucified, or which was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
again; as the Relative <hi>(which)</hi>
would not hinder this Propoſition
from being Metaphorical; likewiſe
theſe words, <hi>which was broken for
you,</hi> hinder not the other Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from being Improper and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:47218:17"/>
               <hi>Mark,</hi> that his Body was not
broken before he Suffered upon
<hi>Golgotha:</hi> How did he ſay then,
<hi>which is broken,</hi> before it was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?
There is no ſenſe of it but
this. The Bread was broken, and
ſignified that his Body ſhould be
broken. Now, as the breaking
of the Bread did ſignifie the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his Body, ſo the Bread muſt
ſignifie his Body: And as his Body
was not broken indeed, when the
Bread was broken; ſo the Bread
could not be his Body indeed, for
then his Body ſhould have been
broken, when the Bread was broken.</p>
            <p>If becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is
my Body, this is my Blood,</hi> they will
have theſe words to be expounded
litterally; why then do they not
expound the other words of Chriſt
litterally alſo concerning the Cup?
For the Text ſaith, that he took
the Cup, and ſaid, <hi>This is my Blood.</hi> I
am ſure that thoſe of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> will not ſay that the Cup was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47218:18"/>
the Blood of Chriſt, as the words
declare it to be, but that there is
a Figure in theſe words, namely,
<hi>Continens pro Contento;</hi> that by the
Cup is meant the Wine in it. If
then they will admit a Figure in
this Propoſition, why there may
not be a Figure in the other; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Signatum pro Signo;</hi> that theſe
words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ſhould be
underſtood thus, the Bread is a
ſign of my Body.</p>
            <p>I may prove as well, that Chriſt
is a Door, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>I am the
Door;</hi> and that he is a Vine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſaith, <hi>I am a Vine;</hi> for
his ſayings are alike. But Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Speeches muſt not be conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
litterally. Now, that they may
ſee, that not we only ſay, 'tis Bread
and Wine after Conſecration, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt himſelf doth call them
ſo. <hi>I will drink no more,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>of the fruit of the Vine.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt
aſſures, that it was the fruit of the
Vine which he drank; therefore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47218:18"/>
Wine and not Blood was his drink;
therefore after Conſecration, Wine
was ſtill Wine. And St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. c.
11.</hi> does confirm it, when he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaith, that <hi>the Communicant doth
eat Bread.</hi> Therefore the Bread
remains Bread after the words of
Conſecration: For, if it were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated
into the Body of
Chriſt, then were there no Bread
to eat; the Body of Chriſt ſhould
be the thing that ſhould be eaten,
and conſequently ſhould not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Bread.</p>
            <p>What I ſay may be ſeen by theſe
words of Jeſus Chriſt, wherein he
aſſures us, <hi>That he was the bread of
life which came down from Heauen,
which if any man eat, he ſhall live
for ever,</hi> John 6. 50. His Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
hearing theſe words, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
until he had expounded them.
And how did he expound them?
thus, <hi>He that comes unto me, has
eaten; and he that believes in me has
drunk.</hi> Afterwards, when He In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47218:19"/>
this Sacrament in like
words, they murmured not, which
they would as before, if he had
not reſolved them before, that, to
eat his Body, and to drink his Blood,
was nothing but to come to him,
and believe in him. For, as it is
plainly ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> ſo it
is plainly ſaid, <hi>Theſe words are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
that is, they muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
ſpiritually, and not litteral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
ſo ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, Believe, and
thou haſt eaten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was Chriſt's manner to ſpeak
by Similitudes, Figures, and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
ſhewing one thing by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For example, Chriſt calls
the Lamb the Paſſover, in place
whereof this Sacrament ſucceeded.
And yet the Paſſover was this, <hi>An
Angel paſſed over the houſe of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
and ſtruck the Aegyptians,</hi>
Exodus 12. 27. This was not a
Lamb, and yet becauſe a Lamb
was a ſign of this Paſſover, as the
Bread and Wine are of Chriſt's
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47218:19"/>
Body and Blood; becauſe of that
Chriſt called the Lamb the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as he called the Bread and
Wine his Body and Blood. This
may be ſeen again in Circumciſion,
Baptiſm, and the Cup.</p>
            <p>Circumciſion is called the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
and yet Circumciſion was
nothing but the cutting away of a
Skin, and the Covenant is this;
<hi>In Abraham's ſeed all nations ſhall
be bleſſed; I will be their God, and
they ſhall be my People; I will defend
and ſave them, and they ſhall ſerve
and worſhip me.</hi> This is not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
and yet as though the
Circumciſion were the Covenant
it ſelf, it is called the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, Baptiſm is called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation;
and yet Baptiſm is a
<hi>dipping our Bodies in Water,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
is the renewing of our
mind to the Image of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was Created. This is not
Baptiſm, and yet, as though Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
were Regeneration it ſelf, it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47218:20"/>
is ſo called, becauſe it ſignifies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
            <p>And the Cup is called the New
Teſtament; and yet the Cup is
but a piece of Metal, filled with
Wine: And the New Teſtament
is, <hi>He that believes in the Son of God
ſhall be ſaved.</hi> This is not a Cup,
and yet, as though the Cup were
the New Teſtament it ſelf, it is
called the New Teſtament. So the
Bread and Wine are called Chriſt's
Body and Blood, becauſe they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
Chriſt's Body and Blood.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine of ours may be
confirmed, becauſe every Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was called by the thing which
it ſignified; and yet never any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
was taken for the thing it
ſelf. What reaſon have they then
to take this Sacrament for the thing
it ſelf more than all the reſt? It is
the conſent of all Divines, that a
Sacrament is a Sign; therefore it
is no more the thing ſignified, than
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47218:20"/>
the Buſh at the Door is the Wine
in the Cellar.</p>
            <p>But what then, will the Papiſts
ſay, is there nothing in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but Bread and Wine? We
do not ſay that this Sacrament is
nothing but a bare Sign, or that
we receive no more than what we
ſee: For Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that it is his
Body;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures, that it
is the Communion of Chriſt Body
and Blood. Therefore there is
more in this Sacramental Bread
than in the common Bread we Eat
in our Houſes; for though the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Bread be not changed, yet
the uſe is changed. It doth not
only ſerve the Body, as it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but alſo it ſerves for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
of our Souls; for as ſure as
we receive Bread, ſo ſure we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Chriſt. And you may ſee
this by this Similitude: You have
an Obligation in your hand, and I
ask you, what have you there?
and you anſwer, I have here an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47218:21"/>
hundred thouſand Crowns. How!
ſay I, I ſee nothing but Paper, Ink,
and Wax! Oh, but by this, ſay
you, I ſhall recover a hundred
thouſand Crowns, and that is as
good.</p>
            <p>So when ye receive theſe Signs
in the Sacrament of the Lord's
Supper, ye receive the Vertue of
Chriſt's Body and Blood by Faith;
and it is all one as if ye ſhould eat
his Body, and drink his Blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſay that it is contrary
to Senſes, that the Bread Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
by Popiſh Prieſts, be
really changed into Chriſt's Body.
For when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
would oblige me to believe, that
what my Senſes behold, is not
Bread and Wine, but the true Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Blood of Chriſt, it is clear
that it is contrary to them; for my
Eyes ſee them to be Bread and
Wine, I ſmell nothing but Bread
and Wine; I taſte nothing but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47218:21"/>
Bread and Wine, and my Hands
feel nothing but Bread and Wine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> We confeſs, ſay they,
that it is contrary to Senſes, but
Senſes ought not to be Judges in
the Myſteries of Faith.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer. That Jeſus Chriſt
made uſe of the Senſes, to prove
to his Apoſtles, that he was not a
Spirit, but a Body, when he ſaid
unto them, <hi>Handle me and ſee, for
a ſpirit has not fleſh and bones as ye
ſee me have,</hi> Luke 24. 32. And
if the Fathers diſputing againſt the
<hi>Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Euthicheens,</hi> the
former of which believed that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt had not a true Body, but
only the appearance; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that the Subſtance of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was changed into the Godhead
after his Reſurrection, they made
uſe of the very words of Jeſus
Chriſt. <hi>Handle me and ſee, for a
ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones as ye
ſee me have.</hi> I may after their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
make uſe of my Senſes in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47218:22"/>
the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and
ſay, to let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
know, that what they believe to
be the true Body and Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, is true Bread and Wine,
<hi>Handle and ſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The reaſon, ſay they,
why Chriſt's Body is not ſeen in
the Sacrament, is becauſe he is
there miraculouſly.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, That if the Bread be
turned into the very Body of
Chriſt by a Miracle, then ſhould it
appear viſibly ſo. For the Nature
of every Miracle is to be viſibly to
the outward Eyes and Senſes. As
when Jeſus Chriſt turned Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Wine, it was viſibly
Wine, when <hi>Moſes</hi> Rod was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into a Serpent, it was viſibly a
Serpent. And ſo if the Bread were
turned into the very Body of
Chriſt, it ſhould be viſibly a Body,
if they will hold a Miracle in this
Sacrament. But St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that there is no Miracle in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47218:22"/>
the Sacraments. <hi>Honorem,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>tanquam Religioſa poſſunt habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
ſtuporem tanquam mira non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt,</hi>
Tom. 1. 8. c. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſay that this Doctrine
is contrary to Reaſon. 1. Becauſe
it ſuppoſes the ſame Body in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places at one time. A Body
may be conſidered objectively at
one time in ſeveral places, but that
it ſhould be really or ſubſtantially
in many places at one time alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
would have, which teaches and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliges
to believe that the Body of
Jeſus Chriſt is Subſtantially in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, and in every place,
where the Prieſt pleaſes to Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate,
or pronounce theſe words,
<hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood,</hi>
and in every part of the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Bread; ſo that if you divide it
into a thouſand Parts no bigger
than the Point of a Needle, he is
there in every part wholly, that is
contrary to Reaſon. For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47218:23"/>
to Reaſon, a Body of ſix Foot
in Dimenſion, cannot occupy no
more place than the Circumference
of ſix Foot; and though it may be
ſucceſſively in ſeveral places, yet
it cannot at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>And theſe words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts
3. 22. <hi>Whom the Heaven muſt receive
until the times of reſtitution of all
things,</hi> Prove my ſaying evidently;
for though he has a glorified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet he retains the Nature and
Property of a true Body ſtill, which
cannot be but in one place at once.
And ſo ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in Joan.
Tract. 3. <hi>Corpus Domini in quo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrexit
uno tantùm loco eſſe poteſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This Doctrine is contrary to
Reaſon, becauſe it makes Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
exiſt without any Subject.
It is the Nature of Accidents to be
joyned to their Subject. As for
Example, It is the nature of the
whiteneſs of a Stone to be joyned
to the Stone; ſo that if you deſtroy
the Nature or Subſtance of this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47218:23"/>
Stone, you muſt of neceſſity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
its Whiteneſs, and other its
Accidents. And according to the
Opinion of Modern Philoſophers,
who ſay that Accidents are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe than Matter modified,
that is to ſay, as it is diſpoſed to
this or that Faſhion; it follows that
Matter cannot be deſtroyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
its Accidents being deſtroyed
likewiſe with it. It is the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Iraeneus,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That we
cannot conſider Water without its Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity,
nor Fire without Heat, nor a
Stone without Hardneſs; theſe things
being ſo United, that the one cannot
be without the other, but that they
muſt exiſt together</hi> Nevertheleſs,
thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teach
the contrary; for in their Myſtery
of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> they put Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
without any Subject; they
put Colour and Quantity without
Matter, Smell and Taſte without
Subſtance, Hardneſs and Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
without there being any thing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47218:24"/>
that is hard and moiſt. I may
then very well ſay and affirm, that
this Doctrin is contrary to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>I ſay that it is contrary
to the Holy Fathers, for St.</hi> Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
<hi>Epiſt. ad Caeſar, ſaith,</hi> That
the myſtical Symbols do not loſe their
proper Nature, but remain in their
firſt Subſtance, as the Body of Christ
has preſerved the true Subſtance of a
Body when it was Glorified. <hi>And
Writing to the People of</hi> Antioch,
<hi>Hom. 6. he ſaith,</hi> That God gives
us things Spiritual under things Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Natural; and that Bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sanctified, is delivered from the
Name of Bread, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> exalted to the
Name of the Lord's Body, although
the nature of the Bread ſtill remains.</p>
            <p>Origines <hi>in</hi> Matth. 15. <hi>ſpeaks
thus,</hi> The Bread that is Sanctified
with the Word of God, as touching the
material Subſtance thereof, goes into
the Belly, and forth again like other
Meats.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:47218:24"/>
               <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Iraeneus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Lyon,</hi> ſay, <hi>That our Fleſh is
nouriſhed with the Cup, which is
the Blood of Chriſt, and is increaſed
with the Bread, which is the Body of
Chriſt.</hi> Theſe words do deſtroy
thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who,
becauſe they believe that the Bread
and Wine are changed into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Blood of Chriſt, are forced
to ſay, that our Body is not nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with the Bread and Wine, but
with their Accidents, or by ſome
Subſtance that God Createth.</p>
            <p>Tertullian, L. 4. Adverſ. Marci.
c, 40. <hi>ſaith, that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt took
the Bread, and giving it to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
made it his Body, ſaying, this is
my Body. That is to ſay, as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
himſelf explains it, the Figure of
my Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>Cont. Adam. c. 12. is
of that Opinion,</hi> The Lord, <hi>ſaith he,</hi>
doubted not to ſay, this is my Body,
when he gave but the Signs of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<hi>And in</hi> Pſal. 8. <hi>He ſaith,</hi> That
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47218:25"/>
the admirable Patience of Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Judas to the Banquet, wherein
he delivered to his Diſciples the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of his Body and Blood. <hi>And in
the third Book of the Chriſtian
Doctrine, he ſpeaks thus.</hi> When
the Lord ſaith, if ye do not eat the
Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink
his Blood, you ſhall have no life in
you. He ſeems to command a Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs
and a great Crime; therefore
it is a Figure, whereby it is injoyned
unto us to think upon our Lord's Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and remember that his Fleſh was
Crucified and Wounded for us. <hi>He
ſaith alſo in an Epiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to</hi> Boniface,
That the Sacraments are called by
the name of the things they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>The Sacrament then of the Lord's
Supper, may be taken either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctively
with what it repreſents,
and in this Senſe it is ſaid to be the
Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt;
or ſeparately from the things
which it ſignifies, and in this Senſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47218:25"/>
it is the Type, the Symbole, or
Figure of the Body and Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt; and that is to be ſeen
in the Affairs of the World; as
when we ſay, that the Letters
which are brought, wherein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Pardon which the King
gives to a Criminal, are the King's
Pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoret,</hi> Dial. 2. <hi>ſaith,</hi> That
the myſtical Signs after Conſecration
do not depart from their Nature, but
they abide ſtill in their former Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
Figure, and Form, and may
be both ſeen and felt as before. <hi>And,
Dial. 1. he ſaith,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt
has honoured the viſible Symbols with
the Name of his Body and Blood, not
in changing their Nature, but in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Grace to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Pope</hi> Gelaſius, <hi>in lib. de duab.
nat. adverſ. neſt. &amp; Eutich. ſaith,</hi>
That the ſubſtance or nature of Bread
doth not ceaſe, and verily there is
the Image and Similitude of the Body
and Blood of Chriſt celebrated in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47218:26"/>
action of the Myſteries of the Body of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baronius,</hi> An. 648. N. 15. and
869. N. 3. ſaith, That <hi>Theodorus,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> and that the
Council held at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for
the Condemnation of <hi>Photius,</hi> took
the Conſecrated Cup, and poured
Ink into it, and having dipp'd their
Pens into theſe two mixt Liquors,
they ſubſcribed the depoſitions of
theſe Men. If they had believ'd
that the Conſecrated Wine was the
Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, as now the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes, is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
that they would have mixt
Ink with it, and dipp'd their Pens
with it? No, it is not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
would not do ſo now, but would
believe they ſhould commit an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Sacrilege.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if the holy Fathers
had believed <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi>
that is, the converſion of Bread
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47218:26"/>
and Wine into the true Body and
Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, they would
not have failed to inſtruct us, that
a Body is under a point; that it
has Accidents without any Subject,
and that it is after the manner
of a Spirit. They would have
taught us what nouriſhes our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in receiving of this Sacrament,
and from whence come the worms
which are ingendred in the Bread.
They would have told us what
kind of action it is, which makes
Chriſt Exiſt under the Species of
Bread and Wine; whether it was
a <hi>Reproduction,</hi> or <hi>Adduction,</hi> or <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bification.</hi>
I ſay, they would have
taught us all theſe things, ſince the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gives now a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
inſtruction in it. Now,
ſince they were as Learned as the
preſent Doctors of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> are at this time; and ſince they
ſaid nothing of it, it is a certain
ſign that this Doctrin was contrary
to their Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:47218:27"/>
And for the confirmation of
what I ſay is, that when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
diſputed againſt Idolaters,
they confuted them with theſe
words, <hi>Why do you adore what your
Hands have made, and which has
neither Speech nor Motion, but is
ſubject to Fire, and to Corruption,
and to be ſtolen away by Thieves?</hi>
This was the Argument they made
uſe of to prove that they were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.
If at that time they had
believed <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
would not have failed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
their Argument; and ſince
we find they have not retorted it,
it is a certain ſign that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
was contrary to the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The Origine of <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was a Dream of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> a
Monk of <hi>Corbis;</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> the
Third, in the Year of our Lord
1215. ſet it up amongſt the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith, in the Council of
Latran. So many years were paſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47218:27"/>
before <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
Then the Pope ſet it on foot,
and ſo it came out from <hi>Rome;</hi> and
for want of the holy Scripture, of
Reaſon, and holy Fathers to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, they have ſince defended,
and do ſtill defend it at this day
with Sword and Fire.</p>
            <p>It is then manifeſt, that the
Bread Conſecrated by the Popiſh
Prieſts is not really changed into
the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; and
therefore that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
is Idolater; ſince in Worſhiping a
bit of Bread baked upon the Fire,
in Praying to it, in carrying it in
Proceſſion, in ſhewing it to the
People in their Maſs, in offering
Frankincenſe unto it, in bowing
before it at the Ringing of a ſmall
Bell or Cymbal, as the People did
before the Image of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi>
and taking it for their God;
She Worſhips the Creature for the
Creator.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:47218:28"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> We believe that what
we do Worſhip is God, and that
therefore hinders us from being I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, If this Reaſon were
good and ſufficient, the Heathens,
which did Worſhip <hi>Jupiter,</hi> had
not been Idolaters; becauſe they
believed him to be the true God.
And yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
that all thoſe who did Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> were Idolaters. It is
then true, that to Worſhip as a
God, that which is not God, tho'
it be taken for a God, is a groſs and
flat Idolatry; and therefore that
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Idolater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe Worſhips for her God a
bit of Bread, which is not God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſhe believe, and take it for
her God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> I ſay that ſhe is Idolater,
becauſe ſhe makes graven Images
of the Godhead, and bows before
them; and becauſe ſhe kneels down
before thoſe of Saints, prays to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47218:28"/>
them, kiſſes and ſerves them, offers
Frankincenſe unto them, Crowns
them with Flowers, Cloaths
them with Fine Garments, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as it may be ſeen in the II.
Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> that they ſhall
not only be placed in Churches,
Chappels, and Oratories, where
the Divine Majeſty is Worſhiped,
but ſhall be alſo Honoured and
Worſhiped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which is directly contrary to
theſe words of</hi> Samuel, Prepare your
hearts to the Lord, and ſerve him
only; <hi>and to thoſe of Chriſt in St.</hi>
Matthew, Thou ſhalt worſhip the
Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou
ſerve; <hi>as alſo to thoſe of God, in
the XX Chapter of</hi> Exodus, Thou
ſhalt not make unto thee any graven
Image, nor any likeneſs of any thing
that is in Heaven above, or that is in
Earth beneath, or that is in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

               <hi>Objection,</hi> This forbidding, ſay
they, is againſt Idols, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               </gap> only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I Anſwer, That theſe
words, <hi>Nor any likeneſs of any thing
that is in Heaven above,</hi> &amp;c. ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the one and the other, I mean
both Idols and Images. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
I ſay, that beſides this diſtinction
of a Worſhip of <gap reason="foreign">

Scripture, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her own Confeſſion,
and the Doctrin of her Angelick

This Truth is eſpecially
ſeen upon <hi>Good Friday,</hi> at which
time ye may ſee, that not only the
Monks, Prieſts, Biſhops, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,

even that Princes and Kings lay

               <hi>Objection,</hi> This Worſhip, ſay
they, that they do render to the

related to the Croſs and Images,
but to God and Saints; and that is
the reaſon, ſay they, why they
are not Idolaters.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, That theſe words of
<hi>Samuel, Prepare your hearts unto the
Lord, and ſerve him only;</hi> and that
thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt in St. <hi>Matthew,
Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God,
and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> do
quite deſtroy all theſe diſtinctions
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning
the Relative Worſhip of <hi>Latria</hi> and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47218:30"/>
               <hi>Dulia.</hi> For, that it is a flat Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to Worſhip God in any Image, I
evidently ſhew it by the Children
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they made the
golden Calf to be a Repreſentation
of God, <hi>Exod. 32.</hi> For the Text
ſhews that it was a flat Idolatry,
for which many of them were
Plagu'd and Puniſh'd. And yet
their Worſhip was Relative; for
their meaning was to Worſhip the
true God in the Calf; for they
were not ſo ſimple as to think or
believe that that dead Idol or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
was God. The Idolatry then
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping
the Croſs, and the Images
of the Godhead, and by bowing
down before the Images of Saints,
Martyrs, Apoſtles, and kiſſing them,
and imploring their aſſiſtance, and
offering Frankincenſe unto them,
is as groſs and wicked as theirs
was.</p>
            <p>The Origine of the Worſhiping
mages, proceeds from <hi>Irenea,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47218:30"/>
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> about the
year 790. She called a Council at
<hi>Nice,</hi> wherein by Intreagues and
Threatnings, ſhe did ſo prevail,
that it was concluded we ought to
Worſhip Images, notwithſtanding
the Oppoſitions that were then
made in all Parts. For the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> did at the ſame
time call a Council at <hi>Francfort,</hi>
wherein that of <hi>Nice</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
and the Decree of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping
Images made void. But
becauſe they remained ſtill in
Churches, this Superſtition of
Worſhiping them, to which the
Ignorant People was always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd,
got at laſt the uppermoſt.</p>
            <p>It is then true, as I have clearly
made it appear, that the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Idolater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhew that ſhe is <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;</hi>
for all thoſe that are obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in their Errors, are <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is obſtinate
in her Errors; therefore ſhe is <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:47218:31"/>
The Major Propoſition is true,
and all Divines are of that Opinion.
As for the Minor, which is in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
I prove it thus.</p>
            <p>All thoſe, that refuſe to obey the
Holy Scripture in ſeveral Points of
Faith and Practice, are obſtinate
in their Errors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Church refuſes to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Holy Scripture in ſeveral
Articles of Faith and Practice.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſhe is obſtinate in her
Errors.</p>
            <p>The Major Propoſition is true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and it is the conſent of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.
As for the Minor, behold
as I prove it.</p>
            <p>All thoſe, that do add to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, and diminiſh from it
ſeveral Articles, both of Faith and
Practice, refuſe to obey the Holy
Scripture; for <hi>Deut. 4. 2.</hi> It is
commanded us neither to add to
the Word of God, nor to diminiſh
from it. And St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 4.
6.</hi> Forbids to think above that
which is Written.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:47218:31"/>
But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> adds to
the Word of God, and diminiſhes
from it ſeveral Articles both of
Faith and Practice.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſhe refuſes to obey the
Word of God; therefore ſhe is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
in her Errors; therefore ſhe
is <hi>Heretick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does
add to the Word of God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
from it ſeveral Articles, both
of Faith and Practice, is that I ſhall
endeavour to ſhew evidently.</p>
            <p>1. I ſay that ſhe adds to the Word
of God ſeveral Articles of Faith,
which ſhe obliges to believe under
the Pain of Damnation. For
though it be manifeſted in ſeveral
places of the Holy Scripture, that
Jeſus Chriſt is our <hi>Saviour, Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and <hi>Mediator; that there is no
Salvation in any other, and that there
is no other name under Heaven,
whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 4.
12. <hi>That we have an Advocate with
the Father Jeſus Chriſt the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and that he is the Propitiation
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47218:32"/>
for our Sins,</hi> 1 John 2. 1. And <hi>that
there is one God, and one Mediator
between God and Men, the Man
Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Tim. 2. 5. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
call the bleſſed Virgin the <hi>She-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi>
of the World, as it may be
ſeen in <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> c. 4. of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And in the Litanies and
Hymns Compoſed in her Honour,
they call her <hi>the Queen of Heaven,
Mother of God, and their Hope,</hi> and
give her ſuch Titles as belong to
God only. They implore the help
of Saints, they put their Truſt and
Confidence in them, and take them
for their <hi>Advocates</hi> and <hi>Mediators;</hi>
as we may ſee in ſeveral Prayers,
wherein they ſpeak thus. <hi>O great
Saint, in whom I put my Truſt and
Confidence, Pray for me miſerable
Sinner,</hi> &amp;c. And though Jeſus
Chriſt, Teaching his Diſciples how
they ought to Pray, bid them to
call upon his Father, and ſay, <hi>Our
Father which art in Heaven.</hi> And
although the Almighty ſpake thus
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47218:32"/>
by his Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah 45. 21. There
is no God elſe beſide me, a Juſt God
and a Saviour, there is none beſide
me.</hi> Yet thoſe of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> will have us to implore the
help of Saints, to truſt in them,
and take them for our <hi>Advocates</hi>
and <hi>Mediators;</hi> as it is declared in
the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Seſſ. 25. It
is then evident, that this Doctrine
being not found in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they add to the Word of God,
and think above that which is
Written.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> We Pray, ſay they, and
beg the Favour of the Saints, as
we pray a Friend at Court to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
a Kindneſs from His Majeſty;
I Anſwer, they ought not to do ſo,
for it is Written, <hi>We have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt
the Righteous.</hi> And we do not read
that any other is our Advocate. If
the King's Son ſhould ſay, when
ye will ask my Father any Favour,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47218:33"/>
come ye unto me, and not unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
if after this Declaration,
ſome body ſhould go unto another,
he ſhould be very Imprudent. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 11. 28.</hi> Speaks
thus, <hi>Come unto me all ye that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and are heavy laden; and I will
give you reſt.</hi> We muſt not have
then another Advocate beſide him.
<hi>By him,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, we have an
acceſs to the Father,</hi> and we do not
read that we have it alſo by the
bleſſed Virgin, or by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St.
<hi>Anthony,</hi> or any other Saint.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St.</hi> Chryſoſtome, Hom. 2. de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanea,
<hi>ſpeaking of this Woman,
who, though ſhe were a Sinner,
was bold to come unto Chriſt,
ſaith thus,</hi> Behold the Wiſdom of this
Woman, ſhe doth not Pray to <hi>James,</hi>
ſhe doth not beſeech <hi>John,</hi> ſhe goes
not to <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhe looks not to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the Apoſtles, neither requeſt
any of them; but for all this ſhe takes
Repentance for her Companion, and
goes to the very Fountain it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:47218:33"/>
               <hi>St.</hi> Ambroſe, <hi>in</hi> Rom. c. 1. <hi>ſpeaks
thus,</hi> They are wont to uſe a pitiful
Excuſe, ſaying, that by the Saints
they may have acceſs unto God, as by
the Earls there is Acceſs to Kings;
by Officers and Earls, Acceſs is made
to the King, becauſe the King himſelf
is a Man; but to come to God, from
whom nothing is hid, there is no
need of a Spokeſman, but a devout
Mind; for whereſoever ſuch a one
ſpeaks to him, he will anſwer him.</p>
            <p>The Souls of Men, <hi>ſay</hi> Tertullian
<hi>and St.</hi> Auſtin, do not take care of
the Affairs of the Living: The Saints
are not our Mediators, we do praiſe
the Martyrs, becauſe they fought for
the Truth, but we do not Worſhip
them. For what end then are theſe
Solemnities? That by them we may
thank God for their Victories, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
others to imitate them, and
be partakers of their Palms and
Crowns. But, that we may obtain
them, ſhall we implore the Aſſiſtance
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47218:34"/>
of the Saints? No, but we ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
the help of that true God, who
made them Martyrs. <hi>de cura pro
mortuis, c. 13. &amp; cont. Parm.
l. 2. c. 8. de Civit. l. 8. c. 27.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hereunto I may add that which
is written in</hi> Eccleſiaſtes 9. 5. That
the dead knew not any thing, neither
have any more a portion for ever in
any thing that is done under the Sun.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I may ſay that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> intreats in vain
the help of the Saints; for God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
does know our Thoughts. And
the moſt Learned Doctors of that
Communion cannot ſay how they
may hear the Prayers of Men; for
they confeſs it is not a Property of
their Happineſs; and ſome ſay
they ſee only the things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to them; ſome ſay that God
diſcovers to them the Prayers of
Men; ſome ſay they ſee in the Face
of God, as in a Looking-glaſs, all
things here below. Some aſſure
that the Faithful which are upon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47218:34"/>
Earth, give notice of their Deſires
and Minds to to the Saints, as the
Angels do Communicate their
Thoughts one with another. To
make it ſhort, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
is ſo uncertain concerning the
Saints, that oftentimes ſhe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
and Prays to them, that are
now burning in an everlaſting
Fire.</p>
            <p>The Origine of the Interceſſion
of the Saints, proceeds from thoſe
publick Penitents; which for their
Crimes, were Condemned to be
ſeparated from the Church for
ſome years. For Martyrdom being
in a great Honour amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and the Church having a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
eſteem for thoſe that were
Priſoners for the Goſpel, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Penitents did Write to theſe
Martyrs, that they would be ſo
kind as to Intercede for them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Church, that they
might be admitted in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
before the time of their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47218:35"/>
Penance were expired. Such was
the Interceſſion of Saints at that
time, they knew then no other
in the ſecond Age, as it may
be ſeen in St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſay that the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> adds to the Word of God,
when ſhe teaches, and will have
us to believe that there is a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
wherein the Souls of the
Faithful departing this Life are
Afflicted and Tormented; ſome
for a ſhort time, ſome for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, ſome for a thouſand and
upwards, and others to the end of
the World. For this Doctrine is
not found in the Holy Scripture,
but it is quite contrary to it; as it
appears by theſe Words of the
14th Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,
Bleſſed are the dead which die in the
Lord, from henceforth, yea, ſaith
the Spirit, that they may reſt from
their labours, and their works do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them.</hi> As alſo by thoſe of the
Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> Canonized by the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47218:35"/>
general Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein
it is written, that <hi>the Souls of the
Righteous are in the hands of God,
and there ſhall no torment touch them.</hi>
This appears alſo by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when
he ſaith in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
that <hi>there is now no Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to them that are in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the
Fourth finding Purgatory very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to his Kitchin, ſpeaks
thus, <hi>I certainly believe that there
is a Purgatory, and that the Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
therein are relieved by the
Prayers of the Faithful.</hi> And the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Seſſ. 25. <hi>gives
Order to all Biſhops, to take care that
the ſound Doctrine of Purgatory, which
was delivered to us by the holy Fathers
and ſacred Councils be Believed, and
Taught, and Preached every where.</hi>
And though Mr. <hi>Amelot,</hi> who was
a Papiſt, and tranſlated into <hi>French</hi>
the Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
does confeſs that Purgatory can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47218:36"/>
be prov'd; and though the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot declare,
whether this Purgatory be in the
Air, or in the Earth, or in the
place wherein Sins are committed;
yet ſhe ſaith, that the Pope with
an Indulgence laid unto a Bead, or
Croſs, or Medal; or with a Maſs
Celebrated upon certain days of
the Week, gives Power to deliver
from this Purgatory whom he
pleaſes, and when he thinks it fit.</p>
            <p>I ſay then in the firſt place, ſince
this Doctrine is not found in the
holy Scripture, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
addeth to the Word of God, and
thinks above that which is written.
<hi>2ly,</hi> I ſhew ſhe does deſtroy her ſelf,
when ſhe will have us to believe
under the Pain of Damnation, that
there is a Purgatory. For, if there
be a Purgatory, either it is to purge
Sins, or to purge the Pain due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. It is not for the former,
becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church believes,
that Jeſus Chriſt did by himſelf
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47218:36"/>
purge all our ſins, according to theſe
words of St. <hi>John, His Blood cleanſes
us from all ſins;</hi> and becauſe they are
to be purged before we be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from this World, it is then for
the purgation of the Pain; but the
Pain is puniſhed and not purged;
for a Gallows is not for the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Murder, but for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of it. Therefore, ſince
Purgatory, according to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
is only for the Pain due to
ſins, they deſtroy themſelves when
they call it Purgatory. It has no
warrant in the holy Scripture, for
Jeſus Chriſt ſhews but two places,
<hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> when he ſaith,
that the <hi>Rich Man's</hi> Soul, which
was unmerciful to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> went
after his Death into Hell, and there
was tormented; and that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus's</hi>
Soul, he being Dead, was
carried into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſome, a
place of Joy and Comfort. To
the <hi>Thief</hi> which was Executed
with Chriſt at his Paſſion, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47218:37"/>
believed in him, Jeſus Chriſt
anſwered, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with
me in Paradiſe:</hi> Which ſhews that
the Souls of the Faithful never
come into Purgatory-fire, to be
burnt and tormented; for all their
Sins are forgiven, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Puniſh ment incident to the
ſame is forgiven alſo; and their
Souls paſs from Death to Life, that
is, they go to Heaven. <hi>Bleſſed are
the dead that dye in the Lord, from
henceforth they reſt from their labors,
and their works follow them.</hi> If
from the time of their Death they
have Bleſſedneſs, and Reſt, then
they are not in any Purgatory-fire
to be burnt and tormented. <hi>The firſt
place,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Hyp. L. 5. <hi>the
Faith of the Catholicks, doth by divine
Authority believe, is the Kingdom
of Heaven; the ſecond is Hell; a
third place we are utterly ignorant
of, neither can we find ſuch a one in
the holy Scriptures.</hi> And in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiridion
ad Laur. c. 67. He ſaith,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47218:37"/>
               <hi>That thoſe that believe a Purgatory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire,
are much deceived, and that
through a humane Conceit. Know
ye,</hi> ſaith he, de van. ſecul. 1. c.
<hi>That when the Soul is ſeparated from
its Body, ſhe is immediately placed
in Paradiſe for her good Works, or caſt
into Hell becauſe of her Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The Primitive Church,
ſay they, did pray for the
Dead, as <hi>Tertullian de Corona Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litis</hi>
doth confeſs: Therefore it is
a good proof that ſhe believed a
Purgatory.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, That when the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church did pray for the
Dead, ſhe did not believe they were
in any place of Torments, nor that
there was a Purgatory: She only
believed, that the Souls of the
Faithful ſhould only enjoy the ſight
of God after the day of Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
She prayed then for the filling
up of their Glory; ſhe prayed to be
joyned with them, and be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the Reſurrection of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47218:38"/>
Faithful. She prayed that Jeſus
Chriſt would haſten their Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and ſhe prayed alſo for the
Patriarchs, the Prophets, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
and Martyrs, that God
would be pleaſed to increaſe their
Glory; but ſhe did not implore
their aſſiſtance, nor believe a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
as it is related by <hi>Juſtin
Martyr, 9. 60.</hi> and <hi>76. Iren. L. 5.
Tertul. Cont. Marc. L. 4. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Origine of Purgatory is
<hi>Virgil</hi> in the ſixth Book of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neids,
wherein he ſaith, that the
Souls, before they enjoy Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
are differently purged in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
places, as you may ſee in
theſe following Verſes.</p>
            <l>Ergo exercentur poenis, veterum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
malorum</l>
            <l>Supplicia expendunt; aliae pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur

            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:47218:38"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhew that the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> adds to the Word of God,
when ſhe teaches, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils and Popes are Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
that the latter have Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Pre-eminence over all other
Biſhops; that they have power to
Depoſe Kings and Princes from
their Thrones, and are above them;
for this Doctrine is not found in
the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1. I ſay that their general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and Popes are not Infallible;
for St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>Tom. 6. l. 2. cont.
Donat. plainly teaches that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
and the holy Scriptures are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
or cannot Err.</hi> The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> which are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
of all the Chriſtian World, are
often corrected, the former by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when by any tryal of things, that
is opened which was ſhut, and that is
known which was hidden. <hi>If a general
Council may be corrected, as ſaith
St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>therefore it may err:
Wherefore he ſpeaks thus to</hi> Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47218:39"/>
               <hi>Biſhop of the</hi> Arians; Neither
ought I to alledge the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
nor thou the Council of <hi>Arimini</hi> to
take advantage thereby; for neither
am I bound nor held by the Authority
of this, nor thou of that. Set Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with Matter, Cauſe with Cauſe,
or Reaſon with Reaſon; try the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by the Authority of the Scriptures,
<hi>l. 3. c. 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
condemned the ſetting up Images
in the Churches; and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice,</hi> Act. 4. ordered after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they ſhould be ſet up. One
of theſe Councils, being contrary
to the other, muſt needs be Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.
And that is granted by it
ſelf, when in a ſet Form of Prayer,
which is appointed to be ſaid after
the concluſion of every Council,

            <p>
               <hi>Objection,</hi> The Popes, ſay they,
have Authority or Pre-eminence
over all other Biſhops, becauſe they
are Succeſſors to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and St.
<hi>Peter</hi> had ſuch a Pre-eminence and
Authority over the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
becauſe Jeſus Chriſt told
him, <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this
Rock I will build my Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant that Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi>
after he had confeſſed him to be
that Chriſt, and the Son of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon
this Rock I will build my Church.</hi> But
theſe words give no Superiority to
St. <hi>Peter</hi> above the other Apoſtles;
only they ſhew, that the Church
is builded, not upon the Perſon of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47218:41"/>
               <hi>Peter,</hi> but upon the Rock, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon Chriſt, whom St. <hi>Peter</hi>
confeſſes to be the Son of the Living
God. For, as ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor.
3. 11. <hi>That Rock was Chriſt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
foundation can no man lay but
that which is laid already, namely,
Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And in the ſecond
Chapter to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he ſaith,
<hi>That the Church is built upon the
foundation of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the
head ſtone in the corner.</hi> Where
then can they find that St. <hi>Peter</hi>
was made Prince of the Apoſtles,
and had Pre-eminence or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over them? They ſay it is,
when Jeſus Chriſt gave unto <hi>Peter</hi>
the Keys of Binding and Looſing.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that Chriſt therein
gave no more Authority to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
than to the reſt of the Apoſtles;
for he doth not ſay, I give unto
Thee, but I will give unto Thee;
which Promiſe was afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;
and when it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47218:41"/>
the Keys, or the Power of
Binding and Looſing was given not
only to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but alſo unto all
the reſt together, <hi>Go ye,</hi> ſaith Jeſus
Chriſt, Matth. 28. 19. <hi>unto all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Baptizing them in the Name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghoſt; teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
all things whatſoever I have
commanded you.</hi> And in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> he ſpeaks
thus, <hi>Receive ye the holy Ghoſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſins ye remit, they are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto them; and whatſoever ſins
ye retain, they are retained.</hi> By
theſe words ye may clearly ſee, that
Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks unto all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and not to <hi>Peter</hi> only. And
ſo it is evident that St. <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
no more Power than the reſt
of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>I grant that St. <hi>Peter</hi> may be
called the firſt of the Apoſtles in
the way of reckoning; or as it is
commonly ſeen amongſt Men, who
though they be equal, do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47218:42"/>
determine one amongſt
themſelves, to whom, without
being greater than the others,
leave is given to ſpeak firſt. St.
<hi>Matthew 10. 2.</hi> did mean nothing
elſe, when he ſaid, <hi>Now the names
of the twelve Apoſtles are theſe, the
firſt Simon, who is called Peter.</hi> He
doth not diſtinguiſh him from the
others but by the order of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
If he be then the firſt of the
Apoſtles, it is only by the way of
reckoning: For the Scripture
tells us, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 20.</hi> That the
Church is no leſs builded upon the
others than upon him; when ſhe
ſaith that the Faithful are builded
upon the Foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles, and that there
is no other Foundation, nor other
Head-ſtone to prop the Church
but Jeſus Chriſt, on whom the
whole Edification is laid. He is
the chief and principal Foundation,
all the others are only ſubalterne
and dependent. It is then impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47218:42"/>
that St. <hi>Peter</hi> be the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church more than are
the other Apoſtles, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have more Authority. For, as
I have already made it appear, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt ſpake to all his Diſciples
gathered together, when he ſaid,
<hi>Matth. 18. 18. Whatſoever ye ſhall
bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on
Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> He
ſends them all as his Father had
ſent him: He equally makes them
his Ambaſſadors, and gives no more
Power or Authority to one than to
the other.</p>
            <p>Where was <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy
or Authority, when St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal.
2. 11. <hi>withſtood him to the Face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was to be blamed?</hi> And
where was <hi>Peter</hi>'s Pre-eminence,
when in the Council held at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
where the Apoſtles were
preſent, St. <hi>James,</hi> and not St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
did Rule in the Action? And
when there was a diſpute among
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47218:43"/>
the Apoſtles, <hi>which of them ſhould
be accounted the greateſt,</hi> Luke 22.
25. Jeſus Chriſt ſaid unto them,
<hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe
Lordſhip over them, and they that
exerciſe authority upon them are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Benefactors; but ye ſhall not be
ſo; but he that is greateſt among you,
let him be as the younger; and he
that is chief, as he that doth ſerve.</hi>
If the greateſt ought to be as the
younger, and he that is chief as he
that doth ſerve, what Authority
has he over the reſt? Since then
the Pope's Authority over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Biſhops is grounded by the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Authority over the other Apoſtles;
and ſince St. <hi>Peter</hi> has no ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over them, it follows that
the Popes have none over the other
Biſhops.</p>
            <p>This is confirmed by the Popes
themſelves: For <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> aiming to be the
firſt and have the Title of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47218:43"/>
Biſhop, <hi>Gregorius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
withſtood him; and in his <hi>54th.</hi>
Epiſtle to the Empreſs ſpeaks thus
of him. <hi>By this Pride and Vanity,
what is foretold but that the time of
Antichriſt is at hand, and art like
Lucifer, who making no account of
that Happineſs he had in common
with the whole Army of Angels, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
to a ſingularity over all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
ſaying, as it is written in Iſaiah,
I will raiſe my Throne above the ſtars
of Heaven.</hi> And in 28 Epiſtle he
affirms, <hi>That whoſoever takes the
Title of Univerſal Biſhop to himſelf,
he cannot be leſs than Antichriſt.</hi>
And St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ad Evag. ſaith,
<hi>That the Biſhop of</hi> Eugubium, <hi>or any
other the leaſt See, is equal to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of</hi> Rome. For they are all
joyned in the ſame Commiſſion;
they muſt ſerve in the Church, and
be diligent to diſcharge that great
Charge, which their Maſter Jeſus
Chriſt has eaqually laid upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:47218:44"/>
3. I ſay that the Popes have no
Power to Depoſe Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from their Thrones, and are
not above them. For the pulling
down of Princes God has reſerved
to himſelf alone that Power; for it
is he <hi>that putteth down the Mighty
from their Seats, and Exalteth them
of low Degree. By me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the
Kings Reign, and Princes bear Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</hi>
He removes Kings, and
ſetteth up Kings, wherefore, ſince
it is God that has this Authority
proper to himſelf, which way can
the Popes claim it, without Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Power of God, and to
that of Kings, whereunto they
ought to be ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ſay, it is by reaſon of their
Keys, as it appears in the Bull of
Excommunication, which the
Pope</hi> Sixte <hi>the fifth thundered in
the year 1585, againſt</hi> Henry <hi>King
of</hi> Navarre, <hi>and the Prince of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
<hi>wherein he ſaith.</hi> That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
given to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47218:44"/>
by the infinite Power of
God, is above all Powers upon Earth,
that it belongs to that Authority to
cauſe the Laws to be obſerv'd, and
puniſh the Offenders, by pulling them
down from their Seats, how Powerful
ſoever they be.</p>
            <p>This is the Origine and the
Ground of the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all Men, and of Depoſing Kings
and Princes from their Thrones.
But they are deceived; for they
ought to remember, that the
Keys given, were the Keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
by this Authority of the
Keys, he cannot meddle with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial
Kingdoms, to ſhut out thoſe
that are in them. And they ought
alſo to remember, that he has no
more Authority by the Power of
his Keys, or of Binding and Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
than any other Biſhop; for
the Keys were given to all the reſt
of the Apoſtles, as well as to St.
<hi>Peter.</hi> For Chriſt ſpeaks thus <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47218:45"/>
ye the Holy Ghoſt, whoſoever Sins
ye remit, they are remitted unto
them; and whoſoever Sins ye retain,
they are retained.</hi> It is then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that it is contrary to the Will
of Jeſus Chriſt, that any Miniſter
of the Goſpel ſhould claim Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
above another; for they are all
indifferently joyned in one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and conſequently have all
equal Authority. And therefore
the <hi>Pope</hi> has no more Authority
by the Vertue of his Keys than any
other Biſhop, that is to ſay, none
at all to Depoſe Kings and Princes
from their Thrones. His Duty is
rather to obey them, and teach the
ſame Obedience to others, as the
Apoſtles of Chriſt did. For in the
firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>Peter, 2. 13.</hi> It
is Written thus, <hi>Submit your ſelves
to every Ordinance of Men for the
Lord's ſake, whether it be to the King,
as Supreme.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the
<hi>Romans, 3. 1.</hi> ſaith; <hi>Let every Soul
be Subject to the higher Powers.</hi> And
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47218:45"/>
Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſaid, that <hi>his
Kingdom was not of this World.</hi> He
refuſed to be made a King, he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
others to do the ſame. If
then Chriſt were Subject to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
is it not a great ſhame to the <hi>Pope</hi>
to exalt himſelf above <hi>Caeſar,</hi> I mean
above Kings.</p>
            <p>Some Papiſts do Anſwer, that
he got this Sovereign Authority by
Donation from the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine;</hi>
but let it be granted,
that ſome Chriſtian Emperor was
ſo fooliſh, as to give his Empire,
(which is neither likely nor credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
yet I ſay it was not Lawful for
him to take it, if he will be a true
Miniſter of the Goſpel, or lawful
Succeſſor of the Apoſtles. For
Chriſt has expreſly forbidden his
Apoſtles, and in them all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the Goſpel, all ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
when he told them,
<hi>Matth. 20. 26. Ye know that the
Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47218:46"/>
over them, but it ſhall not be
ſo among you.</hi> Which words being
prohibitory ſhew that they muſt
not Reign like Kings of Nations,
but muſt ſerve in the Church, and
be diligent in the great Charge
that Jeſus Chriſt has laid upon
them.</p>
            <p>It is then evident by what I have
ſaid here before, that the Pope has
no Authority over Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and is not above them. This
may be ſeen by theſe Words of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
in <hi>Apolog. We Honour,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>the Emperor as the next Man to
God, and Inferior to god only.</hi> And
in another place, he ſaith, that <hi>the
King i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the ſecond to God, the firſt
next after God, and before and over
all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Optatus <hi>Cont. Parmen. l. 13.
ſaith, that</hi> there is none above the
Emperor but God only, which made
the Emperor. <hi>And St.</hi> Chryſoſtome,
<hi>ad Pop. Anthio. hom. 2. ſaith,</hi> He
has no equal on Earth. <hi>And</hi> Gregory
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47218:46"/>
               <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>himſelf affirms,
that</hi> Power is given to Princes from
Heaven, not only over Souldiers, but
Prieſts alſo. <hi>Which is confirmed
by St.</hi> Peter, <hi>when he ſaith in his
firſt Epiſtle 2. 13.</hi> Submit your ſelves
to every Ordinance, for the Lord's
ſake, whether it be to the King, as
Supream.</p>
            <p>It is then evident, that the Popes
are not Infallible, that they have
no Authority to Depoſe Kings and
Princes from their Thrones, and
that they are not above them.
And therefore that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> does add to the Word of God,
when ſhe holds and teaches ſuch a
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſay, and ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make it appear, that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church diminiſhes from the
Word of God, ſeveral Points of
Faith and Practice. 1. Becauſe ſhe
Prays, Sings, and gives Thanks to
God in the Church in an unknown
Tongue. 2. Becauſe ſhe forbids
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47218:47"/>
the Reading of the Holy Scriptures
to the common People. 3. Becauſe
in the Lord's Supper, ſhe takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Cup from them and from
the Clerks that are not Prieſts.
4. Becauſe ſhe forbids every one to
eat Fleſh in certain Time and Days,
and all Prieſts, Monks and Nuns to
Marry.</p>
            <p>1. I ſay that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
diminiſhes from the Word of God,
when ſhe Prays, Sings, and gives
thanks to God in the Church in a
Tongue unknown to the common
People. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have us to ſpeak in the Church
with a known Tongue, but alſo he
ſhews the Confuſion of them that
ſpeak in an unknown Tongues. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Pipe or Harp,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>1 Cor. 14.
give diſtinction in the ſound, how ſhall
it be known what is Piped or Harped?
If the Trumpet gives an uncertain
ſound, who ſhall prepare himſelf to
the Battle? So likewiſe you, except
ye utter by the Tongue, Words eaſie to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47218:47"/>
be underſtood, how ſhall it be known
what is ſpoken? For ye ſhall ſpeak into
the Air. Therefore if I know not the
meaning of the Voice, I ſhall be unto
him that ſpeaketh a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> and he
that ſpeaketh ſhall be a <hi>Barbarian</hi>
unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, the Church
of</hi> Rome <hi>thereby ſpeaketh concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Sermons, and conſequently
doth not ſpeak againſt her, becauſe
ſhe Preaches in a known Tongue.
I anſwer, that St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Prayers, Pſalms and
Thankſgivings.</hi> If I Pray, <hi>ſaith he,</hi>
in an unknown Tongue, my Spirit
Prayeth, but my Underſtanding is
Unfruitful. What is it then? I will
Pray with the Spirit, and I will Pray
with the Underſtanding alſo; I will
Sing with the Spirit, and I will Sing
with the Underſtanding alſo; elſe
when thou ſhalt bleſs with the Spirit,

            <p>And notwithſtanding this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of them which go againſt it;
as it is declared by the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the Pipe, Harp, and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>Prays, Sings,</hi>
and <hi>gives Thanks</hi> in the Church
in a Tongue unknown to the
common People. And though
in the Primitive Church, all Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were made in the vulgar
Tongue. <hi>Linguâ auditoribus non
ignotâ omnia peragebantur, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudo
ita ferebat, ut tota Eccleſia ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul
pſsalleret.</hi> And though St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
ſays, <hi>Deus vult ut quod Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
intelligamus &amp; humana ratione
non quaſi Avium voce canamus.</hi> God
will have us to underſtand what
we Sing, and not be like Parrots,
which do not underſtand what
they ſay. Yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
doth not obey this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47218:48"/>
but continue ſtill in that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
            <p>The Origine of this Error pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
being exalted in an eminent degree
of Grandeur, could not be contented
until they had ſet up Laws, though
very irregular and unreaſonable;
and as it is uſual amongſt Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
had introduced and impos'd
their own Language upon thoſe
they had ſubdued and made their
Slaves. So they have to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of their Power eſtabliſhed
their Liturgies, Ceremonies and
Language in all Churches, that
they might ſerve afterwards as a
Monument of their Juriſdiction
and Authority upon others.</p>
            <p>2. I ſay that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
doth diminiſh from the Word of
God, when ſhe forbids the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Holy Scriptures to the
common People. For this forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of hers is wholly contrary to
the Commandment of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47218:49"/>
who in the 5th chapter of St. <hi>John</hi>
39 Verſe, ſpeaks thus, <hi>Search the
ſcriptures, for in them ye think ye
have eternal life; and they are they
which teſtifie of me.</hi> And quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this Ordinance of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
who writing both to the Biſhops

Women, either young or old,

<hi>Theſſalonians, 5. 27. I charge you
by the Lord, that this Epiſtle be read
unto all holy Brethren.</hi> And wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the <hi>Coloſſians, 4. 16.</hi> he
ſaith, <hi>When this Epiſtle is read among

Church of the Laodiceans, and that ye
likewiſe read the Epiſtle from Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, as if the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> were wiſer than Jeſus Chriſt,
St. <hi>John,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and all other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
and holy Fathers, who did
ſo much, and ſo often recommend
it, ſhe forbids it to the common
People, ſtifly affirming that it is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47218:49"/>
dangerous, that it cauſes Schiſms,
ſeveral Sects and Hereſies. For in
the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it is written,
that <hi>if the Reading of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be permitted in a known Tongue
amongſt all People, it will be more
hurtful than profitable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The abuſe ſome make of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, ought not generally
to condemn the uſe of it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the beſt things would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from us, becauſe they
are ſometimes miſuſed. The uſe
of Wine would be forbidden; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
many are Drunk with it,
and is the cauſe of ſeveral Diſorders.
It is enough to forbid what is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
bad, without forbidding that
which is eſſentially good. Jeſus
Chriſt doth not only permit the
Reading of the Holy Scripture to
ſome particular <hi>Jews,</hi> but he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
it unto all. <hi>

            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> doth forbid to the common
People ſo good a Book, ſo uſeful
to Piety, and ſo neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Is it not then a great Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
to forbid Children to ſee and

Is it not an exceſs of rigour
to deprive them of that which
nouriſhes their Souls for an Eternal

to hinder them from ſeeing
that, which they are to be judged
upon?</p>
            <p>3. I ſay that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
diminiſhes from the Word of God,
when in the Lord's Supper ſhe
takes away the Cup from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People, and from the Clerks
that are not Prieſts. For we read
in St. <hi>Matthew 26. 27.</hi> that in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47218:51"/>
Inſtitution of this Sacrament, <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt took the Cup, and gave it all
his Diſciples, ſaying, drink ye all
of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection,</hi> When Jeſus Chriſt
ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Drink ye all of

ſaith the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prieſts only ought to drink

            <p>
               <hi>I Anſwer, that St.</hi> Paul <hi>writing
to the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>amongſt whom
were more</hi> Laics <hi>than</hi> Prieſts, <hi>doth
evidently ſhew the contrary; for,
ſpeaking to every one, he ſaith,
1. Cor. 11. 28.</hi> Let a man examine

<hi>And St.</hi> Chryſoſtome,
<hi>Hom. 18. upon the ſecond Epiſtle
of St.</hi> Paul <hi>to the</hi> Corinthians <hi>ſpeaks

               </gap>ſe that preſide over, as when we
receive the holy Myſteries; for we
are all equally admitted to them. It
is not now as it was under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
where the Prieſt did eat par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
things, and the People others;
where it was not lawful to the People
to eat that which the High Prieſt was
then eating. It is not ſo now, for one
and the ſame Body, and one and the
ſame Cup is given to all.</p>
            <p>The Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> in the Year
490. <hi>2. Diſtinct. 2. Can. Comperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
did Decree, that all they
ſhould be Excommunicated, which
would receive the Lord's Supper
but in one kind; and his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
<hi>Leo</hi> did call thoſe Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that did refuſe to take the
Cup.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:47218:52"/>
               <hi>And tho' in the general Council
of</hi> Conſtance, <hi>Seſſ. 13. the</hi> Roman
<hi>Church do confeſs this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was receiv'd in the Primitive
Church with the Bread and the
Cup; yet in the general Council
of</hi> Trent <hi>ſhe ſpeaks thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> If any man
ſay that the Catholick Church had not
juſt Reaſons to give the Communion
to the Laics, and Clerks who did not
ſay Maſs, under the accidents of Bread
only, and that ſhe Erred in this, let
him be Anathema.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons, ſaith the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, why they took the Cup
from them, are many Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
and ſeveral Abſurdities.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, that beſides there is
no Inconveniency, though there
ſhould be any, it ought not to be
above the Commandment of Jeſus
Chriſt and St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Chriſt, the
Primitive Church, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were very Wiſe; and Wiſer
than ſhall ever be the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> and ſince they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47218:52"/>
and given the Sacrament
of the Lord's Supper with the Cup,
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ought to follow
their example and obey them. The
Inconveniencies, which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
at this day, as that the Flies
may fall into the Cup, or that the
Communicant's Beard may touch
the Blood, were in the time of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus 
Chriſt and his Apoſtles: Had
there been any Inconveniency, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſhould
have certainly remedy'd it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſince they have not forbidden
the Cup to the common People,
who did then receive the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ought
not now to forbid it.</p>
            <p>The Origine of taking the Cup
from the common People proceeds
from <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
believed produces <hi>Concomitancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and from this <hi>Concomitancy</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this concluſion, that the <hi>Laics</hi>
ought to be contented with the
conſecrated Bread, becauſe the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47218:53"/>
Blood of Chriſt was therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as well as in the Cup.</p>
            <p>But I have already prov'd, that
there is no Tranſubſtantiation in
the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
And though there were any,
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ought not to
take away the Cup from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
becauſe Jeſus Chriſt, his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and the Primitive Church
did not take it from them; and
becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> orders every one
to take it, when he ſaith, <hi>Let a
man examine himſelf, and ſo let him
eat of that Bread and drink of that
Cup.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I ſay that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
diminiſhes from the Word of God,
when ſhe forbids every one to Eat
Fleſh in certain times and days;
and all Prieſts, Monks and Nuns
to Marry: For St. <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to
the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 2. 16. ſpeaks thus,
<hi>Let no man judge you in meat and
drink.</hi> And in his firſt Epiſtle to
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 10. 24. <hi>&amp;c. what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:47218:53"/>
ſaith he, <hi>is ſold in the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that eat, asking no queſtion for
Conſcience ſake. If any of them,
that believe not, bid you to a Feaſt,
and ye be diſpoſed to go, whatſoever
is ſet before you, eat.</hi> And writing
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That every
creature of God is good, and nothing
to be refuſed, if it be received with

to</hi> Timothy 4. 3. <hi>he tells us, that</hi>
forbidding to marry, and commanding
to abſtain from meats is a doctrine of
Devils. <hi>And Jeſus Chriſt himſelf
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47218:54"/>
honoured ſo much the Marriage
of the Prieſts, that he did chuſe the
Son of the High Prieſt</hi> Zacharias <hi>to
be his Fore-runner. To avoid For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
ſaith St.</hi> Paul, <hi>1 Cor. 7. 2.</hi>
Let every man have his own wife,
and let every woman have her own
husband.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding all theſe
Texts of the holy Scripture, the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church commands, under
the pain of Sin unto Death, and
conſequently of Damnation, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from Fleſh in certain times
and days; and forbids all Biſhops,
Prieſts and Clerks to marry. And
though in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> of
which the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian
ſpeaks thus, <hi>It pleaſed ſome Biſhops
to introduce a new Law in the Church;
that thoſe, who were dedicated to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Miniſtry, namely the Biſhops,
Prieſts, Elders and Deacons, ſhould
lie no more with their Wives. But</hi>

who had one of his Eyes pluckt out for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47218:54"/>
the Confeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, roſe up,
and oppoſed them, ſaying, That they
ought not to impoſe ſo heavy a Yoke;
becauſe Marriage was honourable in
all, and the Bed undefiled; and that
this Prohibition would be hurtful to
the Church, becauſe all men had not
the Gift of Continence; which did ſo
much prevail, that the Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to his opinion,</hi> Hiſt. tripart.
l. 2. c. 14. Yet <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII<hi>th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
with cruel Decrees of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
deprived Miniſters of their
Wives, and forced the Clergy to
the Vow of Continence. And the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Seſſ. 23. Can. 11.
<hi>forbids Marriage to all Clerks that
are in Orders, and to all Regulers or
Monks that have made a ſolemn Vow
of Chaſtity; and thundereth Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
againſt thoſe that ſay they may
marry, notwithſtanding they feel
they have not the Gift of Chaſtity.</hi>
And ſo this Council doth not only
oppoſe the Primitive Church, and
the Apoſtles, but even the Law,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47218:55"/>
which God himſelf has pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
For when he ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt
not commit Adultery,</hi> thou ſhalt not
be a Whoremonger; it is as if he
ſhould ſay, Thou ſhalt make uſe of
Marriage, which is a proper means
to avoid theſe two great Sins. It
is an implicit Commandment of
God made to all Men and Women
that have not the Gift of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
in what ſtate and condition
ſoever they be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection,</hi> The Monks and Nuns
have made a ſolemn Vow of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Chaſttiy; therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
marry.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer that they cannot, and
ought not to make ſuch a Vow.
For every Vow, to be good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the very Principles of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ought to have
two Conditions: It ought to be of
a good thing, and ought to be in
our Power. When the <hi>Jews</hi> made
a Vow, that they would neither
Eat nor Drink, till they had kill'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47218:55"/>
               <hi>Paul;</hi> that Vow was void, and
they were not obliged by it: For,
had it been in their Power, yet
it was of a bad thing. And when
<hi>Jacob</hi> did Vow unto God, if he
could return in peace into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Houſe, the Lord ſhould be
his God, and would offer unto him
the Tenth part of his Goods, <hi>Gen.
28. 20.</hi> That Vow was good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it contained the two requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Conditions for a good Vow. It
was of a good thing, and in his
Power. When Monks and Nuns,
at ſixteen years old, Vow unto
God Almighty to keep a perpetual
Chaſttiy, that Vow doth not bind
them, becauſe it is made of a thing
which is not in their Power: For
Continence is a Gift of God. He
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>h not grant it to every body,
but to whom he pleaſes, <hi>Matth. 19.
11.</hi> Therefore thoſe only, that are
indeed with it, are bound to keep
it. Therefore when he, that has
Vowed a perpetual Chaſtity, finds
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47218:56"/>
by experience, he is often troubl'd
with the Luſts of the Fleſh; and,
though he has ſeveral times called
upon God, they ſtill continue to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him, it is a certain ſign that
God has not granted him the Gift
of Continence; and therefore will
have him to make uſe of Marriage,
which is honourable amongſt all,
and which he has appointed as a
means to keep Mankind, and as a
remedy to pacifie our inordinate
Paſſions. For, when he made
Man, he ſpeaks thus, <hi>It is not good
for a man to be alone, I will give him
a companion,</hi> Gen. 2. 18. <hi>He made
them male and female; and for this
cauſe, he ſaid, that man ſhall forſake
Father and Mother, and cleave to
his wife,</hi> Matth. 19. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith, That, <hi>to avoid fornication e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man ought to have his own wife,
and every woman her own husband,
for it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to marry than burn,</hi>
1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 7. Formerly young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were not admitted to take
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47218:56"/>
the Nun's Vail, till they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years old, as it may be ſeen,
<hi>Can. Sanctimoniales cauſa 20. 9. 1.</hi>
And though St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks thus,
<hi>I will that younger women marry, bear
children, guide the houſe: Let not a
widow be taken in the number under
threeſcore years old; but the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
widows refuſe, for when they
have begun to wax wanton againſt
Chriſt, they will marry,</hi> 1 Tim 5.
Yet thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
laugh now at this Ordinance and
Cuſtome: For they ſhut up young
Maids in Monaſtries, before they
have any true knowledge of God,
of the World, and of Themſelves.
So <hi>Rhea Sylvia Numitor's</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was ſhut up in the Monaſtry
of <hi>Veſta</hi> by her Uncle <hi>Amulius,</hi>
who had expelled <hi>Numitor</hi> for fear
ſhe ſhould marry, and get Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
able to revenge and re-obtain
her Father's Eſtate. They are ſhut
up in Iron Cages, as wild Beaſts,
and mad Folks, for fear they ſhould
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47218:57"/>
commit any diſorder. By this
Priſon, wherein they are ſhut up;
and by this Prohibition of <hi>Gregory,
That all Prieſts and Clerks ought not
to converſe, nor dwell with Women,
nor ſo much as with their Mothers,
Siſters, and Kindred, leſt it ſhould
happen to them, as it happened to the
Son of</hi> David. It is clear that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the one nor the other have the
Gift of Continence; for if they
were endued with it, for what
end all theſe Iron Cages to the
Nuns, and all thoſe ſtrict Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the Prieſts? And if they
have not the Gift of Continence;
St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands them to marry,
and conſequently they are not
bound to keep their Vows. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Prieſts, Monks and Nnus,
are obliged to them but upon
this condition, that God has endued
them with the Gift of Continence.
As he, that made a Vow to be a
great Philoſopher, or famous Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
is not bound to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47218:57"/>
of that Vow but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that God gives him a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Wit and Strength for the
obtaining of theſe two eminent
Qualities. I have the Gift of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
therefore I make a Vow
to keep a perpetual Chaſtity, that
Conſequence is good. But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
unto God a perpetual Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
therefore he ſhall give me the
Gift of Continence, this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is not good. For in the
Contracts we make with Men, our
Promiſe doth not oblige us, but as
it is accepted by him, to whom we
make it. And when a young Man
and Maid at ſixteen years old, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
promiſe unto God a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Chaſtity, who told them
that God did accept their Promiſe?</p>
            <p>Therefore, ſince many Monks,
Nuns, and Prieſts, have neither the
Gift of Continence, nor any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that they ſhall have it all the
Days of their Lives; it is a Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to them to promiſe what is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47218:58"/>
not in their Power. Therefore their
Vow wanting the laſt Condition
to make it good, becomes void;
therefore they may, and ought to
Marry. <hi>For it is better to Marry
than to Burn; and Marriage is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
in all, but the Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Adulterers God will Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Origine of Monaſtical Life,
came from ſeveral Chriſtians, who
in the time of Perſecution retired
into deſert Places. And when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
ceaſed, many of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
there, either becauſe they
were uſed to that Calm, Innocent,
and retired way of Life; or becauſe
they were afraid to fall again into
Perſecution. But this Monaſtical
Life was quite different from that
which is now ſeen at this day. For
then they made no Vow of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Chaſtity; they lived with the
Labour of their Hands, and many
of them were Married.</p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> l. 1. Epiſt. 9.
c. 11. tells us, that the Virgins,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47218:58"/>
who did Conſecrate themſelves
unto God, that they might relieve
the Poor, had the liberty of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Vow of perpetual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity,
when they thought, they
might better ſerve God in the State
of Marriage, than in that of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity.</p>
            <p>Let us then conclude, ſince
thoſe, who contrary to Chriſt's
Doctrine, and the Law of Nature
perſecute, and cauſe Men to die,
merely becauſe they are not of
their Opinion and Religion, are
Cruel and Tyrannous; ſince thoſe
that do Worſhip the Creature for
the Creator, are Idolaters; and
ſince thoſe, that do add to the Word
of God, and diminiſh from it ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Articles both of Faith and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
are Hereticks.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Church, contrary to
Chriſt's Doctrine and the Law of
Nature, Perſecuting and cauſing
Men to Die, merely becauſe they
are not of her Opinion and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47218:59"/>
Worſhiping the Creature for
the Creator; and adding to the
Word of God, and diminiſhing
from it ſeveral Articles of Faith and
Practice, it doth evidently follow,
that ſhe is Tyrannous, Idolatrous
and Heretick.</p>

            <p>IF <hi>Lucifer</hi> with all his proud
and obſtinate Companions;
if <hi>Dives, Judas,</hi> and many
other wicked Men were caſt
into Hell, and did all likewiſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;
it is becauſe they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of their Sins. But there is
this difference between Angels and
Men, that though God, according
to all Divines, did not grant the
grace of Repentance to the former,
yet he did not refuſe it to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
For, ſpeaking concerning
Man, he ſaith, Ezechiel 18. 32.
<hi>I will not the death of a Sinner,
but that he turn and live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Repentance is called by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
a ſecond Plank after Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47218:60"/>
For, when Men have
made Ship-wrack, to lay hold on a
Plank, is their only remedy; ſo,
when in the vaſt Ocean of this
World, they are loſt by Sin, the only
remedy left them, that they may
not eternally periſh, is Repentance.</p>
            <p>If I begin to Preach unto you
this excellent Virtue, ye are not
to wonder at me, for I do nothing
but what St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt,</hi> the Apoſtles, and Holy
Prophets, have done, when they
began to Preach and convert Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
<hi>Repent ye, for the Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand,</hi> ſaid <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> in his Firſt Sermon; and in
the words of my Text he ſpeaks
thus, <hi>except ye repent, ye ſhall all
likewiſe periſh.</hi> By theſe words ye
ſhall ſee the neceſſity and utility of
Repentance; but becauſe it is hard
to Men, firſt I will ſhew you its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.
That Repentance is hard,
will be the firſt part of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
that it is neceſſary, will be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47218:60"/>
the ſecond, and that it is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
will be the third.</p>
            <p>1. Part. I muſt confeſs that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is very hard; the Latin
word <hi>Poenitentia</hi> does evidently
ſhew it, for it means nothing but
pain and grief. Indeed there is
nothing in this World more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to Men than Repentance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we conſider it in reſpect of the
Creator, or in reſpect of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>If we conſider it in reſpect of the
Creator, God muſt, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
our wills, make a change in
our minds and Hearts. He muſt
change the mind and heart of him,
that feeds an Inclination for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
Love muſt take the place
of hatred; meekneſs and clemency
that of bitterneſs and cruelty. God
muſt, without deſtroying the free
will of Man, work ſo in his mind
and heart, as to make him forſake
and renounce the Object, which he
loves beſt, and without which he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47218:61"/>
cannot live. This is harder to God
(if I may ſpeak ſo) than to create
Heaven and Earth. For, when God
would create all the things that
are in this World, he only ſaid, <hi>let
there be ſuch a thing,</hi> and preſently
it was created. But when he will
convert a Sinner, and will have him
to forſake his wickedneſs, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
and oppoſition does he not
find, notwithſtanding the different
means he makes uſe of.</p>
            <p>For Oftentimes God, willing to
induce a Sinner to repent of his ſins,
cheriſhes him as a Nurſe does her
Young ſucking Child, and as a good
Husband his Faithful Wife. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he threatens him, as a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Father threatens his diſobedient
Son; as a good Maſter his unruled
Servant; and as a juſt Judge his
guilty Priſoner. And yet his che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhings
and threatnings do very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
prove vain and unprofitable.
The ſinner remains in his Crimes,
and will not repent of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47218:61"/>
God, according to his ordinary
way in the Converſion of a Sinner,
muſt give him a preventing Grace,
and afterwards an aſſiſting one;
and though theſe two Graces be
ſufficient for a true and ſincere
Converſion, yet to paſs from Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to Act, he muſt needs give him
another Grace, which is called ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.
This is the difficulty of
Repentance conſidered in reſpect of
God our Creator.</p>
            <p>But it is more hard and difficult,
if we conſider it in reſpect of the
Creature. For a Man, who got a
great ſtore of Goods by an Unjuſt
way, is bound to reſtore them
wholly to him they belong to; for,
as ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, Non remittitur
Peccatum, niſi reſtituatur, ablatum.</hi>
A Senſual and Carnal Man, who
wholly devoted himſelf to worldly
Delights and Pleaſures, is obliged
to forſake them for ever. What
Pain, and what Difficulty does he
not find, when he takes reſolution
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47218:62"/>
to leave them? And this Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is the greater, if he be an old
Sinner, and got a bad Cuſtom.
For, <hi>can the Ethiopian change his
Skin,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,
or the Leopard his Spots, then may
ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to
do evil, 13. 23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee that every day by our
own experience, eſpecially if a
Man be accuſtomed either to
Drunkenneſs or Impurity. For
then he will find a great difficulty
to ſubdue and forſake his filthy and
diſhoneſt Paſſion. If Grace invites
him to abandon his Sins, and truly
Repent of them, Nature preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppoſes it ſelf, and gives him a
quite contrary Mind.</p>
            <p>There is a Fight in that Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Nature and Grace. And to
ſpeak otherwiſe, there are two
Men in that Man; the Man of
Grace, and the Man of Sin. The
Man of Grace is willing to forſake
his Sins, and Repent of them, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47218:62"/>
the Man of Sin is unwilling. The
Man of Grace ſpeaks thus, theſe
many Years I have committed
Sins, I muſt now forſake them,
with all the guilty Pleaſures of this
World, and I muſt wholly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
my ſelf unto God. And the
Man of Sin ſaith, what! wilt
thou forſake thoſe Delights, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
Sports and Recreations,
which ſo many Men ſigh after, and
with ſo great a Paſſion, as if their
ſoveraign Happineſs were truly
conſiſting in them? The Man of
Grace ſaith, come, I will Repent;
and the Man of Sin replies, not yet,
not now, ſtay a little longer I pray
thee. To make it ſhort, there is
a wonderful Battel in this poor
Man's Heart and Mind. I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him as upon a Ship in a great
and furious Storm: For as this
Ship by the violence of Waves,
goes ſometimes as high as the
Clouds, and preſently ſeems to go
down into the bottom of the Sea;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47218:63"/>
ſo this Man Aſcends into Heaven
by Grace, and Deſcends into Hell
by Sin. What ſtrange Fight do
we ſee in this poor and miſerable
Creature? What difficulty does
he not find, when he is willing to
forſake his Sins? And when he
delays from day to day, that Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
encreaſes, for two Reaſons.
The firſt is taken from Grace, and
the Second from Sin. The Reaſon
taken from Grace is, that being
neceſſary to forſake Sins, it goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and forſakes the Creature,
that is delaying from day to day.
The other Reaſon taken from Sin,
is becauſe it is compared unto a
young Tree, which grows every
Month ſtronger and ſtronger, and
is hardly pluck'd out, if we let it
grow ſeveral Years. For it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to a Hedge-hog to thruſt out
her Youngs before their Briſtles be
grown ſtrong; but if ſhe ſtays too
long, ſhe ſhall rather die, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
them out of their Hole. Sin is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47218:63"/>
like unto a Hedge-hog; for it is
eaſie to caſt it out of our Hearts,
when it is Young, I mean in its
beginning; but if we ſtay too long,
what difficulty ſhall we not find to
pluck it out of them? Such as the
<hi>Ethiopian</hi> in changing his Skin,
and the Leopard his Spots.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we muſt confeſs, that
Repentance is hard and difficult
to Men, whether conſidered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Creator, or in reſpect
of the Creature. Nevertheleſs it is
neceſſary, unleſs we will all periſh.
And this I am going to ſhew you
in the ſecond part of my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>2. Part. This Man, who was
ſent from God, to bear witneſs of
the Light, that all Men through
him might believe; this Man, I
mean St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, began
his Sermons by this neceſſary Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
And when Jeſus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to Preach, he began with theſe
Words, <hi>Repent ye, for the kingdom
of heaven is at hand.</hi> Theſe two
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47218:64"/>
Examples would be ſufficient to
convince us of the neceſſity of
Repentance. But that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all Doubts from your Minds,
I will prove that we are obliged to
Repent of our Sins, for two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Firſt, becauſe we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
God, who is our Father;
and ſecondly, becauſe if we do not
Repent, we ſhall all be unhappy
for ever.</p>
            <p>That God is our Father, all
Chriſtians do acknowledge this
Truth; for, as often as they ſay
the Lord's Prayer, they confeſs
God to be their Father. Yes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
God is our Father, ſince he
made and Created us: And to
ſpeak properly, he only is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Call no man Father on earth,
for one is your Father, which is in
Heaven,</hi> Matth. 23. 9. He is
more properly our Father, than
thoſe that brought us into the
World; becauſe he not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
with them in the Production
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47218:64"/>
of our Bodies, but alſo becauſe he
alone Created our Souls, and
makes us partakers of his holy
Grace, whereby we become his
Children. If then it be true, that
God is our Father, likewiſe it is
certain we have Sinned againſt him
two different ways; <hi>poſitively,</hi> when
we have done thoſe things, which
we ought not to have done; and
<hi>negatively,</hi> when we have left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
thoſe things which we ought
to have done.</p>
            <p>We have offended him in our
Hearts, in our Underſtandings, by
our Tongues, by our Hands, Feet,
Ears and Eyes. In our Hearts and
Underſtandings we have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, as often as we have
thought and deſired any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his holy Commandments.
With our Tongues we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, as many times as we
took his Name in vain, or ſpake
ill Words, or were Slanderers, or
falſe Witneſſes againſt our Neigh-
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47218:65"/>
Neighbours. With our Hands,
as often as we did ſtrike any body,
or Rob him of his Goods. With
our Feet, when we went into
thoſe places, which we knew to
be to us an occaſion of Sin. With
our Ears, when we took delight
in hearing impure and obſcene
Words. And with our Eyes, as
often as we did read bad Books, and
look upon a Woman to Luſt after
her.</p>
            <p>Seeing then we have ſo many
ways ſinned againſt God, who is
our Father, I think it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
we ſhould Repent. And,
if to Repent is nothing but to weep
for our Sins, and commit them no
more, are we not obliged to it,
ſince we have ſinned againſt him?
<hi>How cruel it is,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, to
offend ſuch a Father, and willingly
commit any thing againſt his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments!</hi>
We did fall into
ſuch a Cruelty, as often as we have
ſinned againſt him. It is then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47218:65"/>
neceſſary we ſhould Repent.
Therefore let us weep for our Sins,
and commit them no more. Let
us begin to day, at this very hour
and moment, and continue all the
days of our Lives. Let us beg him
Forgiveneſs; and kneeling with a
contrite Heart, let us ſay as the
prodigal Child, <hi>Father I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt heaven, and before thee,
and am no more worthy to be called
thy ſon.</hi> Let us imitate, <hi>David,</hi>
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen:</hi>
They have Sinned, but they have
Repented. They bitterly wept
for their Treſpaſſes, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them no more. We have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them in their Sins, let us
follow them alſo in their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
We are obliged to't, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we have offended God, who is
our Father.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon why we are
obliged to Repent, is becauſe if
we do not, we ſhall certainly be
unhappy for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:47218:66"/>
He that is caſt into an eternal Fire,
is Miſerable and Unhappy for ever,
ſeeing he endures there exceeding
immoderate Torments. For he
undergoes two ſorts of Pains, one
Privative, and the other Poſitive.
1. <hi>Privative,</hi> becauſe in that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Priſon he is deprived from the
ſight of God, who is infinitely beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
good, perfect, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
infinitely worthy to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and put out of the Company
of Jeſus Chriſt, of the Angels, and
all bleſſed Souls; thereby loſing all
the Delights, Treaſures and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
which are found in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Poſitive,</hi> Becauſe he that is
in that fiery Priſon, is always full
of Sorrow, Fury, Grief and Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
being detained in a place of
Tears, Sighs, Groanings, gnaſhing
of Teeth, and innumerable other
Torments, which no Tongue can
expreſs. Therefore if he, that is in
an eternal Fire, wherein he is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47218:66"/>
all theſe poſitive and priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
torments, which I have juſt
now deſcribed unto you, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
and miſerable for ever; it is
certain, we ſhall be ſo, unleſs we
repent. For <hi>except ye repent,</hi> ſaith
Jeſus Chriſt in the words of my
Text, <hi>ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may believe Jeſus Chriſt,
<hi>the axe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is laid unto the
root of the Trees; therefore every
Tree, which brings not forth good
fruit, is hewen down, and caſt into
the fire;</hi> yes certainly, except we
repent, we ſhall not eſcape theſe
eternally burning Priſons; we ſhall
undergo all the Torments contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therein; we ſhall be unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and all periſh for ever. For,
ſince God did not forgive his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and did caſt into Hell the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi>
with <hi>Dives, Judas,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
becauſe they would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
their Sins; let us be certain,
if we do not repent, we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47218:67"/>
alike puniſhment; <hi>we muſt
either burn or repent,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
and <hi>except ye repent,</hi> ſaith Jeſus
Chriſt, <hi>ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are we then willing to eſcape
theſe eternally tormenting Flames?
have we a deſire that our Sins
ſhould not be puniſh'd of God?
we muſt needs puniſh them our
ſelves, whilſt we live in this
World. <hi>Wilt thou not have God to
puniſh thy ſins?</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them thy ſelf; for every iniquity
either great or ſmall, is to be puniſht
either by repenting Man, or by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we may be the more
inclined to repent, let us ſee its
utility; this is the third part of
my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>3. Part. Repentance is uſeful.
1. Becauſe it blots out all our Sins.
2. Becauſe thereby we obtain the
Grace of God. And, 3. Becauſe
therein conſiſts the Salvation of all
Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47218:67"/>
Before I make it appear unto you,
that Repentance blots out all our
Sins; ye muſt know, that Sin is
hurtful for three ſpecial Effects. 1.
Becauſe it kills our Souls. <hi>The Soul,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Ezekiel, that ſinneth, it ſhall
die, 18. 4.</hi> But how can Sin kill
our Soul, ſince it is immortal?
The reaſon is, becauſe there is a
double life in our Soul; one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and another ſupernatural.
As for the former life, our Soul
does not loſe it by Sin; but as for
the latter, which is more excellent
than the other; and without
which natural life is nothing but
ſorrow, miſery, trouble and grief,
Sin kills it. <hi>The Soul, that ſinneth,
it ſhall die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Sin is hurtful, becauſe
thereby we loſe infinite Riches
both of Body and Soul; we loſe
ſaith <hi>Laurence Juſtinian</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
concerning St. <hi>John</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt,
the Whiteneſs of Innocency,
the Gown of Immortality, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47218:68"/>
of the Soul, the ſweetneſs and
delight of Contemplation, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Spirit, the Kingdom of
Heaven, the Society of Angels,
and the Love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Sin is hurtful, becauſe
he that Sinneth, from the Child of
God becomes the Child of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
<hi>He that commits Sin,</hi> ſaith
St. <hi>John, is of the Devil, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
ſinneth from the beginning,</hi>
1 John 3. 8.</p>
            <p>If Sin be ſo hurtful, as I have made
it appear, Repentance muſt needs
be very advantageous, ſeeing it
blots out all our Sins. This Truth
is evident by theſe Words, <hi>Repent
ye, and be converted, that your ſins
may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e blotted out,</hi> Acts 3. 9. For
as the Sun expells Darkneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the eſſential Oppoſition
they have one with another; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Repentance expells Sins. It
is like unto that Pool, whereof it is
ſpoken in the Fifth Chapter of
St. <hi>John,</hi> which whoſoever firſt,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47218:68"/>
after the troubling of the Water,
ſtepped in, was made whole of
whatſoever Diſeaſe he had.</p>
            <p>Witneſs <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen.
David</hi> did commit both
Adultery and Murther. He killed
<hi>Uriah</hi> with the Sword, and took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his Wife. He Repented of
his Sins, he begged Pardon unto
God, and ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned againſt
the Lord, 2 Sam. 13. 12.</hi> And
what then? his Sins were blotted
out, the Lord did forgive him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> whoſe Sins
were many, and out of whom
went ſeven Devils, <hi>Luke 1.</hi> She
Repented of her Sins; for when
ſhe knew, that Jeſus ſat at Meat in
the Phariſees Houſe, brought an
Alabaſter Box of Oyntment, and
ſtood at his Feet with Tears, and
did wipe them with the Hairs of
her Head, and kiſſed his Feet and
Anointed them. And what did
happen unto her? She heard
Chriſt ſaying, <hi>thy Sins, which are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47218:69"/>
many, are forgiven.</hi> What happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi>
will certainly befall us, if we do
imitate them in their Repentance.
<hi>Though your Sins be as Scarlet,</hi> ſaith
the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, they ſhall be as
white as Snow; though they be red
like Crimſon, they ſhall be as white
as wool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Repentance is uſeful,
becauſe thereby we obtain the
Grace of God. Indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more advantageous to Man
than God's Grace. For thereby we
are made the Children of God, not
by Nature, but by Adoption.
Thereby we are made <hi>Heirs of God,
and Joint-Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom.
8. 17. And thereby we are made
Partakers of all the Treaſures and
Riches, which are found in the
Kingdom of Heaven. It is then
certain, that by Repentance we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Grace of God. For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to all Divines, it is a Motion
from Sin unto Grace. In a Motion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47218:69"/>
there are two ways, the way,
whence we depart, and that,
which we go to. The way, whence
we depart, and which we forſake,
is Sin; and that which we go to,
and which we obtain, is Grace.
The Publican, whom it is ſpoken
of in St. <hi>Luke 18. 3.</hi> Does verifie
the Truth of my Propoſition. He
comes unjuſt into the Temple, and
ſtanding afar off, would not lift up
ſo much as his Eyes unto Heaven,
but ſmote upon his Breaſt, ſaying
God be merciful unto me a Sinner;
and he obtained Grace, for he went
down to his Houſe juſtified. Is any
one of us a Swearer, or Drunkard,
Slanderer, Proud, or given to any
other Vice? He has loſt the Grace
of God. Is he willing to recover
it? Let him humble himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; let him fall upon his
Knees; let him ſigh, weep, confeſs
his Sins, Repent of them, and like
the Publican, let him ſmite upon
his Breaſt, and ſay, God be merciful
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47218:70"/>
to me a Sinner; and then he will
recover the Grace of God, and go
into his Cabine juſtified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Repentance is uſeful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
therein conſiſts the Salvation
of all Men. Man was loſt twice.
Firſt, by the original Sin, which
is nothing but the Crime of <hi>Adam,</hi>
and called ours, becauſe our Will
was incloſed in his. Secondly, by
perſonal or actual Sin, ſo called,
becauſe it was committed by our
own Will. The Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
according to the common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
was ordered by Jeſus Chriſt
to ſave Mankind from that firſt
Ship-wrack; and Repentance was
Eſtabliſhed by God to ſave them
from the ſecond. Therefore it is
called the ſecond plank after
Ship-wrack, and for that Reaſon
therein conſiſts the Salvation of all
Men.</p>
            <p>Certainly we cannot hope to be
Saved without that moſt excellent
and neceſſary Virtue. If all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47218:70"/>
and Saints in Heaven would
pray for the Salvation of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
Soul, their Prayers would
be vain, and without any good
Effect. And Jeſus Chriſt himſelf,
ſaith <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> cannot make
happy, and ſave an unrepenting
Soul, <hi>ut ſic,</hi> that is, whilſt ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in Sin; for there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
between to be happy
and remain in Sin; between to
be ſaved, and to be unrepenting;
<hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe
periſh.</hi> Therefore by a contrary
conſequence, if ye repent, ye ſhall
be ſaved, and therefore in a true
and ſincere Repentance conſiſts the
Salvation of all Men.</p>
            <p>Dear Friends! have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Souls; be careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them, for they are infinitely
more to be valued than all the
things in the World beſides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are made after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God. For it was God,
that breathed into Man the Breath
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47218:71"/>
of Life, as ye may read in the 2.
Ch. of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Now God being
of the greateſt excellency, the
more any thing is like him, the
more it is to be valued. But it is
certain, that no Creature upon
Earth is at all like God but the Soul
of Man, and therefore nothing
ought to have ſo much of your
care.</p>
            <p>As for your Bodies, ye ought to
imploy them for His Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
for the defence of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
for the maintainance of your
Wives and Children, for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of your Nation, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of your Properties and
Liberties, and eſpecially of your
Religion, which ought to be dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to you than your Lives; ye
ought not to be afraid to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
nor even to be killed, for <hi>it
is appointed to all men once to die,</hi>
and there is nothing more glorious
than to die for theſe aforeſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.
<hi>Horatius, Scevola,</hi> and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47218:71"/>
ſeveral others brave and generous
Men, ſo much renowned in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Hiſtory, did willingly give
their Lives for the Service of their
Princes, and for the preſervation
of their Country.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak only of your Souls, and
of the great care ye are to take of
them, for if ye once loſe them,
they are loſt for ever. If ye had
two Souls, in loſing one, ye could
ſave the other, but ye have but
one, and if ye be ſo unhappy as to
loſe it, this loſs cannot be recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
I grant ye cannot loſe your
Souls in one ſenſe, that is, ſo loſe
them, that they ſhall ceaſe to be;
but ye may loſe them in another,
that is, ye may loſe that happy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
to which they were created,
and plunge them into the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt
miſery. In a word, ye may
loſe them in Hell, whence there is
no fetching them back, and ſo they
are loſt for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:47218:72"/>
Take then care of your Souls, at
leaſt as much as ye do of your
Bodies. For, when your Bodies
are out of Order; as ſoon as ye
are ſick or wounded, preſently ye
call for the Phyſician and Surgeon.
But when your Souls are ſick,
wounded by Sin, and infected
with ſeveral ſpiritual Diſtempers,
ye do not care to cure them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
of your Sins. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
if ye do not repent, ye ſhall
periſh for ever; ye look upon
Death, as if it was very far from
you; and, perhaps, at this very
moment in one of theſe Ships,
that are here at anchor, there is
ſome body dead without repenting
of his Sins; and if ſo, his Soul is
loſt for ever. Think ſeriouſly of
this, and make a good uſe of this
firſt inſtruction I give you to day;
obey the exhortations, threatnings,
and commandments of Jeſus Chriſt
our Lord and Redeemer. Behold,
ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> with what care and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47218:72"/>
diligence an unhappy Lover obeys
his Miſtreſſes Commandments. He
had rather diſoblige every body
than diſpleaſe her. The only thing
he fears, is to hear theſe dreadful
words, <hi>be gone, I will ſee thee no
more.</hi> A naughty Woman ſaith,
<hi>I will ſee thee no more,</hi> if thou
doeſt not what I command thee;
and that frights him ſo much, that
he is forced to obey. And Jeſus
Chriſt, who gave his life for our
Salvation, ſaith unto us, if ye do
not repent of your Sins, ye ſhall
be ſeparated from my face, ye
ſhall eternally periſh, and be caſt
into Hell-fire for ever; and we
will not obey. Are we not afraid
to hear him ſaying? <hi>Be gone, I
will ſee you no more; depart from
me ye curſed into everlaſting fire,
prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
That we may not hear theſe
terrible and dreadful words, let
us obey Jeſus Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47218:73"/>
of our Sins; for <hi>except ye
repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <q>Above all things, my brethren,
ſwear not, neither by heaven,
neither by the earth, neither by
any other oath, but let your
yea, be yea, and your nay, nay;
leſt you fall into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</q>
               <bibl>James 5. 12.</bibl>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IF any Man offends not in Words,
ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> the ſame is a
perfect Man, and able alſo to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the whole Body. Behold, we
put Bridles in the Horſes Mouth,
that they may obey us, and we
turn about their whole Body. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
alſo the Ships, which, though
they be ſo great, and driven of
fierce Winds, yet are they turned
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47218:74"/>
about with a very ſmall Helm,
whether ſoever the Governour liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Even ſo the Tongue is a little
Member, and boaſts great things;
behold how great a matter a little
Fire kindles; and the Tongue is a
Fire, a World of Iniquity, it is an
unruly Evil, full of deadly Poiſon,
therewith we bleſs God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we curſe Men, made after
the Similitude of God; out of the
ſame Mouth proceeds Bleſſing and
Curſing.</p>
            <p>Divine Providence confined us
together, within the narrow Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of a Ship, wherein we have
time enough to edifie one another
by our Tongues. God does daily
preſent us with ſeveral Subjects of
Godly Diſcourſe; for how many
Experiences of extraordinary Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Preſervations have we to
relate one to another, and bleſs the
Lord for? What Heavenly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
is there for our Tongues?
We ſhould call upon one another,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47218:74"/>
and ſay as <hi>David, come hither, and
I will tell you, what God has done for
my Soul, at ſuch a time, and in ſuch
an extremity.</hi> We ſhould call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one another to pay the Vows
our Lips have uttered in our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.
Thus we ſhould provoke
one another, as one lively Bird ſets
the whole Flock a Chearping. But
if a Man ſhould come aboard, and
ask of us, as Chriſt did of theſe two
Diſciples going to Emmaus, <hi>what
manner of Communication is this,
that ye have in your Ship one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother?</hi>
What ſad account would
he have from moſt of us? It may
be he ſhould find one Jeſting, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Swearing, another reviling
Godlineſs, and even the Profeſſors
of it. This is the caſe with moſt of
Seamen, I ſay moſt of Seamen, for
there are ſome, mongſt them, that
live Soberly and Godly, and know
how to rule their Tongues. <hi>Above
all things, my Brethren, Swear not,
neither by Heaven, neither by the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47218:75"/>
Earth, neither by any other Oath,
but let your yea, be yea, and your
nay, nay; leſt ye fall into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
Theſe words will give me
occaſion to ſhew you two things,
which ſhall make the two parts of
my Diſcourſe; that there are two
ſorts of Oaths or Swearing; one
Lawful, whereby God is Glorified,
and which ſometimes we ought to
make uſe of; and another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,
whereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od is highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
and which we ought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void.
The lawful Oath will be the
firſt part of my Diſcourſe; and the
Profane will be the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Firſt Part, An Oath is an Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to God, or an Appeal to him,
as a Witneſs of the Truth of what
we ſay. So that in caſe that which
we Swear, be not True; we, if
not expreſly, at leaſt virtually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
God as a Judge and Avenger.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of Oaths,
one Aſſertory, and the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory;
an <hi>Aſſertory</hi> Oath is, when
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47218:75"/>
we Swear and Certifie, that that
thing which is in queſtion, is ſo as
we ſay, and a <hi>Promiſſory</hi> Oath is,
when we promiſe by Oath ſome
thing that is future; and if our
Promiſe be made directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to God, 'tis called a
Vow; if to a Man, an Oath. This
being ſuppoſed, and very true.</p>
            <p>I ſay with Dr. <hi>Tollotſon,</hi> late
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that an
Oath is not only Lawful, but alſo
is ſometimes neceſſary, as when
Men's Eſtates are concerned, and
no Evidence can be had to decide
and clear the matter, but what is
aſſured by Oath. Then it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to make an end of, and decide
the Controverſie; as it appears by
theſe Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſixth
Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews;
an Oath,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
is an end of Strife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And its Lawfulneſs appears by
ſeveral Texts of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
wherein God, who is Truth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47218:76"/>
it ſelf, and cannot lye, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
might be believed of Men
upon his bare Word, and without
neceſſity of making an Oath; yet
to confirm his Promiſes, is willing
to take it. For <hi>when God made his
promiſes to Abraham, becauſe he
could not ſwear by a greater, he ſwore
by himſelf, God willing more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
to ſhew unto the heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
the immutability of his counſel,
confirmed it by an oath,</hi> Heb. 6. 17.
Therefore if God himſelf Swears,
and takes an Oath, why ſhall it
not be Lawful to Men to take an
Oath in dubious Matters, and of
great Concerns, and when no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
can be had to decide and
clear them.</p>
            <p>Was not <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſpared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Lord's Oath, that was
between them, between <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Jonathan</hi> the Son of <hi>Saul,</hi> as ye may
read, <hi>2 Sam. 21. 17.</hi> Did not the
Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in many caſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
them? Does not <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47218:76"/>
make uſe of them, when he ſpeaks
thus. <hi>I call heaven and earth to
witneſs againſt you this day, that ye
ſhall ſoon utterly periſh from off the
land, whereunto you go over Jordan
to poſſeſs it.</hi> Does not St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſe
them oftentimes? As when he
ſaith, <hi>God is my Witneſs, I call God
for a Record upon my Soul; before
God I lie not;</hi> which Oath St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
who was to teach the Precepts of
Chriſt to others, ſhould not have
uſed, if they had been unlawful,
and forbidden in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt himſelf, as we may
Read in the 26th Chap. of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
did not refuſe it, when the
High Prieſt asked him to anſwer
upon his Oath, whether he was
the Son of God. <hi>I adjure thee,</hi> ſaith
the High Prieſt, <hi>by the living God,
that thou tell us, whether thou be
the Christ the Son of God. And Jeſus
ſaid unto him, thou haſt ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47218:77"/>
Therefore, ſince Jeſus Chriſt
himſelf does Anſwer, when he is
adjured upon Oath; and St. <hi>Paul</hi>
oftentimes called God to witneſs,
for the Confirmation of what he
ſaith; ſeeing <hi>David,</hi> and ſeveral
others in the Old Teſtament, and
God himſelf, who cannot give us
a bad Example, uſed it for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of his Promiſes, it is a
clear and evident Sign, that it is
Lawful; and that we are to explain
theſe Words of St. <hi>Matthew, ſwear
not at all;</hi> as alſo thoſe of my Text,
<hi>above all things my brethren, ſwear
not.</hi> They ought to be interpreted,
not generally, but in a limited
Senſe, as only forbidding Swearing
in common Converſation, and in
our ordinary Commerce and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
as it appears by theſe words
immediately following, <hi>viz. Let
your communication be yea, yea, and
nay, nay; for whatſoever is more
than theſe comes of evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:47218:77"/>
From whence it follows, though
Swearing and Oaths ought to be
avoided in our Converſations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are then ſo many Sins,
yet there is a time, as when the
Matter is doubtful, and of Concern,
and no Evidence can be had to clear
and decide it, when they are not
only Lawful, but alſo very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.
The Corruption of humane
Nature has made Man ſuch a falſe
and fickle Creature, that his ſingle
Teſtimony cannot be ſufficient Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for another, eſpecially in
weighty Caſes; and therefore in
Swearing he calls God for a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Truth of what he ſaith,
and affirms.</p>
            <p>Now this calling, or asking a
Teſtimony from God, makes an
Oath become a part of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and gives him a great deal of
Honour and Glory. For hereby he
that Swears, acknowledges, 1. His
Omniſciency. 2. His infallible
Truth. and 3. His Righteouſneſs.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47218:78"/>
He acknowledges his Omniſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
for by his Appeal to him, he
acknowledges him to be the
ſearcher of Hearts and Reins, and
that he knows the ſecret intents
and meaning of our Spirits. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
alſo his infallible
Truth; for this is manifeſtly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in his Oath, that though he
be a falſe and deceitful Creature,
and his Affirmation cannot obtain
univerſal and full Evidence, yet he
that is greater than he, by whoſe
Name he Swears, cannot deceive.
And laſtly, he acknowledges his
Righteouſneſs; for he that Swears,
does either expreſly or implicitly
put himſelf under the Curſe and
Wrath of God, if he Swears falſly.</p>
            <p>Therefore ye ſee that there is an
Oath, or Swearing, which is not
only Lawful, where the Matter is of
Concern, and cannot be cleared and
decided but by Oath; but alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and conducing to the Glory
of God. But there is an other Oath
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47218:78"/>
Profane, whereby God is highly
offended, and which we ought to
avoid in our converſation; and this
I will ſhew in the ſecond part of
my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>2. Part. Idle words, and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
talk, which are not referred
to the glory of God, are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
in our converſation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are to give an account
of them in the dreadful day of
Judgment, according to theſe
words of St. <hi>Matthew, every idle
word, that Men ſhall ſpeak, they
ſhall give an account thereof in the
day of Judgment.</hi> And though this
common evil be little regarded by
Men, yet it is a Sin of a greater
importance, than we can imagine.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe by idle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
words, we abuſe and
pervert our tongue from that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and uſe, which God
by the Law of Creation had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to. God did not give us
the power of Speech (which is our
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47218:79"/>
excellency above the Beaſts) to
ſerve a vain humour, and talk
fooliſhly; but to extol and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our Creator, and render him
the praiſe for all his admirable
Works, and infinite Mercies eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day beſtowed upon us. This
was the end of God in giving us
a Tongue; and we do commonly
imploy it in diſhonoring him that
made it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by idle and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
words we waſte our precious
time, which is but a little Spot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Eternities, either of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
or miſery. God turns about
theſe glorious Celeſtial Bodies over
our Heads in a conſtant revolution,
to beget time for us; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs
of every minute thereof
reſults from its uſe; and therefore
great things depend upon it, and
no leſs than our eternal Happineſs
or Miſery. What an evil then is
it to us, to waſte it away to no
purpoſe, in our idle and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47218:79"/>
talking? which Sin is the more
dangerous, becauſe few are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of it: Other Sins, as Murder,
Adultery, and Theft, are ſeldom
committed, becauſe they are hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible;
and when they are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
then Conſcience is ſtartled at
the horridneſs of them; few, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they be profligate Wretches,
dare make light of them; but for
the idle and vain words, there are
innumerable Swarms of them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, and few regard them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they have miſchievous
effects upon others; for, an idle
word, or fooliſh Jeſt ſticks long
time in Men's mind, and becomes
an occaſion of Sin to them; for
our fooliſh words may be working
in the minds of our Companions,
when we are laid in the Duſt, or
committed to the deep. And thus,
though we be dead, yet we may
be ſinning in the Perſons of our
Companions. Theſe are the bad
effects of idle, unprofitable and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47218:80"/>
words, and why we ought to
avoid them in our converſation.</p>
            <p>But if idle and fooliſh words
ought to be carefully avoided, we
ought with a greater reaſon to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
vain Swearing, and Profane
Oaths, ſince God is highly offended
thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of
the Lord thy God in vain, for the
Lord will not hold him guiltleſs,
that takes his name in vain.</hi> Theſe
words ſhould be ſufficient to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any Man from Swearing, or
from any Profane Oath, becauſe
God has forbidden it, and declared
him guilty, that takes his Name
in vain. But that I may deter
Men from Swearing, or Profane
Oaths, let them conſider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the Heathens durſt not
uſe the name of their Idols, for
fear the Earth ſhould tremble, and
ſwallow them up alive; ſhall the
Sacred and Dreadful Name of the
True God be Profaned by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47218:80"/>
Tongues, and not afraid that
God will be avenged for their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Abuſes of his Holy Name?
In the old Law, he that took the
Name of God in vain, was Stoned
to Death. If this Law were now
put in Execution, how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
ſhould we ſee Stoned every
day? Or rather how ſhould we
hear Men Swearing for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stoned? for the fear of Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment,
even when it is but ſmall,
if put in Execution, would be able
to reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>2. It is a Sin which God has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
threatened, and puniſhed
with temporal and corporal
Plagues. For, <hi>by reaſon of Oaths,</hi>
ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah 42. 3.
The land mourns, and every one that
dwells therein languiſhes.</hi> That is,
it brings the heavy Judgment of
God upon whole Nations, under
which they ſhall Mourn. And in
<hi>Zachariah</hi> there is a flying Role of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47218:81"/>
Curſes upon them that Swear; <hi>a
flying Role,</hi> to denote the ſwifneſs
of it; <hi>for it flies,</hi> ſaith the ſame
Prophet, <hi>towards the Houſe of the
Swearer, and it ſhall therein remain,
and ſhall conſume it with the Timber
thereof, and the Stones thereof;</hi> that
is, it ſhall bring an utter Ruine and
Deſtruction to his Houſe. Wo to
that wretched Family, into which
this flying Role enters; wo to the
Inhabitants thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>3. Profane Oaths bring ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Plagues upon us; they bring
Hell along with them; and if we
be not afraid to Sin, certainly we
ſhould be afraid to Burn. If the
Love of God can work nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Souls, his Threatnings
ſhould ſtartle and affright us. Let
us conſider thoſe Texts of the Holy
Scripture, and unleſs God has loſt
all his Authority with us, they
ought certainly to make us afraid.</p>
            <p>The firſt, are the Words of my
Text, <hi>Above all things, my brethren,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47218:81"/>
ſwear not, neither by heaven, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the earth, neither by any other
oath, but let your yea, be yea, and your
nay, nay; leſt you fall into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
Conſider this Text ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.
I think it ſhould be like the
Fingers, that came forth and wrote
upon the Wall that dreadful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that changed the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of a King, and made his
Knees ſmite together. <hi>Above all
things,</hi> that is, above all other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
avoid Swearing; <hi>but let your
yea, be yea, and your nay, nay;</hi> that
is, accuſtom your ſelves to ſhort
and plain Affirmations, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations;
<hi>leſt you fall into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi>
that is, leſt for theſe things
the Judge of Heaven and Earth
ſhould paſs a Sentence of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to Hell upon you. O Men!
dare ye then from henceforth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſuch a hainous Sin as Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
ſeeing it will bring you under
God's Judgment and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Did you never ſee a poor
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47218:82"/>
Malefactor Tryed at the Aſſizes,
and obſerve how his Face grows
pale, how his Legs Tremble, and
how Death diſplayes his Colours in
his Cheeks, when Sentence is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon him? But what is that
to God's Condemnation? What
is a Gallows to Hell?</p>
            <p>The other Text is this; <hi>the
Lord will not hold him guiltleſs, that
takes his name in vain.</hi> Now, what
does God mean, when he ſaith, <hi>he
will not hold him guiltleſs?</hi> The
meaning is plain, that is, his Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
and prophane Oaths ſhall be
reckoned to him, and he ſhall be
bound to Anſwer God for them.</p>
            <p>The laſt Reaſon, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
you to avoid Swearing and
prophane Oaths, is, that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of vain and prophane Oaths,
is as plain a diſcovery of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
Soul, as any in the World.
This is a ſure ſign ye are none of
God's Children, nor have any
thing to do with his Heavenly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47218:82"/>
For, by this, the Scripture
diſtinguiſhes the State of Saints and
Sinners. This Fruit of the Tongue
plainly ſhews what the Tree is that
bears it. <hi>The vile Perſon,</hi> ſaith the
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, will ſpeak of villany,
and out of the abundance of the heart
the mouth ſpeaks.</hi> Loquere, ut te vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deam,
<hi>ſpeak, that I may ſee what you
are.</hi> What is in the Heart, is ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Tongue; when the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Grace are in the Hearts,
then good and Holy Words will be
in the Lips. <hi>The Mouth of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi>
ſaith David, <hi>ſpeaks Wiſdom.
By thy words,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>thou ſhalt
be juſtified, and by thy words thou
ſhalt be Condemned.</hi> We uſe to ſay,
ſuch Witneſſes Hanged a Man; the
meaning is, the Evidence they
gave, did Caſt and Condemn him.
If the words do Evidence the State
of the Soul, what a wofull State
theſe Souls muſt needs be in, whoſe
Mouths overflow with Swearing,
profane Words and Curſes? How
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47218:83"/>
many Witneſſes will be brought
in, to caſt them in the great day?</p>
            <p>Wherefore, that ye may not
fall into ſuch a misfortune, avoid
vain Swearing, and Profane Oaths,
whereby God is ſo highly offended;
which he has puniſh'd with both
temporal and ſpiritual Plagues;
which are a plain diſcovery of an
unregenerate Soul; and which
God will bring to condemnation.</p>
            <p>And that ye may leave that bad,
and ugly cuſtom, wherein there is
neither profit nor pleaſure; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that if every idle word that
Men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an
account thereof in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how much more then, for
immodeſt, obſcene, filthy Words,
profane Oaths, and Bloody Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.
Before ye ſpeak, weigh
and ponder your words; beg of
God to guide your Tongues, and
every day ſay with <hi>David, ſet a
watch, O Lord, before my mouth,
and keep thou the door of my lips.</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:47218:83"/>
Labour to get your hearts cleanſed,
and purified; make the tree good,
and then his fruit will be good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
A holy heart will produce
holy words: Conſider alſo that no
Man is the better lookt upon for his
filthy words, and vain, bloody,
profane Oaths; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
loſes his eſteem among all
them, that have any ſenſe or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and even among them, that
are wicked, and great Swearers too.
If there was any puniſhment put
in Execution upon them, that
Swear, and take the Sacred Name
of God in vain; they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
forbear that horrid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Sin. For I obſerved,
when I was in <hi>Holland,</hi> that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was ſo much Mony to
be payed by every one, that did
Swear, I never heard there any
Man taking the Name of God in
vain; though I were ſeveral times
in the Company of above Forty
Men together drinking in Taverns
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47218:84"/>
and Coffee-houſes. And I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
alſo in the Ships, where I have
ſerved; that, when the Captain
ordered the Collar, which is a
piece of wood of about Fifty
Pounds weight, to be worn by the
Sea-men, that were heard Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then no Profane Oath was
ſcarce heard that day. If a ſmall
parcel of Mony to be put in a box,
and given to the Poor in <hi>Holland;</hi>
and if the pain and ſhame of wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Collar in the Ships, be able
to make Men abſtain from Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
why ſhall not the puniſhment
of Hell, and of an eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
threatned to them, that take
God's Name in vain, have ſuch a
Power over them? Certainly they
do not believe ſuch a thing. For if
they were convinced of that Truth,
or that there is an avenging God;
or that their Souls are Immortal;
or that the Holy Scripture was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
revealed of God, and the
Threatnings therein contained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47218:84"/>
Swearers ſhall be put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
in the great and fearful day
of Judgment; without doubt they
would hereafter forbear from
Swearing, and taking God's Name
in vain. And that they may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
of theſe Truths, I intend
to publiſh three other Sermons; the
firſt to God's Exiſtence; the ſecond
of the Immortality of our Souls, and
the third of the certainty of the
holy Scriptures; for the Reaſon,
why Men do continue in their Sins,
is becauſe they are not utterly and
fully convinced of theſe important
and neceſſary Truths. <hi>Above all
things, my Brethren, ſwear not,
neither by Heaven, neither by the
Earth, neither by any other Oath,
but let your yea, be yea, and your
nay, nay; leſt you fall into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>

            <head>Third Sermon against Drunkeneſs.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>Be not drunk with wine, wherein
is exceſs,</q>
               <bibl>Epheſ. 5. 16.</bibl>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE <hi>Sparthans</hi> brought their
Children to loath Wine, by
ſhewing them a Drunkard, whom
they gazed at as a Monſter; and
<hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of the Primitive
Chriſtians, they drank no more
than was ſufficient for temperate
Men: they did ſo eat and drink, as
thoſe that remembred they ought
to pray afterwards. But now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe that profeſs Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
how ordinarily is this Sin
committed, but eſpecially by Sea-men.
Some of them have gone
aboard drunk, and laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of their Voyage in that Sin;
and though they knew not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47218:86"/>
they ſhould ever ſee again the
Land of their Nativity, yet this
was the farewel they took, this
was their preparation; and ſo in
their return, notwithſtanding the
terrible and aſtoniſhing works of
the Lord, which they have beheld
with their eyes; and their marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
preſervations in ſo great and
terrible extremities. Yet aſſoon
as they were aſhore, they went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ale-houſes, there drowning the
ſenſe of God's precious Mercies and
Deliverances in their Drunken
Cups.</p>
            <p>I grant, that there is a lawful
uſe of Wine and ſtrong Drink to
ſupport Nature, not to clog it; to
cure Infirmities, not to cauſe
them; <hi>Drink no longer water, but
uſe a little wine, for thy ſtomachs
ſake, and thine infirmities,</hi> ſaith St.
<hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy 5. 23.</hi>
God allows us Wine, and other
ſtrong Liquor, not only for bare
neceſſity, but for chearfulneſs alſo;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47218:86"/>
that our Bodies may be the more
fit for our Imployments. But to
drink Wine, or other ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
until we be inflamed, and our
reaſon diſturbed, is that which St.
<hi>Paul</hi> forbids us in the words of my
Text, <hi>Be not drunk with wine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is exceſs.</hi> For, ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Iſaiah, 5. 11. Wo to them, that
riſe early in the morning, that they
may follow ſtrong drink, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
until night, till wine inflame
them.</hi> And that I may deter Men
from this horrible and ſo common
a Sin, and keep a method. I will
divide this Diſcourſe into two
parts, in the firſt I will ſhew them
the reaſons, why they ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
that Sin; and in the ſecond I
will anſwer to their objections.</p>
            <p>1. Part. The firſt reaſon, which
ought to make us avoid the exceſs
of Wine, or any other ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
is, becauſe we are thereby
equalized to the Beaſts that periſh;
for the exceſs of Wine takes away
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47218:87"/>
the Wiſdom and Ingenuity of Men,
and ſo brutifies them, as <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
who had the heart of a
Beaſt given him. The heart of a
Man hath generoſity, and brave
vigorous Spirits capable of, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for noble and worthy actions
and imployments; but immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
drinking enervates, quenches,
and drowns this brave noble vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor.
For, no ſooner is a Man
brought under the dominion of
Wine, but he loſes the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Reaſon; and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
like a Beaſt either wallowing
in the mire, or preſently falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep
as a ſot and ſtupid; or ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and quarrelling as one that is
ſtark mad, and has loſt the uſe of
his Reaſon. God put all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in ſubjection to Men, but by
immoderate drinking Men put
themſelves in ſubjection to Wine,
and are brought under its Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Power. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls
the exceſs of Wine <hi>a diſtemper of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47218:87"/>
the head, a ſubverſion of the ſenſes,
a tempeſt in the tongue, a ſtorm of
the body, the Ship-wrack of vertue,
the loſs of time, a wilfull Madneſs,
a pleaſant Devil, a ſugared Poiſon,
a ſweet Sin, which he that has, has
not himſelf; and he, that commits
it, doth not only commit Sin, but he
himſelf is altogether in Sin.</hi> It is a
Sin, which much degrades a Man,
by equalizing him to a Beaſt, and
the vileſt of Beaſts, a Swine, which
wallows in the mire.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon, why Men are
to avoid the exceſs of Wine, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of its ſeveral bad effects. For
Drunkeneſs waſts and ſcatters
Men's Eſtates, and brings them to
Poverty. <hi>The Drunkard ſhall be
cloathed with rags, and brought to
a morſel of bread. He that loves
wine and oyl ſhall not be rich, ſaith
Solomon,</hi> Prov. 21. 17. And in the
23. 21. he tells us, that <hi>the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
and glutton ſhall ſurely come to
Poverty;</hi> for Drunkeneſs doth not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47218:88"/>
only diſpoſſeſs a Man of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which is a rich and fair Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
given to him by God; but
it alſo deprives him of his Eſtate,
and waſts all that either the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
care of his Parents, or the
bleſſing of God upon his own indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
has obtained for him.</p>
            <p>And not to mention here the
miſeries and ſorrows he brings
thereby upon his Family, drinking
the Tears, yea the Blood of his
poor Wife, and helpleſs Children;
I will only take notice of ſeveral
Diſeaſes, which are begotten by
the exceſs in drinking ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.
For, hence come Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies,
Gouts, Palſies, ſudden
Death, Trembling of the Hands
and Legs, and as the Proverb ſaith,
<hi>Plures occidit Gula quàm gladius,</hi>
that is, <hi>Drunkeneſs kills more than
the Sword.</hi> O! what a terrible
thing will it be to conſider upon
a Death-bed, that theſe pangs and
aches are the fruits of our Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47218:88"/>
and exceſs. <hi>Who has wo?</hi>
ſaith <hi>Solomon; who has ſorrow?
who has contention? who has bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?
who has wounds without cauſe?
who has redneſs of eyes? They that
tarry long at wine, they that go to
ſeek mixt wine,</hi> Prov. 23. 29, 30.
By this enumeration and manner
of interrogation the wiſe Man
ſeems to make it a difficult thing
to recount the miſeries and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that Drunkeneſs brings upon
us. For as Vermin abounds, where
there is ſtore of corn; ſo do the
Diſeaſes in the Bodies of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
where crudities and ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
do continually abound.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Drunkeneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Origenes, is the
fore-runner of all vices.</hi> The Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
is commonly quarrelſome, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſlow to any thing that is
good, and prone to all Evil. He
ſpeaks and does whatſoever the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
ſuggeſts to him, be it never ſo
obſcene and ridiculous. And when
he is Drunk, he never conſiders
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47218:89"/>
that the end of his Drunkeneſs is
Confuſion, Quarrel, Riot, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that the pleaſant taſte of
the Liquor will prove in the end,
like the ſting of a Serpent, his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Of all things to be lamented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us this is moſt lamentable,
that of all ſorts of Men there is
none more prone to this Vice than
Sea-men, when they are aſhoar
with their Pockets full of Mony:
Should they be ſo blinded, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can hinder them from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves and their Families
to ruine, for the ſatisfying of their
Appetites. But let them hear what
God ſaith unto them. <hi>Wo be unto
you that are full, for ye ſhall hunger;</hi>
and the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that
ſuch are excluded of the Kingdom
of Heaven. <hi>Drunkeneſs,</hi> ſaith St.
<hi>Gregory, is a flattering Devil, a
ſweet Poiſon, a pleaſant Sin, and
whoſoever is under the raigning Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of this Sin, is wholly in Sin, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47218:89"/>
makes him forget God his Creator.</hi>
The Truth of this is manifeſt in
<hi>Noah,</hi> who never forgat God, till
he was Drunk. This only Sin is
recorded in Holy Writ againſt him,
whereby he gained a perpetual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy.</p>
            <p>But how much more infamous
muſt their condemnation be, who
by their often reiteration of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneſs,
make it not only cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but almoſt natural, and even
boaſt and glory in their Shame. But
let all ſuch know, that Almighty
God ſees their Abominations, and
will ſurely pour upon them the
Cup of his vengeance without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
unleſs they come to him by
unfeigned Repentance. But this
may be a good warning to them
that are guilty of Drunkeneſs, to
beware of over drinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
For, ſuppoſe this Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
fit continue but for a while;
yet in that time, before the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of their reaſon, they may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47218:90"/>
act or ſpeak what they may
repent of. They may kill a Friend,
as ſeveral have done in their Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
and ſo bring themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the laſh of the Law to the loſs
of their Lives and Fortunes, and
perpetual Ignominy both of their
Families and Relations. But if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man think, he may drink much,
and yet keep the perfect uſe of his
Senſes and Reaſon, he may as well
ſuppoſe, that, when he has drunk
Poiſon, he ſhall not be prejudiced
thereby. Ye ſee that Drunkeneſs
does not only waſte and ſcatter our
Eſtate, bringing us to Poverty and
Miſery, but alſo produce ſeveral
other bad Effects.</p>
            <p>The third Reaſon, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
us to avoid Drunkeneſs, is
becauſe it is a leading Sin, which
has a great retinue &amp; attendance of
other Sins waiting on it. It is like
a ſudden Land-flood, which brings
a great deal of dirt with it. So
that, as Faith excels amongſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47218:90"/>
and Virtues, becauſe it enlivens
and gives ſtrength unto them; ſo
is Drunkeneſs amongſt other Sins.
It is not ſo much a particular Sin
againſt a ſingle Commandment of
God, as a general violation of the
whole Law; for it warms and
quickens all our Luſts and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and ſo expoſes us to every
Sin. It gives occaſion, yea is the
real cauſe of many contentions,
and fatal Quarrels and Murthers,
which are the ordinary effects of
drunken Meetings; for, when Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is loſt, and Luſt heated, what
will not drunken Men then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt?
<hi>Numquam ego Ebrium ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum
putabo,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> that
is, <hi>I will never think a Drunkard to
be chaſt.</hi> And <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſpeaking
of a drunken Man, ſaith, Prov.
23. 33. <hi>Thine eyes ſhall behold a
ſtrange Woman, and thine heart ſhall
utter perverſe things.</hi> This Sin is
well called the Devils bridle; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thereby he turns the Sinner
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47218:91"/>
which way he pleaſes. Drunkeneſs
is ſo horrid a Sin, that it deprives
us of the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Be
not deceived,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor.
6. 9, 10. <hi>neither Fornicators, nor
Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,
nor Abuſers of themſelves
with mankind, nor Thieves, nor Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
nor Drunkards, ſhall inherit
the Kingdom of God.</hi> Certainly he
is not aſleep, but dead, who is
not ſtartled at theſe words; how
are Drunken Men able to face ſuch
a Text as this? Think, when
Wine ſparkles in the Glaſs, what
a Cup of Wrath is in the hand
of the Lord for thee. Thou wilt
not now believe this, but the day
will come, when thou ſhalt know
the Price of theſe Brutiſh Pleaſures,
except thou doſt timely forſake
them.</p>
            <p>Time is allowed us by God to
work out our Salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
every minute of it ought to
be moſt thriftily husbanded to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47218:91"/>
that end; but when it is laid out
in immoderate Drinking, then
it tends to the working of our
Eternal Damnation. Beſides, he
that Drinks immoderately, tho'
he eſcape being Drunk himſelf,
is yet guilty of all the Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Sins that any of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
falls under; for, he gives
them encouragement to Drink on
by his example, eſpecially if he
be one of any Authority: But, if
he be one whoſe Company the
reſt are fond of; his Company is
then a certain enſnaring of them;
for, then they will Drink too, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than diſoblige, or loſe him.
There is yet a greater fault that
many of theſe Stronger brain-drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
are guilty of, that is, the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelves purpoſely to make
others Drunk, playing, as it were,
a Prize at it, and counting it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Triumph and Victory to
ſee others fall before them. This
is a moſt horrid Wickedneſs; it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47218:92"/>
is the making our ſelves the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
Factors; endeavouring, as
much as we can, to draw our
poor Brethren into eternal Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by betraying them to ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
a Sin: Therefore it may be
well reckoned as the higheſt ſtep
of this Vice of Drinking, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in it the Sin of miſchieving
others, added to the exceſs in our
ſelves. And though it be lookt
upon in the World, as a matter
of jeſt only, to make others Drunk,
that we may ſport our ſelves with
their ridiculous Behaviour; yet
that Mirth will have a ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
there being a Woe expreſly
threatned to that very Sin; <hi>Wo
unto him,</hi> ſaith St. Paul, <hi>that gives
his Neighbour drink, and maketh
him drunk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now gone through the
ſeveral Motives and Reaſons, which
do oblige us to avoid Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
It is a Sin ſo ſtrangely raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amongſt us, that no Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47218:92"/>
no Age, or ſcarce Sex, is free
from it, to the great diſhonour of
God, reproach of Chriſtianity, and
ruin, not only of our Souls hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but even of all our preſent
advantages, and happineſs in this
Life; there being no Sin, which
betrays each ſingle committer to
more miſchiefs, in his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
his Health, his Credit, and
Eſtate, than this one doth; and
we have reaſon to believe this Sin
is one of thoſe common crying
guilts, which have long laid hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
upon this Nation, and pulled
down thoſe many ſad Judgments
we have groaned under.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let me now intreat
you by all that tenderneſs and love
ye ought to have to the Honour
of God, the Credit of your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, eternal Welfare of
your own Souls, the Proſperity of
the Church and Nation whereof
ye are Members; nay, by that
love, which certainly ye have to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47218:93"/>
your own temporal Intereſt, to
think ſeriouſly on what has been
ſpoken. Ye have heard the reaſons
why Men ought to avoid the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of Wine, and other ſtrong
Liquois; now let us anſwer to
their Objections, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>2. Part, The firſt and moſt own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is that which they call good
Fellowſhip; one Man drinks to
keep another Company at it: But
I would ask ſuch a one, whether,
if that Man were Drinking rank
Poiſon, he would pledge him for
Company; if he ſays he would
not, I muſt tell him, that by the
very ſame, nay far greater reaſon,
he is not to do this; for, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Drinking is that very Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
Perhaps it doth not always
work Death preſently, but the
cuſtom of it does uſually bring
Men to their ends; and therefore,
though the Poiſon work ſlowly,
yet it is ſtill Poiſon. But however
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47218:93"/>
it doth at the preſent work, that
which a wiſe Man would more
abhor than Death, it works Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Frenzy, turns the Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Beaſt, by drawing his Reaſon,
which ſhould difference him from
one.</p>
            <p>The Second is, ſay they, the
chearing of their Spirits, making
them Merry and Jolly; but ſure,
if the Mirth be ſuch, that reaſon
muſt be turn'd out of door, I may
ſay with <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 2. 2. <hi>The
laughter of ſuch fools is madneſs.</hi> For,
they that will be Drunk to put
themſelves in this temper, muſt,
by the ſame reaſon, be glad of a
Frenzy; if they could but be ſure
it would be of the merry Sort. But,
little do theſe merry Drinkers
think, what ſadneſs they are all
this while heaping up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
often in this World, when
by ſome mad Pranks they bring
miſchief upon themſelves; but
however, certainly in the other,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47218:94"/>
where this Mirth will be ſadly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
for.</p>
            <p>A Third Objection of theirs is,
the putting away of Cares; but I
ask what theſe Cares are? Perhaps
they are ſome checks and remorſes
of Conſcience, which muſt be thus
charmed. But it is a groſs miſtake,
if we think to lay them down that
way; we may indeed thus ſtop
them for a while, but they will
one day cry the louder for it. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a Thief or a Murderer knew he
were purſued to be brought to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
would he, to put away the
fear of being hang'd, fall to Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and in the mean time take
no Care for his Eſcape? or would
we not think him deſperately Mad,
if he did? This is the very Caſe
here; our Conſciences tell us of
our Danger, that we muſt e're long
be brought before God's Judgment-Seat;
and is it not Madneſs for us,
inſtead of endeavouring to get our
Pardon, to drink away the thought
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47218:94"/>
of our danger? But ſuppoſe theſe
Cares be ſome Worldly ones, and
ſuch as are fit to be put away;
then for ſhame let us not ſo diſgrace
our Reaſon and Chriſtianity, as to
rid us of them by ſo pitiful and
diſgraceful a way. But beſides,
this will not do the deed neither;
for tho' it may at preſent, whil'ſt
we are in the heighth of our Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
fits, keep us from the ſenſe of
our Cares; yet, when our Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is over, they will return again
with greater violence; and if we
have any Conſcience, bring a new
Care with them, even that which
ariſes from the guilt of ſo foul a
Sin.</p>
            <p>The Fourth is ſaid to be the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
away of time; but this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is, in many, a very falſe plea,
for they often ſpend their time at
the Pots, not only when they have
nothing to do, but even to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of their moſt neceſſary Buſineſs.
However, it is in all a moſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47218:95"/>
excuſe; for there is no Man
but he may find ſome what or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to imploy himſelf in. If he
have little worldly Buſineſs of his
own, he may yet do ſomewhat to
the benefit of others; but howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
there is no Man but has a Soul,
and if he will look carefully to that,
he need not complain for want of
Buſineſs, where there are ſo many
Corruptions to mortifie, ſo many
Inclinations to watch over, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Temptations (whereof this of
Drunkeneſs is not the leaſt) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt;
the Graces of God to improve
and ſtir up, and former neglects of
all theſe to lament. Sure there
can never want ſufficient Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for all theſe require time,
and ſo Men at their Death find;
for thoſe, that have all their Lives
made it their buſineſs to drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Time, would then give
all the World to redeem it. And
certainly, where there is much lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
for worldly Affairs, God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47218:95"/>
to have the more time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in ſpiritual Exerciſes. And
it concerns them to imploy their
time to the benefit of their Souls,
and not to beſtow it to the Ruine
of them; as they do, who ſpend it
in Drinking.</p>
            <p>The laſt Objection, is that of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining.
They ſay it is neceſſary
for them to drink in this one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Trading with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
Bargains being moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
to be ſtruck up in Ale-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Taverns. But is this a worſe
Reaſon than all the others. For the
bottom of it is an aim of Cheating;
for we think, when Men are in
Drink, we ſhall the better be able
to over-reach them; and ſo this
adds the Sin of Defrauding to that
of Drunkenneſs. Now that this is
indeed the Intent, is manifeſt; for, if
only the diſpatch of Bargains were
aimed at, we ſhould chuſe to take
Men with their Wits about them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
therefore the taking them when
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47218:96"/>
ſtrong Liquor has diſtempered their
Reaſon, can be for nothing but to
make Advantage of them. Yet this
often proves a great Folly as well as
Sin; for he that Drinks with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in hope to over-reach him,
does many times prove the weaker
Brained, and becomes Drunk firſt;
and then he gives the other that
opportunity of cheating him, which
he deſigned for the cheating of the
other. Now this end of Drinking,
is ſo far from becoming an Excuſe,
that it is an increaſing of the Sin;
for, if we are not to drink immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
upon any occaſion, much
leſs upon ſo wicked an one as is the
Cheating and Defrauding our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
<hi>See the whole Duty of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now Anſwered to the
chiefeſt Drunkards Objections,
which are ordinarily brought in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
of this Sin. I am yet further to
tell you, that it is not only that
huge degree of Drunkenneſs, which
makes Men able neither to go nor
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47218:96"/>
to ſpeak, which is to be look'd on
as a Sin; but all lower Degrees,
which do at all work upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
whether by dulling it,
and making it leſs fit for any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
or by making it too light
and airy, apt to apiſh and ridiculous
Mirth; or what is worſe, by infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Men to Rage and Fury.
Theſe, or what ever elſe make any
change in the Man, are to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
into this Sin of Drunkenneſs.
I have given you the Reaſons why
ye are to avoid the Exceſs in
Drinking, and anſwered alſo to the
Drunkards Objections. Pray make
a good uſe of this Inſtruction, <hi>be not
drunk with wine, nor with any other
ſtrong liquor, wherein is exceſs.</hi>
