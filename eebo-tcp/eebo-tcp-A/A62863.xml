            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AS you will find the following Scenes drawn from the Stores of that great Master <hi>Ben,</hi> I hope you will think the Contrivance no ill Imitation: That they had no better Success on the Stage, was for this Reason: The principal Part (on which the Diversion depended) was, by Accident, disappointed of Mr. <hi>Nokes's</hi> Performance, for whom it was design'd, and only proper; which caus'd a Retrenchment of whole Scenes in the Action, that are in this Copy inserted. As it here lies

together, if the Plot be not too regular for Farce, and ought not rather to have been call'd Comedy, I dare trust the Reader for the rest. Notwithstanding all the Disadvantages in its Appearance on the Stage, you were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, Sir, to discover some Beauties through the Cloud. However, I am not so much concern'd for a Work of this Nature, as to impose the Protection of it upon you. My Ambition in this Address, is, to owne my good fortune in your Acquaintance, and Advantages from thence, as to Nobler <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of Poetry. I speak not with relation to any Essays of my own, but for improvement of my Skill in the best <hi>Latin</hi> Poets. When <hi>Ben Johnson</hi> was inform'd, that a certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had done him Injury, he cry'd out with Indignation, <hi>I made the Ingrateful Man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> Horace. Obligations of this kind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are unvaluable. I presume (Sir) I could before pretend to a Grammarians, or Commentators knowledge; but this was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding like a <hi>Dutchman:</hi>

            </lg>
            <p>They understood the Words, but you the <hi>Poet.</hi> Your Judgment does not terminate in what is express'd, but takes in the whole Scope of Fancy, and feels the flame of the Poet, while he labour'd with Inspiration. In short (Sir) you make their very Spirit visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and with piercing sight discover those Beauties, which their Art threw off to such distance, that they were not discern'd by Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Eyes. The World must allow me to pay this Acknowledgment: It is what I heard own'd (while a Stranger to you) by a <note n="*" place="margin">E. of Roscommon.</note> first-rate Judge, as well  as Poet; he that was at once the <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Mecaenas</hi> of our Age. know, Sir, you will pardon me, if on menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Noble Person, I stain this Paper with a Tear.</p>

            <p>Of many Obligations that endear his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to me, the Opportunity of your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance was not the least; while I have heard you discant together on your beloved Authours, Time seem'd to me to be revolv'd, and I thought my self in the Court of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus.</hi> I think the Nation is duly grateful for what he has transplanted from their Language, though sparing of those Favours. We like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise know, Sir, that you have not fate down with the bare knowledge of those ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Treasures, without giving some parts of them the <hi>English</hi> Stamp. And to hoard them in Secresy, is injury to your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It was always thought the Perfection of an Honourable person, to be an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht Courtier, Souldier, and Scholar. All which Capacities are (Sir) without Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ascrib'd to You. Nor may we omit, that Justice, Courtesie, and Condescention, which (in relation to Inferiours) compleat

                  <p>HAil, thou fair Haven of Marry'd Men; for my part, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume not to arrive here, but only in Right of my Master, who sent me thus early to put up these necessary Ensigns of his Homage.</p>

                  <p>Not one of them that were Drown'd, for all that I can yet hear: just by the Fisher's Hutt below yonder, there was a Boat over-turn'd, three Men Passengers and a Gentlewoman. You may see 'em all shifted into the Old Fisherman's Wardrobe; but the Woman wisely went to Bed.</p>

                  <p>A very fair Voyage we have made on't, my Masters; if our Throats had not been too full of Claret to take in one drop of Water, we had lodg'd with the Flounders till our Calls had burst: well, 'tis but imagining we are arriv'd at some Outlandish Place, and these the Habits of the Countrey.</p>

                  <p>Why, we have just as much Copper as Gold left, <hi>Frank;</hi> the unmerciful <hi>Thames</hi> has swallow'd All. Our Boat turn'd oft'ner than a Juggler's bag, and rowl'd like any Porpice. Now if my Lady Wife has had as good a Land Passage on't, as we have had by Water.</p>

In fine, there was no remedy but we must part; for I shall be very concise, Mr. Deputy.

                  <p>All Reason in the World for it; and besides, Gentlemen, it is your Interest; for as you came to be Cuckolds by locking your Wives up: for ought I know, you may be Uncuckolded by giving them their freedom.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>WE have shewn an Alderman no Conjurer. (were?</l>
               <l>'Nouns, crys Pit-Bully, Who e'er thought there</l>
               <l>Have Patience, Sirs, next bout we'll shew, if luck hold,</l>
               <l>What's strange indeed,-----an Alderman no Cuckold:</l>
               <l>A Privilege for serious Play too great,</l>
               <l>But Farce has Privilege, Farce, our last Retreat:</l>
               <l>For as kept Misses, when their Keepers tire,</l>
               <l>With some new slight, revive the pall'd desire;</l>
               <l>So Poets banking th' old Roads of the Stage,</l>
               <l>Bring Farce to tickle up th' Enervate Age:</l>
               <l>Poets, and Whores, you equally shou'd dread;</l>
               <l>A-like infections, where their Venom's spread.</l>
               <l>What's Poetry, but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Clap i'th' Head?</l>
               <l>Yet Clapt Gallant sometimes gets Sound agen,</l>
               <l>No Cure for Gonorrhoea of the Pen</l>
               <l>The Parallel holds further, as I guess,</l>
               <l>There's Whores for Need, and Whores for Wantonness;</l>
               <l>So there's Sale Poetry, Poetry of Lord,</l>
               <l>Worth just as much, as his sweet Lordships Word.</l>
               <l>One Word more from the Authour, I must say,</l>
               <l>He once hit Farce, whate'er he has done to day.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:106311:29"/>
He then had Strength, you should have charg'd him then;</l>
               <l>But Criticks are a sort of <hi>Country-men,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Their Valour of the true Militia-Strein;</l>
               <l>Who from the fighting Foe, like Lightning fled,</l>
               <l>But come like <hi>Thunder</hi> back, to Maul the <hi>Dead.</hi>
               </l>
