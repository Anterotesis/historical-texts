            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>IT is no miracle to me, if, after the antiquity of the firſt Ages had been circumvented through the exceſs of their credulous ſincerity, ours (though much refin'd from the ſcurf of ignorance, and forc'd by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſo many difficult experiments, to be more cautious and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident ſhould not be wholly free from the remainders of the ſame miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, in ſo much, that we now find there are ſome very grave men,

Yet can I not but expreſs my diſſatisfaction with the judgment of <hi>Antonius Poſſevinus,</hi> a Divine of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who, having diſcover'd the <hi>Impoſture</hi> of the <hi>Sibylline</hi> books, hath choſen rather to think them <hi>corrupted,</hi> then <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious.</hi> I ſhall therefore in the firſt place, to make a full diſcovery of this forgetfulneſs in him, lay down his cenſure, with ſome obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereupon, and afterwards examine the ground of his Sentiment. <hi>It is apparent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>both from the Fathers and other Eceleſiaſticall Writers,</hi>

                        <hi>that there was not any</hi> Sibyl <hi>before</hi> Moſes, <hi>to the end the world might know, that, if, in the</hi> Oracles <hi>publiſh'd under the name of the</hi> Sibyls, <hi>and compriz'd in</hi> eight Books, <hi>there be any thing relative to what was before the Age of</hi> Moſes, <hi>it is counterfeit and falſe, as having been ſince ſown by</hi> Satan, <hi>out of a deſign, that falſhood, being thruſt in together with truth, might bring into queſtion the truth of other times. Of that kind is that which is attributed to the</hi> Sibyl <hi>of</hi> Moſes, <hi>hinting at, and foretelling the</hi> Deluge, Lib. 1. p. 9. <hi>as alſo what is found written in the ſame</hi> Book, pag. 11. <hi>that the</hi> Sibyl <hi>her ſelf, with her husband, her Father-in-law, Mother-in-law, her brethren-in-law, and others, was t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They will be found alſo to be wanting, as to truth, if the government of the</hi> Greeks <hi>began ſince</hi> Moſes; <hi>for from the departure of</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>to the deſtroying of the Adminiſtration or Commonwealth and Government of the</hi> Jews, <hi>under</hi> Veſpaſian, <hi>are reckoned one thouſand four ſcore and two years. Further, what can be ſaid, as to what we find in the</hi> fifth Book, p. 49. <hi>where the</hi> Sibyl <hi>affirms, that ſhe had ſeen a ſecond conflagration of the Temple of</hi> Veſta? <hi>And that (according to the teſtimony of</hi> Euſebius) <hi>it happened under the Emperour</hi> Commodus, <hi>in the year,</hi> 199. <hi>for in that year the Temple of</hi> Veſta, <hi>and the Palace, and the greateſt part of the City was burnt, whereas the firſt conflagration happened in the</hi> 134.

in the ſame matter of fact, knowes as much, if not more, then the moſt knowing, and that theſe propoſitions are formally contradictory: <hi>the advantage is of the</hi> Jews, and the <hi>advantage is not of the</hi> Jews.

                     <p>From all which I muſt needs inferr, that, it being impoſſible, a perſon ſound in his intellectuals, ſhould at the ſame time, hold both parts of the ſame contradiction, and there being yet a greater impoſſibility, that ſuch as are inſpir'd from God, ſhould be guilty of ſuch a miſcarriage; St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not onely not ſay what is attributed to him in <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,</hi> but could not have ſaid it.

                     <p>But above all, the firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperour, <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was ſo far pre-poſſeſs'd with this opinion, that that great Monarch, (now 1330. years ſince) would needs undertake to maintain it in the face of the <hi>Church,</hi> and grounded his proof thereof on certain conſiderations, which ſo much heightned his piety, and the excellence of his great parts, that (if ever the Imperiall Diadem might have ſerv'd for a mask to diſguiſe <hi>Truth)</hi> we were all oblig'd to entertain <hi>Her,</hi> put into that dreſs by ſo noble a hand: but ſince her dignity never had any dependance on the authority of men, and that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had no other deſign then to make her more glorious, and not to gain any reputation to himſelf, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſenting <hi>Her,</hi> and enſlaving <hi>Her</hi> to falſhood, it will be no preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in us (to the end <hi>ſhe</hi> may appear in <hi>Her</hi> own true light) to take notice of his inadvertencies who hath miſapprehended <hi>Her.</hi>

                     <p>The firſt reaſon is, for that he maintains in generall terms, that there is no <hi>Divination</hi> by inſpiration, ſuch as it is ſuppoſed, was that of the <hi>Sibyls. What authority</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is there in that fury, which you call</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, <note place="margin">De Divin. l. 2. c. 110.</note> 
                        <hi>which is ſuch, as that a perſon diſtracted, ſeeth what a wiſe man ſees not, and that he who is at a loſs of humane abilities, ſhould have acquir'd divine?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, for that he particularly obſerves, that the Author of the Verſes which were kept at <hi>Rome,</hi> under the title of the <hi>Sibylline,</hi> was ſo far from doing what he did, by vertue of any inſpiration, that it was the effect of a jugling and crafty invention, out of a deſign to cheat. <hi>We take notice,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of theſe Verſes of the</hi> Sibyl, <hi>which it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fell from her in a fury, out of which it was thought not long ſince</hi> [that is to ſay, in the year 710] <hi>that the Interpreter</hi> [Cotta] <hi>would tell the Senate things that were not true, according to the common report of men,</hi> to wit, <hi>that if we would be ſafe,</hi> [from the <hi>Parthians] we muſt call him King, who in effect was our King. If this he in the Books, what man, what time does it particularly deſign?</hi> For, <hi>finally, he who hath compoſed theſe things, hath ſo done his work, as that (whatſoever ſhould happen) it might ſeem to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, the determinate obſervation of men and times being taken away. He hath alſo put on a vayl of obſcurity, that the ſame Verſes might ſeem applyable,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 111.</note> 
                        <hi>one while to one thing; another, to another. But that the</hi> Poem <hi>is not the work of a perſon in fury, on the one ſide, the</hi> Poem <hi>it ſelf declares it; for it is rather the effect of Art and diligence, then of tranſportation and extaſie; and on the other, the</hi> Acroſtick, <hi>as they call it, when there may ſome connexion be made of the firſt Letters of the Verſe, as in ſome of</hi> Ennius's Poems; <hi>this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106901:20"/>
is the work rather of an attentive mind then of a diſtracted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in as much as he concludes that that the Poëms, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in <hi>Rome,</hi> to the cuſtody of the <hi>Quindecimviri,</hi> tended rather to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, then the eſtabliſhment of Religion. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Let the</hi> Sibyl <hi>be ſtill ſecret and ſequeſtred from us, that (as it hath been ordered by our</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 112.</note> 
                        <hi>Anceſtors) the books be not read without the permiſſion of the Senate, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing more to the putting off religious worſhips, then ſubmiſſion thereto. Let us treat with the Prieſts, that they would draw any thing out of them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a King, which neither gods nor men will ever hereafter ſuffer in</hi> Rome.</p>
                     <p>This he ſpoke in relation to the deſign of <hi>Cotta</hi> and his <hi>Colleagues,</hi> to have <hi>Caeſar</hi> proclaim'd King, the poor man not in the leaſt imagining that he was himſelf upon the threſhold of his greateſt misfortune, for having through an almoſt fatall inconſiderateneſs, contributed to the tranſlation of the Royall power, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> had been poſſeſs'd of, into the hands as well of a remote deſcendant <hi>[Auguſtus]</hi> of that Prince, as of <hi>Anthony</hi> his moſt inexorable enemy. And thence it may be deduc'd:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That he had not (though <hi>Augur)</hi> read the <hi>Sibylline</hi> books, in as much as he expreſſes himſelf in theſe terms, <hi>If that be in the books;</hi> and with greater reaſon, that he had not been the Interpreter of them, nor inſerted into his Works any pieces thereof.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That though they had been abſolutely at his diſpoſal, yet would he not have taken the trouble upon him, either to tranſcribe ought out of them, or give any interpretation thereof, ſince he did not acknowledge there was any thing Divine in them, but onely artifice, mixt with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture and impiety.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That it is not poſſible he ſhould account the <hi>Sibyl</hi> (whatever ſhe might be) a <hi>Propheteſs,</hi> in as much as he deny'd there either were, or could be any <hi>Prophets;</hi> it being not imaginable in an underſtanding man, and a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> that after he had laid down this univerſall nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Propoſition, <hi>No perſon was ever ſeiz'd by Divine fury,</hi> he would betray ſo much forgetfulneſs, as to maintain the contradictory affirmative, <hi>Some perſon</hi> (to wit, the <hi>Sibyl) hath been ſeiz'd by a Divine fury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That what he obſerves of the <hi>Acroſtick</hi> and the <hi>Poëm</hi> which was full of ambiguity and artifice, ſignifies, that it was (in his judgement) an attempt of ſubtil knavery, and not the effect of any Divine inſpiration.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XII. The ſentiment of <hi>Cicero</hi> concerning the <hi>Acroſtick</hi> attributed to the <hi>Sibyl,</hi> further clear'd up.</head>
                     <p>BUt I proceed further, and ſay, That though it were granted, that <hi>Cicero</hi> could have been perſwaded that the Pieces kept at <hi>Rome</hi> in the cuſtody of the <hi>Quindecimviri,</hi> were Divine, yet would he never have made that judgement, either of the eight Books now extant among us, nor yet of the thirty three Verſes taken by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> out of the eighth.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106901:20"/>
He would not have made it of the whole body of the eight books; for all the <hi>Sibylline Oracles</hi> were (as being not much unlike the Centuries of <hi>Noſtradamus)</hi> little fragments of <hi>Poetry</hi> writ down one after another, but diſtinguiſh'd as well in regard of the form as ſubject, and diſpoſed by way of <hi>Acroſticks.</hi> Whence it is, that <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus,</hi> writing under <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and ſome few years after the death of <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſayes, that <hi>The Verſes attributed to the</hi> Sibyl, <hi>are diſcover'd by the</hi> Acroſticks; And <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf, who had ſpoken of an <hi>Acroſtick</hi> in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhews that the artifice of it was common to all the <hi>Poëms</hi> that went under the name of the <hi>Sibylline. In the</hi> Sibylline <hi>books</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the firſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">C. 12. Aiqui in Sibyllinis ex primo verſu cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſque ſententiae primis literis il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius ſententiae carmen omne praeiexitur.</note> 
                        <hi>verſe of every ſentence, is made the beginning of the contexture of all the</hi> Poëm, <hi>by the firſt Letters of that ſentence; this is the work of a perſon that writes, not of one in a fury; of a man that does things with circumſpection, not of one that is extravagant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that it might be ſaïd of theſe Pieces, that there was in them not a ſimple, but a double artifice, as wherein the firſt verſe was written, as it were, in the frontispeece, and down along ſideways, making the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Poem,</hi> and containing, in order, the firſt letters of every of the following verſes. Of that kind was that forc'd Preface which <hi>Athelme,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sarisbery</hi> writ, about the year, 705. and put at the begining of this <hi>Poem, Of the praiſe of Virgins;</hi> the firſt verſe, which was,
<q>
                           <l>Metrica tyrones nunc promant carmina caſtos,</l>
                        </q>
contains an <hi>Acroſtick</hi> of all the reſt of the work, ſo that as the firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is, <hi>M,</hi> begins the whole body of the Preface; the ſecond <hi>E,</hi> is the firſt Letter of the ſecond verſe; the third, which is <hi>T,</hi> of the third; and ſo of the reſt. And hence it is apparent, that, though the <hi>Acroſtick</hi> of thirty three, or thirty four verſes, copied by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as alſo by St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> had been truly <hi>Sibylline,</hi> the reſt of the eight books, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſuppoſition of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus,</hi> could not be the like; ſince that there is not any Tract of an <hi>Acroſtick</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The ſame thing may be ſaid of the verſes, which <hi>Zoſimus</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> elſewhere. But that thoſe thirty three verſes, whereof the Capitall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters make up the name of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> neither have been, nor could be ſuch as the ancient <hi>Chriſtians</hi> believ'd them, is further apparent from this, that the firſt verſe contains not the <hi>Acroſtick</hi> of all that follows, and does not any way expreſs the artifice: of the <hi>Sibylline</hi> verſes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by <hi>Cicero.</hi> Whence it muſt neceſſarily follow;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that the perſon, who was the Author, as well of this part of the eighth book, as of all the reſt of both that and the other books, which many upon ſuch triviall grounds, would have us entertain for <hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> had onely heard ſo much of the <hi>Acroſtick</hi> mention'd by <hi>Cicero,</hi> as that he never underſtood it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that it may with much more reaſon be believ'd, that he never had any ſight or knowledge of the <hi>Sibylline</hi> books celebrated by the ancient <hi>Heathens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and thoſe Fathers who were later then <hi>Juſtine Martyr,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Optatus,</hi> dazled with the falſe luſtre <note place="margin">Tertul. de Bapt. c. 1.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106901:21"/>
to find ſomething of myſtery in it, and ſtriving to go beyond the <hi>Acroſtick,</hi> which they ſo much, though without any juſt cauſe, admir'd) they ſhuffled together the capitall Letters of theſe five <hi>Greek</hi> words, <gap reason="foreign">

Nor do I make this remark out of any deſign to caſt a blemiſh on thoſe holy perſons, who made their advantage of it (for who is not ſubject to be ſurpized?) but out of compaſſion, to ſee their plain dealing, and want of caution, ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily play'd upon, and their piety ſo inſolently abuſed by a ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who (without any ſhame or conſcience) have preſum'd to lodge their own fantaſticall imaginations in the moſt honourable places of Gods Sanctuary, one while as <hi>Propheticall Oracles,</hi> pronounc'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Deluge; another, as <hi>Apoſtolicall Predications,</hi> added ſome 2400. years after, to confirm and raiſe them into greater ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>

                     <p>According therefore to his firſt miſ-repreſentation, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that <hi>Virgil</hi> had, by the <hi>multitude of new men,</hi> meant the <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi> But it is clear, that his imagination ran onely upon that race, which he ſuppoſed was (under the Conſulſhip of <hi>Pollio)</hi> to begin the <hi>Golden-Age,</hi> after the expiration of that of <hi>Iron.</hi> From thence the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour comes to make this Remark, <hi>What can there be more manifeſt?</hi> for he adds, <hi>The Oracle of the</hi> Cumaean <hi>Prophecy is come to its period,</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifying the <hi>Cumaean Sibyl.</hi> And I acknowledge, that <hi>Virgil</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the coming of the <hi>laſt Age</hi> of the <hi>Cumaean</hi> Prophecy) reflected on that of the <hi>Cumaean Sibyl:</hi> but I affirm withall;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That to alledge any ſuch thing, is manifeſt to ſhoot wide from the Mark, and not to ſay any thing pertinent to the Diſcourſe, which had preceeded, that is to ſay, that <hi>Cicero</hi> had copied out, and tranſlated the <hi>Acroſtick</hi> attributed to the <hi>Erythraean Sibyl.

                     <p>Secondly, I ſay, that (this ſuppoſition being allow'd) it would not follow from the words of <hi>Virgil,</hi> that he had, or could have read the <hi>Sibylline</hi> Prophecy, ſince he was neither <hi>Patrician,</hi> nor <hi>Quindecem-vir</hi> (to whoſe Colledge that priviledge was reſerv'd) nay, indeed, not of a competent age to be entertain'd into that Society, which conſiſted one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of antient men; and not of young men, ſuch as <hi>Virgil</hi> then was, as being about the thirtieth year of his Age.</p>

Thirdly, That, though he had been one of the <hi>Quindecem-viri,</hi> yet can it not be granted, he could have any knowledg of thoſe <hi>Cumaean Oracles,</hi> which had been brought to <hi>Tarquin;</hi> for they were deſtroyed fourty three years before, in the time of <hi>Sylla:</hi> &amp; thoſe, which <hi>Rome</hi> was poſſeſſed of in the time of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> were (according to the obſervation of <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus)</hi> certain <hi>Collections,</hi> gotten out of a thouſand ſeveral places, and went under the name of the <hi>Cumaean,</hi> improperly onely, in as much as they were dispoſed into the place of the real <hi>Cumaean</hi> ones.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That, though it were granted, that the true <hi>Cumaean</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings (which had nothing common with thoſe reputed ſuch at this day) had been preſerv'd entire, and that <hi>Virgil</hi> had been of the number of thoſe, to whom the reading thereof was allow'd: yet had he (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what is ſuppos'd) diſcover'd therein any thing of Prediction concerning the Saviour of the World, he would not (as he hath done). wholly have adapted the Sence of the Oracle to <hi>Pollio</hi> and his Son, and principally to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> not onely in that place, but alſo above ſixteen years after, in the ſixth Book of the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> where he introduces <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes,</hi> ſaying to his Son <hi>Aeneas,</hi> of the Prince <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperour, proſecuting his deſign, ſaies, Virgil <hi>is not ſatisfied with this, but preſſing farther, there being a neceſſity of his Teſtimony, what hath he more to ſay?</hi>

Firſt, That there is a great diſtance between the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Latine,</hi> which (as it were particularly, to point at the great Revolution of the <hi>Platonick-</hi>Year, and the Reſtauration of the <hi>Saturnian</hi> Age, and to diſcard all other ſpeculations) ſpoke thus much,

                     <p>Secondly, That, though the perpetual Virginity of the Bleſſed <hi>Mother</hi> of our Lord and Saviour, and the <hi>Conception</hi> of that great <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by the Holy Spirit,</hi> and his happy return at the laſt Judgment, ought to be acknowledg'd by all the World: yet doth it not thence follow; that <hi>Virgil</hi> had any knowledg thereof, and much leſs, that he ſpoke ought of it. Beſides, that in rigour it cannot be ſaid of the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin-Mother;</hi> that ſhe <hi>return'd</hi> into the World, when ſhe Conceiv'd our <hi>Saviour:</hi> ſo as that, having been before upon Earth, ſhe had been abſent from it; to the end, ſhe might <hi>return</hi> thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>in the fulneſs of time;</hi> or haply, that, having been brought forth <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> once before, ſhe was ſnatch'd out of it, and then <hi>return'd</hi> again into the World by a ſecond Production: and conſequently, That, which way ſoever it be taken, this Imagination will ſtill have a ſavour of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniſm,</hi> if not ſome thing worſe.</p>
                     <p>To conclude therefore: ſince it is impoſſible, without great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, to adapt to the ſacred <hi>Virgin</hi> this Diſcourſe of <hi>Virgil;</hi> who neither did, nor could have thought of her: there will ariſe a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe Obſervations, which we have made of theſe Principal Miſtakes of the plain-dealing Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> were enough, to take off the Credit of what other Conjectures he may have made upon the <hi>Poem</hi> of <hi>Virgil:</hi> yet, to make his Miſapprehenſions the more apparent, I ſhall not think much to add theſe further Remarks.</p>
                     <p>He ſays, in the firſt place, <q>"That the <hi>Poet</hi> had written; That <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>

ſome other account.

<q>
                           <l>Every where <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Roſes grow,</l>
                           <l>—And the unpruned Thorn</l>

                        </q>
then when he ſaid, in the Third,

                        </q>
For no body needs be told, that the fertility of <hi>Briers</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> in bearing <hi>Roſes</hi> and <hi>Grapes</hi> is much alike, and that there were no leſs Miracle in one then in the other.</p>
                     <p>As to what <hi>Conſtantine</hi> adds, That the <hi>Poet, having exclaim'd againſt the War, and Towers,</hi> or <hi>Fortreſſes, hath deſcrib'd the Saviour engaging in the War of</hi> Troy, and that, in his <hi>Eclogue,</hi> Troy ſignifies <hi>the world;</hi> I cannot but ſo much the more pity, the more apparent it is, that he conſidered not the whole diſcourſe, on which his ſpeculation is grounded. For firſt, <hi>Virgil</hi> does not exclaim onely at <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Fortifications</hi> of places, but alſo at <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Agriculture,</hi> things moſt innocent, not to ſay neceſſary, if not to the being, at leaſt to the convenience of mens being in the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 He ſpeaks not of the <hi>War of Troy,</hi> otherwiſe then by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as he had propoſed in matter of <hi>Navigation,</hi> the expedition of the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> and alledged thoſe two facts, as two illuſtrious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that great Revolution, which he ſuppoſed muſt have followed that of the <hi>Platonical</hi> year, and began under the Monarchy of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 If by <hi>War of Troy</hi> he had meant the conqueſt of the World by our Saviour, he would certainly have excepted it out of the number of thoſe <hi>(wars)</hi> which, in his judgement, deſerved to be exclaimed at: and if he was unwilling (which he could not have denyed without crime) to celebrate it with its due praiſes, he would not have preſumed to accuſe, and put it into the rank of things condemnable. But having deteſted all <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Wars</hi> abſolutely, he (to confine himſelf to ſome known fact) alledges the voyage of <hi>Tiphys</hi> and the <hi>Argonauts</hi> to <hi>Colchos,</hi> and the going of <hi>Achilles</hi> to the <hi>Trojan wars:</hi> who yet was not General in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Expedition, but went under the command of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and did not conquer <hi>Troy,</hi> but died before the taking of it. Whence it is manifeſt, he could not be any way taken for a Type of our Saviour, who was not under the charge of any other Chief, but hath onely been known by the Title of <note n="a" place="margin">Joſh. 5. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Captain of the hoſt of the Lord;</hi> nor ever made uſe of any Army for the Conqueſt of the world, but hath effected it <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 1. 3. Luke 19. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>by himſelf;</hi> nor <note n="c" place="margin">Jo. 3. 17. 12. 47.</note> 
                        <hi>came into the world to judge and deſtroy the world</hi> (as <hi>Achilles</hi> went to <hi>Troy</hi> to lay it deſolate, but <hi>to ſave it, and to</hi>

                        <hi>reconcile it to God by his blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So <hi>Virgil</hi> ſays, that the equipping of Fleets for Sea, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Wars would be <hi>diſcoveries of the ancient fraud;</hi> that <hi>another</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:106901:25"/>
Tiphys <hi>ſhould undertake the Conduct of another</hi> Argo; and, that <hi>the great</hi> Achilles <hi>ſhould be once more ſent to</hi> Troy; to ſhew, that he was far from approving any thing of War: and particularly, that he accounted not the Deſigns of <hi>Tiphys</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> among the commendable; but among the criminal Enterpriſes of the <hi>Iron-Age</hi> of old. So that thoſe, who think, that (under the Coverture of theſe borrowed Names) his Deſign was to ſpeak of the ſpiritual War between the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World and the <hi>Devil,</hi> imagining by that means to make him a <hi>Prophet</hi> of his Victory, make him a <hi>Blaſphemer</hi> of his Majeſty; from which he muſt notoriouſly derogate, by making a parallel between the glory of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Combat, and the <hi>remainders of the antient Fraud.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He had repreſented the Felicity of <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Reign ſo great; that <hi>all parts of the Earth ſhould bear all kinds of Fruits,</hi> and that there would be no farther uſe of Cultivation. Upon which <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> (who ſhould have remembred, that this Fiction was onely a <hi>Paſtoral Hyperbole,</hi> grounded on the antient <hi>Mythologie</hi> of the <hi>Saturnian-Age,</hi> wreſting thoſe Words to his own advantage, asked, <hi>Whether any one, in his Wits, could imagine this of the Race of men, and of a childe born of a man; What reaſon there was that the Earth ſhould be without ſowing and labouring, and the Vine ſhould not feel the Pruning-hook, and be exempted from other huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry; How it could be conceived, that that was ſaid of humane Race, that Nature, who is ſubſervient to the Ordinance of God, ſhould be the Executreſs of the command of man:</hi> inferring from all this, that the <hi>joy of the Elements,</hi> deſcribed by the <hi>Poet,</hi> ſignified <hi>the deſcent of a God, not the conception of ſome man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, that <hi>Nature</hi> indeed does not properly ow Obedience to any word, but that of its Authour; that in effect the Earth, ſince the Fall of man, never was, nor ever will be, without need of Cultivation; and that no body either could, or can imagine, that it hath, or ought to be in that condition, without renouncing his Reaſon. But I think it withall as true, that it is no leſs an Errour to deny; that the <hi>Heathens</hi> were guilty of ſuch an Imagination, as believing, and peremptorily writing, that to the firſt Race of men, under the <hi>Golden-Age,</hi> all things happened accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Wiſhes, without any trouble, and that the ſame Happineſs would infallibly return: and it having been the particular Suppoſition of <hi>Virgil;</hi> that it would happen, not onely under <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> but for his ſake, it were a ſtrange courſe, to cure the extravagance of his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was in effect abſurd and groundleſs, to bring it into queſtion (contrary to the plain matter of Fact) whether he ever had any ſuch, and thereupon convert his Diſcourſe into <hi>Allegories,</hi> which he never dream'd of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Virgil,</hi> concluding his <hi>Poem,</hi> had ſaid, ſpeaking to <hi>Pollio</hi>'s little Son,</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>Which words, as they had a formal relation to the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> (together with <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity)</hi> are the two principal Deities, which preſide at the Birth of men: ſo they ſhew'd,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106901:26"/>
that <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Wife, who had been very much indiſpoſed during her Pregnancy, ſhould, after her Delivery, make her ſelf known to her childe by her joy; that that Joy was, as it were, the Earneſt of the child's Bleſſing; as it were a ſignification of Misfortune to him, if his Parents were not joyfull at his Birth.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Emperour,</hi> transforming the Diſcourſe of <hi>Virgil</hi> according to his own way, makes him ſay, <hi>Begin, laughing, and lifting up thy ſight, to know thy Mother, who ſhould be dear to thee: for ſhe hath carried thee in her womb many years: thy Parents have not ſmiled on thee at all, thou haſt not been put in a Couch, nor had ſplendid Banquet.</hi> Whereupon he adds, by way of Comment upon it, <hi>How have not the Parents ſmiled on this childe? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was becauſe he, who begot him, is a certain Power, that hath no Qualities; nor can be figured by the delineation of other things; nor hath a humane body. Now, who knows not, that, being a holy Spirit, it can have no experience of Coiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? And what inclination, and deſire, can be imagined in the diſpoſition of that good, with a greedineſs whereof all things are inflamed? Or what compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is there between Wiſdom and Pleaſure? But let theſe things be ſaid onely by thoſe, who introduce, I know not what, humane generation of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour not to cleanſe their minds of every bad Word, and Work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What a ſmall matter needs there to divert men from the Truth; ſince the pure Imagination of a Myſtery, where there is not any, is able to do it. Certain it is, that, as <hi>God the Father</hi> hath neither Qualities, nor Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, nor Body, nor Paſſions, nor Deſires; ſo the eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Word</hi> hath nothing common with that of men. But nothing of all this coming to the knowledg of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and his words neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, nor capable of expreſſing it; (ſince the <hi>Greek,</hi> properly ſpeaking, is a corruption of the <hi>Latine,)</hi> which tended to no other end, then to promiſe Happineſs to <hi>Pollio</hi>'s young Son: to what purpoſe have ſome thought to <hi>Philoſophize,</hi> as they have done? For there had been no occaſion given, had they not altered the Senſe, by ſuppoſing (as many have done) that <hi>Pollio</hi>'s little childe had <hi>laughed</hi> aſſoon as he was born; and that, upon that extraordinary Laughter, the whole Prediction of his Happineſs had been grounded; and imagining, that <hi>Virgil</hi> had ſaid of the child's Laughter what he meant of the Mother's; as alſo that ſhe had <hi>born him ſeveral years;</hi> and that, he was not deſcended of Parents, ſubject to, either any inclination to Laughter, or the natural neceſsity of Sleep and Reſt. For ſhould that Great man have returned to Earth again, he might with reaſon have ſaid to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> what St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid ſince to <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Pelagian; Reſtore me my Words, and thy dreaming Imaginations will vaniſh.</hi>

                     <p>THe ſame thing may alſo be ſaid of the ſame <hi>Emperour</hi>'s ſuppoſing; that the <hi>Poet</hi> ſpake <hi>Figuratively,</hi> and <hi>diſguiſed the Truth, out of a fear, that any of the Potentates of the Royal City ſhould charge him with writing againſt the Laws of his Country, and dcrogating from what had ſometime been the ſentiment of his Anceſtours concerning the Gods;</hi> and, that he wiſhed the prolongation of his own life, <hi>to ſee the coming</hi> of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> For, as it happened (about three hundred years ſince) that the Poet <hi>Dante,</hi> mov'd by an Admiration of that incomparable Wit, would needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him out of his Hell; in like manner, the good opinion <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had conceived of him, hath made him read in his <hi>Poem,</hi> what indeed is not in it, out of ſuch an Imagination, as thoſe have, who, looking up to the Clouds, think they ſee ſuch and ſuch Figures therein. And thence comes it, that he hath ſpoken ſo much to his advantage; though without any ground, either in Truth it ſelf, or indeed, in the very outward Dreſs of his Work, which was not done according to the certain Pattern of any antient Oracle of the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> nor yet to the eight Books now extant among us, and which were writ above one hundred fourſcore and ſix years after the <hi>Conſulſhip</hi> of <hi>Pollio;</hi> but was deſign'd, onely to expreſs the deſire, which <hi>Virgil</hi> had to comply with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Pollio,</hi> and to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate more and more into their Favour.

                     <p>This, I ſay, is a manifeſt Miſtake. For</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is no hard matter to imagine, that the <hi>Impoſtour,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Eight Books of the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> and had impudently taken upon him the name of <hi>Wife to</hi> Noah'<hi>s Son,</hi> two hundred years after the Death of <hi>Varro;</hi> who died, according to <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in the ſeven hundred twenty and ſixth year of <hi>Rome,</hi>

                        </note> might at his eaſe, and long enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have read what he had alledged out of <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> who was more antient, whether in his <hi>Latine,</hi> or in the <hi>Greek</hi> Text of <hi>Apollodorus;</hi> and that he could do no leſs, for his own Reputation, then produce, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Argument of his pretended Antiquity, what he had found in him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, For that <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> who atteſts of the <hi>Erythraean Sibyl;</hi> that ſhe was <hi>born in his City,</hi> and acknowledged a <hi>Native</hi> thereof, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by common Report, or upon the Credit of her Writings, could not have ſaid any ſuch thing of our Counterfeit <hi>Sibyl;</hi> who ſays ſhe <hi>came from Babylon,</hi> and was <hi>Noah's Daughter-in-law,</hi> and formally denyes, that ſhe was by Country an <hi>Erythraean,</hi> and charges the <hi>Greeks</hi> with Impoſture, for preſuming to derive her thence. A manifeſt Argument; that <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodorus</hi> could not ground his pretenſion on her contradictory Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: but that the Counterfeit <hi>Sibyl,</hi> having ſeen (as being later by many Ages) what he had written, took occaſion to oppoſe it, as incompatible with his Fiction.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, For that ſhe quarrels with the <hi>Greeks;</hi> for having ſaid, of her, things, which not any one in particular could be convinced to have affirmed: to wit, That ſhe was the <hi>Daughter of</hi> Circe, <hi>and, by Father, of</hi> Gnoſtus; for all thoſe among the Antients, who have left any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, have made the <hi>Erythraean Sibyl,</hi> the <hi>Daughter of</hi> Jupiter, or <hi>of</hi> Apollo <hi>and</hi> Lamia, or <hi>of</hi> Ariſtocrates <hi>and</hi> Hydole, or <hi>of</hi> Crinagoras, or, in fine, <hi>of the Shepherd</hi> Theodorus <hi>and the Nymph</hi> Idea; and not any one, <hi>of Circe:</hi> beſides, that indeed they could not have done it without Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. For, how could it have come into their minds, to make her born at <hi>Erythrae,</hi> a City of <hi>Aſia;</hi> if they had thought her the Daughter of <hi>Circe,</hi> by Nation an <hi>Italian,</hi> born, and dwelling near <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the Mount called, to this day, by her name, <hi>Monte Circello?</hi>

I paſs by (as of leſs Conſequence) the Stupidity of that pretended <hi>Propheteſs,</hi> who (to put a ſlur on the reputation of <hi>Homer)</hi> betrayed her own Ignorance; ſaying, <hi>That</hi> Homer <hi>ſhould write not truly, but clearly, of</hi> Ilium; <hi>becauſe he ſhould ſee her Works.</hi> For, who will ſay, they are things incompatible, <hi>To ſay the Truth,</hi> and, <hi>To ſpeak clearly?</hi> Are they, who ſpeak Truth, neceſſarily obliged to conceal themſelves; and <hi>Liers,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves?

                        <hi>Origen</hi>'s Anſwer gives no great ſatisfaction. <hi>He affirms,</hi> (ſays he of <hi>Celſus) that we have thruſt in, among the Writings of the</hi> Sibyl, <hi>many things, and ſuch, as are reproachfull; and does ſhew, neither what we have thruſt in (which he might have done, if he could have ſhew'd Copies, more antient, and uncorrupt; and ſuch, as had not what he conceives to have been foiſted in) nor yet that thoſe things are injurious, and reproachfull.</hi> For it was not <hi>Celſus</hi>'s intention, to acknowledg, that the eight Books, out of which the <hi>Fathers</hi> had made Extracts, were legitimate; and to quarrel onely at the inſertion of ſome things, that were falſe: but to reproach the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they had ſhuffled together (as much as lay in their power) thoſe eight Books, <hi>Pieces</hi> notoriouſly <hi>ſpurious,</hi> among the Writings of the <hi>Sibyl,</hi> which were pretended to be <hi>legitimate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Origen</hi>'s Reply, that, to prove the <hi>ſpuriouſneſs</hi> of the things produced by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> it was neceſſary, <hi>to ſhew Copies that were more antient, more correct, and ſuch, as wherein thoſe things were not,</hi> was no way to the purpoſe.

                        </gap>y, To require a <hi>Pagan</hi> to produce <hi>antient Copies</hi> of the true <hi>Sibylline</hi> Writings, was to make a ridiculous, and uncivil requeſt to him: ſince, <hi>firſt,</hi> There could not have been, through the whole <hi>Romane</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, beſides the <hi>Original,</hi> preſerved under the <hi>Baſe</hi> of <hi>Apollo Palatinus;</hi> but that onely Copy, which had been Tranſcribed by the <hi>High Prieſts,</hi> in the Time of <hi>Auguſtus. Secondly,</hi> For that it was not in any caſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that any private Perſon ſhould read, or interpret it; and that the <hi>Quindecem-viri</hi> themſelves, whoſe particular Privilege it was, durſt not attempt any ſuch thing, without the expreſs Order of the <hi>Senate.</hi> Whence it follows; that the <hi>Heathens</hi> had good reaſon to Charge with <hi>Impoſture</hi> the <hi>Pieces,</hi> produced by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> upon this account parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly; That they ſaw them in their hands, and by them publiſhed: nor could the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> juſtly preſs them to produce what none of them could come at, and was to continue locked up under the Key of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſecret.</p>
                     <p>But, all this notwithſtanding, <hi>Origen</hi>'s Anſwer was not neceſſary; Celſus <hi>does not demonſtrate, that the things which he conceives ſhuffled into the Works of the</hi> Sibyl <hi>are reproachfull, or detractive; therefore they are not ſuch.</hi> For, though the imputation of <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Superſtitions be not properly detraction; but a moſt true, and moſt juſt, reproach of their Impiety: yet was it a Detraction, according to their Opinion, and to bring the Charge by a <hi>Sibyl</hi> (that is, the Perſon, the moſt unfit to act ſuch a part)
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106901:31"/>
was to exerciſe a kind of Detraction, againſt her Memory, and to bear a falſe Teſtimony under her Name, very well deſerving to be taken off by the general complaint of all the Unbelievers. Wherefore the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Origen,</hi> againſt the Objection of <hi>Celſus,</hi> who (as Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with <hi>Juſtine Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Lucian,</hi> who dedicated his <hi>Pſeudo-mantis</hi> to him) had ſeen the breaking forth of the <hi>Impoſture,</hi> being but an Eluſion, and no more, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath had a thouſand times more reaſon, to leave it to the Adverſaries of the Church, to acknowledge, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, at their own choice, the eight Books, pretended to be <hi>Sibylline;</hi> ſaying, <note n="u" place="margin">De Civit.

Hence comes it, that all the Verſes of the</hi> Sibylline <hi>Poems were not preſerved. For we our ſelf being at the City</hi> (of <hi>Cumae) underſtood ſo much from thoſe, who led us up and down, and ſhewed us the places, where ſhe ſpoke her Oracles, and a certain Urn made of Braſs, where they ſaid her Reliques were conſerved. They alſo gave us this account, as having it from their Predeceſſours, That thoſe, who received the Oracle, being people without inſtruction, many times failed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act obſervation of meaſures, and ſaid this was the reaſon, why ſome Verſes were without meaſure;</hi> viz. <hi>that the Propheteſs, after the Extaſie of inſpiration was over, remembred not the things ſhe had ſaid, and that thoſe, who writ them, by reaſon of their ignorance, had loſt the exact meaſure of the Verſes.</hi> And a little lower; <hi>Submit to the moſt antient of all the</hi> Sibyls, <hi>whoſe Books, it is ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, are preſerved all the World over; and who, by Oracles, proceeding from a certain powerfull inſpiration, hath taught you concerning thoſe, who are called Gods, that they are not ſuch.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, Is it not a great miſtake, to think, that God (whoſe Works are ever ſuitable to his own Majeſty, that is to ſay, Divine, and Perfect) could ever have pronounced <hi>Verſes, that were imperfect, both as to their Sence, and Meaſure,</hi> to thoſe, whom he inſpired?</p>

                     <p>But (for the beter underſtanding of all theſe Paſſages) the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reader is onely to remember; that, as the <hi>Prophets</hi> (though they did not any action, that was irregular, or void of reaſon) paſſed for <hi>Mad</hi> men in the apprehenſion of the profane; ſuch, as might be the <hi>Captains</hi> at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> and <hi>Shemaiah,</hi> the Preſecutour of <hi>Jeremiah:</hi> ſo the <hi>Devils</hi> egged on their Foretellers of things to come, to play the <hi>Apes,</hi> and imitate the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and to brag (even when they were at the height of their Extravagance) of Inſpirations, equal with theirs. So that, if the true <hi>Prophets,</hi> moved by Celeſtial Grace, diſcovered the operations of it, by ſome action ſuitable to their condition; upon which account <hi>Saul</hi> (being among them) <hi>ſtripped himſelf</hi> of his Royal Robe, and <hi>lay upon the ground,</hi> humbling himſelf before God, and celebrating the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Infinite Power, <hi>according as the Spirit gave him to ſpeak:</hi> on the contrary, when he was overpreſſed with <hi>Melancholy,</hi> and tormented by the <hi>evil Spirit,</hi> which put him into Madneſs, and Ecſtaſie, he ſpoke alſo, in that condition, as if he had Prophecyed. And Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> minds us of the difference, there is between the ſervile tranſportation of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed Perſons, which darkens the light of their minds, binds up its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, makes their Reaſon unprofitable, and forces them to violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that holy Raviſhment of the <hi>Prophets;</hi> which, filling them with admiration, and joy, refined their underſtanding, and left them the free uſe of their ratiocination, yet in ſuch manner, as to diver them from all humane Conſiderations, and bend their thoughts to an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſubmiſsion to God. Upon which account he ſaid, <hi>They cryed, not what they would themſelves; but what he commanded:</hi> intending to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thereby the violence they did themſelves, by renouncing their own will, that they might, the more freely, purſue the motions of his Grace: and obſerved further, that they <hi>minded not their own ſafety;</hi> repreſenting, that they regarded not the preſervation of their Lives, nor their own convenience; but were always ready to Sacrifice themſelves, and proteſt with St. <hi>Paul;</hi>

But, the deſire of profiting out of all things, of taking advantages every where, of forcing Truth even out of the mouth of Falſhood, and to become like Torrents, whoſe violence carries away what ever they meet with, hath made many of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that nothing might eſcape the greedineſs of their <hi>Memory,</hi> neglect the beſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they could have had to make Diſcoveries of their <hi>Judgment;</hi> and not onely endeavour to draw to themſelves all the apprehenſions of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> as well ſolid, as ill-grounded (as thoſe great <hi>Rivers,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in their <hi>Chanels</hi> Golden Sand, and Dirt, mixed together) but alſo triumph in that kind of employment, wherein there muſt ſometimes be foul Play; as if it had been lawfull for them to ſay with <hi>Aeneas,</hi> in <hi>Virgil,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The laſt Time comes, which <hi>Sibyl</hi>'s Verſe declare: and that <hi>no body queſtions, but that the</hi> Cumaean <hi>Poem is the</hi> Sibylline.

                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, That <hi>Virgil</hi> does not ſay, he either had, or could have, taken any thing out of the <hi>Cumaean Poem;</hi> which could not be come at by a Perſon of his Quality; but that <hi>the laſt Time,</hi> which was to accompliſh the <hi>Deſtinies,</hi> foretold by the <hi>Cumaean Poem,</hi> was then coming in.</p>

the <hi>Cumaean Sibyl</hi> had <hi>uttered</hi> what the <hi>Poet</hi> writ; but that ſhe foretold the Fate of the <hi>Empire</hi> to its laſt Time: whereof (according to his manner) he makes a <hi>Deſcription.</hi>

                        <note n="c" place="margin">Lib. 36. cap. 5.</note> there was at the ſame time, in <hi>Rome, Vedius Pollio,</hi> a man no leſs familiar with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> then <hi>Aſinius;</hi> as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the ſame <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. 9. cap. 23, 53.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Though <hi>Herod</hi> came four ſeveral times to <hi>Rome;</hi> yet is it impoſſible, to make the conceit of <hi>Baronius</hi> to ſuit with any one of them. For the firſt Journey he made thither was in the year of <hi>Rome</hi> 714, during the <hi>Conſulſhip</hi> of <hi>Pollio,</hi> to implore the aſſiſtances of the <hi>Senate</hi> againſt the <hi>Parthians;</hi> and then he was in a private Condition, made little ſtay, had other Things in his thoughts, then Diſcourſing with <hi>Virgil</hi> (who was then onely beginning to come into Repute, without minding ought of Religion) and, having his Imagination employed how to get (as he afterwards did) the Crown of <hi>Judaea,</hi> he would have been more likely to entertain <hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Pollio,</hi> with the Riſing of his own Glory, then of that of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> whom the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls the <note n="e" place="margin">Jer. 10. 7.</note>

For the firſt was in the year of <hi>Rome,</hi> 738. to carry away the children of <hi>Mariamne</hi> into <hi>Judaea;</hi> the ſecond, in the year 744. to accuſe them before <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> and the laſt, in the year 746. to reſtore into favour <hi>Archelaus,</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> his Ally. So that <hi>Virgil</hi> was not then in a Condition to learn any thing, either of him, or of any of his Retinue; or, yet, of his Friend <hi>Pollio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Joſephus</hi> does not ſay; that <hi>Pollio</hi> was ever <hi>Hoſt</hi> unto, or <hi>entertained, Herod</hi> at his Houſe: but that he <hi>lodged his Children,</hi> from the year of <hi>Rome,</hi> 733. at which time <hi>Virgil</hi> was in <hi>Greece,</hi> to the year 738. which was the third after his Death. And it is ſo far from being a good Conſequence, <hi>Pollio entertained in his Houſe the Children of Herod;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>He received</hi> Herod <hi>himſelf into his Houſe:</hi> that the contrary ſeems rather to be inferred, <hi>He lodged the Children of</hi> Herod; therefore, <hi>He could not, at the ſame time, lodg</hi> Herod <hi>himſelf, their Father; who had a Royal Retinue about him, and was more vain-glorious, then any</hi> Prince <hi>of his Time.</hi> I preſs not, that <hi>Cardinal Baronius</hi> (directly contrary to the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Conſtantine,</hi> who commends the Piety of <hi>Virgil)</hi> cenſuring his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Flattery, renders him ſo much the more criminal, for that, having learned of the <hi>Jews</hi> the Myſterie of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> he, out of a voluntary Malice, applied the <hi>Prophecy</hi> to <hi>Pollio,</hi> and his Son. All which conſidered, gives me the Confidence to affirm; that the preſumed communication of <hi>Virgil</hi> with the <hi>Jews</hi> is a groundleſs Imagination, and no more.</p>

                     <p>This Venerable man, preſſed to Ward off the Objections of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> alledging the Suppoſititiouſneſs of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> in that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed, as extant, <hi>Churches,</hi> that were not in the Time of St. <hi>John</hi> (as, for inſtance, that of <hi>Thyatira)</hi> admits, without any neceſſity, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of thoſe troubleſom Spirits, as if it had been out of all Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: then Anſwers; That <hi>John</hi> ſpoke by Prophecy, not of the <hi>Church,</hi> which was then; but of that, which ſhould be planted ſome time after at <hi>Thyatira:</hi> where the People, ſeduced by the <hi>Alogians,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſts,</hi> ſhould, after the ninety third year from our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> or the one hundred twenty ſixth from his <hi>Birth,</hi> according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> corrupt that wretched City with their Errour; and, having cited the Text of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> makes Application of it in theſe Terms; <hi>Do you not ſee, that he ſpeaks of Women, who, having been ſeduced with an Imagination, that they had the Gift of Prophecy, have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many others? Now I ſpeak of</hi> Priſcilla, <hi>and</hi> Maximilla, <hi>and</hi> Quintilla; <hi>whoſe Seduction hath not been hidden from the Holy Spirit.</hi> In fine, after he had ſearched into the time, when he thought <hi>John</hi> Baniſhed to <hi>Patmos,</hi> he ſhuts up his Diſcourſe with this Concluſion; that is to ſay, <hi>That in</hi> Thyatira <hi>a Woman ſhould call her ſelf a</hi> Propheteſs.</p>
                     <p>But, the more I conſider this Anſwer, the leſs I finde it (without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the reſpect due to its Authour) capable of giving ſatisfaction to judicious Perſons. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Is there any likelyhood, that the Holy Spirit ſhould direct <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> from the Son of God to <hi>Churches,</hi> which had no being, when it dictated them, and that we muſt underſtand theſe words, <hi>Unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Church, which is in</hi> Thyatira, <hi>write theſe things, I know thy works,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The laſt are more then the firſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have a few things againſt thee; becauſe thou ſuffereſt the woman</hi> Jezabel, <hi>who calleth her ſelf a</hi> Propheteſs, <hi>to teach, and ſeduce,</hi> &amp;c. in this ſence, <hi>Write to the Angel of the Church, which</hi> ſhall be <hi>in</hi> Thyatira, <hi>I know the works thou</hi> ſhalt do; <hi>the laſt</hi> ſhall be <hi>more then the firſt; I</hi> ſhall <hi>have ſome few things againſt thee; thou</hi> ſhalt <hi>ſuffer the woman</hi> Jezabel, <hi>who</hi> ſhall <hi>call her ſelf a</hi> Propheteſs, <hi>to teach,</hi> &amp;c? It was no hard matter for St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to write it; but whom hath he hitherto convinced of it, beſides himſelf? This manner of Interpretation being ſuch, as that not any one of either the <hi>Antients,</hi> or <hi>Modern,</hi> hath followed it, the very Singularity thereof ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, not onely to bring it into ſuſpicion; but alſo to repreſent it as ſo much the more unmaintainable, in as much as all, that profeſſed <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> from St. <hi>John</hi> to St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> (that is, from the year 100. to the year 375. wherein the later wrote againſt the <hi>Alogians</hi> had held the contrary to what it ſuppoſes, and took it for a thing indiſputable, that the <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> to whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> directed his <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> had been planted by the Miniſtery of Saint <hi>John</hi> before his Baniſhment to <hi>Patmos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Contradicting his own <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> to wit, that <hi>Thyatira</hi>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:106901:46"/>
had not had any <hi>Church</hi> in the Time of St. <hi>John,</hi> he comes, for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, to maintain the oppoſite <hi>Affirmative,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Then the whole Church</hi> (of <hi>Thyatira</hi> was <hi>wholly degenerated into the Sect of the</hi> Cataphrygians [or <hi>Montaniſts] accordingly the holy Spirit would needs reveal unto you how it ſhould come to paſs, that the Church ſhould be ſeduced after the time of the</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>and</hi> St. John, <hi>and thoſe who came after; it was about ninety three years after the Aſſumption of our</hi> Saviour, <hi>that the Church of that place,</hi> (to wit, <hi>Thyatira) ſhould be ſeduced, and fall into the Hereſie of the</hi> Cataphrygi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For, if the <hi>Church were planted at</hi> Thyatira, it neceſſarily follows, it <hi>was there:</hi> the Allegation of the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of a thing containing the formal preſuppoſition of its precedent <hi>exiſtence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, But, not to meddle any further with that contradiction of St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> nor the ſuppoſition, which he granted the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all, he advances a new one againſt the expreſs Text of St. <hi>John;</hi> for he writes expreſly, that <hi>the whole Church of</hi> Thyatira <hi>was degenerated into the Sect of the</hi> Cataphrygians; whereas the Holy Spirit, on the contrary, ſays it was not the <hi>whole Church</hi> of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> that had committed Adultery with <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and received her <hi>Doctrine;</hi> but that, in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> there were ſome <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> which were not fallen into thoſe Errours; as it expreſly declares, ſpeaking <hi>To the reſt in Thyatira, who had not received that Doctrine, nor known the depth of Satan, I ſay,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Saint <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> himſelf, does further deſtroy the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation he had taken to denote the falling-away of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira.</hi> For whereas, in his <hi>Diſpute</hi> againſt the <hi>Alogians,</hi> he affirms, that, in the ninety third year after the <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> (and conſequently the one hundred, twenty ſixth after the <hi>Birth</hi> of our <hi>Saviour)</hi> this Revolt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; in the fourty eighth <hi>Hereſie,</hi> where he particularly refutes the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> he comes thirty years later, then that Date, ſaying; <hi>Theſe,</hi> (to wit, the <hi>Montaniſts) were about the twenty fifth year of</hi> Antoninus Pius, <hi>after</hi> Adrian: which (according to our Computation) cannot concur, but with the year 156. and is neceſſarily falſe, as to their Judgment, who preceded in Time. For <hi>Claudius Apollinaris,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> limits the firſt eruption of the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> to the <hi>Proconſulſhip</hi> of <hi>Gratus,</hi> which is conſonant to the year 142. or thereabouts: and <hi>Apolionius,</hi> the <hi>Romane</hi> Senatour, who ſuffered Martyrdom under <hi>Peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> on the eighteenth of <hi>April,</hi> 181. obſerves, that, fourty years before, that <hi>Sect</hi> pretended to a Prophetick Spirit; thereby inſinuating, that it had broke forth about the year 139, or 140. not much differing from the time aſsigned by <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> but three years later, then St <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> would have it, in his <hi>Diſpute</hi> againſt the <hi>Alogians,</hi> and thirty ſix years ſooner, then he ſaid in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> againſt the <hi>Montaniſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, This <hi>Sect</hi> roſe up particularly in <hi>Phrygia</hi> at a little <hi>Village,</hi> called <hi>Pepuzium,</hi> which the Inhabitants (upon occaſion of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Prophets,</hi> who were <hi>Natives</hi> thereof) named <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and not (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> imagined) in <hi>Thyatira</hi> in <hi>Lydia;</hi> which, though adjacent indeed, and lying upon the <hi>Frontiers</hi> of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> yet made a <hi>Province</hi> of it ſelf, as appears by the Teſtimony of <hi>Strabo</hi> (in his thirteenth <hi>Book)</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (in the ſecond <hi>Chapter</hi> of his firſt <hi>Book)</hi> by the <hi>Councel of Nice,</hi>

Aſſembled by the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> in the year 325. and by that of <hi>Lydia,</hi> convened by Order of the Emperour <hi>Leo the Firſt,</hi> in the year 450. where the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Thyatira</hi> ſubſcribed. with the <hi>Lydians,</hi> as being of the ſame Diviſion. Nay, though there were onely to ſatisfie us, but the very Denominations of <hi>Cataphrygians, Phrygaſtae,</hi> and <hi>Pepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziani,</hi> given by the <hi>Catholicks</hi> to the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> they might ſuffice to make us apprehend, that we are not to look for their extraction in <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira,</hi> out of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> from which they are <hi>ſpecifically</hi> denominated.</p>

For <hi>one Woman,</hi> (to take the word ſtrictly) is not <hi>Women;</hi> but I am rather apt to ſuppoſe, he took the word <hi>Woman</hi> collectively; and in that comply with his meaning.</p>
                     <p>As to his maintaining, that the Holy <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was Baniſhed to <hi>Patmos,</hi> and there writ his <hi>Apocalyps</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> at leaſt fourty two years ſooner, then is held by the common Tradition of the Truth; I deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to ſee him refuted by the very <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> where he may finde in the eighteenth and nineteenth <hi>Chapters,</hi> that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> having (in the year of our <hi>Lord</hi> 51. coincident with the eleventh of <hi>Claudius)</hi> ſowed the firſt Seeds of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> departed thence, to go and keep <hi>Eaſter</hi> at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and that, after his Return, he continued conſtantly at <hi>Epheſus</hi> two years; that is to ſay, the fifty ſecond, and fifty third of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> concurrent with the twelfth and thirteenth of <hi>Claudius,</hi> who died on the thirteenth of <hi>October,</hi> 54. on the twentieth day of the ninth Moneth of his fourteenth year.

                     <p>Thirdly, For that the <hi>Church</hi> hath always held it for certain;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That, full eleven years after the Death of <hi>Claudius,</hi> the <hi>firſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi> was raiſed by <hi>Nero,</hi> to derive upon the innocent <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the Indignation of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> exaſperated by the reſentment of their own Loſſes, in the firing of the City, which that <hi>Monſter,</hi> himſelf, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Baniſhment of St. <hi>John</hi> was conſequent to ſome <hi>Perſecution:</hi> St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> Contemporary with St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Friend, aſſuring us, that, <hi>becauſe of the Martyrdom,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before his Tranſportation to <hi>Patmos, was at</hi> Rome, <hi>caſt into the veſſel of ſeething Oyl.</hi>

See</hi> Epiphanius <hi>in the</hi> Hereſie <hi>of the</hi> Alogians. Claudius <hi>had (as appears by</hi> Acts xviii. 2.) <hi>forced out of</hi> Rome <hi>the</hi> Jews, <hi>among whom, at that time, the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>were alſo numbered, as hath been obſerved by many learned men. Which example, there is no doubt, but divers Governours of the</hi> Romane <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces imitated; by which means</hi> John <hi>was forced to leave</hi> Epheſus.</p>
                     <p>But I maintain, in oppoſition to the Prejudice of this Great man,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That not any one of the Antient <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor yet of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, either were of the Opinion of St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> or favoured it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> (who was neither preceded, nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by any one in his Sentiment) ſays not any thing, that is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and is not peremptorily refuted, as well by the Tradition univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally received in the <hi>Church,</hi> as by Reaſon it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the Singularity, and Novelty, of that <hi>Father</hi>'s Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being contrary to thoſe of all the reſt, and in ſome manner to himſelf, ſhould rather have raiſed his Diſtruſt, then prepoſſeſſed him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That it cannot, by any Monument of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> be made good, that the miſtake of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> taking the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for <hi>Jews,</hi> had reduced (in the Time of the <hi>Emperour Claudius,</hi> under whom the <hi>Jews</hi> were the onely Perſecutours of the <hi>Church)</hi> any one of the <hi>Faithfull</hi> to ſuffer Baniſhment, upon the account of his being of the <hi>Faithfull,</hi> or a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and that to preſuppoſe it onely by way of ſimple Conjecture, without any Proof, is no other, then openly to prejudice one's credit, and to abuſe their plain dealing, and eaſineſs of perſwaſion, who might comply therewith.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That it is impoſſible to make it good, that the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> which Baniſhed the <hi>Jews</hi> onely out of <hi>Rome,</hi> had been, or could have been, imitated by any of the <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Romane Provinces,</hi> who knew there was but one <hi>Rome</hi> in the World, and that it was not within any of their Jurisdictions.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That, by the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it is evident, that, after the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Claudius,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> enjoyed, in all other places of the <hi>Empire,</hi> as abſolute Freedom, and Toleration, as they could have done before; ſince St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> his Wife, lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where thoſe of their Nation had their <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and aſſembled, as they were wont, without any Diſturbance.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, That though the <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Romane Provinces</hi> ſhould have been enclined (in imitation of their <hi>Emperour)</hi> to pack the <hi>Jews</hi> out of their <hi>Jurisdictions,</hi> yet would it not be juſt to imagine any ſuch thing of the <hi>Proconſul</hi> of <hi>Aſia;</hi> nor to preſuppoſe, that, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with that Extravagance, he had driven St. <hi>John</hi> (who was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106901:48"/>
his <hi>Jurisdiction)</hi> from any place; when at the ſame time, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were forced to depart <hi>Rome,</hi> St. <hi>Paul, Priſcilla, Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> (who were no leſs of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Extraction, then <hi>John)</hi> ſojourned at <hi>Epheſus</hi> without diſturbance, their <hi>Brethren according to the Fleſh</hi> enjoyed there as much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as ever: nay, even when <hi>Demetrius</hi> had (with thoſe of his <hi>Profeſſion)</hi> made an Inſurrection in the City againſt Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> they thought themſelves ſufficiently Authoriſed to pacifie the Tumult, <hi>thruſting out</hi> Alexander <hi>their Brother out of the Multitude,</hi> and charging him to ſpeak to the enraged People; for, if it were to no purpoſe, that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it, it was at leaſt without apprehenſion of any danger, either to themſelves, or him.</p>
                     <p>Whence it follows, that, not onely without any neceſſity, but alſo without any ground, it is imagined, that St. <hi>John</hi> (who was not yet come to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Claudius</hi> came forth againſt the <hi>Jews)</hi> was driven thence by Virtue of that <hi>Edict,</hi> which no way concerned him; and that, if there never could be any excuſe to introduce Novelties into the Buſineſs of <hi>Religion,</hi> we ſhould be much further from advancing ruinous <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> to maintain the more ruinous Deſign of oppoſing common Sentiments. So that no man ſhould think it ſtrange, if (through the juſt Judgment of God) thoſe, who take a pleaſure in contradicting things, that are moſt evident, unadviſedly engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in inconſiſtent Opinions, to the prejudice of their Reputation, and ſuch, as are more apt to raiſe Compaſſion for their Weakneſs, then Jealouſie upon account of the great Eſteem due to them.</p>

                     <p>Thus are we furniſhed by this man with a third Opinion, inconſiſtent as well with the two precedent, as the Truth it ſelf, which declares onely for the firſt, confirmed by St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and others of the <hi>Antients;</hi> and what ſhould make this new Production the more contemptible, is, that it will be found grounded onely upon <hi>Chimaerical Suppoſitions,</hi> and, taking it at the beſt advantage, ſpeaks nothing poſitively Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. For, whereas it is confidently affirmed, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> aſſures us in two ſeveral places, that Saint <hi>John</hi> was Baniſhed at the time of the Martyrdom of the Holy Apoſtles, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely falſe; that <hi>Father,</hi> who makes mention of the Sufferings of the Saints, <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> jointly all together in one onely place, to wit, in the thirty ſixth of his <hi>Praeſcriptions,</hi> expreſſing it onely in theſe Terms: <note n="a" place="margin">Stat. felix Eccleſia. cui totam Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam <hi>Apoſtoli</hi> cum ſanguine ſuo profude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt; ubi <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus</hi> Paſſioni Dominicae ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequatur; ubi <hi>Paulus Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> exitu coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur; ubi A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolus <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes,</hi> poſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um igneum demerſus, nihil paſſus eſt, in Inſulam rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatur.</note>

                     <p>This Imagination, conſidered by the moſt antient of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as taken out of a <hi>Book</hi> of divine Authority, made ſo ſtrong an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon them; that they took it for an infallible Leſſon.

We cannot make a better repreſentation of the State, whereto the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> of that Time conceived their <hi>deceaſed Brethren</hi> to be reduced; then by copying-out what <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who had ſeen the Eruption of the firſt <hi>Sibylline</hi> Impoſture) hath written of the condition of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, to whom he very juſtly applied thoſe words of the two and twentieth <hi>Pſalm</hi> (according to the <hi>Hebrews)</hi>

                        <hi>Save me from the Lyon's Mouth. That he prayed his Soul might be delivered</hi> from the Sword, from the Lyon's Mouth, and the Paw of the Dog, <hi>was a requeſt, that none ſhould prevail over his Soul; to the end, that, when we come to depart this life, we ſhould deſire the ſame things, as he did of Almighty God; that every wicked bold Spirit may be prevented from taking our Souls, as being what the Souls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. I have ſhewn as much, in that</hi> Saul <hi>required, that the Soul of</hi> Samuel <hi>might be evocated by the Witch. It appears alſo, that the Souls of all thoſe, who have been Juſt, and Prophets, are ſubject to ſuch Powers, as (by the effect) it is manifeſt, was that, wherewith the Witch was Poſſeſſed. Whence it is, that he teacheth us by his</hi> Son, <hi>that we (for whoſe ſake it is clear, that that was done) ſhould Fight all manner of waies, and deſire, at our Departure out of this life, that our Souls may not fall under any ſuch Powers, for as much, as when he gave up the Ghoſt upon the Croſs, he ſaid</hi>

                     <p>From which Diſcourſe we learn; that he had a certain perſuaſion of four things;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That our <hi>Saviour,</hi> at the time of his <hi>Paſſion</hi> for our ſalvation, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his Soul might not fall under the power of the <hi>Devils.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That we are obliged, upon our approaches to Death, to imitate his Example.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the <hi>Prophets</hi> were, after death, expoſed to the inſolencies of <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> in ſuch manner, that the Soul of <hi>Samuel</hi> could be evocated by the <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the Souls, of the <hi>Faithfull,</hi> who dayly <hi>depart</hi> this world, are ſubject to the ſame inconveniences; and, conſequently, do all ſtand in extraordinary need of being relieved by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Living.</hi>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Thoſe, who are here, believe, that thoſe, who are departed this world, live: and that they are not deprived of being; but that they both are, and live to the</hi> Lord. <hi>And to the end, that this excellent Doctrine may be explained; that there is an hope for thoſe, who pray for their Brethren, as for perſons in their journey; the prayer made for them is alſo profitable, although it does not cut all, that may be alledged againſt them: but (in as much, as, many times, while we are in this world, we ſin voluntarily, and involuntarily) to ſigniſie what is accompliſhed. For we make mention of the</hi> Juſt, <hi>and pray for ſinners; for ſinners, directing our Eyes to the mercy of God, which they have obtained; for the</hi> Juſt, <hi>for the</hi> Fathers, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Martyrs, Confeſſours, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Anachorets, <hi>and the whole Battalion, to the end, that we might make a diſtinction between the rank of men, and the Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>becauſe of the honour, which is due to him, and render him convenient Veneration, as having
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106901:63"/>
this apprehenſion, that our</hi> Lord <hi>is not to be parallelled with any of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, though every one of mankinde were poſſeſsed of Juſtice ten thouſand times, and more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is evident, that the firſt Conſideration of Saint <hi>Epiphanius</hi> could make nothing againſt <hi>Aërius;</hi> who denyed the advantage of <hi>Prayer</hi> for the <hi>Faithfull</hi> departed: the Ratiocination, or Argument of this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> being not neceſſary, either abſolutely, or in reſpect of his Adverſary <hi>He is living, Therefore he muſt be prayed for;</hi> ſince that, if this were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Prayers</hi> ſhould be made for all the living Creatures that are, <hi>Angels, Men,</hi> and <hi>Beaſts,</hi> without any exception; and that for this reaſon, that all theſe, every one of theſe kindes is poſſeſſed of <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> in ſome degree. Beſides the Conſequence of ſuch a way of reaſoning would go much beyond, as well the intention of its <hi>Authour,</hi> as the practice of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Pontus;</hi> in vindication whereof he had framed it: ſince that no Community of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ever did, or thought it ſelf obliged to communicate its <hi>Suffrages</hi> to the <hi>Angels, who live, and ſtand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord;</hi> as ſuppoſing that Office could not be due to them, nor be conceived a <hi>rational ſervice,</hi> in regard they neither ſtand in need thereof, nor can receive any advantage thereby.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond <hi>Conſideration,</hi> which concerns the Hope the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>fourth Age</hi> conceived of the effect of their <hi>Prayers</hi> for their <hi>deceaſed Brethren,</hi> could not be of greater weight, then the former, as far as it concerned <hi>Aërius;</hi> who denyed, not that the <hi>Faithfull</hi> of his Time, had a certain hope of profiting the <hi>Dead</hi> by their <hi>Prayers</hi> (for that they had, was manifeſt) but that their hope was well grounded, and that their <hi>Prayers</hi> for the <hi>Dead</hi> were, or could be, of any advantage. But, as I cannot, without ſome trouble, reflect, that a <hi>Perſon</hi> ſo great (as Saint <hi>Epiphanius)</hi> ſhould be (through I know not what forgetfulneſs) redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to alledg for a reaſon to his <hi>Adverſary</hi> the very thing he put in queſtion, and which had moſt need of proof; ſo I think my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to make this <hi>Obſervation;</hi> 
                        <q>That the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at that time uſed their hope concerning the communication of their <hi>Suffrages</hi> to the <hi>Dead,</hi> with ſo much indulgence; that they extended it even to thoſe, whom they thought dead in mortal ſin, and out of the communion of the <hi>Church.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XVI. The Third, and Fourth Motives of <hi>Saint Epiphanius</hi> taken into conſideration.</head>
                     <p>THe third Conſideration of Saint <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to confirm the cuſtom of Praying for the Dead: <hi>viz.</hi> That the departed are (in relation to the living) <hi>as perſons that Travell,</hi> ſeems to preſuppoſe the firſt <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> of the pretended <hi>Sibylline</hi> Writing, which gives occaſion to imagine, that thoſe, who dy, arrive, upon the diſſolution of the Body, not at the place of their ſovereign Happineſs; but are transferred to ſome unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing receptacle under the earth, where their patience is no leſs exerciſed, then that of Travellers, who have a long and tedious Journey to go through. This <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> indeed (if ſo be it were maintained by <hi>Aërius)</hi> might juſtly have been objected to him, to induce him to admit Prayer for the Dead? ſince it is evident, that thoſe, who are at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from their Happineſs, and languiſh in the expectation of it, ſtand in need of comfort, and the Prayers requiſite to obtain grace of him, who is the author of Grace. But it cannot be of any conſideration, as to what concerns the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who unanimouſly Impugn it, and conſtantly teach, that the Souls of men, at the very departure out of their Bodies, enter either into Eternal fire, whence there is no deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and where there is no comfort; or into the Glory of God, which for ever exempts them from all thoſe exigencies, which they are Subject to, who are deprived thereof, while they endeavour to attain it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:106901:66"/>
The fourth Conſideration of the ſame Father, to wit, that thoſe, who dy, have, during the time of their Pilgrimage in this world, <hi>Sinned both voluntarily, and involuntarily,</hi> is very Juſt, and as <hi>Aërius</hi> never had any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to deny it, ſo is it not at all contradicted by any of the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> who, by that which they have learnt of Saint <hi>John,</hi> that thoſe men, who (at any aſſignable time of their Life) <hi>ſay they have no ſin, deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, make God a Lyar, and have neither his word, nor truth in them,</hi> do very well comprehend, that it muſt of neceſſity follow, that thoſe, who ſhould deny <hi>they had any</hi> till the hour of Death, would <hi>deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> no leſs then others, and with equal preſumption charg with falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood the God of truth. But (omitting what <hi>Aerius</hi> might have ſaid according to his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> of which we have nothing certain) the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> hold, that there is no neceſſity of this conſequence, <hi>he hath (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voluntarily, or involuntarily, it matters not) ſinned during his life:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>we muſt Pray for him after his death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> grants it, inaſmuch as ſhe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that this Antecedent, <hi>he hath ſinned,</hi> is and ſhall eternally be as undeniably true in reſpect of the <hi>Saints,</hi> which are, and ever ſhall be in the Glory of God, and the <hi>Damned,</hi> who ſhall never come out of Hell torments, as of the <hi>living,</hi> who aſpire to felicity, and deſire to eſcape Damnation: ſhe, I ſay, neither prays, nor thinks ſhe ought to pray, for either the <hi>Saints Glorified,</hi> nor the <hi>Sinners Condemned,</hi> but onely for the <hi>Faithfull,</hi> whom ſhe preſuppoſes to expect their Glorification, and that onely for a certain time.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that if from this antecedent, <hi>he hath ſinned,</hi> it did of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty always follow, <hi>We muſt Pray for him,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would be obliged to Pray; <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the <hi>Apoſtatized Angels,</hi> who, having quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their firſt ſtation, ſinned no leſs then men do, but in ſuch manner, that their offence condemned by an irrevocable decree is abſolutely incapable of remedy. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Damned, who are not in a ſtate capable of amendment. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For thoſe, that are Glorified, who have not any good to obtain, and that as well after, as before, the laſt Judgment; ſince that after the Pronuntiation of it, this truth, that <hi>men, and Devils have ſinned,</hi> will remain evident, and irrefragable as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though that after the retribution, which ſhall be for ever made to every one according to his works, it will not be any longer either neceſſary, or convenient, or rational to pray for him.</p>

                     <p>Thence it appears, how weak St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, even from this; that it proves more, then he had propoſed to himſelf; nay, more, then the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day deſires: the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſay; which hath not onely for the ſpace of 1200. years paſt, left off <hi>Praying for the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Martyrs,</hi> &amp;c. but would look on that kinde of Devotion as <hi>injurious,</hi> having grounded her proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> copied by <hi>Beda,</hi> upon the twelfth <hi>Chapter</hi>

                        <hi>TErtullian,</hi> before any of theſe <hi>Authours,</hi> alledged two <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>praying for the Dead;</hi> that is to ſay, their <hi>refreſhment,</hi> and the <hi>haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>advancement of their Reſurrection.</hi> For this Great man (I know not how) bewitched by the pretended <hi>Sibylline</hi> Writing, ſuppoſed, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt Judgment, the <hi>Son of God,</hi> being deſcended upon Earth, to eſtabliſh a new Kingdom in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to govern it himſelf, ſhould bring together all his <hi>Faithfull,</hi> and ſhould there fill them with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, even corporeal, for the ſpace of a <hi>thouſand years.</hi> And, whereas St. <hi>John</hi> had foretold in his <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> that, the <hi>Old Serpent being bound for a thouſand years,</hi> there ſhould be a <hi>firſt Reſurrection,</hi> in favour of their Souls, <hi>who were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus,</hi> he, with <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias,</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and all thoſe, who have ſince gone under the name of <hi>Millenaries,</hi> took that Praediction <hi>literally,</hi> and, wreſting it to a contrary ſence, imagined, that, during the thouſand years of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Reign,</hi> which he pretended ſhould be in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the moſt eminent for Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, among the <hi>Faithfull</hi> departed, ſhould riſe again before the reſt of mankind; but ſucceſſively, and every one at this appointed time; ſo as that, if one took poſſeſsion of his body in the firſt of the <hi>thouſand years,</hi> another ſhould not have that privilege, till a hundred, two, or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after, and ſo to the end of that period of ten Ages; and that thoſe ſhould have leaſt advantage thereof, whoſe Reſurrection ſhould be either delayed, till near the end of the <hi>thouſand years,</hi> or put off till after it, and referred to the laſt day aſsigned for the general Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well of the reſt of the Juſt, as the Wicked. To induce us to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that Opinion, St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in the thirty fourth <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>fifth Book,</hi> making a coherence between the words of St. <hi>John</hi> in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Son of God</hi> in the twelfth of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Hoc eſt, quod à Domino dictum eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <q>This is it, which is ſaid by our <hi>Saviour;</hi>

                     <p>It might ſeem (and there want not Great men, who have thought ſo) that St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was of the ſame Sentiment; when, cloſing up his <hi>Funeral Oration</hi> upon the Death of <hi>Valentinian the Second,</hi> he writ in the year 392. <hi>Te quaeſo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I beſeech thee, Sovereign God, that, by an haſtened Reſurrection, thou wouldeſt awake, and raiſe up theſe moſt dear young men</hi> (Gratian, <hi>and</hi> Valentinian) <hi>ſo as that thou recompenſe by an advanced Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection the courſe of this life, which they have terminated, before it was come to its perfection:</hi> as if by the <hi>haſtened,</hi> or <hi>advanced Reſurrection,</hi> which he deſired, he had meant the <hi>firſt Reſurrection,</hi> which the <hi>Millenaries</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to themſelves; and had begged it, as well for <hi>Gratian,</hi> who was born on the eighteenth of <hi>April,</hi> 359. and had been murthered twenty four years, four Moneths, and ſeven days after, that is to ſay, on the twenty fifth day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 383. as for <hi>Valentinian,</hi> whoſe <hi>birth,</hi> happening on the eighteenth of <hi>January</hi> 370. had not preceeded his <hi>death</hi> (falling on <hi>Whitſun-Eve, May</hi> the fifteenth, 392) but twenty two years, three Moneths, and twenty ſeven days: upon which account he called them both <hi>Young men,</hi> and bemoaned them, that the <hi>courſe of their Life</hi> had been cut off before its <hi>maturity,</hi> and juſt <hi>perfection.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>That thoſe, who have recourſee to this kinde of Defence, make a formal disacknowledgment of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who, grounding his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> onely upon the <hi>Law of the Apoſtles,</hi> under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> hath even in that diſcovered, how vain and frivolous, he thought their undertaking, who would prove their Cuſtom out of the <hi>Old,</hi> in the ſame manner, as theſe later diſclaim all the advantage, which St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> had promiſed himſelf in the allegation of the <hi>Apoſtolical Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it argues want of circumſpection, to ſuppoſe, as acknowledged, what is in Queſtion; <hi>viz. That the</hi> Synagogue <hi>under the</hi> Old Teſtament <hi>made any Prayers for the dead, and that their Practice can be juſtified by Writings either precedent, or immediately ſubſequent to the Birth of</hi> Chriſtianity. For, ſince the <hi>Hieroſolymitane Talmud</hi> was not (by the Confeſſion even of the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves) began till one hundred ſixty two years after the Deſtruction of both <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and its <hi>Temple,</hi> and conſequently fifteen years at leaſt after the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which happened (as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> would have it) under <hi>Caracalla,</hi> Aſſaſſinated on the eighth of <hi>April,</hi> in the year 217. ſeventy nine years after the firſt littering of the pretended <hi>Sibylline</hi> Writings; that the compilation of the <hi>Babylonian Talmud</hi> began not, till the 476. year after the final De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Temple,</hi> that is to ſay, in the year of our <hi>Lord,</hi> 546. that it took up an hundred years to finiſh it, that theſe two <hi>Collections</hi> were made by the implacable enemies of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and its Truth, ſuch as have thruſt together, without either ſincerity, or judgment, all the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106901:73"/>
Extravagancies, that ever troubled the Brains of their <hi>Anceſtours, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over</hi> (as themſelves) <hi>into a reprobate ſence;</hi> and that their Opinions concerning the <hi>State of the dead</hi> hold correſpondence, neither with the Sentiment of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> nor with that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor laſtly with that, which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> holds at preſent; there cannot with reaſon any certa in relyance be made thereon.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That to no purpoſe is alledged the ſeventeenth <hi>Verſe</hi> of the fourth <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Tobit,</hi> which runs thus, <hi>Pour out thy Bread</hi> (the old <hi>Latine Verſion,</hi> made according to the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> adds <hi>and thy Wine) on the Burial of the Juſt, but give nothing to the wicked:</hi> becauſe, <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is not manifeſt, that there ever was really ſuch a man as <hi>Tobit,</hi> and that the <hi>Relation</hi> of his Adventures ſmell (as much as may be) of a <hi>Romance. Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well <hi>Antient,</hi> as <hi>Modern,</hi> have not attributed any authority thereto. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That all the <hi>Greek Fathers</hi> unanimouſly, and many of the <hi>Latine,</hi> have held it to be <hi>Apocryphal. Fourthly,</hi> That though of all the <hi>Canonical</hi> Books it were the moſt <hi>Canonical,</hi> yet neither ought the words alledged out of it to be taken <hi>literally,</hi> ſince they are notoriouſly <hi>figurative,</hi> nor could they have any relation to the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> either of <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>making Offerings for the Dead;</hi> but, according to the uſe of <hi>Funeral Entertainments,</hi> or <hi>Banquets,</hi> ordained, not to procure eaſe to the Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but to relieve the kindred he had left, to induce them to an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion of their mourning, and to comfort them. For, as the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> threatning the <hi>Jews</hi> with the Judgment of God, which was likely to deprive them of all means of comforting one another, ſaid, <note n="a" place="margin">Jer. xvi. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Neither ſhall men break Bread for them in mourning to comfort them for the Dead; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall men give them the Cup of conſolation to drink for their Father, or for their Mother;</hi> ſo <hi>Tobit,</hi> exhorting his Son to the <hi>Offices</hi> of Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his afflicted Brethren, orders him to <hi>Pour out his Bread, and his Wine on the Burial of the dead,</hi> and (by a kind of ſpeaking) to <hi>fill</hi> it, by kindly treating thoſe, that were in mourning, upon their accompt, and raiſing them out of their Heavineſs; which does not inferr either <hi>Prayer,</hi> or <hi>Offering,</hi> for the <hi>dead;</hi> but onely a charitable care, and tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>living.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That the words of the <hi>Son of Sirach,</hi> in the thirty third <hi>Verſe</hi> of the ſeventh <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, A gift hath grace in the ſight of every man Living, and for the Dead detain it not,</hi> make nothing to the Buſineſs of <hi>Offerings,</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> for the Dead, to which ſome would have them relate: in as much as that <hi>Authour,</hi> who made his <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>Sentences</hi> in the year 247. before the <hi>Birth</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> is ſo far from ſaying, that the <hi>gift,</hi> which was to be given upon the accompt <hi>of the dead,</hi> was to be exerciſed towards the departed Perſon himſelf, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declares, it was ſo done <hi>upon the accompt of the dead,</hi> that it referred, as to its proper object, to the ſurviving, adding in the next verſe, <note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 34.</note> 
                        <hi>Fail not to be with them, that weep, and mourn with them, that mourn;</hi> as if he ſaid, <q>That that <hi>kindneſs,</hi> which he deſired ſhould not be <hi>detained for the dead,</hi> conſiſts not in <hi>praying for the dead;</hi> but in having a <hi>ſympathy</hi> for their affliction, who bewail him, and endeavouring to comfort them. Beſides it is to be noted by the way, that the Book of <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticus</hi>
                        </q> (though very antient, ſince it was written 247. years before the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106901:74"/>
                        <hi>Birth</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and very full of good <hi>Doctrine,</hi> upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt it hath been cited by the <hi>Fathers)</hi> was never enrolled among the <hi>Canonical Books,</hi> neither by the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor by any of the <hi>Greek Fathers,</hi> nor by moſt of the <hi>Latines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That there cannot be a clearer Evidence, to convince thoſe of Errour, who ſuppoſe that the Cuſtom of <hi>Praying for the Dead</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently among the <hi>Jews,</hi> then to urge, that there is not the leaſt track of it in thoſe, who were Contemporary with the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> viz. <hi>Philo,</hi> who had made himſelf <hi>Maſter</hi> of all prophane Wiſdom, and the Philoſophy of <hi>Plato,</hi> and who was (in <hi>Caligula</hi>'s Time) reputed the <hi>Glory of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who was one of the chief <hi>Commanders</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> War under <hi>Nero,</hi> and the moſt diligent ſearcher into the <hi>Antiquities</hi> of his Nation under <hi>Domitian.</hi> So that the later <hi>Jews</hi> muſt needs have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the Cuſtom they ſtill continue, either from ſome piece of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh</hi> ſuperſtition, or from the <hi>Opinions</hi> crept into <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> through their means, who were admirers of the pretended <hi>Sibylline</hi> Writing.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That the ſecond Book of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> was neither known, nor of any accompt among the <hi>Jews.</hi> For, as it is manifeſt, that it hath no coherence with the firſt, neither in reſpect of the obſervations of time, nor in reſpect of events, and their circumſtances; ſo we both may, and ought to hold it for certain, that <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who very ſtrictly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the firſt, either had not any knowledg of it, or (if he had) made no accompt of it; ſince that even when it was his buſineſs to repreſent ſome <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> whereof there was alſo a relation in that Book, he hath <hi>not onely</hi> related it according to his own way; but hath often laid it down in circumſtances, as to the matter of fact, incompatible with what was reported thereof in the ſaid Book. Whereto may be added the <hi>ſtrange obſcurity</hi> of it: which is ſuch, that it is not known, neither <hi>who</hi> they were, nor about <hi>what Time</hi> flouriſhed either <hi>Jaſon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian,</hi> the firſt <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour;</hi> or the <hi>Abbreviator,</hi> who reduced into a ſmall <hi>Epitome</hi> the <hi>five Books</hi> of <hi>Jaſon;</hi> nor yet in what Language <hi>Jaſon</hi> had firſt writ them; nor whether he was more antient, then <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who finiſhed his Work <hi>Of the Antiquities,</hi> in the year of our <hi>Lord</hi> 94. concurrent with the thirteenth of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and the fourty fourth before the <hi>Forgeries</hi> of the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit <hi>Sibyl</hi> appeared; nor laſtly, whether that Abridgment came betimes into the hands of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> it appearing not, that any of them had ſeen it before the year of our <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Seventhly, That it is abſolutely impoſſible, that any of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>ſecond, third,</hi> and <hi>fourth Ages,</hi> ſhould, in their <hi>Prayers for the dead,</hi> have propoſed to themſelves, for a Pattern, the Example of <hi>Judas Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabaeus,</hi> and the Judgment, which either <hi>Jaſon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian,</hi> or his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridger</hi> made of it.

                     <p>Fourthly, Beſides the precedent Reaſons which demonſtrate the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of deriving the Original of <hi>Oblations</hi> and <hi>Prayers for departed</hi> Chriſtians, from the pretended Example of <hi>Judas Maccabaeus,</hi> and the Application which the Abridger of <hi>Jaſon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian</hi> conceived he ought to make of it; this (no leſs conſiderable then the reſt) is to be added, <hi>viz.</hi> that the firſt, who undertook the Patronage of ſuch a <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> built very much upon the not-written <hi>Tradition</hi> onely, and by that means, acknowledged, and profeſſed, that neither they, nor (in their Judgment) their <hi>Predeceſſours,</hi> had any ground to recurr to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any Scripture, either properly, or improperly ſaid to be <hi>Canonical;</hi> and conſequently, that their imagination is abſolutely Erroneous, who believe that the <hi>Antients</hi> grounded their <hi>Cuſtom</hi> on the fourth of <hi>Tobit,</hi> or on the ſeventh of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus;</hi> or laſtly, on the twelfth of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Maccabees.</hi> Thus <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in the year 199. in the third <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Book <hi>De Corona,</hi> tells us, <hi>Quaramus an &amp; Traditio,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let us enquire, whether the not-written Tradition is not alſo to be received?

                        <hi>Hoc modo meum quiddam puerile,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nay, there did alſo ſlip from my ſelf ſome ſhew of childiſhneſs that way; but I repreſſed it by the diſcretion of a man, and held my peace. Nor did we think fit to ſolemnize that</hi> Funeral <hi>with weeping, and howling Complaints; becauſe ſuch demonſtrations of ſorrow are wont to deplore the misfortune, or, as it were, utter deſtruction of thoſe, who dy miſerably: whereas ſhe neither died miſerably, nor indeed died at all, as we were aſsured, both by her true faith, and exemplar Life, and by other certain Reaſons. What was then the cauſe, why inwardly this Green Wound did ſo extremely grieve me; but onely the ſudden breaking off of that Cuſtom, which I had to live in her moſt ſweet, and moſt dear converſation,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Becauſe therefore I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſo great a comfort, my Soul was wounded, and my life was, as it were, torn in pieces, which, till then, had conſiſted of mine, and hers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And, becauſe I was very much troubled, that theſe humane reſpects had ſuch power over me; which yet cannot but ſometime happen, according to the courſe of nature, and our condition, I bewailed my former Grief, and was afflicted with a double ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He reſented then, it ſeems (by his own confeſſion) two different Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: one, the <hi>Principal,</hi> occaſioned by the regret of his <hi>loſs;</hi> the other <hi>acceſſary,</hi> ariſing from the regret he conceived to ſee himſelf ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that humane Infirmity of bewailing a dead perſon; and <hi>all the day</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>he could think of nothing elſe, though he endeavoured, as much as lay in his power, to conceal it.</hi> After the <hi>Solemnity</hi> was over, he went to the <hi>Bath;</hi> hoping to rid himſelf of his Grief by diverſion: but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned alſo thence as much afflicted, as before; the <hi>ſmart</hi> of his Wound admitting no remiſſion, till he had ſlept. And then, having with a greater ſettledneſs of Spirit, called to minde the whole <hi>Life</hi> of his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and being expoſed to the ſight of none, but <hi>God</hi> onely, he gave way to thoſe <hi>Tears,</hi> which he had all day, with much violence to himſelf, kept
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106901:93"/>
in; ſaying, <hi>Libuit flere in conſpectu tuo de illa, &amp; pro illa; de me, &amp; pro me: &amp; dimiſi lachrymas, quas continebam, ut effluerent quantum vellent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I took pleaſure to weep in thy ſight concerning her, and for her; and concerning my ſelf, and for my ſelf: and to thoſe Tears, which I had formerly repreſſed, I gave the liberty to run their full Carriere,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems, with ſome Pretenſe concluſible from the foregoing words, that he was troubled about the Condition his <hi>Mother</hi> might be in; but there are <hi>Two</hi> things oblige us to believe the contrary.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That, if he had been inſtructed in the Belief of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> taught by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> he could not, without a kinde of injury to <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> have delayed, till he had ſlept, the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of his <hi>Lamentations,</hi> and <hi>Tears,</hi> for the eaſe, and relief of a Perſon ſo dear; and ſpent the whole Day in <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> and <hi>Divertiſements,</hi> which he thought might have disburthened him of his Grief, but proved <hi>ineffectual.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> That, conſidering with himſelf, that his action might be thought <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> he accuſes it, upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, that he thinks himſelf obliged to excuſe it; ſaying, <hi>Legat, qui volet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let him read it, who will, and interpret it, as pleaſeth him; and, if he think it a ſin in me, to have bewailed my Mother for a ſmall part of an hour (that Mother, I ſay, who was dead to my eyes, and had wept for me ſo many years, that before thine eyes I might live) let him not deride me, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (if he be full of Charity) let him weep for my Sins to Thee, who art the Father of all the Brethren of thy</hi> Chriſt <hi>our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. If the <hi>Opinion</hi> of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> had been, at that Time, crept into the <hi>Church;</hi> who could, with any Juſtice, either have accuſed him of having done amiſs in deploring, with unfeigned ſorrow, and tears, the hard Condition of his <hi>Mother,</hi> confined (whether for a ſhort, or a long time, it matters not) in a place of <hi>Torments?</hi> or excuſe him, that he had not,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Bethought him, aſſoon as ever the Breath was out of her Body, to aſſiſt her with his <hi>Suffrages,</hi> and quitted all other kinde of <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That (when it came into his minde to diſcharge that ſad Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) he had beſtowed but a <hi>ſmall part of an hour</hi> in the Exerciſe of an <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> then which there could not be any of greater Concernment to her, to whom he ought his <hi>Life,</hi> and (under <hi>God)</hi> his <hi>Converſion?</hi> Would the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which approves of the Reitoration of the <hi>Service of the Dead</hi> for hundreds of years for the ſame Perſon, think it <hi>rational</hi> at the preſent, that any one of her children ſhould promiſe himſelf the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Friends in the turning of a man's Hand, and at ſo eaſie a rate, as a <hi>ſhort Prayer,</hi> or the weeping of a <hi>quarter</hi> of an <hi>hour</hi> amounts to?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he had not been able to forbear ſpending ſome part of that little time, which he had deſigned for his <hi>Tears,</hi> in fruitleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailings of his own loſs; expreſſing the reſentment he had conceived thereof by theſe words, <hi>I took a pleaſure to weep concerning my ſelf, and for my ſelf;</hi> as if it had been ſeaſonable, even at the very Time, that he was (as is pretended) to repreſent to himſelf the extraordinaty <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi> of his <hi>Mother,</hi> to look another way, and make any reflection on his own concernments?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he did not (for ought appears to us) engage himſelf,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106901:93"/>
to any kinde of continuance, of either his <hi>Devotions,</hi> or his <hi>Tears,</hi> which he had kept in from the beginning, with a certain violence; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an indignation, that the <hi>frailty</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> tempted him to ſhed them? Is it ſuitable to the <hi>Maxims</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Practice</hi> of thoſe of her <hi>Communion</hi> for ſome <hi>Ages</hi> paſt; that a Childe, not without ſome trouble induced, either to bewail the miſery of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or to beg his deliverance out of it, ſhunning the performance of his <hi>Duty,</hi> aſſoon as he were obliged, ſhould forbear applying any remedy thereto? Yet is this the manner of proceeding, which, it ſeems, may be objected to St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> He had ſtay'd till the Night after his <hi>Mother</hi>'s Death, e're he beſet himſelf, either to do his <hi>Devotions,</hi> or <hi>Weep</hi> on her behalf; he ſpent in that <hi>Exerciſe</hi> but a <hi>ſmall part of an hour,</hi> and never (that we could hear of) offered to reiterate it that Night, or the next Day, or the days enſuing, but abſolutely gave over, as if he had, with one word ſpeaking, diſcharged all his <hi>Duty.</hi> And to repreſent his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more truly, and naturally, I have uſed ſeveral Expreſſions, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to him, either <hi>Vows,</hi> or <hi>Devotions,</hi> or <hi>Tears;</hi> in as much as theſe words, <hi>I took a pleaſure to weep concerning her, and for her,</hi> do not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie, <hi>I took a pleaſure to pray for her;</hi> but may bear this ſence, <hi>I have wept for her ſake,</hi> and deplored <hi>for her:</hi> not onely that ſhe is Dead, but that ſhe was forced to ſubmit to the neceſſity of Dying, e're ſhe had come near <hi>Old Age, viz.</hi> in her fifty ſixth year: <hi>Secondly,</hi> That ſhe died out of her <hi>Country;</hi> and, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Without any hope of being diſpoſed into the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> ſhe had prepared for her ſelf at <hi>Tagaſte.</hi> For, as all theſe Accidents were prejudicial to him, ſo might they well occaſion <hi>Tears,</hi> yet he, that ſhed them, not be engaged to pray for her; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Contraries,</hi> I ſee no more Reaſon to conclude, <hi>He wept for his Mother,</hi> therefore, <hi>He prayed for her,</hi> then that, when we read, that St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> adviſes in ſeveral places to <hi>mourn</hi> for the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens,</hi> who died in their Ignorance, any one ſhould thence think to conclude, that he (contrary to the intention of the <hi>Church)</hi> ordered, that men ſhould expiate their <hi>Crimes</hi> by <hi>Tears,</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> that is to ſay, vainly attempt what is impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that moſt <hi>Divines,</hi> as well <hi>Antient,</hi> as <hi>Modern,</hi> acknowledg that <hi>David</hi> wept for his Son <hi>Abſalon,</hi> and that ſo much the more bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in as much as his affliction was (in his judgment, at leaſt) beyond all conſolation; ſince that unhappy Parricide, purſued by the Wrath of <hi>God,</hi> and taken away by a violent Death, ſuitable to his <hi>Crime,</hi> was not capable of any aſſiſtance, either by his Prayers, or otherwiſe.

To give this laſt <hi>Conſideration</hi> its full Weight, and to raiſe it to an higher Pitch of <hi>Evidence,</hi> I am onely to produce what he adds immediately after, faſtening his <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> to the Time, when he Writ his <hi>Confeſsions.</hi>

                        <hi>Ego autem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But (now my heart being recovered of that Wound, for which it might be blamed of a carnal affection) I pour out to thee, O our God, in the behalf of that thy Servant, a kinde of Tears far different; which flow from a contrite Spirit, out of a conſideration of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of every ſoul, that dies in</hi> Adam.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Night between the Fourth, and the Fifth, he wept <hi>concerning her,</hi> and <hi>for her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That in the year 389. (according to the <hi>Obſervation</hi> we have of his own, in his <hi>Retractations)</hi> he writ his <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> which he there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges compoſed after his <hi>Queſtions</hi> dedicated to <hi>Simplicianus,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Milan;</hi> and who, (according to the Antient Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Ordinations)</hi> could not, before <hi>Sunday, April</hi> the twelfth, the day of <hi>Quaſi-modo,</hi> have taken the place of St. <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> who departed this World on <hi>Eaſter-Eve, April</hi> the fourth, 397.</p>
                     <p>And whereas, after he had dried up his firſt <hi>Tears;</hi> and <hi>recovered of the Wound of his Heart,</hi> whereof he had been his own accuſer, in the beginning of the tenth year after his <hi>Mother</hi>'s Death, he thought good to open <hi>another</hi> Source of <hi>Tears;</hi> propoſing to himſelf, with a compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Spirit, his deceaſed <hi>Mother</hi> expoſed to ſome danger; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that it were neither juſt, nor becoming the reſpect we ow his <hi>Bleſſed Memory,</hi> uncircumſpectly to impute to him what the <hi>Poet</hi> ſaid of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Love,</hi> that <hi>ſibi ſomnia fingunt;</hi> as if this <hi>Great Man,</hi> merely to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> his <hi>Wit,</hi> coud have taken pleaſure in imagining <hi>Accidents</hi> without any occaſion, and feigning (eſpecially ſpeaking to God) what was not; Let us ſee how far his <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> may agree with his own <hi>Principles,</hi> and forbearing to interpoſe our Judgment in what concerns his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding) be content to receive it from himſelf, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to ſubmit to his own <hi>Rules.</hi>

                     <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, it is manifeſt, he admitted but two <hi>Receptacles</hi> for the <hi>Souls,</hi> that had left their <hi>Bodies;</hi> for thus he determines, in the tenth <hi>Treatiſe</hi> upon the <hi>Firſt Epiſtle</hi> according to St. <hi>John; Ille, qui vixit, &amp; morticus eſt, rapitur ad alia loca anima ipſius; corpus ipſius ponitur in terra: an fian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> illa verba, an non fiant, non ad eam pertinet; tamen aliud agit, aliud patitur; aut in ſinu</hi> Abrahae <hi>gaudet, aut in igne aeterno aquae modicum deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is not poſſible, he ſhould have thought his <hi>Mother,</hi> after her Departure, any where, but in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Boſom;</hi> ſince he thought <hi>it not fit to celebrate her</hi> Funeral <hi>with Tears;</hi> that he was of this <hi>Opinion,</hi> that ſhe <hi>could not die miſerably,</hi> or, rather, that ſhe <hi>could not die at all;</hi> that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that <note n="e" place="margin">Illa in <hi>Chriſto</hi> viviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sic vixit, ut laude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur nomen Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in ſide, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribúsque ejus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sepoſitis ejus bonis actibus, pro quibus tibi, gaudens, gratias ago, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Scio miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diter operatam, &amp; ex corde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſiſſe debita debitoribus ſuis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>being quickened, and renewed in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>ſhe had ſo lived, as that the Name of God had been praiſed both in her Belief, and Life;</hi> that he thought himſelf obliged <hi>to give God Thanks with Joy for her good actions;</hi> that he numbered her <hi>among the Children of God, and Inhabitants of the Heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, who have the privilege to <hi>anſwer the Accuſer, that their Debts are diſcharged,</hi> and who have <hi>done works of Mercy,</hi> and have <hi>freely from their hearts forgiven their Debtours.</hi>

But what moved him, after ſo long time, to make ſuch earneſt, and particular <hi>requeſts</hi> for his <hi>Mother,</hi> who had always, from her Infancy, been an <hi>Example</hi> of a rare, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Virtue; and who had been enflamed with ſo great Zeal for Piety, that ſhe had <hi>gained to the Lord</hi> her whole <hi>Houſe;</hi> not to ſay ought of his <hi>Father,</hi> who had been a man of a turbulent Humour, and ſo little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> that he could not be won to embrace <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> till towards his laſt days?

I anſwer, that St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who hath given ſuch a particular accompt of the different <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> of his <hi>Parents,</hi> could not have fallen into ſo great an Errour, as to imagine his <hi>Prayers</hi> more neceſſary for his <hi>Mother,</hi> then for his <hi>Father;</hi> who, having been leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable, ſhould ſeem to ſtand in greateſt need thereof; and that he was induced to make particular <hi>Addreſſes</hi> for his <hi>Mother,</hi> was not (as might be imagined) out of any compliance with the general <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of his Time, which being of equal Obligation towards all) would as well have obliged him to ſpeak of his <hi>Father,</hi> as to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Mother;</hi> but in obedience to the command, which his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> had, expiring, lay'd upon him, and the deſire he had to ſubmit to her <hi>laſt Will,</hi> whereof he would rather be an <hi>Executour,</hi> then a <hi>Cenſour.</hi> This deſire, I ſay, prevailing with him, above all other <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> he not onely thought it a kinde of <hi>pleaſure to weep for her,</hi> the night after her Departure, but nine years after, engaging himſelf to Write the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> thereof, and to give an accompt of her <hi>laſt Words.</hi> Which the more fully to ſatisfy, he gave way to a tenderneſs ſo great, as if he repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to himſelf in ſome danger, that he might accordingly addreſs to <hi>God</hi> the ſame <hi>Supplications,</hi> as might be made for thoſe, who were ſtill engaged in the <hi>Combats</hi> of this Life; though he confeſſed withall, they

                     <p>Firſt, That this Holy <hi>Prelate,</hi> expreſſing that he conſidered not his <hi>prayers</hi> for <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who died a <hi>Catechumen,</hi> but a Perſon very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and truly inclined to Piety, as an <hi>Office,</hi> whereof he ſtood in need; but as a ſimple Effect of his <hi>good Wiſhes,</hi> manifeſtly diſcovers, that not any one of the Faithfull, <hi>departed in the Lord,</hi> ſtands in any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the <hi>ſuffrages</hi> of the ſurviving; and accordingly, that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> who believe, that, in matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> nothing ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted without the expreſs order of God himſelf, ſpeaking in his <hi>Word,</hi> cannot be accompted <hi>criminals</hi> for their declining an act, which is not (even in their Judgment, who practiſed it) of any neceſſity, or any way beneficial to thoſe, for whom the voluntary devotion, or <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> of men deſigns it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who calls the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> celebrated in memory of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and, upon his occaſion, a <hi>Preſent,</hi> which he makes his Friend, and by which he requites him, could not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it to be either the <hi>Body of the Son of God,</hi> or the <hi>Offering-up</hi> of that Body, or, in general, <hi>a Propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> properly ſo called.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106901:117"/>
kindneſs we can do them, ſo as that we might ſay, with St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that, <hi>at leaſt, by that Preſent we requite them?</hi> It ſeems then he pretended not to do what the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> thinks to do at this day in the <hi>Maſſes</hi> of <hi>Requiem.</hi> For ſhe profeſſes to preſent the <hi>Oblation</hi> ſhe makes therein, whatever it may be, not to the deceaſed, for whom ſhe prays; but onely to God, for, or on the behalf of the deceaſed. She conceives al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that her <hi>Hoſt,</hi> which ſhe believes to be <hi>properly,</hi> and <hi>really</hi> the Body of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> ſurpaſſes in value, not onely our <hi>Prayers;</hi> but what ever is moſt excellent, either in <hi>Earth,</hi> or in <hi>Heaven,</hi> among the <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> of the glorified <hi>Saints.</hi> And though ſhe, who cannot endure the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> becauſe they are unwilling to ſubmit their Conſciences to any other <hi>Rule,</hi> then that of <hi>Faith,</hi> contained in the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> hath born in her Boſom, and ſuffered unreproved thoſe inconſiderate Children, who have had the boldneſs to write that the <hi>ſolemn Sacrifice might be offered to Creatures;</hi> As when the <hi>Authour</hi> of the great <hi>Chronicle</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> thruſt in this into his <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> that, on the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October, 1467.

                     <p>But the <hi>Proceeding</hi> of the preſent <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who triumphs ſo much upon theſe <hi>Paſſages,</hi> whereby ſhe pretends to draw St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to her ſide, is ſo much the more unjuſt towards him; the more ſhe preſumes on the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> who does not onely not ſay any thing as to what ſhe would have him, but <hi>abſolutely</hi> deſtroys it, in as much, as he ſpeaks of a <hi>Fire,</hi> which ſome <hi>feel</hi> even in <hi>this</hi> Life, and others <hi>after</hi> it. Whence it follows, that his Imagination reached no further, then a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical,</hi> and <hi>Intentional Fire,</hi> which may be felt, even during the <hi>Life of this Body;</hi> whereas the <hi>Romane Church</hi> ſuppoſes a <hi>real,</hi> and <hi>material</hi> one, which <hi>burns</hi> not the living, but <hi>torments the ſpirits of the Departed.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, That, treading, as it were, upon <hi>Thorns,</hi> he is not over-ready to give us any thing for certain; but entertains us with a ſimple <hi>Conjecture;</hi> which might be brought to Queſtion, whether it were ſo, or not: which alſo he but ſlightly advances; as finding it not contributary to ought Impious, yet without impoſing any neceſſity to admit it, and which, in fine, he lets paſs under a <hi>Whether,</hi> an <hi>It may be,</hi> a <hi>Peradventure:</hi> ſo that, not preſuming himſelf to approve it, all the kindneſs he hath for it, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in his telling us, that he does <hi>not diſallow it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That the <hi>very</hi> thing, which he propoſes ſo doubtfully, may be adjuſted to the <hi>Opinion,</hi> which the moſt <hi>Antient</hi> had had of the <hi>general Conflagration</hi> of the <hi>Univerſe</hi> at the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>World:</hi> whoſe Imagination it was, that it ſhould ſerve as a general <hi>Luſtration,</hi> through which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the <hi>Saints,</hi> even that of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> were to paſs, and who reflected on nothing leſs, then the <hi>Purgatory,</hi> propoſed to us at this day.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That, though he ſhould aſſure us, that that <hi>certain Fire of Grief,</hi> whereof he ſpeaks, ſhall be a <hi>material Fire,</hi> that it ſhall <hi>burn</hi> the <hi>Spirits</hi> of men, and that the <hi>Torment,</hi> which they ſhall endure thereby, ſhall afflict them from their departure out of the Bodies, they had caſt off: yet ſhould not his aſſurance be of greater weight to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi>

So that, to make good the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe againſt the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is ſufficient, if I maintain,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That ſhe hath nothing expreſly affirmed on the behalf of her <hi>Purgatory</hi> among the <hi>Latines,</hi> before <hi>Gregory the Firſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, That that onely reflection may give the more ſimple, light enough to comprehend, that that Point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> being ſo new, that it <hi>was</hi> not known for the ſpace of <hi>ſix Ages</hi> together even among the <hi>Doctours</hi> of the <hi>Weſtern Church,</hi> who have not, neither any one of them in particular, nor all together, anything determinate, to induce the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it, and juſtifie that they had received it, can by no means be an <hi>Article of Faith.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>ALl this thus preſuppoſed, as it may well be, in as much as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reſult from it is, that that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Part of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which <hi>prayed for the dead,</hi> had not any thought of either the <hi>Purgatory,</hi> where the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, that they burn, or their deliverance out of that grievous Pain; but intended onely to deſire of God, that he would be pleaſed to pardon their Sins at the day of his Son's Laſt coming, deliver them from the <hi>general Conflagration</hi> of the World, and give their Bodies a <hi>glorious Reſurrection;</hi> it remains to diſcover, what may have been their intention, who have ordered their <hi>Friends</hi> to be Buried near the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> or, at leaſt, in the <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>Edifices dedicated,</hi> ſince the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to their <hi>Memory.</hi> To proceed in a more certain order, and take things at their proper <hi>Sources,</hi> I obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (no more, then the <hi>Jews)</hi> had not, at the beginning, any common <hi>Cemiteries,</hi> or <hi>Church-yards,</hi> but that every one made choice of ſuch place for his <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> as he thought fit, and, that it was thus, the moſt <hi>antient Monuments</hi> yet remaining among us give ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>Teſtimony.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, That as among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain particular Places of <hi>Sepulture</hi> for thoſe of the ſame <hi>Family;</hi> ſo the reſentments of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fraternity, whereby all the <hi>Saints</hi> make up <note n="b" place="margin">Epheſ. ii. 19.</note>

                     <p>Fourthly, That the <hi>Church,</hi> during the rigour of the <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> having been forced to Aſſemble to ſerve God <hi>before day,</hi> and to ſeek the ſafety of her Children in the ſilence of the <hi>Night,</hi> and the <hi>Solitudes</hi> of <hi>Cemiteries,</hi> Places not onely of no great ſhew, but ſuch as were (if the Scituation permitted it) for the moſt part, under <hi>Ground,</hi> as the <hi>Catatumbs</hi> about <hi>Rome,</hi> and could not (upon that accompt) give any <hi>Jealouſie</hi> to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> the <hi>Faithfull,</hi> who were there daily animated to <hi>Conſtancy</hi> by the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> of their <hi>Paſtours,</hi> and the ſight of the <hi>Tombs,</hi> which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered

                        <hi>Elizeus</hi> was heretofore ſo aſſiſted by the Almighty power of the God of Glory, that a dead Carkaſe, <hi>caſt</hi> by thoſe that carried it <hi>into his Grave,</hi> without any other Deſign, then that to rid themſelves of a trouble, which might have retarded their Flight, <hi>recovered Life, as ſoon as it had touched his bones;</hi> ſo, according to the <hi>Opinion,</hi> as well of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> as <hi>Paulinus,</hi> the Bodies of <hi>Martyrs</hi> were endued with a certain <hi>Virtue,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Sanctified,</hi> and <hi>Purged</hi> the <hi>Things,</hi> that were placed near them. We cannot at this day affirm, whether St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did, or did not change his <hi>Opinion;</hi> but we are obliged to obſerve by the way what there is in it, that is inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nay indeed unmaintainable, ſince that it preſuppoſed, that from the body of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> beheaded at <hi>Milan,</hi> the eighth of <hi>May,</hi> 303. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Maximian,</hi> and from that time, ſhut up in a <hi>Tomb,</hi> the Blood ſhould, eighty years after, iſſue out in ſuch quantity, as to <hi>penetrate the Ground all about,</hi> and <hi>moiſten the body of</hi> Satyrus, though encloſed alſo in his <hi>Grave,</hi> and communicate its Virtue to him. But, if beheaded Bodies muſt neceſſarily be Bloodleſs, and, if that Blood be naturally fixed into a conſiſtency, as ſoon as it is iſſued out of the Veins, what poſſibility was there in the Suppoſition, which St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> made of that, which Saint <hi>Victor</hi> had ſpilt eighty years before, repreſenting it onely liquid, but ſtreaming in ſuch quantity, as might <hi>penetrate the adjacent Ground?</hi> And, if it be pretended, he grounded it on the Conception of ſome <hi>Miracle,</hi> whence did he derive it, unleſs from his own voluntary Devotion, or Will-worſhip, which inclined him to believe, as actually exiſtent, what he thought poſſible to the power of God?</p>
                     <p>Beſides this inconvenience, whereto the <hi>Opinion</hi> of St. <hi>Paulinus,</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Epitaph</hi> of <hi>Celſus,</hi> lies open, and that the more expreſly, the more likely it is, he conceived, or pretended to conceive, that, from the Bodies of <hi>Juſtus,</hi> and <hi>Paſtor,</hi> who had their Throats cut, and conſequently

But upon what grounded? What place of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> can be produced to Authoriſe the Advice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Accordingly, the ſame <hi>Paulinus,</hi> to let us know that he found not himſelf any way ſatisfied with either of thoſe two Preſuppoſitions, with much confidence, and aſſeveration, acknowledged, that he was yet to be adviſed therein in the year 419. wherein two freſh Accidents, to wit, the <hi>Interrment</hi> of <hi>Flora</hi>'s Son, and that of <hi>Cynegius,</hi> a young man, who had, at his Death, required, that his <hi>Body</hi> might be Buried in the <hi>Church</hi> of Saint <hi>Felix</hi> of <hi>Nola,</hi> had reduced him to confeſs his Perplexity.

                     <head>CHAP. XLVIII. The <hi>Sentiment</hi> of <hi>St. Auguſtine,</hi> concerning the Burial of the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> in <hi>Churches</hi> enquired into.</head>
                     <p>SAint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his Treatiſe, <hi>De cura pro mortuis,</hi> to give greater ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to his <note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Paulinus,</hi> mentioned in the precedent <hi>Chapter.</hi>
                        </note> Brother, lays down, that the Care, which is taken of the dead Body, the manner of <hi>Sepulture,</hi> and the Funeral <hi>Solemnities,</hi> are rather <hi>Alleviations</hi> of the grief of the <hi>Living,</hi> then of <note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 2. ex lib. 1. <hi>De Civit. Dei,</hi> cap. 12.</note> any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, or <hi>benefit to the Dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the <note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 3.</note> care taken of the Funeral, and the choice of the place for Burial, are <hi>Effects of the Piety</hi> of the ſurviving towards the <hi>Dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the <note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 4, 5.</note> advantage, which may be drawn from the <hi>Interrment</hi> of the deceaſed Perſon in the <hi>Church</hi> of ſome <hi>Saint,</hi> can be no other, then that of <hi>recommending</hi> him more commodiouſly, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately to the <hi>Saint, as</hi> to a kinde of <hi>Patron;</hi> that that <hi>Office</hi> might be done to the deceaſed Party, though his Body were not preſent in the ſame place, and that the <hi>Sepulture</hi> of it in the ſame place, is to no other end, then to excite a deſire, and affection to pray for him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That <note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 10.</note> what is ſaid of the <hi>Viſions</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> is to be underſtood in the ſame manner, as we do the Dreams we have of thoſe, who are yet alive, and think not in the leaſt of what the Imagination of the ſuch as are aſleep attribute to them, <note n="f" place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> as when <hi>Evodius,</hi> afterwards <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Uzalis,</hi> dreamed, that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſhewed him the ſence of a Paſſage in <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>Rhetorick;</hi> and when <note n="g" place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Curmas Curialis</hi> dreamed of the death of <hi>Curmas</hi> the <hi>Lock-Smith,</hi> and imagined, that he ſaw St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of his City, exhorting him to receive <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That the <note n="h" place="margin">Cap. 13.</note> Souls of the <hi>Departed</hi> neither know, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves about what is done here; that if they did, St. <hi>Monica,</hi> his Mother, would often diſcourſe with him, and God himſelf would not have ſaid of his children, whom he calleth hence, before he exerciſes his Judgments on thoſe which remain, that he calls them, <hi>Leſt they might ſee Evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That the <note n="i" place="margin">Cap. 15.</note> Souls <hi>Departed</hi> may know ſomewhat that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>Living,</hi> either from the report of ſuch as <hi>Die,</hi> or from that of <hi>Angels,</hi> or by <hi>Revelation</hi> from God.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, That the perſwaſion, which we have of the aſſiſtance given by the <hi>Martyrs</hi> to thoſe, who implore it, may be taken in the ſame ſence, as that, which the <hi>Living</hi> have of aſſiſting the <hi>Dead</hi> by their <hi>Prayers,</hi> though they know not any thing in particular of their Condition, and onely deſire of God for them, and on their behalf, Grace, and Reſt: Or that of the aſſiſtances, which the <hi>Living</hi> think they receive from them, there may be made the ſame Judgment, as of the <hi>Opinion,</hi> which the People of <hi>Nola</hi> had of the Apparition of St. <hi>Felix,</hi> during the time they were beſieged by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> or <note n="k" place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> of the Promiſe,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106901:127"/>
which <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> made, to ſhew himſelf the <hi>Night</hi> following to a certain Woman, who thought ſhe really ſaw him, though he ſtirred not from the place, where he was.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, That we muſt not be overy-ready, upon the clamours of <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> complaining, that they are <hi>tormented</hi> by the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> to infer, that the <hi>Martyrs</hi> have in Effect <hi>tormented</hi> them, ſince that in the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Saints, Gervaſius,</hi> and <hi>Protaſius,</hi> they ſaid as much of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> then living, who yet never attributed to himſelf any thing of what they imputed to him.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, That in fine, <note n="l" place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> what may be thought of the <hi>Sepulture</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the <hi>Departed,</hi> is, that it is an <hi>Office</hi> of Humanity towards them, and not any aſſiſtance, and that <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Oblations</hi> may be beneficial to them, if by the Life they led before, they were in a capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the benefit thereof.</p>
                     <p>From this Abridgment of the afore-ſaid <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> it is manifeſt, that that Great Man, who had been <hi>Diſciple</hi> to St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and continued even to his Death, an intimate Friend to St. <hi>Paulinus,</hi> held nothing of the <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> which thoſe two famous <hi>Prelates</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, with a kinde of Emulation, and which the later had afterwards <hi>tacitely</hi> diſacknowledged, as ſuch, as whereof he himſelf was not ſatisfied. But, though his <hi>Conceptions</hi> are much more Rational, and leſs Subject to Contradiction, yet does it not hinder, but they have this <hi>palpable Default,</hi> that he lays down as a thing confeſſed, what he might juſtly have diſputed, and what would be at this day actually denied him by the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> to wit, <hi>That he was aſſured, that there accrues a benefit to the Dead from the Prayers, and Offerings, made for them by the Living;</hi> and that the Living, have a ſufficient ground to dedicate to the Dead thoſe two <hi>Offices,</hi> and to ſuppoſe (upon Authority of the <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> which hath introduced the Exerciſe thereof into the <hi>Church)</hi> that they effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally relieve them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Julian, Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who, in the <hi>Preface</hi> of his <hi>Prognoſtick</hi> to <hi>Idalius, Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> ingenuouſly <note n="m" place="margin">De his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſolutionem, vel definitione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſenſus brevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, non valentes attingere.</note> confeſſes, that neither of them thought himſelf able to reſolve the <hi>Difficulties</hi> ariſing from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> choſe rather to follow the Track of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> then of his Maſter St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and that not without reaſon.</p>

The vertue of <hi>Sanctifying</hi> and <hi>healing Diſeaſes,</hi> without any appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Remedies operating naturally, as alſo that of <hi>driving away,</hi> and <hi>tormenting evil Spirits,</hi> does not properly, and of it ſelf, belong to any but to God alone, and is not a quality, that any nature, in it ſelf corporeal, can be affected with.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is abſolutely impoſſible, the Spirit of any Saint can be <hi>every where,</hi> as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſeems to affirm, whoſe diſcourſe therefore is to be explicated with the help of the ſame moderation, as is uſed by him, when he ſpeaks of <hi>evil ſpirits,</hi> who <hi>wandering all over the World, and that with an extraordinary ſwiftneſs, are preſent every where,</hi> to inſinuate, that ſome as well as others are every where, not in the ſame moment, but in paſſing ſucceſſively from one place to another, and in different moments: which yet (according to the judgment of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Book, <hi>De cur â pro mortuis,</hi> chap. 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) cannot be abſolutely affirmed; the Miracles attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Saints (it being granted they are true) being haply done either by Angels, or by the immediate operation of God's power, ſo as that there is no neceſſity to ſuppoſe, that the Spirits, which God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to himſelf, actually leaving their heavenly manſions, ſhould walk up and down on earth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaid, that the <hi>bones of Martyrs live,</hi> taken litterally, would imply a palpable contradiction, which we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to take away, ſaying, that (according to the ſenſe of that great <hi>Pope)</hi> the virtue, which he thought produced its effects in the preſence of the Saints bones, and when they are touched by men, though it be not in them, but in God alone, is to them, inſtead of a kind of life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What he ſays, that <hi>thoſe, who know God, who knows all things, do alſo know all things,</hi> and that <hi>having his light within them, they are not ignorant of any thing without,</hi> does ſo much the more ſtand in need of moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that, without it, it is abſolutely falſe, in the judgment even of the <note n="a" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>It might ſeem, at the firſt ſight, that all theſe Prayers in general, and every one in particular, upon this very accompt, that they ſpeak of the <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins</hi> for thoſe, who are departed this life, do preſuppoſe, if not a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> ſuch as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath imagined, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it ſome Ages ſince, at leaſt, a certain neceſſity incumbent on the deceaſed, to make ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God after their death. But we muſt neceſſarily infer the contrary. For (not to take notice that to <hi>puniſh</hi> an evil doer is not to <hi>purge</hi> him) if, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Prayers contained in the <hi>Maſs of the Dead,</hi> God <hi>forgives the ſin</hi> of the deceaſed, he does not require he ſhould be <hi>puniſhed</hi> for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he <hi>looſe the Chains,</hi> he ſuffers him not to be ſtill <hi>bound</hi> thereby; if he exerciſes towards him his <hi>mercy through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he does not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute againſt him the rigour of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> ſuch, as it is conceived, is felt by the Souls, which they pretend are to paſs through the fire of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Whence it follows, that the deſign of thoſe prayers, which deſire of God the effect of his mercy in the remiſſion of their ſins, whom he hath called hence, never was, nor could be to procure their deliverance out of the torment, which they are imagined at this day to ſuffer; and whoever would finde the true meaning thereof, is to reflect on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of thoſe, who were the firſt Authours thereof; for they held, that all thoſe, of whom they made a Commemoration, were (in as much as they were <note n="b" place="margin">Apoc. xiv. 13.</note> dead in the Lord) gathered by him into <note n="c" place="margin">Luc. xvi. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s <hi>Boſom,</hi> where they reſted in a <hi>ſleep of peace,</hi> as it is expreſly ſet down in the <hi>Memento.</hi> So that no man well-informed prayed for them, as for wretched <hi>Criminals,</hi> and ſuch as are deprived of the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which God hath prepared for his Saints, but as for <hi>Champions</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready triumphant and glorious. And yet (out of a conſideration, that the perpetuity of the bliſs, into which every one preſuppoſed them introduced, proceeded from the continuation of the mercy, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which God had at firſt beſtowed it, and that it comprehended in it ſelf the ratification of the pardon once granted to the deceaſed, in purſuance whereof they were entred into, and continued in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of celeſtial peace and joy) the ſurviving thought fit to deſire on their behalf <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> not abſolutely, as if they were ſtill under the weight of God's wrath; but upon a certain accompt, to wit, in as much as it is neceſſary, that even in Heaven the mercy of God ſhould be perpetually communicated to thoſe, whom it had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy viſited, inceſſantly aſſuring them of the free gift he had made them, firſt of his grace, and afterwards, of his glory, as believing that thoſe, who enjoy ſo great a happineſs, are nevertheleſs, to expect a more ſolemn ſentence of <hi>Remiſſion,</hi> and <hi>Abſolution,</hi> in that great Day, whereof we are all obliged, both for our ſelves, and on the behalf of our Brethren living upon Earth, and reigning in Heaven, to deſire the bleſſed coming.</p>
                     <p>In this ſence, indeed, the <hi>Antients</hi> never made any difficulty, to deſire, on the behalf of the <hi>Bleſsed</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Pardon</hi> they had already obtained, in as much as they were to obtain it again, after a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner at the <hi>Day of Judgment;</hi> whereto are particularly referred

We beſeech therefore, that the Sentence of thy Judgment may not lie heavy on him, whom the ſincere ſupplication of Chriſtian Faith recommends, but grant, that he, who, while he lived, was ſigned with the Sign of the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, may, by the aſſiſtance of thy Grace, avoid the Judgment of Vengeance.</hi> Again, <hi>Oremus, Fratres chariſſimi,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let us pray, dear Brethren, for the ſpirit of our Brother, whom the Lord God hath been pleaſed to deliver out of the ſnares of this world, whoſe body is this day put into the Ground, that the Lord would, out of his goodneſs, vouchſafe to place him in the Boſom of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>that, when the day of Judgment comes, he may be placed among the Saints and Elect, raiſed up again on the right hand.</hi> And this, taken out of the <hi>Ceremonial, Deus, cui omnia vivunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O God, to whom all things live; and to whom our bodies, though they die, periſh not, but are changed for the better, we humbly beſeech thee, that thou command, that the ſoul of thy ſervant</hi> N. <hi>be carried into the boſom of the Patriarch</hi> Abraham, <hi>by the hands of thy holy Angels, to be raiſed up again, the laſt day of the great Judgment, that what imperfections ſoever it hath, through the deceit of the Devil, contracted, thou out of thy goodneſs and compaſſion mayſt mercifully waſh away.</hi>

we recommend unto thee the ſoul of thy ſervant, and we humbly beſeech thee, O</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Saviour of the World, that thou wouldeſt not refuſe to place in the boſoms of thy</hi> Patriarchs <hi>her, for whoſe ſake thou mercifully didſt deſcend upon Earth.</hi> In the later it is ſaid, <hi>Be mindfull of him, O</hi> Lord, <hi>in the glory of thy brightneſs; let the Heavens be open to him; let the Angels rejoyce with him.</hi> Lord, <hi>receive thy Servant into thy Kingdom; Let St.</hi> Michael, <hi>the Arch-angel of God, and General of the Celeſtial Militia, entertain him; let the holy Angels of God meet him, and carry him into the Heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, &amp;c. <hi>Looſed from the Chains of fleſh, may he be received into the glory of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.

And that they do ſo, we are onely to inſtance out of what hath been newly alledged, what they ſay of all without exception, <hi>viz.</hi> that, after death, they have their place in <hi>Holy Sion,</hi> that the <hi>Angels come to meet them;</hi> that they convey them into the <hi>Kingdom of Glory,</hi> into the <hi>boſom of a bleſſed Reſt,</hi> into the <hi>boſom of</hi> Abraham, into the <hi>pleaſant Verdures of Paradiſe,</hi> that they might with the Quires of the Bleſſed <hi>contemplate Truth</hi> with their bleſſed eyes, and enjoy the <hi>ſweetneſs of divine contemplation eternally;</hi> that the Lord places them in the <hi>Portion of the Elect,</hi> in the place where they <hi>hoped for ſalvation,</hi> opens the <hi>heavens to them,</hi> gives them an <hi>eternal Reſt,</hi> and makes them <hi>paſs into life;</hi> which Expreſsions are ſuch, as that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> could not (according to the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of their Belief) either ſay, or think any thing beyond them. Shall we imagine her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately ſeiſed by a <hi>Vertigo</hi> ſo extraordinary, as that ſhe would be guilty of ſuch an <hi>Extravagance</hi> in favour of the Adverſaries of her <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,</hi> ſo far as to furniſh them with all the Expreſsions capable to ruine it, and that ſhe ſhould be ſo unnatural, and cruel towards thoſe of her children, whom death ſnatched away daily from her, as not to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to let them know, by the laſt word, that ſhe had a Reſentment of their Trouble, or that it was her deſire to procure their Deliverance out of it by her <hi>Prayers,</hi> and to fortifie others, whom ſhe ſaw to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like, by communicating to them her Advertiſements, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, and repreſenting to them on the one ſide the neceſsity, which the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God impoſed on them, as is pretended, to paſs through the <hi>Fire,</hi> and, on the other, the Hope, which his <hi>Promiſe</hi> gave them to be preſerved therein by his care till ſuch time, as his Goodneſs ſhould grant them a glorious deliverance out of it? Nay, though we ſhould be inclined to excuſe in her ſo ſhamefull a want of compaſsion, and memory, could we free her from Prevarication, charging her, that, inſtead of ſtirring up in her children the care of preparing themſelves for Death, and the temporal Pains, which (according to the <hi>Opinion</hi> of <hi>Purgatory)</hi> were to follow upon it, ſhe hath treacherouſly permitted, that (to be rid of it with more eaſe) they ſhould run into erroneous perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and preſume to promiſe themſelves, upon the very ſtart out of this Life, a paſſage into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, and the Paradiſe of God; or rather, that ſhe was reſolved to lay them aſleep her ſelf, by deceitfull Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, in the Boſom of a prejudicial Security, which ſmothers the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion they ſhould have conceived of the Severity of that great Judg, who intends to examine them with all rigour?

To which may be added, that, though it were underſtood of the <hi>Torments,</hi> which wicked Spirits are to expect af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, Reaſon would force us to avow, that the Believer, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Grace of God, is exempted from them after Death, in the ſame manner, as he is <hi>delivered from eternal Death,</hi> from the <hi>dangers of Hell,</hi> and from the <hi>ſnares of his Torments,</hi> which he never felt, nor ever ſhall feel, for as much as <hi>Chriſt, crucified, and dead for him,</hi> preſerves, and frees him from them.

ceaſing, you pray for me unto</hi> Chriſt, <hi>God, to the end, that I may not (according to my ſins) be confined to place of Torment, but that he would place me where is light of Life.</hi> The middle-conditioned Souls are they, ever (according to them) at ſuch a point, as, immediately after their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of the Body, to be at the ſelf-ſame time exempted from the <hi>Pains</hi> of <hi>Reſtraint,</hi> Obſcurity, or Grief (through which it is affirmed they are to paſs) and deprived of the <hi>Reſt,</hi> which, after the <hi>Pains,</hi> they are to obtain, ſo as that they are (for the leaſt ſpace of time imaginable) in a Neutral State, which admits not the qualification of either Good or Bad, of either Light or Darkneſs, Reſt or Torment, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, of either Joy or Grief, if not by accident?

                     <p>It may be Anſwered, That <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which, as we have ſhewn, grounded its <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> onely on the not-written <hi>Tradition,</hi> hath, by its <hi>Procedure,</hi> declared, that it had not (no more then the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at this, day) eyes to perceive, in thoſe <hi>Texts,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which ſome pretend to derive from them; it being onely <hi>Intereſt,</hi> which is vigilant upon all occaſions, ready to make advantage of all things, confident in feigning what is not, and ingenious in the dreſſing-up of fond Imaginations, that hath hitherto been capable of theſe fine Diſcoveries. The ſame <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> prides it not a little, in that the ſame <hi>Antiquity</hi> hath (no leſs, then the Modern <hi>Greeks)</hi> even from the <hi>firſt Ages</hi> practiſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended <hi>Prayers for the Dead;</hi> but ſhe diſcovers not, that while ſhe condemns all the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of that <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and admits not any one of the <hi>Motives,</hi> which inclined it to that Devotion, ſhe is, in Effect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated further from its Belief, then the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who ſo forbear do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the <hi>Antients</hi> did, as that they do all lies in their power, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it, and to ſhew, that, as their Intention, and Worſhip have been free from the Venome, which the Ignorant malice of later <hi>Ages</hi> hath ſince ſcattered all over the <hi>Weſt;</hi> ſo the end they aim at is, not either to diſhonour them, becauſe of the Weakneſſes they have been ſubject to, or to make an odious diſcovery of their ſhame, but onely take the remarks of their Discircumſpections, as ſo many Advertiſements to <hi>Poſterity,</hi> never to forget it ſelf through too much ſecurity, and a blindly-exceſſive reſpect for the great Names, that have preceded it. After Notice taken of the ſucceſs, which attended the Impious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of thoſe <hi>Impoſtours,</hi> who (in the <hi>Second Age</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> even while the Blood of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> was yet boyling, and the Memory of their Inſtructions, and Examples more lively) carried on their wicked Deſigns upon the ſimplicity, and ſincerity of <hi>Apoſtolical-men;</hi> as alſo how charming thoſe Deluſions proved, which incredibly dazzled many of thoſe, whom the Mercy of God honoured with the Crown of <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>

and whoſe precedent converſation had been looked on in the Church, as a ſingular pattern of Piety, and Sanctity: after notice, I ſay, taken of theſe things, it is an Obligation lies on every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> at this day, to bow down the head in humility, to implore, by continual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to Heaven, the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of Grace, that, efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inſinuating it ſelf into their hearts, he may not onely divert them from the like Tryals, but fill them with light, aſſurance, and joy, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of arming themſelves (like Furies) with the Thunder-bolts, and Whirl-winds of a falſe Zeal, which ever inſpires them with malice, and the utter ruine of thoſe they think in an errour, that they would ſuffer themſelves (as <hi>Children of Peace,</hi> Domeſticks of the <note n="c" place="margin">Eſa. 9. 5.</note>

Heretofore the Church, ſoon after the departure of the Apoſtles, had the misfortune, that <hi>Hermas, Papias, Juſtin Martyr, Athenagoras, Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian,</hi> (in a word, all the moſt excellent Perſons, of whom we have ought left) led away by the extravagances and fantaſtick Imaginations of the counterfeit <hi>Sibyll,</hi> believed themſelves, and perſwaded others, that the Souls of all men were, from the departure out of the Body, detained in Hell, till the Reſurrection; that the juſt, riſing again before the others, ſhould reign with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> upon Earth, and live a <hi>thouſand years in Jeruſalem,</hi> made glorious, and flowing with corporeal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or at leaſt, in the Terreſtrial Paradiſe; and that the Bodies of the greateſt Saints, ſhould paſs through the laſt conflagration of the World, as through a <hi>Refiner</hi>'s Furnace.

The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who approves not of praying for either of thoſe two States, hath at laſt brought into cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit her <hi>Purgatory,</hi> a thing not known before: why may we not hope it from the goodneſs of God, that he will diſpel this laſt Imagination, as he hath done the precedent, and every where eſtabliſh his Truth in its full luſtre? Let therefore thoſe, who at the preſent, quarrel at the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who neither maintain the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which the Opinion of <hi>Purgatory</hi> hath diſcredited, nor hold <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi>
