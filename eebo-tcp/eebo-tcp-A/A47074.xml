            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Sir, there was much jelosie of you in the time of the Prelates, that you were too full of feares, And now the Lord hath shortned those dayes of persecution; and you have a prise in your hand, being one of the Maisters of the Assemblie, fasten some naile concerning the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of laying on of hands, which will cleare up holy fellowship and take off that aspertion layd upon your congregations, that they are false; none of Christs, but Antichristian: Though I doe not for
<pb facs="tcp:51539:3"/>
my part say so of them, yet the Doctrine of Baptisme and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of laying on of hands is left out of them, notwithstanding the ceremonys have beene of Baptisme and laying on of hands with more then needed which makes some to goe to a second Baptisme. And on other forme, some are seekers out of a Baptisme looking for <hi>Elyas</hi> as <hi>John</hi> the Baptist to bring it from heaven, forsaking all fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship till Christ shall send forth new Apostles to lay on hands; All this is (as I conceive) is for want of the knowledge of those two mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle principalls, seeing these things are come to passe in your dayes, before your end; labour in the word and doctrine to cleare up those two principalls, so to our great Doctor I leave you to teach you the misteries of the Kingdome, resting ever to love the Saints.</p>

here what hath beene done against the Saints, There have beene councellors of state that have councelled for their hurt: I hope better things of some that are now clouded with temptations; that they will dote upon questions of no worth, and plead for a thing of naught, and against the Saints, but were they grave councelors as healing Elders, they would endeavour to heale <hi>Babell,</hi> shee not being healed, or come out of her into holy fellowship, as the straight gate by reason of persecution,<note place="margin">Ezek. 42. 8.</note> and so shine forth to the consuming of Antichrist,<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 2.</note> and their holy fellowship and godly conversation will be as the leaves of the trees of the sanctuary for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the nations. And if they were wise pleaders, they would not plead against the Saints, who were companions with them in sufferings, and in their adversitie, gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to prayer in holy fellowship for them, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led convinticles, who after the way they called heresie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship they God abiding steadfast in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship, and put away uncleannesse from them so farre as they know, they doe not separate with shame, as some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations like darke mountaines, those that abide in holy fellowship doe not seperate with whores, they doe not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with harlots as the people that doe not understand, but may fall upon the darke mountaines; If those pleaders that accuse the Saints of that they know not, were they wise plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they would plead the cause of the dumbe,<note place="margin">Hosea 14. 4.</note> who keepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence inevill times, the wicked being in sight:<note place="margin">Psa. 39. 1.</note> If they would plead their own innoecncy after some that have been first as seeming just, <hi>they are made dumbe and put to silence,</hi> for none of their Complaints shall passe the Presse, but the Presses are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with their Letters, that open their mouthes wide to smite the Saints with the tongue, and wound them with the Pen, blotting them with their Inke, as if they would not have the name of holy Ones among them; as in the time of the Hirarchie, the pretious were put out, and the uncleane kept in, and compelled to come to worship, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished it no more then the White of an Egge: But now when the name of Antichrist should be raised out, now they have a prise in their hand to set upon reformation, now the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                  <hi>this is that king Ahaz that sinned more and more in the time of distresse</hi>: Oh that the Saints were wise to gather into holy fellowship, the roote of <hi>Iesse</hi> set up for an Ensigne, and so Thrones set up for Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the gates of <hi>Sion,</hi>
