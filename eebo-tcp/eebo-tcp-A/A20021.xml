            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Good my Lord, I beseech your grace, to allowe of my plaine and comfortable Epilogus, for this matter at this time. Seeing, my studious exercises, and conuersation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ciuile, may be aboundantly testified, to my good credit, in the most partes of all Christendome: and that, by all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Nobility, by al degrees of the learned, and by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many other, of godly and Christian disposition, for the space of 46. yeeres triall: (as appeareth by the Recordes lately viewed by two honourable witnesses, by Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from her Maiesty,) And seeing, for these 36. yeeres, last <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> past, I haue beene her most excellent Maiesties very true, faithfull, and dutifull seruaunt; At whose royall mouth, I neuer receiued any one word of reproch; but all of fauor, and grace: In whose princely countenance, I neuer percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued frowne toward me, or discontented regard, or view on me: but at all times fauorable, and gracious: to the great ioy and comfort of my true, faithfull, and loyall hart. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>(thirdly) Seeing, the workes of my handes, and wordes of my mouth (heere before notified, in the Schedule of my bookes, and writings) may beare liuely witnesse of the thoughts of my hart, and inclination of my minde, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, (as all wise men do know, and Christ himselfe doth auouch) It might, in manner, seeme needlesse, thus care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully


<pb facs="tcp:10024:9"/>
(though most briefely and speedily) to haue warned or confounded the scornefull, the malicious, the proud, and the rash in their vntrue reports, opinions, and fables of my studies, or exercises Philosophicall: but that, it is of more importance, that the godly, the honest, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, the discreet, graue, and charitable Christians (Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish or other,) louers of Iustice, truth, and good learning, may, hereby, receiue certaine comfort in themselues (to perceiue, that <hi>Veritas tandem praeualebit</hi>) and sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be weaponed and armed with sound truth, to defende me against such kinde of my aduersaries: if hereafter they will begin afresh, or hould on, obstinately, in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer errors, vaine imaginations, false reportes, and most vngodly sclanders of me and my studies. ¬∂ Therefore, (to make all this cause, for euer, before God and man, out of all doubt:) Seeing, your Lordships good grace, are, as it were, our high Priest, and chiefe Ecclesiasticall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, (vnder our most dread and Soueraigne Ladie, Queene Elizabeth) to whose censure and iudgement, I submit all my studies and exercises; yea all my bookes, past, present and hereafter to be written, by me (of my own skill, iudgement, or opinion,) I do, at this present time, most humbly, sincerelie, and vnfainedly, and in the name of Almighty God, (yea for his honor and glory) request, and beseech your Grace, (when, and as conueniently you may) to be well and throughlie certified of me, what I am, <hi>Intus &amp; in cute: Reuerendissime in Christo Pater, &amp; Dignissime Archipraesul, cognosce &amp; agnosce vultum t√†m internum, qu√†m externum pecoris tui</hi>: And wherein I haue vsed, doe or shall vse, pen, speech, or conuersation,

otherwise then as it appertaineth to a faithfull, carefull, sincere, and humble seruant of Christ Iesu, That your grace woulde vouchsafe to aduertise me.

(The Almighty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be highly thanked, praised, honored, and glorified, for euer and euer, Amen.)</p>
            <p>But nowe, in respect of the generall intent of this briefe discourse, I most humbly, and reuerently, exhibit to your graces view, and perusing, the originall monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Authenticke Record, before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, faire written in parchment, with the seale whole, and perfect, duly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant: as I haue 46. yeeres, and somewhat longer, preserued it.
