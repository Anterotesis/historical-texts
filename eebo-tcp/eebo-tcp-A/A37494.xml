         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>form</hi> of Godliness, is very <hi>common</hi> in these dayes of ours; but the <hi>power</hi> of it, is very <hi>rare.</hi> How <hi>few</hi> persons, shall we finde in the <hi>visible Church,</hi> who live and act in the <hi>strength of God?</hi> But ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, men do, what ever they do, in their <hi>own</hi> strength, and that not onely in <hi>humane</hi> things, but in <hi>divine.</hi> How seldom do we see, either in <hi>Ministers</hi> or <hi>Christians,</hi> in the discharge of their duties in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, more then the <hi>power of men?</hi> The greatest part by far, not onely of those who are called <hi>Christians,</hi> but also of forward <hi>Professors,</hi> being ignorant what it is, <hi>to be strengthened with might in the inner man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the glorious power of the great God.</hi> How <hi>little</hi> is there (among all our plenty) of <hi>that</hi> preaching, which is not in the plausible words of mans wisdom, but in the demonstration of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power?</hi> How few <hi>Congregations</hi> (among the many that are in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) are gathered together in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of our Lord Iesus Christ? How few of <hi>those</hi> Christians are there, in whom is the <hi>exceeding greatness of Gods power,</hi> together with the <hi>effectual working</hi> of it? But the <hi>form of Godliness,</hi> is now become, almost the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of all flesh,</hi> and in these dayes of light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb facs="tcp:65184:3"/>
it is accounted by all (that are not down-right A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists) a great shame, not to <hi>seem</hi> to be religious. And when men, and families, and Congregations, are gotten into this <hi>form,</hi> they think themselves both <hi>safe</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi> as being near the suburbs of the Kingdom of God, and close Neighbours to the Saints. And this <hi>form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> as it is of very easie compliance with flesh and blood, in this particular, in that according to this, men onely make their <hi>actions new,</hi> retaining still their <hi>old natures; so</hi> it is also of great credit and esteem, with <hi>carnal Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</hi> But <hi>the spiritual man judgeth all things, and yet he himself is judged of no man</hi>: and he being partaker of the power of God himself, can in some measure discern both the <hi>presence</hi> and <hi>want</hi> of it in others, both which he knows in his own experience.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>form of godliness,</hi> is, when men are godly without God, and anoynted without Christ, and regenerate not having the Spirit; that is, when they have a <hi>sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi> of holiness, but not the <hi>thing</hi> it self: a semblance of <hi>grace,</hi> retaining their <hi>old natures.</hi> And such Christians as these, perform <hi>spiritual</hi> duties, with <hi>natural</hi> strength, <hi>heavenly</hi> duties, with <hi>earthly</hi> strength, the <hi>works</hi> of God, with the <hi>power</hi> of men. In the <hi>Religion</hi> of these men, there is the <hi>outward</hi> duty done, and it may be very specious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and <hi>plausibly,</hi> but there is none of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the duty. There is <hi>their own working</hi> towards God, which is faint and faithless, and not <hi>Gods own working</hi> in them towards himself, which is lively and mighty: and all the religious acts they do are onely their <hi>own</hi> operations, and not the operations of <hi>God</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>This <hi>form of godliness,</hi> how pleasing soever it be to a mans <hi>self,</hi> and of what reckoning soever with <hi>others,</hi> who are like himself, yet is indeed, of very <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful consequence,</hi> whether we regard the <hi>doings</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:65184:3"/>
               <hi>sufferings,</hi> unto which this <hi>form</hi> necessarily engages.</p>
            <p>For first, when men by occasion of this <hi>form</hi> are called forth to do the great <hi>works</hi> of God, and yet are destitute of the <hi>power</hi> of God, their <hi>duties</hi> are above their <hi>strength,</hi> and their <hi>strength</hi> bears no proportion to their <hi>duties.</hi> And so sooner or later, meeting with <hi>difficulties,</hi> they faint, and languish as a Snail, their <hi>works</hi> being too high for their <hi>faculties.</hi> For <hi>nature</hi> being strained above its power, and offering at that which is beyond its abilities, by degrees grows <hi>weary,</hi> and returns to its <hi>old temper</hi> again. And he that sought that <hi>glory</hi> which was <hi>not</hi> his own, at last lies down in his <hi>own shame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>form of godliness</hi> exposes a man to those <hi>evils,</hi> that are incident to the faithful because of <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Now when a man hath the <hi>same evils,</hi> with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and not the <hi>same power</hi> to support him under those evils; when men have the same evils in the <hi>flesh,</hi> but not the same power in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the same <hi>burthens</hi> on their shoulders, but not the same <hi>everlasting arms</hi> underneath them, they fall <hi>sadly</hi> and <hi>desperately,</hi> to the great <hi>scandal</hi> of the ways of God.</p>
            <p>However, if men be not called forth, to such <hi>eminent</hi> doings and sufferings, and so scape such <hi>manifest</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries and downfals: yet the <hi>form of godliness,</hi> hath this evil in it, That it brings a man onely to the <hi>troublesome</hi> part of <hi>Religion,</hi> but not to the <hi>comfortable;</hi> it engages a man in the same <hi>duties</hi> with the godly, but supplies him not with the same <hi>strength;</hi> it involves him in the same <hi>bitterness of flesh,</hi> but doth not furnish him with the same <hi>joy of Spirit.</hi> For as such a mans <hi>Religion,</hi> doth not reach above flesh and blood, no more doth his <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>comforts.</hi> And so he performs duties at a <hi>low</hi> rate; yea and his <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>empty form,</hi> casts a black vail upon <hi>Religion,</hi> and utterly obscures its <hi>beauty,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65184:4"/>
and makes the world judge meanly of it, and to think it a matter only of <hi>singularity</hi> and <hi>humour,</hi> and not of <hi>power.</hi> Whereas when a <hi>Christian</hi> walks in the <hi>strength of the Spirit,</hi> doing and suffering the will of God, <hi>beyond</hi> all strength and abilities of <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> the world often times <hi>wonders</hi> and <hi>gazes</hi> at him, and many are provoked to <hi>glorifie God,</hi> who hath given such power to <hi>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this <hi>power of godliness,</hi> among other things, hath these <hi>three</hi> advantages.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It makes a man do every duty <hi>strongly</hi> and <hi>mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> And whatever, might take a man off from duty, or distract and disturbe him in it, all fals to <hi>nothing</hi> before this <hi>power.</hi> There is that <hi>strength,</hi> in each duty, performed by the power of the <hi>anoynting,</hi> which declares it to be the operation of <hi>God himself</hi> in man, and nothing else, but the very <hi>power of God,</hi> that is, Iesus Christ himself, in action in us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It makes a man <hi>inflexible</hi> in the ways of God, that he shall neither turn to the right hand, nor to the left, but take <hi>straight steps</hi> towards the mark set before him. No fear nor favours, nor frowns, nor flatteries, nor temptations, nor insinuations nor designs of others, nor ends of his own, can turn him aside. He carries such <hi>strength</hi> in his Spirit, as he can never be <hi>bended,</hi> and so far forth as he partakes of the <hi>power of God,</hi> is as <hi>unmoveable</hi> and <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> as God him self.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It makes a man <hi>invincible,</hi> by all <hi>evils</hi> and <hi>enemies.</hi> Because all the power <hi>against</hi> him, is but the power of the <hi>creature,</hi> but the power <hi>in</hi> him, is the power of <hi>God.</hi> And the power of <hi>God,</hi> easily <hi>overcomes</hi> the mightiest power of the <hi>creature,</hi> but is never <hi>overcome</hi> by it. And if this power in a <hi>Christian,</hi> should be prevailed against, <hi>God</hi> himself who is that power, should be conquered, which is impossible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65184:4"/>To conclude, the <hi>power of godliness,</hi> is the doer of every duty, in Gods Kingdom, the subduer of every sin, the conquerour of each tribulation and temptation, the life of every performance, the glory of each grace, the beauty of a Christians life, the stability of his conversation, the lustre of his Religion, his great Honour and excellency both in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and suffering, yea it is the very glory of God himself, in the Church of God; for by <hi>faith,</hi> the Lord arises on us, and by this <hi>power of godliness,</hi> his glory is seen upon us.</p>
            <p>These considerations, right honourable, moved me to discourse of the <hi>power of the Holy Spirit</hi> coming on all <hi>Christians, Ministers</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> And besides the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi> of some <hi>other</hi> friends, your <hi>Honours</hi> earnest desires of these notes, hath especially prevailed with me to publish them. Not that I am worthy to publish any thing, but that the <hi>truth of God</hi> is worthy to be published, be the <hi>instrument</hi> never so mean and unworthy. And although I well know, the <hi>doubtful success</hi> of such undertakings as these, yet in this matter I am not at all <hi>carefull,</hi> being most willing to be bound up in one condition with the <hi>truth</hi> of God, and to have with it, the same common <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>enemies.</hi> Besides if <hi>Christ</hi> dwell in my heart by <hi>faith,</hi> I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in my bosome already, my <hi>reward,</hi> out of whom, I neither regard <hi>praise</hi> or <hi>dispraise, good</hi> or <hi>evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I was bold to prefix your. <hi>Honours name</hi> to these Notes, because your <hi>desire</hi> of them, hath made them yours, and also your many noble favors are a strong and continual engagement, for me to serve you, according to what God hath made me. Especially I remember your extraordinary <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,</hi> and <hi>bowels</hi> towards me, in the day of my <hi>deepest distress,</hi> when my soul drew near to the Pit, and the shadow of death sate upon my eye lids, and I had not the least drop of comfort, either from earth or heaven; Your Honor then shewed me the <hi>kindness of the Lord,</hi> and encompassed me
<pb facs="tcp:65184:5"/>

Thus was it between <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi>: never was there such dear and intimate <hi>friendship,</hi> and such sincere and burning <hi>love</hi> between any, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.

three times professed his <hi>love</hi> to him, and being sorry that Christ should question his love the third time, he thus answered, <hi>Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> also loved them dearly, yea he loved <hi>them</hi>

Now when such <hi>loving</hi> friends as <hi>these,</hi> were even now ready to take their <hi>last</hi> leave one of another, in regard of <hi>bodily</hi> presence, who would not most willingly have been present, to have heard what discourse passed between <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Disciples,</hi> at this their last parting?</p>

               <hi>should reign from sea to sea, and from the river to the worlds end.</hi> This was the <hi>summ</hi> of Christs discourse with them. And the Apostles were fully satisfied touching the <hi>thing,</hi> onely they were unsatisfied touching the <hi>time.</hi> For besides, that the setting up of this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of the <hi>Messias</hi> in the power, beauty, and glory of it, was at that time the common discourse and expectation of <hi>all Israel</hi>; the Apostles themselves remembred many <hi>Prophesies</hi> and <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> of the Old Testament, for the <hi>restoring</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>; And this they thought <hi>Christ</hi> would have done, in the daies of his <hi>flesh:</hi> but <hi>presently,</hi> all their hopes were blasted by his <hi>death.</hi> But when they saw him <hi>risen</hi> again from the <hi>dead,</hi> then presently their <hi>hearts</hi> were revived, into their former <hi>hopes</hi>; but yet again, seeing nothing done, all the time he conversed with

them after the <hi>resurrection,</hi> when now he was ready to <hi>Ascend</hi> into Heaven, they desire him, <hi>first,</hi> to resolve them of this <hi>question,</hi> whether or no he would at that time, restore the Kingdom to Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; <hi>Lord</hi> (say they) <hi>Wilt thou at this time restore again the Kingdom to Israel?</hi> Now <hi>Christ,</hi> doth not deny, the <hi>restoring</hi> of the Kingdom to <hi>Israel,</hi> but denies, to acquaint them with the <hi>time</hi> when it should be done. He tells them, <hi>it was not for them to know the times and seasons, which the Father had put in his own power.</hi> verse 7.</p>
            <p>The like <hi>answer</hi> to the like <hi>demand, Daniel</hi> received in his time. For when the <hi>Angel</hi> had represented to <hi>Daniel,</hi> the totall destruction of the image of <hi>worldly Monarchy,</hi> together with the <hi>rise</hi> and reign, and ruin of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and the setting up of <hi>Christs Kingdom</hi> in the world, in the stead of the two former, <hi>Daniel</hi> said, Chap. 12.8. <hi>And I heard, but I understood not; thou said I, O my Lord, What shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way</hi> Daniel, <hi>for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.</hi> So that the <hi>Angel,</hi> who discovered the <hi>things</hi> themselves to <hi>Daniel,</hi> refused to discover to him plainly and expressely, the <hi>time</hi> when they should be done: but that was to be <hi>closed</hi> and <hi>sealed</hi> up till the time of the <hi>end.</hi> And so here in like manner, <hi>Christ</hi> who had discoursed largely and cleerly to the <hi>Disciples</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> yet denies to discover to them the <hi>time,</hi> when it should be set up in the <hi>world.</hi> And the reason why he denied <hi>this</hi> to them, to whom he had not denyed <hi>himself,</hi> was not for want of <hi>loue,</hi> but because the <hi>Father</hi> had kept the time and season, wherein all this should be done, in his <hi>own power.</hi> Had this been placed in <hi>Christs</hi> power, he had no doubt made <hi>it</hi> known to them, as well as he did those <hi>other things,</hi> which he had heard from his Father; but the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> had not placed this in his <hi>Sons</hi> power, but had reserved it in his <hi>own:</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> were not to <hi>pry</hi> after, that which was <hi>hidden</hi> with God, but were to content themselves with what he had <hi>revealed.</hi>
            </p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi>
               </note>Our dear <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> why wilt thou leave us, thy poor <hi>Disciples,</hi> among so many evils and enemies in the world, which our <hi>weakness</hi> must of necessity sink under? We well remember how <hi>fearful</hi> and <hi>foolish</hi> we have been, whilest <hi>thou</hi> wast yet <hi>with</hi> us; but how much more <hi>timorous</hi> and <hi>trembling</hi> shall we be, when thou art gone <hi>from</hi> us? When thou wast <hi>apprehended</hi> by the armed power of the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> thou knowest how <hi>we all</hi> forsook thee and fled; and I, said <hi>Peter,</hi> denied thee and <hi>forswore</hi> thee, at the voice of a simple maid. And therefore if thou now <hi>quite</hi> leave us, what <hi>Witnesses</hi> are we like to be unto thee, and what <hi>Preachers</hi> of thy <hi>Name,</hi> among the obstinate <hi>Jews,</hi> among the angry and inraged <hi>Rulers,</hi> and people, who will be ready, for thy <hi>Names</hi> sake, every day to deliver us up to a new death? And how shall we be able to stand amidst so many difficulties, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, distresses, oppositions and persecutions, when thou hast <hi>left</hi> us? Surely, we are such <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>infirm</hi> creatures, that we shall never be able to hold out, but shall lie down both in <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>sorrow.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now from these words, we shall note something <hi>generally,</hi> and something more <hi>particularly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>general</hi> three things. The first is this:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as <hi>Christ</hi> will not suffer his Disciples to be <hi>tempted</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their power, so neither to be <hi>imployed</hi> above their power;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> but he furnishes them with power <hi>sufficient,</hi> both for their <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and for their <hi>imployments</hi>; for their <hi>sufferings,</hi> and for their <hi>doings.</hi> And as <hi>Souldiers,</hi> that are under a wise and carefull <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> when they are neer an <hi>ingagement,</hi> are not suffered to run <hi>rashly</hi> upon the enemy, nor permitted to go forth to battle till they are <hi>armed,</hi> and <hi>mounted;</hi> so <hi>Christ</hi> would not suffer his <hi>Disciples,</hi> to go forth in <hi>his</hi> warfare, to incounter so many evils, and oppositions, and persecutions, and the whole power of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65184:10"/>
               <hi>world,</hi> and of the <hi>Devil,</hi> till first he had armed them with the power of <hi>Holy Spirit; Ye shall receive power when the Holy Ghost is come upon you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ</hi> alwayes gives unto all those whom he sends forth and imployes, of his <hi>own power,</hi> for his <hi>own works; heavenly</hi> power for <hi>heavenly</hi> works, <hi>spiritual</hi> power for <hi>spiritual</hi> works, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>of God,</hi> to do the works <hi>of God.</hi> Indeed Christ gives unto some a <hi>greater</hi> measure of power, and to some a <hi>lesser,</hi> according as he intends to use some, in <hi>greater</hi> works and difficulties, and some in <hi>lesser;</hi> but still they have of <hi>Christs power,</hi> whether <hi>more</hi> or <hi>lesse,</hi> who are imployed by <hi>Christ</hi>; and a <hi>little</hi> of that power that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by <hi>Christ,</hi> will inable a man to do <hi>great</hi> things, far greater then the <hi>world</hi> suspects, or imagines.</p>
            <p>So that we may judge of our <hi>calling</hi> to any business, and of our <hi>imployment</hi> in it, by the <hi>power</hi> we have received from <hi>Christ</hi> for it. If we have <hi>none</hi> of the power of <hi>Christ,</hi> we were never set on work by <hi>Christ</hi>; for <hi>Christ</hi> never sets any, on <hi>his work,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out communicating unto them of his <hi>power.</hi> And hereby we may certainly know and conclude, that those in the <hi>Ministery,</hi> that are loose and vitious, and idle, and negligent, and insufficient for that work, were never <hi>called</hi> to it, nor <hi>imployed</hi> in it, by <hi>Christ,</hi> but they <hi>run</hi> of their own heads, when they were not <hi>sent,</hi> and minister in the Church for the <hi>gain of money,</hi> and <hi>preach</hi> onely that they might <hi>live.</hi> Whereas if <hi>Christ</hi> had imployed them in that calling, he would have furnished them with <hi>abilities</hi> for it: and they being destitute of such <hi>abilities,</hi> it is most evident, they were not sent by <hi>Christ.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Judge then what a kinde of <hi>Reformation</hi> this church were like to have, if some men might have their minds; who would have <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>insufficient</hi> men, yea <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>prophane</hi> men, tolerated in the Ministry, under pretence of <hi>keeping up ordinances</hi>; when yet <hi>such</hi> men, were never <hi>imployed</hi> by Christ, nor <hi>supplyed</hi> with any power from him: Yea and what <hi>ordinances</hi> (I pray) are those like to be, which are kept up by men that are <hi>carnal,</hi> not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Spirit</hi>? But you see here that <hi>Christs</hi> way and wisdom, was <hi>different</hi> from this; for he <hi>first</hi> gives the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the power of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and then <hi>sent</hi> them to preach, when he had first <hi>inabled</hi> them to preach.</p>

               <note place="margin">2. <hi>General Doctrine.</hi>
               </note>2. You see here, that <hi>Christ</hi> being to leave his <hi>Disciples,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65184:10"/>
of his <hi>bodily</hi> presence, yet leaves behind him the <hi>promise</hi> of the Spirit of power; and this was some <hi>establishment</hi> to them, yea this gave great <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> to them, who before had their hearts filled with <hi>sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ,</hi> though sometime he leave his people in regard of <hi>sense,</hi> yet he never leaves them without a <hi>promise.</hi> The soul sometimes, in the hours of temptation and desertion, may want the <hi>sense</hi> and feeling of Christ, but it never wants a <hi>promise</hi> from Christ: and the <hi>promise</hi> makes Christ <hi>present,</hi> in his <hi>absence.</hi> For <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is <hi>spiritually</hi> present, in the <hi>promise,</hi> and not <hi>Christ</hi> onely, but the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> also; for <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> are never <hi>asunder,</hi> but as the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> are <hi>one,</hi> so is <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Spirit one,</hi> and all are in the <hi>promise.</hi> And so the <hi>promise</hi> is able to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the soul in any condition, not because of its <hi>own nature,</hi> but because <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> are present in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> and they are infinitely able to support the soul through the <hi>Promise,</hi> under the greatest evils either of <hi>earth</hi> or <hi>hell.</hi> Now this injoyment of God in the <hi>Promise,</hi> is the injoyment of <hi>faith,</hi> and not of <hi>sense</hi>; and this injoyment of <hi>faith,</hi> is the most <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>intimate</hi> injoyment of Christ. And thus may the soul, injoy Christs <hi>presence</hi> in his <hi>absence</hi>; his presence according to <hi>faith,</hi> in his absence according to <hi>sence.</hi> And therefore <hi>Christ</hi> departing from his Disciples in regard of his <hi>bodily</hi> presence, leaves with them the <hi>promise</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and in that promise, his <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> presence. And this is the <hi>worst</hi> condition, that <hi>Christ</hi> ever leaves his true <hi>Church</hi> in; he leaves them his presence in a <hi>Promise,</hi> when in regard of <hi>sense,</hi> he forsakes them.</p>

               </note> that <hi>Luke</hi> being to speak in this Book of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> of the <hi>propagating</hi> and <hi>inlarging,</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, doth <hi>first</hi> make mention, of the <hi>pouring forth of the Spirit,</hi> and that both upon the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon the <hi>Disciples.</hi> Signifying hereby, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so <hi>necessary,</hi> for the increase and well ordering of the true <hi>Church</hi> of Christ, as <hi>the pouring forth of the Spirit.</hi> And therefore they are altogether deceived, and walk in the light of <hi>Nature</hi> and not of <hi>God,</hi> who think the <hi>increase,</hi> and <hi>propagation,</hi> and <hi>preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>establishment,</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> and ordering, of the <hi>Church</hi> of God, depend especially upon the <hi>Councels,</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> of <hi>men</hi>: and that without <hi>these,</hi> the Church of <hi>God,</hi> would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65184:11"/>
soon come to woful <hi>disorder,</hi> yea to utter <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>confusion</hi>; as if <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> sate idle in heaven, and had <hi>left</hi> the whole business of his Church to <hi>men:</hi> and the <hi>sacred power</hi> confirmed with the <hi>secular,</hi> were abundantly sufficient, for the <hi>increase</hi> and <hi>well ordering</hi> of the Church. In the mean time, not regarding the <hi>promise</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> or the <hi>pouring</hi> out of the <hi>Spirit</hi> by the <hi>Son.</hi> And this is the very <hi>mystery, of the mystery of iniquity</hi> among us, and the very <hi>head</hi> of Antichrist, which is yet to be broken. And therefore let us know, that as the Psalmist saith, <hi>Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: and except the Lord keep the City, the watchman watcheth but in vain</hi>: so also except the <hi>Lord,</hi> through his <hi>Word,</hi> pour forth the promise of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and by that <hi>Spirit</hi> of his, in and through the <hi>Word inlarge</hi> and <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi> the Church, they <hi>labor in vain,</hi> that undertake these things of <hi>themselves.</hi> For it is the <hi>Spirit</hi> alone, that through the faithful ministry of the <hi>Word,</hi> makes the <hi>increase</hi> of the Church, and layes hold on all the <hi>elect,</hi> and brings them through <hi>faith,</hi> into the unity of the <hi>Son</hi> and of the <hi>Father,</hi> and teaches them, and orders them, and governs them, and preserves them. And therefore you see here, that the <hi>promise of the Spirit</hi> is first performed, before the <hi>Church</hi> of God hath any <hi>inlargement,</hi> or <hi>government.</hi>

               <note place="margin">The particular handling of the words.</note>And now from these <hi>general</hi> things we proceed to the words more <hi>particularly. Ye shall receive power when the Holy Ghost is come upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here we may note two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What he <hi>promises</hi> them, and that is <hi>Power; you shall receive power.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>point</hi> we will insist on from <hi>both,</hi> is this.</p>

                  <hi>The Doctr.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>By <hi>nature,</hi> we are all without <hi>strength,</hi> weak, impotent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, utterly <hi>unable</hi> to any thing, that is <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>spiritually</hi> righteous and good.

of it, that is, the perfections and excellencies of it. So that by <hi>nature,</hi> we are all <hi>without</hi> power, because we are nothing but <hi>flesh,</hi> of which, weakness is an inseparable adjunct.</p>
            <p>But when we receive the <hi>Spirit,</hi> we receive <hi>power</hi>:<note place="margin">The Spirit is Power two wayes.</note> for <hi>power</hi> is an inseparable adjunct of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>weakness</hi> is of <hi>flesh:</hi> yea the <hi>Spirit it self</hi> which is given us, is <hi>power,</hi> and that both <hi>essentially</hi> and <hi>operatively,</hi> in it self, and in us.</p>

               </note> by being in us a <hi>spirit of Truth.</hi> And so the <hi>spirit</hi> is, because it doth not onely lead us <hi>unto the truth</hi> (that is unto the word which is the onely truth, as it is written, <hi>Sanctifie them through the truth, thy Word is truth)</hi> but also the <hi>Spirit</hi> leads <hi>us into the Truth</hi>; it leads <hi>us</hi> into the <hi>truth,</hi> and the <hi>truth</hi> into <hi>us,</hi> till we and it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>one</hi> by an inseparable union.

from the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> we are altogether <hi>stedfast</hi> and <hi>unmovable,</hi> among variety of <hi>different</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> winds of <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And this is the very cause, that among so many <hi>divisions,</hi> and <hi>facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>errours,</hi> and <hi>heresies,</hi> which wofully prevail in these present times of ours, the people of God are not <hi>seduced</hi> and <hi>overcome</hi> to wit, because <hi>they are all taught of God,</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and not of <hi>men,</hi> and have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> to lead them into the <hi>truth</hi>; the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> I say and not <hi>men:</hi> and so it is <hi>impossible,</hi> that they should <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>finally</hi> be deceived.

For <hi>all</hi> the <hi>world</hi> cannot lead any man into the truth, till the <hi>Spirit</hi> lead him into it; and when the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth lead us into the <hi>truth, all</hi> the men in the world cannot lead us <hi>out</hi> of it; but we are so <hi>sure</hi> of those things, wherein the <hi>Spirit</hi> hath been a teacher to us, that if all the <hi>Councels</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> in the world, yea all the <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven should teach us contrary, we would hold them <hi>accursed.</hi> But a man that hath not been taught of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> every day you may win him into <hi>new</hi> opinions, by the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> together with the strength of other <hi>advantages</hi>; But he that hath been led into the <hi>truth,</hi> by the Spirit of truth, is <hi>unmoveable</hi> and <hi>invincible</hi> among all doctrines. And thus also the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> by being a <hi>Spirit of truth</hi> is also a Spirit of <hi>Power</hi> in us.</p>

Chrysostome,</hi> was indued with the <hi>same power,</hi> and so resolved to preach the truth, and not to depart from the truth, though the <hi>whole world,</hi> should wage war against him <hi>alone:</hi> And professed, that he desired nothing more, then to <hi>suffer</hi> for the cause of Christ; and that if it <hi>were offered to him of God, whether he would immediately go to heaven, or stay on earth and suffer for Christ; he would a thousand times rather chuse this latter, then the former.</hi> Because in going immediately to heaven, he should <hi>seek himself</hi>; but in staying on earth to suffer for <hi>Christ,</hi> he should wholly <hi>deny himself,</hi> and seek his honour alone. <hi>Luther</hi> was indued with the <hi>same spirit of power,</hi> and so when he was called to <hi>Wormes</hi> before the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, and before all the estates of the Empire, to render a reason of his Doctrine, and some of his friends (perceiving undue deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among his adversaries) perswaded him not to go, to expose himself to danger; but he answered with a mighty spirit, <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Many more <hi>Examples</hi> might be produced, to show that when <hi>Ministers</hi> are indued with the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> coming on them, then they are <hi>stronger</hi> then all <hi>opposition</hi> and <hi>Persecution</hi> whatsoever; otherwise, when these evils encounter them, they with <hi>Demas</hi> leave the <hi>Work,</hi> and imbrace the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus you see, what <hi>necessity</hi> all the faithful <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel have, of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> coming upon them; and <hi>without</hi> this power, though they be <hi>called</hi> Ministers, yet they are <hi>none.</hi> For without this power, they are <hi>unable</hi> to preach the Word, to preach it <hi>powerfully,</hi> and to <hi>persevere</hi> and <hi>hold out</hi> in the course of the Ministery; they are unable to <hi>reprove</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> to wrestle with and overcome the <hi>Devil;</hi> and to suffer that <hi>Persecution,</hi> which necessarily attends that calling. And so <hi>without</hi> this power, they may Minister to <hi>themselves,</hi> but cannot Minister to <hi>others,</hi> the manifold graces of God: they may do their <hi>own</hi> work, but they cannot do <hi>Gods</hi> work; they may feed <hi>themselves,</hi> but not the <hi>Flock of Christ:</hi> they may <hi>domineer</hi> over the sheep, but cannot <hi>drive</hi> away the Wolf: they may build up their <hi>own houses,</hi> but cannot build up <hi>God</hi> house.</p>

Whereby you may

perceive that not <hi>Ministers</hi> only are <hi>Spiritual</hi> men, and all others <hi>temporal,</hi> as the Papists have taught, and many Ignorant people among our selves, are still perswaded: but <hi>all true Believers</hi> are <hi>spiritual,</hi> as well as they, being <hi>born</hi> of the Spirit, and <hi>Baptized</hi> with the Spirit, equally as <hi>they</hi> are.</p>
            <p>And so all <hi>true Believers</hi> as well as <hi>Ministers</hi> being indued with the <hi>Spirit</hi>; are also indued with the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and so have more then an <hi>Earthly</hi> power in them.

            <p>You see then clearly, that all <hi>faithful Christians,</hi> have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of power, and the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> coming on <hi>them,</hi> aswe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fifthly, all <hi>Christians</hi> stand in need of the Power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to <hi>inable</hi> them to the <hi>use of the Word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To inable them to the use of the word.</note> and that both in <hi>private,</hi> and in <hi>publique,</hi> as occasion serves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In private</hi>;<note place="margin">In private.</note> for no man can say, <hi>that Iesus is the Christ but by the Holy Spirit.</hi> No man can speak of Christ, <hi>spiritually,</hi> but by the <hi>Spirit</hi>; and without this spirit, which searches the deep things of God, and reveals them to us, Christians are <hi>unable</hi> to give the <hi>Sense</hi> of the Word of God in their <hi>families,</hi> and among their <hi>friends,</hi> and acquaintance, and are also <hi>ashamed</hi> to do it. Whereas the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God gives both <hi>ability,</hi> and <hi>boldness:</hi> as <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> his wife, did not onely speak the word in their family, but also took <hi>Apollos</hi> a Minister, home,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 18.26.</note> when they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65184:22"/>
perceived him somewhat ignorant in the <hi>mystery</hi> of Christ, <hi>and instructed him in the way of God more perfectly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They have need of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>spirit,</hi> to inable them to speak the word of God in <hi>publike,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In publike.</note> as every Christian may do, if he come where people are <hi>ignorant</hi> of Gods Word, and there be no <hi>Minister</hi> to do it. This I say in such a case he may do by vertue of his <hi>anointing</hi> with the <hi>spirit</hi>; And for this you may see the practise of <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> who were but <hi>Deacons,</hi> and not <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Ministers,</hi> and yet published the Word, where the people were <hi>ignorant</hi>; yea you may see <hi>Act.</hi> 8. how all the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples except the Apostles, were by reason of a great persecution scattered throughout the regions of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> and they that <hi>were so scattered, went everywhere preaching the Word</hi> because the people among which they were, were ignorant, and there was no body else to do it. And God, having made known <hi>Christ</hi> unto them, they could not, but <hi>declare</hi> him unto others: the <hi>love</hi> both of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of their <hi>brethren</hi> constraining them. But this is in case of <hi>necessity,</hi> and <hi>where other faithful Christians</hi> are absent: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when Christians are present, <hi>no man can take that to himself, without the consent of all, which belongs to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, all <hi>Christians</hi> stand in need of this <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>spirit,</hi> to inable them to <hi>confess the word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To inable them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the word.</note> before <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> when they are called thereunto. Whereas without this power they would <hi>tremble,</hi> and bite in the truth. In the 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Mat.</hi> Christ tells his Disciples <hi>that they should be brought before Governours and Kings, for his names sake.</hi> But saith he, <hi>vers.</hi> 19. <hi>When they shall deliver you up, take no thought, how, or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that same hour, what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.</hi> Here <hi>Christ</hi> tels his Disciples that they should be brought before <hi>great</hi> men, yea before the <hi>greatest</hi> in the world, to give testimony to his truth. And surely, it is a very <hi>hard</hi> thing, for a man not to be <hi>daunted</hi> then, but to be unmoveable, before all worldly <hi>power</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> and all the terrible <hi>frowns</hi> and <hi>threats</hi> of mighty men. Now saith Christ at <hi>such</hi> a time, when you are to speak before the <hi>armed power</hi> of the world, be not troubled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>what</hi> to say. For if you have <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> in your <hi>hearts,</hi> you cannot want words in your <hi>mouths.</hi> And the truth which you profess is most <hi>glorious,</hi> when it is most <hi>naked,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65184:22"/>
and <hi>destitute</hi> of the garnishings of <hi>humane</hi> eloquence and wisdom. And therefore be not <hi>fearful</hi> before hand, no nor yet, <hi>careful,</hi> touching <hi>what</hi> you shall say; for it shall be <hi>given to you in that same hour,</hi> in that same <hi>moment;</hi> you shall have most <hi>present</hi> help. How so? <hi>for it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that dwels in you.</hi> The <hi>spirit of truth</hi> that dwels in you, shall inable you to speak the <hi>words of truth,</hi> when you are called to it. And though you, it may be, are <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>mean</hi> men, and your lips would <hi>tremble,</hi> and be quite <hi>closed up</hi> before such an <hi>Assembly of power,</hi> and <hi>Majesty</hi>: yet <hi>Gods spirit</hi> shall give you a <hi>mouth</hi> to speak, even <hi>then.</hi> And because, if you were only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with a <hi>mouth</hi> to speak at such a time, you would be ready to speak <hi>rashly,</hi> and <hi>foolishly,</hi> to the great prejudice, and disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the truth, therefore he will give you not only <hi>a mouth, but wisdom too</hi>; and he <hi>himself</hi> will manage his <hi>own</hi> cause with <hi>your</hi> mouths. And you shall so speak as all your <hi>adversaries,</hi> shall not be able to <hi>resist</hi> the truth that you speak, but shall be so convinced in their <hi>consciences,</hi> that their <hi>tongues</hi> shall not know what to say. You shall have, a <hi>mouth</hi> and <hi>wisdom,</hi> and they shall want <hi>both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, have many poor, mean, simple <hi>Christians,</hi> when brought before <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> been able to carry out the truth in that <hi>strength,</hi> that all their <hi>adversaries</hi> have been put to <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>shame,</hi> as you may see in a multitude of <hi>examples,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Martyrs.</hi> And all this they did, <hi>by the power of the Spirit coming upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, and lastly, all <hi>Christians</hi> stand in need of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to overcome <hi>afflictions</hi> and <hi>persecutions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">7. To overcome afflictions and persecutions.</note> from which it is <hi>impossible</hi> they should be free, in this world, they being <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to the world, and the whole world to them. A <hi>natural</hi> man, who hath no strength in himself, but his <hi>own</hi> strength, faints and fails under <hi>affliction</hi> and <hi>persecution:</hi> but the <hi>faithful</hi> have in them, strength <hi>above</hi> natural strength, <hi>strength</hi> above the strength of <hi>men,</hi> even the strength of the <hi>Spirit</hi> coming on them, and so they <hi>indure</hi> and <hi>overcome.</hi> Our spirits are <hi>weak</hi> spirits, and are <hi>conquered</hi> by every evil; but when they are strenghtned, by the power of <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit, they are, over all evils, <hi>more then Conquerors.</hi> And this is one thing observable, between <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> strength, in the overcoming of evil. <hi>Natural strength</hi> seeks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65184:23"/>
wayes to <hi>throw off</hi> the evil, and so it prevailes: but <hi>spiritual strength</hi> neever seeks the removing of the evil, but let the evil be what it will, it <hi>stands</hi> to it, and overcomes it. For the strength of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is easily able to <hi>overcome,</hi> all evils that can happen to flesh and bloud, whether they arise from <hi>earth</hi> or <hi>hell.</hi> And thus those blessed <hi>Martyrs</hi> mentioned <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. and thousands and ten thousands of their <hi>consorts</hi> since, have overcome, cruel mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and scourgings, and bonds, and imprisonment, and stoning, and sawing in sunder, and slaying with the sword, and all the woes of poverty and want, and banishment, and of living in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesses and caves, and dens of the earth; these and all other evils, they have mightily overcome, by this only <hi>power,</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> comming upon them. Thus we stand in need, of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to overcome affliction and persecution; and how much <hi>power</hi> we have, in <hi>affliction</hi> and <hi>persecution,</hi> to indure them and overcome them, just so much, of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> we have, and no more.</p>
            <p>And thus also, have I declared unto you what necessity, <hi>all Christians</hi> have, of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> coming on them as well as <hi>Ministers.</hi> And this was to strengthen the <hi>Vse</hi> of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Use,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Second use.</hi>
               </note> is for <hi>information</hi> and <hi>instruction,</hi> after this manner. If the receiving of the <hi>Spirit</hi> be the receiving of <hi>power,</hi> then it clearly informs us, that the way to <hi>partake</hi> of this power, is to <hi>obtain</hi> this Spirit: and the way to <hi>increase</hi> this <hi>power,</hi> is to <hi>increase</hi> this <hi>Spirit.</hi> I shall endeavour to speak to both these things, and so shall conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The way to obtain this <hi>power,</hi> is to obtain the Spirit.<note place="margin">The way to get this power, is to get this Spirit.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And that we may <hi>obtain</hi> the Spirit, we must first <hi>prepare</hi> our selves to <hi>receive</hi> the Spirit.<note place="margin">To this end we must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our selves.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Preparation</hi> doth not stand (as Papists teach,<note place="margin">Wherein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration doth not consist.</note> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ignorant persons among our selves think) in <hi>sweeping</hi> the soul from sin, and then <hi>strewing</hi> it with graces, that so we may be fit to receive the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For first, the <hi>sweeping</hi> of the soul from sin, is not a work of our <hi>own,</hi> before the coming of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but a work of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> it self, after it is come. For no <hi>flesh</hi> can clear the soul of <hi>one sin,</hi> it is the <hi>Spirit</hi> must do that.</p>
            <p>And secondly, for the <hi>strewing</hi> of the soul with <hi>grace,</hi> neither
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65184:23"/>
is this a work of our <hi>own,</hi> but a work of the <hi>Spirit</hi> it self, after it is come. For the <hi>Spirit</hi> it self, <hi>brings</hi> all grace with it, and before the comming of the Spirit, there is no grace at all.</p>
            <p>So that, <hi>we</hi> cannot, by any <hi>acts</hi> of our <hi>own,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wherein it doth.</note> prepare our selves to receive the <hi>Spirit</hi>; but only <hi>by the Spirit</hi> we prepare our selves <hi>to receive the Spirit.</hi> For it is not any work of our <hi>own,</hi> upon our selves, but the <hi>immediate</hi> work of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> upon us, that can make us fit to receive <hi>himself.</hi> It lies wholly in his own <hi>power</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> first to <hi>prepare</hi> in us a place for <hi>himself,</hi> and then after to <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>entertain</hi> himself, in that place he hath so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Now the <hi>workes</hi> of the Spirit, whereby he first <hi>prepares</hi> us for himself, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen <hi>entertaines</hi> himself in us, are these two especially.</p>
            <p>1. He <hi>empties</hi> us; and 2. he <hi>fills</hi> us with himself, whom he hath made empty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He empties us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. The Holy Spirit empties us.</note> And this <hi>emptying,</hi> is the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chief</hi> work of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> upon the Elect, whereby he <hi>prepares</hi> them to receive <hi>himself.</hi> For the more <hi>empty</hi> a man is of other things, the more <hi>capable</hi> he is of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> If you would fill a <hi>vessel,</hi> with any other <hi>liquor</hi> then it holds, you must first <hi>empty</hi> it, of all that is in it before; if you would fill it with <hi>Wine,</hi> you must empty it of <hi>Beer</hi> or <hi>Water,</hi> if any such liqour be in it. For two <hi>material</hi> things, cannot possibly subsist in the same <hi>place,</hi> at the same <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of each being safe and sound. And so if the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> who is God, must come into us: all <hi>mortal</hi> and <hi>unstable</hi> creatures, together with <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>our selves,</hi> and <hi>what ever</hi> else is in us, must go forth. Humane reason, and humane wisdom, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and power, and knowledge, cannot receive the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>: but we must be <hi>emptied</hi> of these, if ever we would <hi>receive</hi> him.</p>
            <p>We must thus <hi>suffer,</hi> our selves, to be <hi>prepared</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to receive the <hi>Spirit</hi>: but with this <hi>caution,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>A caution.</hi>
               </note> That when the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath wrought this in us, we do not <hi>attribute</hi> it to <hi>our selves,</hi> as our <hi>own</hi> work, nor think any thing of our selves, but descend into our own <hi>meer nothing.</hi> Otherwise we shall be a <hi>hinderance</hi> to the Spirit, that he cannot work in us after a more <hi>excellent</hi> manner.</p>
            <p>And when a man is thus <hi>empty</hi> of himself, and of <hi>other</hi> things, then he becomes <hi>poor in spirit,</hi> and such the Spirit alwayes <hi>fills,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Fills us.</note>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:65184:24"/>
and <hi>descends</hi> into with a wonderful and unresistible power, and fills the <hi>outer</hi> and <hi>inner</hi> man, and all the <hi>superior</hi> and <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> faculties of the soul, with <hi>himself,</hi> and all the things of God.</p>
            <p>And this is the <hi>second</hi> work of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to <hi>fill</hi> those whom he hath <hi>emptied.</hi> Now the usual and ordinary means,<note place="margin">The means are.</note> through which the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth this, are these three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The hearing of the Word</hi> preached.<note place="margin">1. The hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word.</note> But here we must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of the <hi>Word.</hi> For the <hi>Law</hi> is the word of God, but St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith that by <hi>that</hi> word <hi>the Spirit is not given,</hi> but by the Word of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And therefore how <hi>beautiful are the feet of them that bring the Gospel of peace</hi>! for nothing is so <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> as the word of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which brings with it the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> This you may see Act. 10.44. where it is said, <hi>that whilest Peter yet spake, the Holy Ghost fell on all them that heard the Word.</hi> And therefore also the <hi>Gospel</hi> is called the <hi>ministration of the Spirit</hi>; because as it <hi>proceeds</hi> from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> gives <hi>utterance,</hi> so it also <hi>conveyes</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> to the faithful. Now the gift of <hi>tongues</hi> and <hi>miracles,</hi> and other such like gifts are at the present ceased in the Church: but the gift of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is not ceased; and <hi>this,</hi> the Lord still joynes with the Ministery of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that he may keep up in our hearts the <hi>due respect</hi> of this ordinance, and may <hi>preserve</hi> us, from the wayes of those men, <hi>who seeek for the Spirit without the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Means, is <hi>faith</hi> in the word heard. For it is not <hi>every</hi> one, that <hi>hears</hi> the word, that <hi>receives</hi> the Spirit: but onely <hi>they,</hi> that hear with the <hi>hearing of faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </note> For if thou <hi>hear</hi> the word of the <hi>Gospel</hi> a thousand times, and wantest <hi>faith,</hi> thou shalt never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Spirit</hi>; for <hi>unbeleef,</hi> shuts up the heart against the Spirit, and ever <hi>opposes</hi> and <hi>resists</hi> the Spirit, and never <hi>receives</hi> it. But <hi>faith</hi> opens the heart to receive the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>faith,</hi> we lay hold on <hi>Christ</hi> in the word: and through our <hi>union</hi> with Christ, we obtain the <hi>Spirit.</hi> For we have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>immediately</hi> in it self, but in the <hi>flesh</hi> of Christ. And when we, by <hi>faith</hi> are made the <hi>flesh</hi> of Christ, then we partake of that <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that dwels in the <hi>flesh of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now through these <hi>two</hi> things, the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> communicates to us <hi>a new birth</hi>; it begets us unto God: and so we partaking of the <hi>nature</hi> of God, partake also of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65184:24"/>
God. They are born of <hi>men,</hi> have nothing in them but the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>men</hi> but they that are born of <hi>God</hi> have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God. <hi>That which is born of the flesh is flesh,</hi> &amp; hath no spirit in it; but that <hi>which is born of the Spirit, is spirit,</hi> and hath <hi>spirit</hi> in it. So that there is no means to partake of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God but by being <hi>born</hi> of God: and the means by which we are born of God, are the <hi>Word</hi> &amp; <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Means is <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               </note> For Christ hath said, <hi>the Spirit is given to them that aske.</hi> And the Disciples when they were to receive the promise of the Spirit, <hi>continued with one accord in prayer and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi> Act. 1.14. For God who hath promised to <hi>give</hi> us his <hi>Spirit,</hi> hath commanded us to <hi>aske</hi> it: and when God hath a <hi>minde</hi> to give us the Spirit, he puts us in <hi>minde</hi> to ask it: yea God <hi>gives</hi> us the Spirit, that by it we may <hi>ask</hi> the Spirit, seeing no man can <hi>ask</hi> the Spirit, but by the Spirit. Now in <hi>asking</hi> the Spirit, there is no difference, whether we <hi>ask</hi> it of the <hi>Father</hi> or of the <hi>Son,</hi> seeing the <hi>Spirit</hi> proceeds from <hi>both,</hi> and is the Spirit of <hi>both.</hi> And therefore <hi>Christ,</hi> promiseth the sending of the Spirit from <hi>both.</hi> From the Father, Joh. 14. <hi>The Spirit which the Father will send in my name.</hi> From himself, Joh. 16. <hi>Except I go, the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not come: but if I go I will send him to you.</hi> So that both the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> give the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and it is no matter whether we ask him, either of the <hi>Father,</hi> or of the <hi>Son,</hi> so we ask him, of the Father <hi>in</hi> the Son, or of the Son <hi>in</hi> the Father.</p>
            <p>And thus you see the way, to obtain this <hi>power,</hi> is to obtain the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and also by what <hi>means</hi> this is done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The way to <hi>increase</hi> this power,<note place="margin">2. The Way to increase this power.</note> is to increase the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And therefore it is as <hi>needful</hi> for us, to know the means to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease</hi> the Spirit, as to <hi>receive</hi> it. And they among others are these:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To continue in the use of the Word.</hi> As the <hi>Spirit</hi> is first <hi>given</hi> by the word, so by the same word it is <hi>increased</hi>; and the more any Christian is in the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> the stronger and more vigorous and mighty is the <hi>Spirit</hi> in him: but the <hi>neglect</hi> of the word, is the <hi>quenching of the Spirit.</hi> Let a <hi>Christian,</hi> that is <hi>strong</hi> in the spirit, neglect the <hi>word</hi> a while, and he will soon become <hi>weak,</hi> and as a man without strength. For the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed</hi> on us, but through the <hi>word,</hi> neither doth it <hi>dwell</hi> in us, but by the <hi>word</hi>; and the more the <hi>word</hi> dwels in our hearts by <hi>faith,</hi> the more the <hi>spirit</hi> dwells in our hearts by the <hi>word.</hi> And according to the <hi>measure</hi> of the <hi>word</hi> in us, is the measure of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65184:25"/>2. <hi>To increase faith.</hi> For the more we <hi>beleeve,</hi> the more we receive of <hi>Christ</hi>; and the more we receive of <hi>Christ,</hi> the more we receive of the <hi>spirit,</hi> in Christ. For <hi>faith</hi> doth not apprehend <hi>bare</hi> Christ, but Christ with his <hi>Spirit,</hi> because these are <hi>inseparable.</hi> Now alwayes according to the measure of <hi>Christ</hi> in us is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the <hi>spirit</hi>; and according to the measure of <hi>faith,</hi> is the measure of <hi>Christ</hi> in us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To be much in prayer.</hi> For the <hi>prayer</hi> of the spirit, <hi>increases</hi> the spirit. The <hi>more</hi> we have the <hi>spirit,</hi> the more we <hi>pray</hi>; and the <hi>more</hi> we <hi>pray,</hi> the <hi>more</hi> we receive the <hi>spirit.</hi> So that when we have the <hi>spirit</hi> in truth, we shall have daily, a greater and greater <hi>increase</hi> of it, till we be <hi>filled with the spirit.</hi> For the <hi>spirit</hi> comes from <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom is the <hi>fulness</hi> of the spirit, and carries us back again to <hi>Christ,</hi> that we may receive still <hi>more</hi> of the spirit. And so by the <hi>spirit</hi> that is in our <hi>hearts,</hi> we lay hold on the spirit that is in <hi>Christ,</hi> and receive more and more of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>To turn our selves daily from the creature to God.</hi> For the more we <hi>inlarge</hi> our hearts, towards the <hi>creature,</hi> the less capable are we of the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> For to live much upon the <hi>creature,</hi> is to live much according to the <hi>flesh,</hi> and this quenches and strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the <hi>spirit</hi> in us. And therefore we must live <hi>abstractedly</hi> from the creatures; and so <hi>use</hi> them, as if we did <hi>not</hi> use them: and so <hi>minde</hi> them, as if we did <hi>not</hi> minde them: and <hi>abandon</hi> the contents and satisfactions of flesh and blood, and <hi>wean</hi> our selves from all things but the <hi>necessities of nature.</hi> And the more <hi>free</hi> and <hi>loose</hi> we are from the <hi>creature,</hi> the more <hi>capable</hi> are we of <hi>Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and the <hi>operations</hi> of it. He that lives at greatest <hi>distance</hi> from the <hi>world,</hi> and hath least communion with the <hi>things</hi> of it, hath alwayes the <hi>greatest</hi> proportion of <hi>Gods spirit.</hi> For as the Apostle saith, <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Father</hi> (that is, the Holy Spirit) <hi>is not in him:</hi> so, if any man love the <hi>Father,</hi> the love of the <hi>world</hi> is not in <hi>him</hi>: now the <hi>more,</hi> any one loves the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>less</hi> he loves the <hi>world:</hi> and the <hi>less</hi> he loves the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>more</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> dwels in him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>To cease daily from our own works.</hi> The more we act <hi>our selves,</hi> the less doth the <hi>Spirit</hi> act in us. And therefore we must must from day to day, <hi>cease</hi> from our <hi>own</hi> works, from the <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of our <hi>own</hi> minds, and understandings, and wils, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65184:25"/>
and must not be the <hi>Authors</hi> of our own <hi>actions.</hi> For we being <hi>flesh</hi> our selves, what ever we do is <hi>fleshly,</hi> seeing the <hi>effect</hi> cannot be better then the <hi>cause.</hi> And if we <hi>mingle,</hi> the works of our <hi>flesh,</hi> with the works of Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> he will <hi>cease</hi> from working in us. But the <hi>less</hi> we <hi>act</hi> in our selves, according to the principles of our <hi>corrupt nature,</hi> the <hi>more</hi> will the <hi>spirit</hi> act in us, according to the principles of the <hi>divine nature.</hi> But our <hi>own works,</hi> are alwayes a mighty <hi>impediment,</hi> to the <hi>operations</hi> of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To <hi>encrease</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> in us, <hi>we must give up our selves to the Spirit, that he only may work in us, without the least opposition and resistance from us.</hi> That, as the <hi>soul</hi> acts all in the <hi>body,</hi> and the body doth nothing of <hi>it self,</hi> but is subject to the <hi>soul</hi> in all things: so the <hi>spirit</hi> may do all in us, and we may do nothing of <hi>our selves</hi> without the Spirit, but be <hi>subject</hi> to the Spirit in all its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the Spirit of God, cannot work <hi>excellently</hi> in us, except it work <hi>all in all</hi> in us. And in such a man, in whom the <hi>Spirit</hi> hath <hi>full</hi> power, the Spirit works many <hi>wonderful</hi> things, that he according to <hi>humane</hi> sense is <hi>ignorant</hi> of. For as the <hi>soul,</hi> doth secretly nourish, and cherish, and refresh the <hi>body,</hi> and disperses <hi>life</hi> and <hi>spirits</hi> through it, even when the body is <hi>asleep,</hi> and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>feels</hi> it, nor <hi>knows</hi> it: so the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> dwelling in the soul, by a <hi>secret</hi> kinde of operation, <hi>works</hi> many things in it, for the <hi>quickning,</hi> and <hi>renewing</hi> it, whilst it oftentimes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, is not so much as <hi>sensible</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The seventh means, to <hi>encrease</hi> the <hi>spirit, is to attribute the works of the spirit to the spirit,</hi> and not to <hi>our selves.</hi> For if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the <hi>flesh,</hi> the works of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> and take from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the glory of his <hi>own</hi> works, he will work no longer in us. Wherefore we must <hi>ascribe</hi> unto the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>whole glory</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> works, and acknowledge that <hi>we our selves</hi> are <hi>nothing,</hi> and can <hi>do</hi> nothing: and that it is <hi>he</hi> only, that <hi>is</hi> all in all, and <hi>works</hi> all in all: and we <hi>our selves,</hi> among all the <hi>excellent</hi> works of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in us, must so remain, as if we <hi>were</hi> and <hi>wrought</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; that so, all that is of <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> may be laid low in us, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> alone may be exalted: first to <hi>do</hi> all in us: and then, to have <hi>all</hi> the <hi>glory,</hi> of <hi>all</hi> that is done.</p>
            <p>And thus you see the means to <hi>encrease</hi> the Spirit, and so consequently <hi>strength,</hi> as well as to <hi>get</hi> it. And by the daily <hi>use</hi> and <hi>improvement</hi> of these means, we may attain to a <hi>great degree</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:65184:26"/>
of spiritual strength, that we may <hi>walk and not be weary</hi>: and may <hi>run and not faint,</hi> and may mount up as <hi>Eagles,</hi> yea, and may walk as <hi>Angels</hi> among men, and as the <hi>powers of heaven</hi> upon earth, to his praise and honour, who first communicates to us his own strength, and then by that strength of his own, works all our works in us: And thus is he <hi>glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe.</hi>
