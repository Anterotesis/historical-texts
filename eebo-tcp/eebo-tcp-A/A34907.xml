            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE GENUINE CHARACTER OF A <hi>DEIST.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A <hi>Deiſt Reduplicatively Conſidered,</hi> falling neither under the Laws of Deſcription, nor legitimat Definition, may be called a meer. <hi>I wot not what.</hi> Nor can we have a notion of him any other way, than the Vulgar has of <hi>Nothing,</hi> when they define it, <hi>A Bodileſs Shirt wanting the Sleeves, viz.</hi> By Amputation of all Realities, Yet I'm of Opinion, that he is more apoſitly termed, <hi>An accidental ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregat of Contradictions actually exiſtent,</hi> which is the greateſt Paradox, that ever was offered to a Philoſopher. Or an <hi>Eas rationis objectively taken, not only having an Ideal, but a real exiſtence:</hi> Which is a Degree beyond any Sophiſter, that ever pretended to that <hi>Chimaera.</hi> And hence we have light in the very Fundamentals of his <hi>Non-ſenſe;</hi> firſt why he is ſo virulent in propugning his beloved <hi>Fortuitous concourſe:</hi> And why <hi>impoſſibile eſt idem ſimul eſſe et non eſſe, eodem reſpectu:</hi> with other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the like Quality, has ſo little weight with him: Seing he can produce himſelf, as an undeniable conviction of their Falſities. He may be fitly called an incomparable Hero of Wit, and is truely as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable by Reaſon, as the <hi>Baſs</hi> by blank Powder; having not left ſo much as <hi>Archimedes</hi> his <hi>Punctum</hi> for you to build upon. And that day, in which you prove any thing againſt him, at leaſt convince him that you have done ſo; <hi>I'l prove the Moon to be made of Green Cheeſe;</hi> eſpecially ſo long as he keeps his <hi>Achil<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>an diſtinction; Secundum veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, cognoſcendi modum Co. Secundum meam nego.</hi> He pretends to be a great Friend to Reaſon, which nevertheleſs he's as much acquainted with, as an Aſs with <hi>Mathematicks;</hi> and truely ere you and he agree, you muſt diveſt your ſelf of that Armour; for he's a Sceptick of the firſt Magnitude, and the chiefeſt of that ſize too; for diſcourſe him upon never ſo cleat and evident Truths, you muſt of neceſſity run in <hi>Infinitum</hi> to prove 'em; ſince he acknowledges no Principles, further than they ſerve his turn. And I dare ſwear he'd put a crack-brain'd Philoſopher out of his Witts, either to prove or defend, that it were himſelf. He's <hi>General Generaliſſimo of Sophisters;</hi> for ſo long as he keeps within the Burrows of his Warren, which are contrived more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially for his purpoſe, than <hi>Daedalus</hi> his <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> you'l never catch him: And if you follow him in, I'l promiſe you a Foil before you come out again, ſeing he has deprived you of the Cord of Reaſon to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45476:7"/>
lead your way back. For he applys the objects of Senſe to be judg'd by the Intellect, <hi>&amp; vice verſa;</hi> and that ſo dextrouſly, that in all the Juſtice of he World he might be dub'd Knight-errant of <hi>Jugling</hi> or <hi>Leiger-demain;</hi> and for this end, he has prepared an Helmet of Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and a compleat Coat of Armour conſiſting of loud Laughter, huffing and nauſeating diſdain for a Sheild with this motto, <hi>Nego totum etiam antequam audiverim:</hi> His Lance is made of Reviling, Calumniat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Curſing and Lying: his Sword is much of affinity to the ſame Mettal, being fram'd of Sophiſtical quibbles, having as little connexion among themſelves, as dependence upon the ſelf-evident principles of Reaſon. And how can any conceive it to be otherwiſe when it was forged by the Father of Lyes, upon the Anvil of Falſitie And whereas a Chriſtian has no back-peice to be a Defence in his flight, he hath this to brag of above him, that he has one, which is a Sluggiſh Careleſsneſs whatever come of his Opinion, providing that his Body be well. You'd think that he were a Monkiſh <hi>Hermite</hi> at his Devotion, if you ſaw how ſeriouſly he looks, when he deplores the World's Stupidity in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Reaſonable Service</hi> to God their Creator, Preſerver and Redeemer. He bears the ſame Love to Church-Men, that Cats does to Muſtard: for he Wrayes his Face bitterly when he ſees or hears 'em; &amp; it's no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if we conſider that ther's as much Enmity betwixt them, as between a <hi>Baſalisk</hi> and a Man. He's ſo great a lover of Monarchy, that to have a pretence to the Title, he's content to attribute the ſame to all Mankind; and to have it <hi>Abſolute,</hi> he calls all civil power ſuch, whether it be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocracy, Democracy, or Monarchy. And to attain his End (as he thinks) the more honourably, he rejects the Notions of Good and Evil, but in ſo far as they contribute to, or opugn his Deſigns: As likewiſe thoſe of Juſtice, and Injuſtice. Before mutual Paction, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves never to make ſure, as long as he can keep his darling of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Reſervation,</hi> and that he may turn his Coat with the times under the pretence of Reaſon, he has learned this among the reſt from his Apoſtle <hi>Hobb's,</hi> to keep ſtive with the Strongeſt. and will cite that of the Poet, <hi>Tempora mutantur &amp; nos mutamur in illis,</hi>

               </gap> for a ſufficient Authority. He is ſo biggor on Singularity and Fame that to acquire both, he feeds on Nonſenſe, as Toads does on Filth &amp; Venom And becauſe he cannot be ſingular for Rationality, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Attribute of human Nature; he degrades himſelf to a Beaſt, and turns Irrational. He diſdains I Confeſs to ſwear in any one Philoſopher's
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45476:8"/>
words, but under the Notion of philoſophick Libertie, and free uſe of Reaſon, has ſtored the Magazine of his Brain, with all the ridicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fopprie, that either fell by Inadvertancy, Contention, Malice or Ignorance, from the pens of Ancient and Modern Philoſophers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he's highly enamoured, with <hi>Ariſtotel's Eternity of the world, paucis mutatis,</hi> with <hi>Epicure's</hi> Denial of Providence, and fortuitous production of the Univerſe, with his denial of the Souls Immortality; and eſpecially with his Aſſertion that temporal Pleaſure is the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> or laſt-end of Mankind, and enveighs againſt <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> for ſpending ſo much pains in vindicating the <hi>Old Dottard</hi> from this Brand of Infamy, which he accounts his chiefeſt Glory. Nor is he leſs taken with <hi>Des Cates</hi> his Dubitation, adoring it as a chief Pillar of his Scepticiſm and his Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, with the aſſertion, <hi>that Mater and motion being granted, all cou'd fall out as they are, without the concurrance of an inteligent Over-ruling Power.</hi> This differing nothing from <hi>Epicure,</hi> but that the Particles lack a <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> to hoble and dance in. He likewiſe animadvrerts an admirable Congruence, betwixt this Author's <hi>Clock-works animals,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> his deniall of the Souls Immortality; <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Men and Beaſts vary only in the more and the leſs.</hi> He no leſs ſavours this Authors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of the Conſideration of Final Cauſes in <hi>Phiſicks,</hi> interpreting it to be an implicite denial of Providence. But leaſt I weary you with his Nonſenfe, it ſhall ſuffice to indicat what for a Philoſopher he is, to declar what curſed Author's are his deareſt darlings; which are, firſt the excellent Head-pice of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> the incomparable (for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to Wit,) <hi>Theologue and Philoſoph Spinoza,</hi> with <hi>Lucretius Redivivus,</hi> I mean <hi>Blunt's Oracles of Nonſenſe.</hi> He's ſo great an Affector of Novelties (&amp; that ſo much the more in how much they contradict Senſe &amp; Reaſon) that he looks upon the Author's of them, as ſecond <hi>Solomons,</hi> or third <hi>Cato's</hi> fall'n from Heav'n And although, he reject all Hiſtories that are above Fourty Years old, for meer <hi>Romances,</hi> yet, he is as didactical, in in the Embrios of his Fancy, which he thinks may ſerve his turn any way, as if you had ſeen it with your Eyes; tho' he feign it to have been done Fourty Thouſand Years ſince. And hence it is, that he will rather believe, that there are <hi>Roſy-cruſian Chimiſts</hi> wand'ring about the World in aereal <hi>Vehicles,</hi> than that there ever was ſuch a Man as <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Iulius Caeſar;</hi> for which cauſe he has a very ill guſt of Mr <hi>Lock's Moral way of Demonſtration,</hi> however well he may pleaſe other parts of his works
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45476:8"/>
But to extricat our ſelves from this ſtinking Tale, he's a tranſcendental Evil (which is another Paradox, or rather, Rhetorical Hyperboly, tho' not ſo far ſtrain'd as <hi>Sublimi feriam ſidera vertice)</hi> or if you will, he is a Conſtellation fix'd in direct oppoſition to all Good, compoſed of Malice, Hatred and Self-conceit, which two firſt, are as inſeparable from the laſt, as Heat from Fire; and is truely the greateſt plague that can be in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>flicted on a human <hi>Society,</hi> tho' he accounts himſelf the <hi>primum mobile</hi> of it. He ſurpaſſes the moſt malevolent of all the Devils, in every thing except knowledge; and happy is't for the World that 'tis ſo ordred, for had he knowledge preportionate to his Diabolical Qualities, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade Lucifer, and lead the Van of Hell himſelf; for fear of whoſe Tyranny the Furies themſelves would tremble. If you ſpeak ſeriouſly to him he'll ſwear you're an <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> and 'tis as great folly to diſcourſe him that way, as to read Moral Diſſertations to an Aſs. He's a meer Ape mounted on the pegaſian Wings of a rampant Imagination, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to rove in an imaginary <hi>Vacuity,</hi> where he egarly purſues the Quary which his ill-codled Brains exhibites to him; ignorant that he ſhall incontinently tumble into the infinite Abyſs of a bottomleſs Pit. Or, he's a Galleaſs of the firſt Rate, of the kingdom of Darkneſs, toſs'd by the wind of Pride in an Ocean of Folly, were the Devil perſonally drives at the Helm. Finally, he's the Excrements of the Creation, the ultimat Butt of God's Wrath, the Subject of Satan's laughter, and Object of Mans Deriſion; <hi>Where we leave him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having put a Period to our Conception of a <hi>Deiſt,</hi> we ſhall in the laſt place preſent the Reader with that Unerring Character which the Spirit of God deſcribes them by, in the Oracles of Truth. Which may ſerve, if not for the Conviction of their ſeared Conſciences, yet both for the eſtabliſhing of wavering or weak Chriſtians, and for corroborating or encouraging the ſtronger. And may be unto us as a Mirror, in which we may evidently contemplat the Immenſity of God's Love and Providence, in giving us a Watch-word againſt ſo ſtrong Deluſion; which (as our Saviour Himſelf affirms) wou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Elect, if it were poſſible.</p>
