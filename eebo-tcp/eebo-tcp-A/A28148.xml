         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Persecuting Episcopalians, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>TO that Spirit, in the power of the living God of
Heaven and Earth, I affirm; that there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Lilly sprang up, as also an eternal River
flowing freely (without money or outward price)
through the Nations; the Root of the one being as far out
of your reach to destroy (though you do dig as deep as Hell)
as the immense Fountain and everlasting Current of the other
is out of your vultrous sight, which way to withhold from the
heart and conscience of the truly thirsty: For our Testimony
in the Light of Jesus, from that eternal Fountain, is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and clear, and shall have its full and infallible effect,
though now resisted by the whole seed of evil-doers to the
utmost of their perishing strength; and the numberless and
most immerciful Cruelties which you inflict upon the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
People of God, are so far from depressing the everlasting
Gospel which we preach, Us, or our faithful Testimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
and against your false ways and abominations, that it doth,
&amp; shall add life &amp; growth to the truth of our for-ever blessed
and most precious Cause, and cause your selves indellibly to
be recorded to Posterity as you are, when the Name of the
holy Witnesses to, &amp; Martyrs for, the Truth of our God shall
remain as a sweet-smelling savour, living for ever, though
their Bodies die by your hands. And some of our very little
ones [now living] shall rejoyce in their souls before the Lord
God of their Fathers, that they were the off-spring of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
or that their parents in any measure stood faithful to
God in this your day of heavy Persecution. And that I am
in the eternal sight of this, if my God think me worthy, I am
ready to seal with my Blood, though my Sepulcher, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
this Truth, should be on the Bridge and four Gates
of your City.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93340:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And, as though that accursed womb of your bloody Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to wit, <hi>Newgate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that now dismal Pest-house, were not
big enough to devour the Sheep of Jesus your Saviour, in
which, as Prisoners for the Truth, at least Forty of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Lambs called <hi>Quakers</hi> have laid down their Lives
(through, as is most like, the Pestilential infection of that
place) since the Lord's just hand of Vengeance hath brought
it upon these your Cities of many Whoredoms, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of their sorrows: Beside, about Sixty of the same
Royal Seed and Fold, have been Prisoners till death in that
one Goal since your Act against Conscience was made, also
sealing their Testimony with their Blood, as became the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
of the Most High. And yet, as if all this innocent Blood,
with the rest of your innumerable Imprisonments, Blows,
and Bruises, unjust Fining, Praemuniring, Confiscating of
Estates, making Widows and Fatherless, ruining Families,
frequent shedding our Blood in your Streets and Canels, at
our holy Meetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were not enough even to implore as
it were Gods further Vengeance
upon your heads,<note n="†" place="margin">When as the Blood of one innocent man is fully able to overthrow a Nation, much more a hundred, two prophane superstitious and hypocritical Cities.</note> you drag and
drive from that your Goale of
<hi>Newgate</hi> at one time,<note n="*" place="margin">Besides at three other times very lately before you dragg'd out of that Goal, and in like manner forced on shipboard, eighteen inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent true men, called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi> whereof one of them, through your most savage usage, immediately as you had forced him on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board fell down upon the deck, and soon after dyed.</note> to the
Water-side, and there force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Barge, Boat, or Boats, Fifty
four of the Servants of your Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
from thence hurry towards
an old sorry rotten Ship, which
was ordered to receive &amp; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them beyond the Seas, like
Slaves and Vagabonds, for no
other offence given to you, on
their parts, but only serving the
living God according to his most
holy way: to which bad Vessel
side these freeborn Innocents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, and not having free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in the Lord, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of your Goalors and their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93340:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Accomplices, voluntarily or actively to go in to the<note n="†" place="margin">In which one among your selves (in no mean autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) said, he would not sail to <hi>Gravesend</hi> in, to have her.</note> Ship
themselves, thereby to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a crime, or that criminal,
which God, in the Law of his
Christ our Redeemer, allows (to
wit) their meeting often together
to wait, &amp; call upon his most holy
Name in Spirit and Truth, without restriction of time, place
or number; for obeying this Royal Law of God, conferr'd
on the Universe in the Messias, our Immanuel, the absolute
Supream and alone Head of our Church, and disobeying your
Edict to the contrary, they are sentenced to Banishment;
I say, because of this, with a good conscience, they could not
voluntarily go into the Ship, and consent to their own unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
aswel as unlawful, Banishment and Slavery. The
Souldiers, and some of the superactive baser sort (of whom
<hi>Paul</hi> complained) that were imployed by you to drive and
hale the Innocent, like Sheep to your slaughter (who resisted
them not) without tenderness or contrition, by way of scorn,
cryed, <hi>Throw out the Tackle, throw out the Tackle, that we may
hale up the Kings Goods:</hi> which accordingly they did, fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it about the Bodies of the Innocent, and so slung up into
the Ship the Lambs of the living God, as they do Cattel and
other Lading: who indeed, as found faithful (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the derision of the <hi>Ishmaels</hi> of this age) are the good and
peculiar Treasure of the KING of Kings, for whose sake
earthly Kings and Rulers have, and again will be rebuked in
the day of further Revelation of his most terrible Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which hastens.</p>
            <p>Being thus inhumanely, and utterly contrary to the Law of
this Land, forced on Shipboard; their Lodging (such as it
was) was appointed under a base low Deck, where they were
ramm'd together like other Stowage; and this very bad Ship
being bulgy, leaky, or the like, the Water came in upon them,
and ran frequently under them where they lay: by which
means, and the suffocatious heat that might arise through
their being so cramb'd together (it's like) the Pestilence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
among them, whereof at least <hi>Twenty seven</hi> of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93340:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Bodies of these [so misused] <hi>fifty four</hi> are dead. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Ship is yet unsailed, riding at anchor in the
River of <hi>Thames,</hi> Gods just judgment having overtaken her
Master, who was about three moneths-since clapt up in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for debt, the Mate having left him and the Ship, several
of the Mariners being dead of the Pestilence, others of them
come away, whether convinced of the unlawfulness of their
undertaking, I shall not here determine, having not spoken
with the men face to face; but of this I am certainly enform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That the more ruffinlier sort, who stayed behind, did,
or threatned to fire Guns after them, when they left the
Ship and came on Shore: this being put altogether, <hi>Viz.</hi>
what has befallen the Ship-Master, his Mate leaving him,
the death of several of the Mariners, and some of them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
the rest, the Ship as yet unable to sail, having been
clear'd at the Custom-house about a Quarter of a year since;
Who sees not the hand of God against these accursed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings?
Yet so blind, or rather wilfully wicked you are, that
I have not heard that any one, in considerable authority,
hath so much as endeavoured that the rest of these, yet living
Innocents, might be released from their, so unjust, cruel Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
and Banishment; but on the contrary, I have heard
some in their stiffneckedness blasphemously say, <hi>Cannot your
God defend you from the Plague, in Prison, out of Prison, at Sea
or Land?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To such I plainly answer, as a living man yet upon the
Earth; <hi>My God can preserve me if he please, and I do believe in
my heart will, if it be for his glory, and that he hath any further
service for me to do among ye; if not, his eternal will be done in
Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> And I am as fully assured, that if it
had stood with his most holy will, and that in his uncompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
wisdom he had seen it meet, to have made those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents
further or otherwise more eminently serviceable to
Him, and his Truth upon the Earth, He could and would
have delivered them out of your hands, or in your hands,
under this your most vile usage, preserved them from your
drinking their innocent bloud; but then, if not for this, and
such like doings, how should the measure of your iniquities
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93340:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be filled up? However, we have not at any time preached or
affirmed, that our outward bodies were immortal, but liable,
for the confirmation of our immortal Testimony, even to
suffer by your Spirit and Generation much outward misery,
unnatural cruelties, death, and what not; as was our blessed
Saviour, his holy Disciples and Followers by those Jews
and Monarchs of Old, in whose dayes they appeared on the
Earth; and they were as obnoxious and odious to their then
Hierarchy &amp; Monarchy as the right true Christian man, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Quaker,</hi> is now to yours; and all your Jewish usage of us
his now Disciples and Servants, we as really feel, as he and
his did theirs. Nevertheless, were I sure to dye many deaths
by your hands, whilst I continue in Gods fear, I cannot fear
you, because you are so very wicked and unjust:</p>
            <p>But,
<q>
                  <l>If you could the Soul destroy, as well as th' Body kill;</l>
                  <l>You were indeed then <hi>much</hi> to be fear'd for doing ill.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And that it hath pleased the infinite wise God that in this
common calamity, which is come upon the Nation because
of your unparalleld abominations (and that no flesh may
arise to glory in his sight) some of our bodies who have not
sin'd with you, fall with, or rather by you, do not therefore
rejoyce as the former Jews (uncircumcised in heart and
ears) did, over Jesus the just one, and the then holy People
that believed in his testimony; saying, <hi>That he was as one
smitten or forsaken. He that hath saven others let him now save
himself.</hi> And that his good Apostle was <hi>a perverter of their
Laws; a sower of Sedititon; a turner of the world upside down,
&amp;c.</hi> I say, do not hereby stiffen your necks, nor strengthen
your ungodly hands against the Lord and his Anointed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the outward Bodies of the Godly and Prophane dye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:
for when they (the former Jews) thus drank innocent
blood, and magnified themselves against the innocent and
righteous, then loe their destruction was nigh; and behold
yours slumbers not, and the dregs of the Cup, without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of pitty, you shall as surely drink at the hands of our
God, as you now Torment, Banish, and drink the Bloud of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93340:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
us his People and Servants. And alas, poor animals, for
what you can in the mean time do against our Rock, or us in
him; You do but in your most impetuous wills fight with the
wind, and in very great confusion beat the air of your own
imaginations; for we know right well you are limited by him
whose Seed you would limit. And I sensibly declare unto
you, by the authority, and in the power of the living God,
the Root of that Lilly or Vine from which we sprang up, into
which by the grace of his Eternal Love we are ingrafted,
and in which, through infinite mercy, we grow and prosper in
the Lord, cannot be prevailed against; and in the end you
will as surely feel and find it so, as ever you were born. For
the Mountain of the House of our God, is, must, and shall
be established upon the Top of all unholy Mountains what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
And have you not heard, and every since we were
a People, we have carried our Lives in our hands? And is it
not manifestly seen and known to all men now living in
these Nations, who are not wilfully blind, that through the
God of our Life that strengthens us, we have not valued
our Liberties, outward Estates, Preferments, even Lives
and all, to the death, in comparison of our <hi>Faithful Testimony</hi>
for Gods immortal and most glorious Truth, before you, that
now are, were in outward Power? And have we not in this
your day of <hi>thrice woful and heavy Persecution,</hi> again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
confirmed and sealed this our Testimony with our blood,
and the purely offering up of all that hath been near and dear
unto us as men? And is there not so much as one considerate
considerable <hi>Gamaliel</hi> among you, to consider these things?
However, let not the prophane, so much as think in their
dark sensuality, who were never known of themselves, to
conquer any thing, but themselves with Drink, Whordoms,
Violences, Oathes, and such like Bestialities, to overcome us
who believe and walk in the Light, who have taken up the
Cross of Christ Jesus for our Armour, in which we sensibly
feel the power of God leading to, and surrounding us in his
salvation. Nay, nay, be it known unto you all, that do but
so much as think or wish ill to <hi>Israel</hi> this day, there are
among us who in the power of the Lamb are more than
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93340:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Conquerors over whatsoever it's possible for you to say, do,
or think to do against us for Truth: and unto such a strange
thing cannot befal, neither any evil tidings from you affright
them, because we fear not as you fear, neither hope as you
hope; for while we live, we love to serve our Creator, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
gladly to obey the motions and commands of the Law of
his Spirit, written in our hearts, rather than so much as taste
of the pleasures, or rather bondage, of your not to be parallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wickednesses, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> shal last you but for a season (mark that)
so that when he who gave us breath (creating us and you to
serve and obey him) is pleased to call for our souls, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his fear (out of your false fear, vain hope and glory)
we are ready with joy and gladness to answer to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
who saith, <hi>Come ye blessed, enter into eternal rest, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the Lambs of the fold, &amp;c.</hi> But with the Swearer, Lyer,
Whoremonger, Superstitious, Idolater, and ungodly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Persecutor of Gods Innocent Flock, it cannot be so;
for they shall then dread (though they now make merry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Lords Witness and Witnesses) that most dreadful and
irrevocable malediction, <hi>Go ye cursed;</hi> yea, when such come
to dye, the Light of Christ Jesus (with which every man is
enlightned that comes into the World) shall arise in the
Conscience to the utter condemnation of all those who in
their life-time have despised or disobeyed it. Then shall
the betrayers of the Just, and hard-hearted imprisoners of
the innocent to death, for obeying it, know what it is to be a
<hi>Iudas</hi> or a <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> Then shall the worldly-wise and rich,
with the false divining Hireling, their frontier and leader,
who serpent-like, to save self, have bowed to, and even
twisted about every green and dry tree, that in the deceit
hath stood up, feel the Parable of <hi>Dives,</hi> and know that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
the poor, poor in Spirit, in the faithfulness, is the Seed that
doth and must inherit.</p>
            <p>Now if you be men, and would be deemed in any measure
rational to posterity, for what you do, &amp; have done against us,
positively declare what's the evil these People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
as a people, have done, or if you have ought against them
but for their worshipping the living God of Heaven and
Earth, in Spirit, Truth, and Righteousness: nay farther, if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93340:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they have left undone any thing that they ought to have done;
in the Spirit of God, and according to the Scriptures of
Truth, make it appear: for our souls delight to be, and are
subject to the higher, or highest power: and in my heart I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
most willingly, and for conscience sake, actively to be
obedient to every Ordinance of man, which is, or shall be
made for the Lords sake; I say, by plain Scripture, command
of Jesus our Lord, or pure example from his holy Apostles,
detect our principle and practice if you can; and without
supposition or false allegation, orderly set forth to the world
what detriment we have brought upon the <hi>good People</hi> of these
Nations, since it pleased the Lord first to raise us up therein;
and also what the evil is that we have done you, who have
thus spilt and drank our blood without Mercy. Have we
done ought against you, except reprove you for your rending
and damming, Superstition and Idolatry, prophane and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly,
as well as antichristian Persecution, with the rest of
your superabounding evils and uncleanesses, in which you
wallow, that you might repent, amend your lives and be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
I say again, produce your charge against us under your
hands, plainly and directly setting forth and declaring mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact only, without allegation, dubious supposition, or
any manner of clandestine trick or intreague of State-Policy,
dissonant to Scripture, or forreign to the matter; that it may
be transmitted to the ends of the earth, or at least so far as
your spirit hath traduced, or made odious, us, or our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
that all reasonable and unprejudiced people in the
world, may judge whether it bear in it cause enough thus to
kill us in your Coals and Holes, force and banish us out
of our Nation, where of we are as free-born as your selves.
And when you have thus manifestly, plainly and publickly
emitted your charge into the world, then lay by your
Swords, Clubs, Goals, and ungodly Laws, and bring forth
your Priests also, (with whom, if not for whom you thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
Soul and Body) and let them publickly, thorowly, and
equally dispute your and their Religion, and what they can
<hi>vive voce,</hi> face to face say, or rather prove against us, or our
Principle in Religion, who in the Spirit of Truth serve and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93340:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fear the Lord, by you called <hi>Quakers.</hi> I am sure, if they
(your Priests) be spiritual men, or but so much as spiritually
minded, it cannot be denyed on their parts: And this
would be a good way to try Spirits, and for you and
them to try and hear Truth, and be tryed by it (and true
Religion is a Spiritual, not a State matter) and whoso is found
in the Error, let the smooth stone of <hi>David</hi> be slang into their
hearts by the hand of a holy man to convince, and the Sword
of the Lord run through and through them, as his most holy
Spirit shall give utterance. And if to that they will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
leave it to the Lord of the Harvest; for further, or
contrary to this, no Man, or Power upon Earth, hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from Christ Jesus to act.</p>
            <p>So consider well what Church you are of, and whose Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Ministers you are, that instigate the Rulers (who
are too apt of themselves) to imprison and hew down the
Innocent with carnal swords, promp and help Parliaments
to make Laws against us, move the inferiour Magistrates to
execute them, and cause dissolute Souldiers to tear us out
of our holy Meetings, from thence drag and drive us into
your Goals and Dungeons, there to be kept till Banishment
or Death; whereby (in the Curse) you rend assunder the
endeared Husband from the tender and faithfull Wife,
(whom God hath joyned together) dislocating the blessed
Child from the righteous Parent, the faithful Servant from
his honest Master, and calling the Master from the Servant,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> If this be Christian or Apostolical, I know not what
is Antichristian and Diabolical. Most certain I am, Precept
from Christ, Example from his Apostles, or the least seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vestage in any of their Writings for such doings you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pretend, and the right generous English Spirit abhors
such <hi>Salvagism</hi> as Hell. Then in this matter who are you
like, or to whom may I compare you but your selves? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in that of your Oaths of <hi>Alleageance</hi> and <hi>Supreamacy,</hi>
you run parallel with the <hi>Roman Episcopalians</hi> in the late <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Persecution,</hi> with the <hi>Sacrament of their Altar;</hi> the one
they used as a <hi>Roman Gin</hi> against the then Martyrs, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you impose as an <hi>Antichristian Snare</hi> upon Us, the now
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93340:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
obeyers of the true Christ, who saith, <hi>Swear not at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi>
For often-times when neither your selves, your late made
cruel Edicts, nor the Multitude, (who for the most part have
been for you, against us) can raise seeming plausible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enough against the truly Innocent, to ensnare and incas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serate
their persons, Then I have often seen and observed
your last subterfuge to be, (viz.) <hi>O but will you take the Oath
of Alleageance!</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it's, <hi>Will you take
the Oaths of Alleagiance
and Supremacy?</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">For the denyal of both, or either, great are the numbers of us that have been imprisoned, even several to Death; and yet I have not known any <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> that hath suffered either Imprisonment, or so much as loss of Preferment [a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you] for refusing the latter, whenas they do acknowldge a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Head, and he is but a man: and it is as well known that we Christians do, nor ever did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any other Head of our Church but CHRIST alone; so that if I were of an aggravating spirit, I might say, Why Us, and not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists? But it's not my principle to irritate or stir up any against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ease my self; but I feel who you favour and who you hate.</note> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

we who profess <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
and are <hi>Christians
indeed,</hi> as wel as <hi>in words,</hi>
cannot, may not, dare not

Oath whatsoever, because
the promised Messiah, and

of whom Oaths under the

commanded us in express
words, <hi>But I say unto you,

               <note n="*" place="margin">This could not be meant prophane swearing, for under the Law that was forbidden, viz. <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain;</hi> but Iudicial swearing was by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> allowed.</note>: So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
absolutely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Son of God,
and precautioned, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confirmed by his
good Apostle, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
Commands and Doctrine should be Catholick;
however, to us that are not our own, but bought and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redeemed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93340:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with a price, even the Blood of our immaculate
Lord, it sufficeth; and therefore we dare not, may not turn
his immortal Law behind our backs, nor tread his most
precious Blood under our feet. And I do believe in my
heart, most of you cannot but know before-hand, even before
you offer us an Oath, that it is our avowed Principle
<hi>not to swear at all;</hi> and we dare not assume that unholy liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or accursed dispensation, to break that most sacred, most
royal, and indispensible Law of our Redeemer; as many
of you lately did for your ungodly ends, when against your
Consciences, and against your earthly King, you sware, <hi>To
be true and faithful to the Commonwealth, as it was then esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
without King or House of Lords.</hi> Nay, with us it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so; for the truly Faithful most gladly suffer the loss of
all, even to the Death, rather than against their Conscience
break one <hi>iota</hi> of their KING of Kings Command; and
he that wilfully breaks one, is guilty of all: even so he
that is not faithful in a little, shall never be made a Ruler
in much. So that I cannot say, for what you do against us,
(as also against your own souls and consciences) as Christ
said to the old <hi>Iews, You know not what you do:</hi> but I can
truly say, You know not, or at least wisely consider not what
will follow for these your most unreasonable outrages.</p>
            <p>Indeed, most of our present Adversaries are men of
Oaths, much addicted to Swearing and Cursing; for, and
under which the <hi>good People</hi> of the Land do bitterly
mourn, and they themselves shall howl, though at the
present they trample under their feet, as a thing of nought,
the Name of our God, imploring him often to damn and
sink them; insulting over his Innocent Seed, plowing
broad, deep and most inhumane furrows on the backs of his
righteous People at their pleasure, contrary to all Law and
good Reason: Not less than five or six thousand of us, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Quakers,</hi> imprisoned at a time, since you called <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Protestants</hi> came into outward power.</p>
            <p>Thus have you killed us all your day long, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to outward ruine the Families of the Faithful in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93340:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Land, making many Widows, oppressing their Fatherless,
even as it were chopping them and theirs in pieces, as flesh
for your Cauldron, according to the Edict of your own
hearts lust; yet <hi>in all this you are no Conquerours;</hi> and which
is far worse, <hi>for all this you shall come to Iudgment:</hi> For the
Mower saith, <hi>All flesh is grass;</hi> And, <hi>accursed is the man that
trusteth in man, or maketh flesh his arm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, Lord, if what's already done, and in their hearts to
do, be not enough to fill the measure up of those, who on
thy holy People, for their pure Conscience, do impose. On
me lay on thy pondrous weight, give me but strength to
bear; permit them, Lord, my blood to drink, and flesh to tear.
Yet, Lord, I'm not ith' hast, but on thy holy leisure cry,
How long, how long! O Lord my God, most holy, just, and
high. For, Lord, I know deliverance to thy Seed, nor
evil to the City can be done, Good or Vengeance wrought
thereon, but by thy holy self alone. Therefore freely, and
with all my heart, the manner, way, and <hi>final</hi> disquisition of
these things I leave to thee, my God, who art the King of
Kings, transmuter and establisher of all things.</p>
