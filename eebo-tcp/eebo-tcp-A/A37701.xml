            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lords and Commons in Parliament, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with much tendernesse and compassion, the miserable condition of this Kingdome, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, and distempered with many present evils, and imminent dangers, and brought now to such an height of extremity of misery, that two English Armies are neer together, even ready to joyn in a dreadful &amp; bloody encounter, through the violent and wicked counsell of those who have captivated both the Person &amp; the Power of the King to their own impious and trayterous designes, do thereupon thinke good to publish and declare the same to the Kingdome; together with some directions and provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which may prevent that utter desolation and ruine both of religion and liberty, already overwhelmd and supprest in the intention and hope of those rebels and traytors about the King; To which purpose, it is desired by both Houses, that all wel affected subjects may take notice of these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, that the King by the help and assistance of the papists, the prelatical and corrupt part of the Clergy, the delinquent Nobility, and Gentry, &amp; by the confluence of some notable traytors from beyond the seas, the Lord <hi>Digby, Oneale,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of many desperate mercenary and ill affected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons from all parts of the Kingdome, hath raised an Army,
<pb facs="tcp:63663:2"/>
armed, cloathed, &amp; fed, for the most part with the spoyles of his subiects, giving them liberty to plunder and rob all sorts of people, to exact money and plate from Corporations, by threatning fire and sword if they should refuse it.</p>
            <p>That this wicked Councel doth not only hinder his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty from exercising the justice and protection of a King to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people; but even that honour which is observed betwixt enemies; for by a confident instrument of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, Sir <hi>John Hinderson</hi> a papist (as we are credibly informed) one <hi>David Alexander</hi> was urged to kill Sir <hi>J. Hotham,</hi> telling him it would be a good service both to God and the King, which he refused to do, saying, it was the work of a Butcher, and not of a Souldier; this <hi>Alexander</hi> being a Scotchman of a very poore fortune, and of a mind fit for desperate attempts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King sent for him twice, while he was at <hi>Beverley,</hi> and when he came to his presence, he spake to him publikely in the field, and appointed a summe of money to be given him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he received.</p>
            <p>After which another proposition was made to him by the same Sir <hi>J. Hinderson,</hi> that he would put fire to the Magazine of the Army raised by the Parliament, &amp; to gaine the better opportunity to effect it, that he should labour to get some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in the train of Artilery, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he accordingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke, &amp; endeavoured to obtain; But before he could effect mischievous intention, he was discovered, apprehended, and examined, and thereupon confest the practice, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, the particulars wherof are referred to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations thereupon taken. That the King doth send out Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to borrow great sums, professing that those who wil not lend him money, do give him just cause to suspect their duty to his person, and the peace of the Kingdome. And this will be a sufficient reason to make them lyable to be plundered and spoyled of all they have; but such is the violence of the Kings army, that their friends are in little better case then
<pb facs="tcp:63663:3"/>
they who oppose them, and those who escape best must yet feed, and billet the souldiers for nothing.</p>
            <p>In those places where the Trained bands are willing to go forth to serve in his Majesties army, yet for the most part their armes are taken from them, and put upon those who are more mercenary, and lesse intrested in the Commonwealth, and so likely to be fitter instruments of rapine and spoile.</p>
            <p>By these great violences, and oppressions, they have so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted those parts, that His Majesty cannot stay long about <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and it is the earnest desire of the Cavaleers, that he would march forward towards <hi>London,</hi> those rich and fruitful Countries in the way being like to yeeld them a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of their necessities, and the wealth of <hi>London</hi> a full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their hope, where they likewise think to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>de a party, which upon his Majesties approach may make some disturbance, and facilitate their designes upon the City.</p>
            <p>That if the Kings army prevaile, the good Subjects can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing, but that their lives and fortunes will be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the malice and rapine of those ravenous souldiers, who often talke of cutting the throats of honest and religious men, and have long expected their goods and estates, as the rewards of their service; the Kingdome will again fall under the government of those mischievous Councels, who before this Parliament had even brought both religion and liberty to ruine; and we shall have no hope left of any more Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but such as shall be concurrent and subservient to these ends.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The means of curing and preventing these evils and dangers we conceive to be these.</head>
               <p>That good provision be made by lone and contribution for the Army raised by the Parliament under the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> which is no whit inferiour in Horse and Foot to the Kings Army, better armed, full paid, restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:63663:3"/>
from disorder and rapine as much as may be, well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of all outward necessaries, but above all, well encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and instructed in the goodnesse of the cause by the labour of many godly and painfull Divines.</p>
               <p>That this Army be alwaies ready to attend the removes of the Kings army, either in one body, or divided, as there shall be occasion, according to the wise conduct and direction of the Generall, that so no opportunity of fighting upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage be lost, nor the greedy souldiers of the Kings army suffered to range and spoyle the Country at their pleasure.</p>
               <p>That the Countries through which the Kings Army is to passe, doe associate themselves, and draw all their Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gather for the mutuall defence of their persons, and goods, from oppression and spoile.</p>
               <p>That those Counties be required to send in all their horses fit for carriage, and for dragoons, aswell for the assistance of the Lord Generall; For which in convenient time they shall receive satisfaction; As likewise that by such meanes those Horses may be kept from being imployed by the Kings Army.</p>
               <p>That command and direction be given, to all Lieutenants of Counties and deputy Lieutenants, that all the Trained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and all Volunteeres be put into'a readinesse, to be brought to such randezvous, and to be obedient to such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in chiefe, as shall be appointed by the Committee for the safty of the Kingdome, or by the Lord Generall, that so the Kings Army may finde opposition in every place as they passe; And the inhabitants may have at hand a sufficient protection and defence; And the Lord Generall may strengthen his owne Army, with these Forces, as hee shall see cause.</p>
               <p>That Powder, Munition, and Ordnance, with all other necessaries, be prepared for these Forces, That so without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble, or confusion, they may be brought together, and fitted for service, upon all sudden occurrents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:63663:4"/>That all those who in the City of <hi>London</hi> or any other place, shall weare any colours or other marks of division, whereby they may bee distinguish'd from others, and knowne to be of the malignant party, shall be examined, searcht, and disarmed; As likewise all others, who being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, shall not lend or contribute towards the publique safty of the Kingdom in this time of sogreat and imminent danger.</p>
               <p>That it be commended to the serious consideration of those in the Kings Army, and of all other that intend to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist and succour his Majesty, in this impious and unnaturall War (amongst whom it may be hoped there are some honest men and Protestants) what it is that moves them in this quarrell.</p>
               <p>Is it for feare of some innovations and alterations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or Church Government? Let such as are possest with this vaine and causelesse apprehension, know, that nothing is Intended, or desired, but to take away the government by Bishops, which hath been so constantly, evidently, mischei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and dangerous, to the Church and State, and such other things as shall be found to be justy offensive, And nothing to be setled, and introduced, but by authority of Parliament after consultation first had with an assembly of learned and reverent Divines.</p>
               <p>Is it to uphold the authority prerogative and honour of the King, and to preserve the safty of his royall Person? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Parliament is, and ever hath beene ready to doe any thing that belongs to them to secure all these, which they have often testified by many humble petitions to his Majesty.</p>
               <p>If there be no cause for any of these respects to seeke the destruction of the Parliament, and the blood and ruine of their kindred, friends, and acquaintance, what remaines then to be the matter of the quarrell, and the motives of such great combustions, and the effects and consequences of
<pb facs="tcp:63663:4"/>
their victory if they should prevaile? That Priests Jesuits and the Popes Nuncioes may domineere and governe in the Kings Counsell, as heeretofore; That the Arch-Bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> and their suffragans, may suppresse di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and powerfull preaching, and banish and oppresse all the most pious and best affected Subjects of the Kingdome, &amp; introduce the popish Religion, under a Protestant profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, till they have strength and bouldnesse to cast off the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, and openly appeare that which indeed they are, and would not seeme to be.</p>
               <p>That the Earle of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and his sonne the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jermin,</hi> and other such Traytors may possesse the great places, and government of this Kingdome, and be the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the affaires of State and distributers of preferments, and disgraces, to such as shall further or oppose their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes.</p>
               <p>That the delinquents, oppressors, and destroyers of the Kingdom, may not only escape the justice of the Parliament, but triumph in the spoiles of all honest men, good Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots; And that through our troubles, and divisions, the Rebells in <hi>Ireland</hi> may prevaile; That we may cease to be a free Nation, and become the Object of cruelty, and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at home, and of scorne and infamy abroade.</p>
               <p>And if there can be no other fruit of their hazard and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours on that side, let them then consider whether by adhering to the Parliament they may not expect effects more sutable to the desires of honest men, The glory of God in the preservation of his truth, The peace of the Church, by securing it against the pride, avarice, and ambition of the Clergy, The honour greatnesse and security of the King, by freeing him from false and Trayterous Counsells, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing him in the hearts and affections of his people, the prosperity of the whole Kingdome by the blessing of good Lawes and a righteous government.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E saith, when the King went towards the north, at <hi>Newmarket</hi> he came to the Court, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the King to <hi>Yorke,</hi> and stayed at <hi>Yorke</hi> when the King first went to <hi>Kingstone</hi> upon <hi>Hull,</hi> and came backe to <hi>Yorke,</hi> and after the Kings returne Sir <hi>John Hinderson</hi> told him it was a good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God and the King to kill Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to do it; and that he said he would rather venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Army, and then the King went to <hi>Beverly,</hi> and the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters boy brought him word from Sir <hi>James Hamilton,</hi> he should come to <hi>Beverley,</hi> and should be made Corporall of the field, which he sleighted, and said he was an old man man, and could not ride, and then Sir <hi>James Hamilton</hi> sent to him to meet him at the Posthouse, which he did, and Sir <hi>James</hi> told him if he came not the next day, he would lose his place; he told him he had no money, and he gave him ten shillings, and with that he hired Horse and went thither, and that he came to the L. <hi>Lindsey</hi> Generall, which said he was welcome, and bid him go to the King, and told him the King had sent twice for him, and the next day (which was the day where in the Earle of <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c. had his audience) the King being in the field spake to him and bid him goe to my L. Generall who gave order to Sir <hi>J. Culpeper</hi> to give him ten pounds, which he received, and my Lord
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63663:6"/>
Generall told him Master <hi>Slingsby</hi> and an other Knight were about a Myne which failed, and the siege raised, and afterward he went to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and there Sir <hi>John Hinderson</hi> said to him, he should do good service if he would set the Magazin a fire, and that he undertook to do, and he told him it would be well if he could get a service in the Train of Artillary, and often speech with him upon that action, and said he should be highly recompenced: And thereupon he came to <hi>London</hi> on Tuesday was five or six weeks, and he was with Sir <hi>William Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> and made means to go into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he confess'd to Sir <hi>Balthazar Gerbier</hi> upon Munday last all the passages betwixt him and Sir <hi>John Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson,</hi> and to no body else, but he spake to Sir <hi>Jo. Mildram</hi> to get him a place in the Irish wars, and Sir John promised to speake with the Irish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for him; He said Sir <hi>John Hinderson</hi> told him the King was acquainted with this proposition of firing the Magazine divers times: And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant told him that he had spoken to Sir <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar Gerbier</hi> to tell the King that he could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, and he denied that ever he had laboured for any place in this Army.</p>

            <p>HE sayes, he knowes one <hi>David Alexander</hi> a Scotchman, and ha's known him long, and ha's had discourse lately with him.</p>
            <p>He sayes, the said <hi>David Alexander</hi> said he had a proposition made to him to kill some body, but none named to this examinant, he answered, that to kill a man was fit for a hangman; but any gsne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous act befitting a Souldier he would do.</p>
            <p>The said <hi>Alexander,</hi> said that Colonell <hi>Hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> made this proposition at the Court, he sayes that Act was proposed; That another proposition was made by the same person, that he should get a place in the Train of Artillery, and getting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge where the Magazine was, to do his best to fire it, and this he entertained and was received, and had mony given him; and besides Colonell <hi>Hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and Master <hi>Endymeon Porter</hi> spoke also concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the sam: businesse to him.</p>
            <p>This Examinant sayes, he knows not whether <hi>Alexander, Hinderson,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Endym on Porter</hi> spoke of the same at the same time, nor did he tell him what summe of Money he received, nor did he speak of any other Promises; Upon the third of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant at nine of the clock this discourse was, which he noted in his Table-book. Then desiring to look in his Table-book, the Examinant further related, That he having occasion to use some mans service
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63663:7"/>
to the Court, with the Venetian Ambassadour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his place, he sent to this <hi>David Alexander,</hi> to know if he would go along with him; the said <hi>David</hi> told him he could not go, the Examinant wondred at it, knowing his poverty, and asked the reason, thereupon he said he had some service to do, and the Examinant being his old friend, he would deale plainly with him, and tell him, and said it was of that nature, that it was as much worth as his life to discover, the Examinant wondred at it, and made some difficulty to know it; but he answered that in the Lord <hi>Buckinghams</hi> time he had bin his friend, and therefore to him he would tell it, and put his life into his hands: The Examinant said, why wilt thou put thy life into such danger, then he said he was dispacht and had received money for it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himself to the Army, and to endeavour to get a place about the Artillety, to the end to take a time to fire the Magazine; which he said you know I can do by an instrument made like a watch, which having gone for so many houres then strikes fire, he said he had applyed himself to Sir <hi>William Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> to be recommended by him, but was put off, only had offered to him 14. <hi>s. per diem</hi> for a Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Majors place of Dragooners, or some service for <hi>Ireland</hi>; but he refused it, as not fit for him, saying, that he was more proper for fire works &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, &amp;c. He said further, that meeting with <hi>Dulbier,</hi> he told him, how now <hi>David</hi> thou do'st not come hither for the service against those from when<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e you come, he said no; and then resolved
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63663:8"/>
to apply himself to Sir <hi>John Meldram,</hi> by whom he was to be presented to the house the third of this instant: he desired this Examinant to take this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from him and to acquaint the King with it, to whom it would be acceptable to know what was become of him, and he could not write it himself, and therefore wish't this Examinant to write it in his table-book: This Examinant said he would put it into his table-book, and said how should I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to tell this to the King, or know it to be true; and he said the King would soon know that, and it will be an honour to you to be so trusted, so he concluded his discourse with presenting a Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to this Examinant in his journey, the Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was his companion, and a Sollicitor here for one <hi>Gordon</hi> the Kings Agent at <hi>Hamburgh</hi>; but this Examinant took only his name, and liking not his aspect, promised to send to him some other time.</p>
