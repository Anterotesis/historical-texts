            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere are many Remarkable Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in the Life of <hi>Jovian,</hi> and ſo very diſagreeable to the chief Aſſertions, which I have found in <hi>Julian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> that I have been Invited by them to call this Anſwer to that Book by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Name.</p>
            <p>For firſt, He was choſen Emperor next after <hi>Julian,</hi> although he was nothing Akin to him, while<note n="(a)" place="margin">P. 74, 75, 76.</note>

Chapter. He alſo left behind him a little

               <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and other Great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains likewiſe did, quietly, and peaceably behaving themſelves, while <hi>Julian</hi> did ſo outrage the Church; which ſhews, that either he did not Illegally Perſecute his Chriſtian Subjects (as Mr. J. ſaith he did) or elſe, that they thought in their Duty, as Chriſtians, quietly to ſubmit even to an Apoſtate Emperor, when he <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted contrary to Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Though he was ſo Zealous and Orthodox a<note n="(f)" place="margin">Theodor. l. 4. c. 1, 2. Socrat. l. 3. c. 24.

<pb facs="tcp:40965:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>that they Lampooned, and Burleſqued him, as I have ſhewn at large in the 3d. Chapter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When <hi>Jovian</hi> was Elected Emperor by the Souldiers of <hi>Julian,</hi>
               <note n="(h)" place="margin">P. 171.</note>

            <p>This is plain from the Practife of thoſe Emperors, who ende avoured as much as they could, to paſs over the Empire in part or in whole, like an Inheritance, unto thoſe they loved beſt. For, Sometimes they preferred Strangers before their own Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and made them <hi>Caeſars;</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Remoter of their own Kindred, before the nearer in Blood. Sometimes they would make one, and ſometimes two, or more <hi>Caeſars,</hi> according to the number of their Children, as the Reader will find in the firſt Chapter of this Anſwer; but none of them ever attempted to get it ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled upon one man and his future Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after him, much leſs upon his Heirs Males, or Females in a lineal Succeſſion for ever.

            <p>In the beginning of his Preface he makes a mighty Flouriſh, and in very fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious Rhetoric, againſt the Loyal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers for being contrary to themſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:40965:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>promiſing <hi>to maintain his Majeſty, and the Religion eſtabliſhed, with their Lives, and Fortunes, and a Popiſh Succeſſor too.</hi> But though common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders cannot, yet others can look through this Malicious Fallacy; for it was not the Popiſh Succeſſor, as popiſh, but the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which they promiſed to maintain, and not the Perſon, who ſhall ſucceed, in his endeavours to overthrow the Proteſtant Religion, there they will deſert him, as the <hi>Suffolk</hi>-Proteſtants did Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> but in all other things they will ſerve a Popiſh Succeſſor with their Lives, and Fortunes, as the Chriſtians did a <hi>Pagan,</hi> and particulary <hi>Julian,</hi> ſo that he may keep <hi>the Horns of</hi> Mahomets <hi>Angels, which were half Fire, and half Snow,</hi> as an Emblem for ſuch Proteſtants, who can ſight againſt the Perſon of their Prince in Defence of his Authority, and who are wont to qualiſie their profeſſed Zeal for him with ſuch Cooling Conſiderations, as do perfectly extinguiſh it, as Snow doth Fire.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40965:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Then he goes on to tell us, that <hi>A Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Succeſſor will be an Heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> But then (ſaith he reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Addreſſers) <hi>Did ever Men pray for a Judgment, and make it their Humble Requeſt, that they might be ſure of it?</hi> But did any of the Loyal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers Pray or Deſire, that the next Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor might be a Papiſt, or is Mr. <hi>J.</hi> or any of the Excluders ſure, that he that is next will ſucceed to the Crown? Nay, do not the Truly Loyal Party pray, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make him a Good Proteſtant; and were they not in Parliament for making of Good Laws for our Security againſt him: And hath not the Author of <hi>Julian</hi> very much Forehead, to ſay of ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a part of the Nation, <hi>That if they be Proteſtants, yet he thinks them men weary of their Religion, who are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for a Prince,</hi> a Great Part <hi>of whoſe Religion is to Perſecute, and Extirpate theirs?</hi> But doth he not know, That they Love the King, and pray for his
<pb facs="tcp:40965:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>Preſervation, and wiſh that he may live for ever? Does he not know, that they wiſh him a Numerous Poſterity, and that there were a Succeſſion of many Young Princes, between him and the Collateral Heir? And have they not (at leaſt) as good Reaſons to declare for the Succeſſion, as the Excluders have to declare againſt it, who by an Act of Excluſion would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring as great a Plague, and as Heavy a Judgment upon the Nation, as a Popiſh Prince will do?</p>
            <p>But yet ſo bent is this Man to <hi>Excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that he tacitly commends King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> for Impeaching the Succeſſion of his Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> by the moſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nauthoritative and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, Act, that a good Prince could be guilty of. <hi>Every body knows</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that King</hi> Edward <hi>the Sixth, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his Popiſh Siſter from Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bequeathed his Kingdom by Will to the Lady</hi> Jane, and every body knows, who put the young Prince upon it; and I wiſh too many of thoſe who were for

<pb facs="tcp:40965:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>did; and if by any means it had been in me to have letted the making of that Will, I would have done it; and what I ſaid therein, as well to his Counſel, as himſelf, divers of your Majeſties Counſel can report, but none ſo well, as the</hi> Marquis of Northampton, <hi>&amp; the L.</hi> Darcy, <hi>which two were preſent at the Communication between the King, and me.

            <p>This Act of Parliament is the <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of the Excluders, but all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that can be taken from it, are ſo well anſwered in the<note n="(m)" place="margin">The Great Point of Succeſſion Diſcuſſed.

For he preſents us with a Liſt of their Names,
<pb facs="tcp:40965:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>and tell us, That many of them were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and that they were active and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for ſuch Acts as theſe.</p>
            <p>I know not what he means by ſuch Acts as theſe, for it cannot be proved from Sir <hi>Simon Dewes</hi> his<note n="(n)" place="margin">P. 140.</note> Journal, which he hath cited, That they conſented to this Act about limiting the Succeſſion, but for any thing we find there to the contrary, they might be concluded in the Majority of the Lords. But if it were certain they did all concur to that Act, they had very good Reaſon for ſo doing, becauſe it was ſo highly conducive at that Seaſon to ſecure the Queen (whoſe Title was diſputeable) from being ejected, or diſpoſſeſſed of the Crown, by the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> &amp; her Heirs. But as the<note n="(o)" place="margin">28 ch. 7.34 ch. 1. cenſured as unjuſt by <hi>Judge Jenkins.</hi> Jenkins Rediv. p. 29.</note> Statutes of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> which impowered him to <hi>limit</hi> the Deſcent of this Imperial Crown, had not the honour to be formally repealed, but were virtually declared Null, and Void from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

            <p>From this Act of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> he paſſes on to the Paper of <hi>Reaſons to prove the Queens Majeſty bound him Conſcience to proceed with ſeverity in this Caſe of the late Queen of</hi> Scots.

<pb facs="tcp:40965:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>that he doth not believe, they had any hand in the thing. For</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is uncertain where, or by whom the Reaſons were framed: Sir <hi>Simon</hi> ſaith,<note n="(*)" place="margin">P. 207.</note> That moſt likely they were framed in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,<note n="(o)" place="margin">P. 215.</note> and calls them their Reaſons. Secondly, It is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they were framed by ſome private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who ſpeaks often in the ſingular Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as <hi>God</hi> I truſt <hi>in time ſhall open her Eyes: To thoſe men</hi> I think <hi>God himſelf, and his Angels will ſeem cruel;</hi> and therefore, Thirdly, It is not probable, that they ſhould be preſented unto the Queen (if they were preſented at all, as Sir <hi>Simon</hi> doth but conjecture) in the Name, or as the Senſe of the Biſhops, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we conſider that the Paper is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous, and many of the Reaſons in it are, the very ſame which the Papiſts urge for putting Heretick, and the <hi>Scotizing</hi> Presbyterians (of which there were<note n="(p)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Bancroſts Dangerous Poſitions.</note> many in
<pb facs="tcp:40965:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time) for putting Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Princes to death. I deſire Mr. <hi>J.</hi> to read them again, and then to tell me, Whether he thinks in his Conſcience the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England</hi> could pen ſuch a Popiſh, or Presbyterian Piece? It is credible to believe, that they could argue ſo falſly upon the Principles of the Jewiſh Theocracy to the like proceedings in Chriſtian States? If this way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be true, then the Queen was bound to burn many Popiſh Towns in her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſmite the Inhabitants with the Sword, and to pull down all the Churches eſpecially the Cathedrals, becauſe they had been polluted with Idols. For my part, I muſt declare, that it cannot enter into my Heart to believe, that thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops would liken themſelves to <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Queen to <hi>Saul,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> unto <hi>Agag;</hi> or compare themſelves to the <hi>Man</hi> of God, her Majeſty to <hi>Achab,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to <hi>Benhadad,</hi> or parallel her Caſe with that of <hi>Jeſabel,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40965:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>and <hi>Athaliah:</hi> Or propoſe unto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty the Example of <hi>Solomon, who ſpared not his own natural, yea, and his elder Brother</hi> Adonijah <hi>for Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and likelyhood of Treaſon, for a Marriage purpoſed only, but put him to death for the ſame, and that ſpeedily without courſe of Judgment;</hi> Or laſtly, Argue from <hi>Deut. 13.6. If thy Brother the Son of thy Mother, &amp;c.</hi> In citing of which it is evident up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom our Author did reflect. I would fain know of him, if he approve of this way of arguing, or no; if he do not, why ſhould be think the Reaſon of thoſe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prelates ſo much weaker than his own? But if he do, may be pleaſe to conſult Dr. <hi>Hickes</hi> his <hi>Peculium Dei,</hi> where he will be better informed.</p>
            <p>But beſides this inconcluſive way of arguing from the Laws, and Examples of the Jewiſh Theocracy, there is in thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a Paſſage about <hi>Conſtantinus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which is not conſiſtent with the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb facs="tcp:40965:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Integrity of thoſe Fathers. It is this, That <hi>C.M. cauſed</hi> Licinius <hi>to be put to death, being not his Subject, but his Fellow-Emperor, for that the ſaid</hi> Licinius <hi>laboured to ſubvert the Chriſtian Religion;</hi> which is not true, for <hi>Licinius</hi> had rendred himſelf, and his Purple to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> upon condition of Life, and ſo was become a private Perſon, and he cauſed him to be put to death for new Attempts againſt his Promiſe, after he became his Subject, as I have ſhewed, <hi>p. 43.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Reader pleaſe to conſult this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous Paper at large, he will find it Presbyterian and Scottiſh from one end to the other, and a Brat ſo unlike the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, upon whom the true Author hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered it, that a man may almoſt ſafely ſwear, that it was none of Theirs. Indeed there is one Good Argument in it, why the <hi>Queens</hi> Subjects might have been urgent with her Majeſty to put the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> to death, and that is this, <hi>That ſhe ſought the Life of the Queen, and
<pb facs="tcp:40965:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>endeavoured to diſinherit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her.</hi> Theſe Attempts put her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly out of the <hi>Queens</hi> Protection, and though for this Reaſon ſhe might lawfully be excluded out of the World, yet ſtill the queſtion remains, <hi>Whether ſhe could be excluded from the Crown?</hi> To be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the World, and from the Crown, are things of a <hi>diſparat</hi> Nature, and the former may, and ſometimes ought to be done, when the latter neither can, nor ought. As for Example, among the <hi>Jews</hi> it was the Birthright of the<note n="(q)" place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:40965:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Crown out of the World, unto the Excluſion of him from the Crown. <hi>They</hi> (ſaith he of the Biſhops) <hi>were Excluders with a witneſs, for they were for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the next Heir, not only from the Succeſſion, but out of the World.</hi> And again; <hi>A Bill of Excluſion is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Courtſhip to theſe Reaſons. Let thoſe therefore that have run down 3 ſucceſſive Houſes of Commons for that Bill, turn their. Fury and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches with more Juſtice upon theſe old Excluders.</hi> But all theſe fine Words are nothing to the purpoſe, for theſe Old Excluders were not Excluders from the Succeſſion, which ſpoyls the parity of the Inſtance; and to let him ſee that it doth ſo, he may aſſure himſelf, That the ſame Loyal Men, who run down <hi>3</hi> Houſes of Commons for the Bill to Exclude his <hi>R.H.</hi> from the Succeſſion, would neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon ſufficient Proof that he ſought <hi>the Life of his dear Brother</hi> (to whom hitherto he hath ſhewed himſelf the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:40965:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>Obedient of his Subjects) be willing to do him Juſtice, and exclude him out of the World. Furthermore, to let Mr. <hi>J.</hi> ſee what a great difference there is between theſe two Excluſions, I muſt remind him, that in caſe Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had died between the Sentence of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and her Execution, that the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Crown would have purged Her of all Crimes, and that 'ſhe would have had the ſame Right unto it, which the Parliament declared her Son <hi>James</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards had upon Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> death.</p>
            <p>But yet, though the Deſcent of the Crown purges all Defects, and would bring back the greateſt Malefactor of an Heir, not only from a Priſon, but from the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and from the Block to the Throne; yet our Author with unparallelled Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence<note n="(r)" place="margin">Preface p. 19.</note> challenges all that were againſt impeaching the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>To give him but one Reaſon to prove a Bill of Excluſion to be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
<pb facs="tcp:40965:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>which they will own to be a Reaſon a Week after, and not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it, and he doth ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to joyn with them in renouncing theſe Old Reformers, and thereafter will follow their New Guides, and New Lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never in all my Life read any thing ſo bold from a Man of Mr. Js. mediocrity, who here challenges the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> the <hi>3 Eſtates of</hi> Scotland, the <hi>Univerſity of</hi> Cambridge, one of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries of State,</hi> the Loyal Addreſſers, and ſeveral other Perſons of Note, whom he ought to believe, are at leaſt as wiſe, and learned, and as good Proteſtants as himſelf.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Houſe of Lords, who were the firſt, that in his Phraſe run down the Houſe of Commons for the Bill of Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon which his Majeſty ſent the Houſe this Meſſage, That <hi>He was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his Opinion againſt that Bill, by the Judgment of the Houſe of Lords, who rejected it;</hi> and may not one
<pb facs="tcp:40965:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>preſume, that many of them rejected it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought it diſagreeable to the <hi>Lex Legum,</hi> or great ſtanding Law of this Inheritable Kingdom, That <hi>nothing is to be conſented to in Parliament, which tends to the diſinheriſon of the Crown, whereunto they are ſworn.</hi> This is the great Rule by which all Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are to be framed, and if any of them tranſgreſs it they are as null and void from the beginning, as Marriage with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who hath a natural Impediment, or Imperfection. By this Supream Invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Law, an Act of Parliament for <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the Monarchy,</hi> or <hi>for debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the King of the Service of his Subjects,</hi> or <hi>for giving the Crown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Forainer,</hi> or <hi>for making it Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageable to a Superiour Power,</hi> or <hi>for dividing the Monarchy into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partnerſhip unto two Heirs,</hi> or <hi>for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the whole Royal Family,</hi> (as many of the Excluders grant) would all be Null, and Void from the beginning;
<pb facs="tcp:40965:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſo, I verily believe, moſt of them think that an Act for Excluding the next Heir would be ſo too, which made them ſo zealous to back it with an Act for an Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, which the Author of <hi>the Power of Parliaments</hi> ingeniouſly calls a <hi>Club-Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Know not what any Excluder can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this, but either to ſay, That an Act of Parliament, which tends to the Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriſon of the Crown is nevertheleſs valid, or that an Act of Excluſion hath no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency thereunto; To aſſert the former would be a Contradiction to the moſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Lawyers Antient, and Modern, and many Declarations in Parliament, and would alſo ſuppoſe, that an Act for deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Monarchy it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be valid. And to aſſert the latter, is virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to ſay, That an Act for Diſinheriting the next Heir, doth not tend to the diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriſon of the Crown; which would be difficult to maintain, becauſe the ſame Power that puts by One Heir, may put by
<pb facs="tcp:40965:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>Ten, either altogether, or Succeſſively, and ſo <hi>Adieu</hi> to the Royal Family, and the Hereditary Succeſſion, which may be laid aſide in part or in whole, when the King, and Parliament ſhall pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But to return to this Fundamental-Law of the Monarchy, which ſeems to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date all Acts of Parliam. that tend to the Diſinheriſon, or Deſtruction of the Crown, and particularly all thoſe, which limit, and bind the Succeſſion.

<pb facs="tcp:40965:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>or they were not: If not, then Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which impeach the Succeſſion are without any more ado, Null and Void in Law; but if they were, by what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was the Houſe of <hi>Suffolk</hi> Excluded, and King <hi>James</hi> admitted to the Crown, contrary to many Statutes againſt him? notwithſtanding all which the<note n="(t)" place="margin">Jacob.

            <p>The next Reaſon, which ſeems to make an Act of Excluſion unlawful, is the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> which moſt of the Kings Subjects are called to take upon one Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or other, and which the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> are bound by Law to take before they can ſit in the Houſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40965:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>By this Oath every one, who takes it ſwears to <hi>Aſſiſt, and Defend all Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, Priviledges, Preheminences, and Authorities, granted or belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Kings Highneſs, his Heirs, and lawful Succeſſors, or united, and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</hi> And I appeal to every Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and Loyal <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> whether it be not one of the moſt undoubted, tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and Eſſential Rights, Priviledges, and Preheminences belonging to the Kings Heirs, and united to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> that they ſucceed unto the Crown, as it comes to their turn, according to Proximity of Blood. Secondly, I deſire to know, Whether by <hi>Lawful Succeſſors,</hi> is not to be underſtood, ſuch Heirs as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the common Rules of Hereditary Succeſſion ſettled by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law of <hi>England,</hi> and if ſo, how any Man, who is within the Obligation of this Oath, can Honeſtly conſent to a Bill of Excluſion, which deprives the next.

<pb facs="tcp:40965:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>(and in him virtually the whole Royal Family) of the Chief Priviledge, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence which belongs unto him, by the Common-Law of this Realm; Or how any Man, who hath taken this Oath, which is ſo apparently deſigned for the Preſervation, of the Rights, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Royal Family, can deny Faith and true Allegiance to the next Heir from the Moment of his Predeceſſors death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Common Right of Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Succeſſion, which by Common-Law belongs unto Him, and is annexed to the Crown? What Oath ſoever is made for te Behoof and Intereſt of the Kings Heirs and Lawful Succeſſors in general, muſt needs be made for the Behoof and Intereſt of every one of them; but the Oath of Supremacy ſo made for the Behoof and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Kings Heirs, is apparently in general to ſecure the Succeſſion unto them; and therefore it is undoubtedly made to ſecure the Succeſſion to every one of them according to the Common Order
<pb facs="tcp:40965:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Hereditary Succeſſion, when it ſhall come to their turn to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>I have uſed this Plain and Honeſt Way of arguing with many of the Excluders themſelves, and I could never yet receive a ſatisfactory Anſwer unto it. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have ſaid, with our Author, that the Oath of Supremacy <hi>is a Proteſtant Oath,</hi> and ſo could not be underſtood in a Senſe deſtructive to the Proteſtant Religion, which is a meer Shift, and proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe it proves too much. For according to this Anſwer we might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with our ſworn Faith and Allegiance to a Popiſh King, if any ſhould hereafter turn ſuch, becauſe the Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Supremacy, are <hi>Proteſtant Oaths,</hi> and are not to be underſtood, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them, in a ſenſe deſtructive to the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though they are <hi>Proteſtant Oaths,</hi> yet they reſpect not the King and his Heirs as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but as lawful, and rightful King, and Heirs, according
<pb facs="tcp:40965:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the Imperial Law of this Hereditary Kingdom; and therefore Moderate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, will take the Oath of Supremacy, as well as of Allegiance (as indeed it was for ſubſtance taken in the Time of<note n="(y)" place="margin">35 H. 8. ch. 1. § 11.</note> 
               <hi>H. 8.</hi>) which they could not do, were they made to the King, and his Heirs, as Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly, As they are Proteſtant Oaths, they bind us the more Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to aſſiſt and defend the King againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation of the Pope, who pretends to a Power of Depoſing Kings, and of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding</hi> Hereditary Princes from the Succeſſion (Witneſs <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th;</hi>) and therefore as all good Proteſtants are bound by theſe promiſſory Oaths to maintain the King in the Throne, ſo are they bound to maintain and defend their Heirs, and Succeſſors, when their Rights ſhall fall.</p>
            <p>I have joyned the Oath of Allegiance with the other of Supremacy, becauſe in it we alſo <hi>ſwear to bear Faith and true Allegiance to the Kings Heirs, and
<pb facs="tcp:40965:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>Succeſſors, and Him, and them to defend to the utmoſt of our Power;</hi> And I here proteſt to all the World, That when I took theſe Oaths, I underſtood the Words Heirs, and Succeſſors, for ſuch as hereafter were to be Kings by the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courſe of Hereditary Succeſſion: And I appeal to the Conſcience of every Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Proteſtant, if he did not underſtand them ſo.</p>
            <p>Other Excluders I have heard main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the King, and Three Eſtates in Parliament had a Power by an Act of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to diſcharge the People of this part of their Oaths, <hi>Of bearing Faith and true Allegiance to the Kings Heirs, and Lawful Succeſſors,</hi> but this ſeems contrary to the following Clauſe of the Oath of Allegiance, (which is alſo to be underſtood in the other of Supremacy)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do believe and in my Conſcience am reſolved, that neither the Pope, nor any</hi> other perſon whatſoever, <hi>hath Power to abſolve me of this Oath, or any
<pb facs="tcp:40965:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>part theoreof:</hi> And I appeal even to Mr. <hi>J.</hi> Whether a Man can be abſolved from a Promiſſory Oath by any Power upon Earth, but by the Perſon, or Perſons to whom, and for whoſe behoof it was made.</p>
            <p>To aſſert that the King by the Conſent of the Parliament can abſolve a Man from the binding Force of an Oath which he hath made for the Intereſt of a 3 <abbr>d</abbr> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is to give him, what his Juſtice would abhor, a Papal Authority over the Conſciences of Men; which Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſuppoſe, as well as the Popiſh Practiſe of Excluſion, made the great Man, above cited, ſay, <hi>For my part, I think there is more of Popery in this Bill, than there can poſſibly be in the Nation without it; for none but Papiſts, and Fifth-monarchy-men did ever go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to Diſinherit Princes for their Religion.</hi> But ſome Men will ſay, <hi>Why ſhould not Proteſtants Diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Popiſh, as well as Popiſh Diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Proteſtant Princes?</hi> To which the
<pb facs="tcp:40965:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>Anſwer is eaſie by another Queſtion, Why ſhould not Proteſtants Depoſe Popiſh, as well as Papiſts have Depoſed Proteſtant Kings?</p>
            <p>I am not Conſcious to my ſelf, that I have uſed the leaſt Sophiſtry in Arguing, as I have done, from the Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Supremacy againſt and Act of Excluſion; yet Mr. <hi>J.</hi> hath the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to call theſe Arguments taken from thoſe Oaths<note n="(z)" place="margin">Preface p. 19.</note> 
               <hi>ſhameful Sophiſtry,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Regard, that Honeſt Proteſtants have unto them, <hi>deceitful Prejudice,</hi> which (he ſaith) is occaſioned for want of diſtinguiſhing betwixt <hi>Actual,</hi> and <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> Heirs. But he is very much, and I fear very Wilfully miſtaken; For the Faith, and Allegiance in theſe Oaths is promiſed to the Poſſible Heirs, when they ſhall become Actual according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Order of Succeſſion, or to ſpeak yet more<note place="margin">Otherwiſe thus: Thoſe who take the Oaths of Allegiance, and Supremacy, ſwear to accept and take the Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heirs for their Soveraigns when they ſhall become Actual according to the Hereditary and Lineal Deſcent of the Crown.</note> plainly, our Faith
<pb facs="tcp:40965:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Allegiance is promiſed to the poſſible Heirs, and is to be made good, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto them, and every one of them, when by the Providence of God, they ſhall come to be actual, according to the known Order of Hereditary Succeſſion; and thus for Example, to uſe his own Inſtance, The <hi>Exciſe is granted to the Kings Heirs, and Succeſſors; i. e.</hi> To the Kings Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Heirs, and Succeſſors, upon whom the Crown ſhall deſcend according to the Ordinary Rule of Succeſſion; and every one of them will have a Right to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe by vertue of that Grant, when of a Poſſible he ſhall by Gods Providence (who determines the days of Kings) become an Actual Heir, or have the Crown fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Head by Lawful and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoubted Succeſſion, according to the Fundamental Cuſtom of this Hereditary Realm.</p>
            <p>A Third Reaſon againſt the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is taken from the <hi>Author</hi> of this Hereditary Succeſſion to the Crown, which
<pb facs="tcp:40965:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>is<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Coke Littleton, fol. 1.6.</hi> The Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our Lord the King is a direct Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, of which none is the Author but God alone: <hi>And from hence as the Learned</hi> Bochart <hi>obſerves, the Kings of</hi> England <hi>have always ſtiled themſelves</hi> Dei Gratiâ, <hi>and the Royal Shield carryes this Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> Dieu, &amp; mon droit. <hi>Nay Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>who through the Dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of her Title, courted the People ſo much, yet in her Declaration for Aſſiſting the</hi> Netherlands, <hi>printed 1585. ſpeaks, as it became ſuch a Soveraign Princeſs, in this manner;</hi> Although Kings, and Soveraign Princes owing their Homage, and Service only unto Almighty God the King of all Kings, and in that Reſpect not bound to yield Account, or render a Reaſon of their Actions to any other but God their Soveraign; and though among the moſt Ancient, and Chriſtian Monarchs the ſame Lord God hath committed unto Us the Soveraignty of this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and other Dominions, which we hold immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately of the ſame Almighty God; and thereby—</note> God alone, who hath given it to the Royal Family for a Perpetual Inheritance, and hath by his Providence ordained, that it ſhould come to one of them after the deceaſe of another, according to Birthright, and Proximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Blood.</p>
            <p>From this Principle many good Men, who are as Wiſe, and as Learned as any of the Excluders, infer this Concluſion, That it would be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, without a manifeſt Revelation from God, to Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Crown from this Family, to which he only hath given it, or to preclude any
<pb facs="tcp:40965:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>Perſon of it, much more the next Heir, whether Apparent or Preſumptive, from ſucceeding thereunto.</p>
            <p>This Argument is not ſo ſlight, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Mr. <hi>J.</hi> will make it; for if the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown of <hi>England</hi> be Subject to none but God, who hath given it for an Inheritance to the Royal Family, then it is very reaſonable to conclude, That to endeavour to exclude the <hi>Whole</hi> Royal Line to prevent Popery, would be Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Will of God. This I have heard ſome of the firſt Form of Excluders readily grant, and from thence I think the Oppoſers of the Bill of Excluſion may well argue, That to Exclude any one Perſon of the Royal Family, but moſt of all the next Heir upon the Line, from the abſolute Right, or Birthright, which God alone hath given him, would be alſo to oppoſe the Will of God.</p>
            <p>All theſe Arguments againſt the Bill of Excluſion are owned by the Ingenious
<pb facs="tcp:40965:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Loyal Authors of the<note n="(c)" place="margin">Third Part. p. 63, 64,</note>

            </p>
            <p>Nay all theſe Reaſons againſt Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the next Heir from the Succeſſion, are own'd by the Three Eſtates of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and would (I am confident) be owned by them, were they to meet again.

            <p>I ſhall add no more, but only tell the Author of <hi>Julian,</hi> who <hi>Thraſo</hi>-like hath Deſpiſed this <hi>Anſwer</hi> before he ſaw it, That I as much Deſpiſe his Great Boaſts. Confidence, and Hectoring I know, are ſometimes Serviceable to a Coward in Sword-quarrels, but what Influence they may have in Conflicts of the Pen, I am ſuch a Novice in writing Controverſies, that, I profeſs, I cannot tell. However, if he, or any other Perſon, will make a Fair, Cloſe, and Subſtantial Anſwer to what I have here written, they will O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige me by the Performance, and the World may reap Advantage from a Plain, and Solid Management of the Matters of Controverſie between us. But if inſtead

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THe Apoſtacy of <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperor did not perhaps make a greater Noiſe in the Cities of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, than the Short Account of his Life, called, <hi>Julian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> did in the City of <hi>London</hi> at its Firſt Publication. It ſtarted from the Preſs, as Racers uſually do from the Poſt, with a great and mighty Shout, and was attended all along with loud Acclamations of men ſet on purpoſe to cry it up in all Places, as indeed they apparently combine to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe, and cry up any thing, that is plauſibly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Non-Reſiſtence, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> or any of <hi>the Rights of Soveraignty,</hi> which keep the Crown firm upon the Kings Head.</p>
            <p>O! ſaith Mr. <hi>Nelth.</hi> the very Morning, that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> came out, to two or three Gentlemen, Have you ſeen <hi>Julian?</hi> It is an Unanſwerable Piece, it hath quite undone your Pleas for Succeſſion, and your Paſſive Obedience; and it is written by a Church-Divine, and we thank God, that there is one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40965:42"/>them, who is not for enſlaving the People.</p>
            <p>And ſaith the worthy Son of as worthy a Peer who was a Spectator at that Riotous Election of Sheriffs (when they juſtled my Lord Mayor, and cried, <hi>Take away the Sword</hi>) God, here's a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Brave Fellows, O that <hi>Joh.</hi> were hereto preach <hi>Julian</hi> unto them! And ſaith Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> a Miniſter holding up <hi>Julian</hi> in his Hand. Have you ſeen this Book? What Book, ſaith he <hi>Julian the Apoſtle</hi> replyes Mr. <hi>P.</hi> it was this day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to my Lord, and he ſays it is an Admirable Piece. To be ſhort, <hi>Julian</hi> was the Oracle of the Cauſe, the Pocket-Book of all the Party; it was carried to <hi>Change</hi> and <hi>Coffee-Houſes</hi> in Triumph, and at laſt called in Print by the (<note n="(*)" place="margin">4. vol. n. 30.</note>, <hi>Courantier,</hi> the <hi>Plaguy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Julian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of it hath boaſted to ſeveral that it had the Approbation of Sir <hi>W. J.</hi> whom I ſuppoſe he means in his Preface by <hi>that great Aſſertor of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Laws now with God:</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath alſo own'd that he peruſed it in the Manuſcript, and theſe Mens Breath conſpiring in his Praiſes with the Breath of the People, have blown him into ſuch a Conceit of his Performance, that he hath challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the World <hi>to Anſwer it, and expoſe him to open ſhame, if he have done amiſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having heard of theſe, and many other things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Julian,</hi> I got the Book, and at the firſt curſory peruſal diſcerned, as I thought, many contradictions and much fallacious Reaſoning in it: upon this I took Heart and read it again more obſervantly, and then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40965:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>plainly ſaw that it was not Unanſwerable, though it was a very cunning and malicious piece. The Author of it ſhews what Company he keeps by his ſcurrilous and irreverent Phraſes: I can never think of the following Paſſages, <hi>the</hi>

               <hi>the making the World for Banditi by it, and the many more Exceptions againſt their Artillery of Prayers, and Tears,</hi> I ſay, I can never think of theſe and many more of his Lampoons upon the Doctrine of the Croſs, but they make me think of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> and <hi>Fitz-harris his Libel,</hi> and that the Spirit of that Author hath paſſed into this.</p>

            <p>I would further ask our Author, upon ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the three Sons of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had every one of them had Three Sons, whether their reſpective Parts of the Empire by the Law of Nature muſt have been divided into equal ſhares among them, as the whole was divided among their Fathers; or whether by the Law of Nature they muſt have been reſtrained to the Eldeſt Son, and the Younger been laid aſide? By that time he hath conſidered of an Anſwer to theſe Queſtions, he will be forced to grant, That by the Law of Nature, <hi>Euſebius</hi> meant no more in his looſe Panegyrical way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, than the dictates of Reaſon grounded upon natural Kindneſs and Affection, by which a man is prompted in the firſt place to make Proviſion for his Children, or if he have no Children, for his next Relations; and theſe dictates of Reaſon grounded upon natural Affection may be called the Law of Nature in a large and ſecondary Senſe. Thus we ſay a man is bound to provide for his Children, or Nature binds man to provide for his Children, and to prefer them before Strangers, but then theſe and ſuch like Sayings are not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but only Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetically true, upon ſuch and ſuch Suppoſitions: They are only general Rules of Natural Juſtice and Equity, from which there may be a Thouſand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. As for Example, <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Natural Juſtice</hi> and Equity binds me to ſtudy the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Children, but not to places for which they are not fit, or of which they are not worthy, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> But if I have Places of Honour and Truſt at my diſpoſal, of which my Children, or next Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40965:74"/>are as capable, and worthy as other men, then if no miſchief will thereby ariſe to them, nor the Publick, Natural Juſtice requires, that I ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them; and upon this Suppoſition, that <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> Son to <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> inherited all the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of his Father, as the World believed, <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoras</hi> in his Apology told his Majeſty, that the Chriſtians prayed that his Son <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Thus have I fairly examined the Authorities of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in which it is alſo remarkable that he doth not ſay, That the Empire was a Paternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but only that it was left or divided, like a Paternal Inheritance; juſt as <hi>Galba,</hi> ſpeaking of the Empire which continued ſo long in the Houſe of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſaid, <hi>Sub</hi> Tiberio, Caio, Claudio <hi>unius Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliae quaſi haereditas fuimus.

                  <hi>Saluſtius,</hi> who refuſed the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Age and Weakneſs; <hi>Jovian,</hi> who accepted it, and <hi>Valentinian</hi> his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor.</note> Three Emperors without taking notice of <hi>Procopius</hi> [his <hi>Great Grandſon</hi> if he were <hi>Julians</hi> Nephew, but his Grandſon if they were Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Children] or he of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of their Choice. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, if he was Nephew to <hi>Julian,</hi> he muſt have been ſecond Couſen to <hi>Constantius,</hi> and Son to the Neece of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great; or if he were his Couſen by the Fathers ſide, then he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Couſen to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and Nephew to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Great; and beſides all this, he was a Man as well qualified, and educated for the Government, as any of the three mentioned before; who, if the Empire was Hereditary, were all Uſurpers and ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally <hi>choſen over his Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But although we had wanted the Inſtance of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius,</hi> yet it would have been a bold and precarious Aſſertion to ſay, that the Houſe of <hi>Chlorus was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct in</hi> Julian, for there were many Branches of it, of whoſe Poſterity Hiſtories are ſilent, and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but then it doth not follow from thence, that they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40965:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>had none. It doth not follow, for Example, that <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> eldeſt Son to <hi>Constantius Chlorus</hi> by <hi>Theodora,</hi> or <hi>Nepotianus</hi> his Grandſon by <hi>Eutropia</hi> had no Children, becauſe we do not read of them; for as the Parents of <hi>Procopius,</hi> ſo the Children of theſe and others Branches may not have been ſpoke of by Hiſtorians; but men that will write againſt the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> or the <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> or the <hi>Rights of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,</hi> may venture to ſay any thing, they may be as bold as <hi>blind Bayard,</hi> they may contradict themſelves, or common-ſenſe, and yet ſhall not want an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> to cry them up for Unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, be they never ſo much beſides the Truth.</p>
            <p>Having now ſhewed how the Succeſſion ſtood in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and anſwered all the Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Citations, which our Author hath fallaciouſly brought to prove it to be <hi>Hereditary,</hi> I hope by this time his Admirers will acknowledge that he is not Unanſwerable, but that the Foundation upon which he argued, being deſtroy'd, the Superſtructure of his Concluſions muſt fall to the Ground. For his Induſtrious Attempt to prove the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to have been Hereditary doth ſufficiently declare it to be his own Senſe, that there can be no Parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the caſe of <hi>Julian</hi> and a Popiſh Succeſſor, but upon that ſuppoſition; and that otherwiſe, there can be no good arguing from <hi>Non-Election</hi> or <hi>Preterition</hi> to <hi>Excluſion,</hi> and from no Right and Title to Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, or Inheritance, which is the conſtitutive diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between an Elective and Hereditary Crown.</p>
            <p>The Nature of Birthright, and Inheritance, which is not founded on the Statutes, but upon the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cuſtom and Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is an Hereditary Monarchy, makes it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40965:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>debateable whether an Act of Excluſion would be Valid or Invalid? And upon ſuppoſition that it would be Valid, there are many Arguments which makes it diſputable, whether it would be ſafe or unſafe, expedient, or unexpedient; and whether the Miſchiefs it would bring upon us would not be as great, as thoſe which it would prevent. But in the caſe of <hi>Julian</hi> there was no ſuch matters for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; and therefore the ſenſe which <hi>Nazianzen</hi> had of his Succeſſion is nothing to us, who are under an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſort of Government, and in other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; the Conſideration of which makes many Sincere and Honeſt Proteſtants, who dread Popery and a Popiſh Succeſſor, as much as our Author, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the <hi>Lineal Succeſſion;</hi> and this diſtinction between the <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> and a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi> makes it no Contradiction in the Addreſſers, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in his and Shr. <hi>Beth</hi>'s Friends of <hi>Rippon</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech his Majeſty not to agree to the Bill of Excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet to be ready <hi>to hazard their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and ſpend that laſt Drop of their Blood in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Majeſty, and the Religion eſtabliſhed by Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is one thing to be for the <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be for a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> as it is one thing to be for the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and another thing to be for a <hi>Popiſh Monarch;</hi> and there are many for the Former, who as heartily pray to God to prevent the Latter, as for their daily Bread. But our Author, who is an excellent Artiſt in Fallacies, ſo words it in the beginning of his Preface, as to induce his Reader to think that thoſe, who addreſs to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to preſerve the Lineal Succeſſion, do make it their humble Requeſt to him, that they may be ſure of a Popiſh Succeſſor, as if they had conſulted <hi>Gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> or the Fates, and were ſure that his <hi>R.H.</hi> whom
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40965:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>he means by the Popiſh Succeſſor, without an Act of Excluſion, ſhould certainly come to the Crown.</p>
            <p>Nay ſo far are all thoſe, who are ſo tender of the Succeſſion, from having any tenderneſs for a Popiſh Succeſſor, that they dread him like <hi>the Plague,</hi> and therefore would have had Proviſional Laws made to bind up ſuch an one, and put <hi>him under very cloſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Confinement,</hi> in caſe he ſhould be King. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſerve the other Proteſtants but an Act of Excluſion backed with another for an Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to which, I am confident, that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had he then ſat on the Spiritual Bench, would never have ſaid, <hi>Content.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, to make the caſe of <hi>Julian,</hi> and his <hi>R. H.</hi> exactly parallel, we muſt not only ſuppoſe, that the Succeſſion to the Empire was Hereditary, but that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great had been murdered after a long Rebellion by the <hi>Aerians,</hi> his Son <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> miraculouſly preſerved and reſtored, and the ruined Church reſtored with him; that from the time of his Reſtauration the <hi>Aerians</hi> reſumed their old practiſes againſt the Church and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and underhand helped <hi>Julian,</hi> after he had left the Communion of the Church, to get an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence for themſelves and the <hi>Pagans;</hi> that the Church was almoſt ruined and the Empire much weakned by this Indulgence, and other Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences; and that however the <hi>Aerians</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> were oppoſite in other things, yet they agreed in conſpiring againſt the Eſtabliſhed Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even in the Senate, where they always voted alike.</p>
            <p>We muſt alſo ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Aerians</hi> were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Commonwealths-men, that they were a very buſie and dangerous intereſt of men againſt the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40965:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>Government, that they took all Advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, eſpecially when the Peoples minds were diſtracted by the diſcovery of a <hi>Pagan</hi> Plot upon <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> Apoſtacy, that then they repreſented the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Chriſtians, eſpecially the Biſhops, and the Clergy for <hi>Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Half-Pagans;</hi> that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had promiſed the diſcontented Senate (which now I muſt ſuppoſe like our Parliament) to paſs any Acts for the Security of the Chriſtian Religion, which were conſiſtent with the Succeſſion; that the <hi>Weſtern Empire</hi> was ſatisfied with the Emperors Declaration, and had made it Treaſon to call the Succeſſion into Queſtion; that the Monarchy was weakly ſupported;<note place="margin">

               </note> that <hi>Julian</hi> was but two years younger than the Emperor, and not of ſo healthful a Conſtitution; that the Empreſs might dye, and the Emperor marry again; that <hi>Julians</hi> own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the next Heirs after him were firm Chriſtians; that in caſe he ſhould come to the Crown he would find an Empty Exchequer, and a poor Revenue; that the Senate would never Supply him, but upon their own Terms; that he could not perſecute without almoſt inſuperable Difficulties; that an Act for Diſ-inheriting of him would be a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Precedent, and of dangerous Conſequence, eſpecially ſince the <hi>Weſtern Empire</hi> had declared for the Succeſſion; that it would ſignifie nothing without an Act for Aſſociation; and that an Act for Aſſociation would legalize a ſtanding Army, and entail War upon the two Empires, and end in Arbitrary Government. Theſe, and many more things beſides the Hereditary Succeſſion to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, muſt be ſuppoſed to make the Parallel exact between <hi>Julian,</hi> and his <hi>R. H.</hi> and to make a good Conſequence from <hi>Nazianzens</hi> ſenſe about <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:40965:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>Succeſſion in that Scheme of Affairs, to the ſenſe he probably would have had of it in ſuch a Scheme as ours. I am ſure there is no Conſequence from one to the other, although his Expoſtulations with the Soul of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſhould not paſs for mere Rhetorick, and if they muſt not, I deſire Mr. <hi>J.</hi> to ſay, if they will not prove the Invocation of Saints? If they muſt be underſtood as Rhetorick, then they are (as indeed they are) poor Sham Arguments to prove either the Invocation of Saints, or <hi>That the Fathers would have ſet aſide an</hi> 100 <hi>ſuch Titles</hi> as that of the Heir of <hi>England to ſecure their Religion;</hi> but if they muſt not be ſo underſtood, then do they not equally prove both. Indeed were an Act of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion the only way of ſecuring our Religion, were it certain that the Popiſh Succeſſor ſo preſumed muſt if he were not excluded, ſucceed, or were the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of him not the moſt diſputable way of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing our Religion, and very hurtful to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or were it not, as the <hi>Excluders</hi> would back it with an Act for Aſſociation, attended with as pernicious inconveniences, as it would prevent, then indeed our Author might have better preſumed to determine what the Fathers would have done in ſuch a caſe; but ſince it is not the only Expedient, but ſuch an one as is very diſputable and dangerous too, he was, methinks, too bold with their Beards in aſſerting, That <hi>they would have ſet aſide an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſuch Titles, to ſecure their Religion,</hi> when other probable Means more agreeable to the Conſtitution of the Government, were offered for the Security thereof. In ſuch a caſe the Fathers might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their Zeal for the Chriſtian Religion, and yet like our Loyal Addreſſers, have made it their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Requeſt to the Emperor, not to have paſſed the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40965:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>Bill of Excluſion, that is but one among other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients; and a man may be free in the Choice of means, without being <hi>Guelph, and Gibeline at once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſure there is no ſuch Contrariety in ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, as for a Miniſter of our Church to write ſuch a Book as <hi>Julian,</hi> to be Lamb without, and Wolf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; to wear the Churches Livery, and yet in ſecret to liſt himſelf with her Enemies; to pretend a mighty concern for Religion, and yet to ſlander the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, and ſcoff at the Doctrine of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience; this indeed is to be contrary to his Profeſſion, and to be <hi>Guelph,</hi> and <hi>Gibeline</hi> at once.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40965:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>what I have written in this Chapter: Either the Behaviour of the Chriſtians was really as Barbarous and Exorbitant againſt <hi>Julian</hi> as Mr. <hi>J.</hi> hath repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it, or it was not; if it were, then they muſt bear the Blame of it, having no ſuch Warrant for it, as he told us they had; but if it really were not, then he hath done neither like a Scholar, nor a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to exaggerate and miſrepreſent it with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to deceive the World.</p>
            <p>I am afraid, The beſt Friends Mr. <hi>J.</hi> hath, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep him from being Obnoxious to one of theſe two Conſequences; and therefore in the next place let us enquire, Whether the Chriſtians did behave themſelves ſo like <hi>Apoſtates, and Barbarians</hi> againſt their Lawful Emperor, as he hath endeavoured to make the World believe they did. Surely if the Paſſages be examined, which he hath produced, it will appear that ſome of them are Dubious, others Falſe, ſome Laudable, many of them Innocent, and thoſe few that are Blameable, or that he would have to be ſo, Excuſable in a great meaſure, and having nothing Singular in them, which have not been done to other Emperors before.</p>

            <p>I Shall begin with their Behaviour towards him in Words, as it is ſet down in his Third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where all along he moſt unjuſtly charges what was ſaid but by one, or a few Chriſtians upon the whole Number, altho the Examples, which he hath brought are nothing in proportion to the <hi>whole Eaſtern Empire,</hi> much leſs to the <hi>Weſtern,</hi> in which perhaps not one Inſtance of that which he calls <hi>Barbarous Behaviour towards</hi> Julian, can be produced. At his rate of arguing from one, or a few Examples to the whole Church, a man may prove out of the Scriptures, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were a very unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward People, for there, as he is pleaſed to phraſe it, <hi>A man may almoſt loſe himſelf in the great variety of Inſtances, which may be given of their</hi> great, and manifold Miſcarriages, if what ſome particular Men or Churches did amiſs, might be charged upon the whole Body of Chriſtians, and be called <hi>theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ſaith he of the Chriſtians in general; <hi>
                  <hi>They</hi> ſufficiently requited him for calling them</hi> Galilaeans, <hi>for <hi>they</hi> named him <hi>Idolianus</hi>
               </hi> inſtead of <hi>Julianus,</hi> and <hi>Piſaeus,</hi> and <hi>Adonaeus from his worſhipping of</hi> Jupiter, and <hi>Adonis;</hi> and Bull-burner <hi>from the great number of them, which he ſacrificed.</hi> One would think as he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40965:90"/>hath repreſented the matter, that all the Chriſtians uſed thus to Nickname <hi>Julian,</hi> and yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult that place of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> which he cites for it in the Margent, we ſhall find that it was not the general Practiſe of the Chriſtians ſo to call the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate</hi> in requital, <hi>but of ſome of one ſort.</hi>

            <p>But let us ſuppoſe that theſe merry Gentlemen did tranſgreſs the duty of Chriſtians in playing upon the Name of <hi>Julian,</hi> yet there was nothing of tendency to Rebellion in it, nothing ſpecifick that can tempt a man to think, that they did it becauſe <hi>he perſecuted the Chriſtians contrary to Law.</hi> Our bleſſed Lord called <hi>Herod Fox,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>Nero Lyon,</hi>

Wherefore let us take up Spiritual Weapons; we have no need of Darts and Arrows, and other Bodily Armour, our Tongues [by which we are to confeſs Chriſt] are ſufficient Arms for us, and out of our Mouths ſhall we ſhoot Arrows againſt the Devils Head.</q> Theſe are the Sayings of theſe two Captains in St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi>

Upon this immediately ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Table, they became like diſtracted Men; and being heated with Zeal and Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ran about the Market-place, crying, out, and ſaying, <q>We <hi>are Chriſtians, we are Chriſtians in our Hearts; we declare it to all men, and before all men unto God, to whom we live, and for whom we will dye. O Saviour Chriſt we have not betrayed thee, we have not denyed the Faith; for however we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee with our Hands, we are upright in our Hearts; the Emperor deceived us, and we are not tainted with his Gold, we renounce this ungodly Act, we will waſh it off with our Blood.</hi>

                  <hi>cryed out, Sir, we have not received Gifts from you, but our own Death and Damnation; you called us, not to Honour us by them, but to mark us with Diſgrace; Now do us who

               </q> Having ſaid this to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, they informed others of the Cheat he had put upon them, and exhorted them to make Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to their Saviours Honour with their Blood.

            <p>OUr Author having ſhewed us how the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans behaved themſelves towards <hi>Julian</hi> in Words, proceeds in two Examples to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Actions, <hi>which,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>make manifeſt their Hatred to him, and how they held him in the very loweſt degree of Contempt.</hi> We may be ſure theſe two Examples are the beſt he could pick out; but as for the firſt, he hath unluckily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from it the Efficacy he intended it ſhould have, by obſerving out of <hi>Theodoret</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> that <hi>Valentinian</hi> did what he did to the <hi>Sacriſt,</hi> as a Confeſſor of the Chriſtian Religion; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes that he did it, not out of hatred to <hi>Julian,</hi> or with a Deſign to affront his Majeſty, but out of love to his Saviour, and to own his Religion, and to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his Fidelity to him.</p>
            <p>For in thoſe ſtreights, wherein he was ſurprized, he was either to receive the <hi>Sprinklings of the Luſtral Water</hi> quietly, as the Heathens did, and then he had polluted himſelf, or elſe he was bound to ſhew by ſome Sign, that he was no Heathen, nor Apoſtate, but a true Chriſtian; and having no time to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, which was the moſt decent, and inoffenſive way, we need not wonder, that he ſtruck the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſt,</hi>

               <hi>this dody Body of an old Man, ſcarce able to breath,</hi> was reſolved to kick <hi>Julian</hi> in the head of a Troop; and what is yet ſtranger, <hi>Julian,</hi> who had fought ſo many
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40965:102"/>Battles in the Head of his Legions, having happily got Intelligence of his Deſign, was ſo terrified at the danger, that he ran away. Beſides, it is not imaginable, that a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor ſhould put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Head of a Captain and his Company of Archers to lead them on to the ſtorming of a Church; it was very proper for him to command ſuch a Captain, and his Company upon the Service, but to lead them on himſelf, was not conſiſtent with the Emperors Majeſty, who never marched any where, but attended with the Praetorian Guards.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations methinks might have made Mr. <hi>J.</hi> conſider the <hi>Greek</hi> better, and if he had, he would not have thought it any <hi>Soleciſm</hi> to underſtand the Place of the Captain of the Archers, becauſe he who led them on demanded the Church <gap reason="foreign">

If he did not, he was very ignorant, and if he did, he was very diſ-ingenuous to ſay ſo againſt his own Knowledge, and then he thinks he concludes bravely with a Sarcaſme upon the Excellent Primate, and Biſhops of <hi>Scotland, only this we may be aſſured of, that none of thoſe Biſhops (Maris</hi> nor Old <hi>Gregory) had ever been in</hi> Scotland, <hi>nor had learnt to fawn upon an Apostate, and a mortal Enemy to their Religion.</hi> His <hi>R.

            <p>This is a Doubty <hi>Hero</hi> to attack a King, and a Prince; nay his own natural King and Prince, with Fourteen Biſhops at a time: Every one knows he alludes to the Letter, which the Biſhops of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſent to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to let his Grace, and their Brethren in <hi>England</hi> know, how much they were beholden to his <hi>R.

All this being ſuppoſed, let Mr. <hi>J.</hi> tell me, if it would have been <hi>Fawning,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and Prudence</hi> in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Biſhops to ſend an Account of this moſt Generous and perhaps Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Goodneſs of <hi>Julian</hi> to the Orthodox Church, and Clergy, notwithſtanding the general ſuſpitions that went abroad of his being a <hi>Pagan,</hi> to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to deſire him, when <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> returned to the Court, to give him Humble thanks.</p>

               <hi>were the Arms of the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for they were Darts, and Arrows, and Firebrands, and Death.</hi> Cruel Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians! ſo <hi>to dart their Prayers againſt</hi> Julian, and then to be ſo flippant as <hi>to expreſs it by a Word which might more properly be employed to deſcribe, the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Javelin,</hi> which afterwards ſtuck in his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> Oh <hi>but it was</hi> Julian! <hi>and in that Age thoſe were accounted the beſt Prayers, and Tears, which did beſt Execution upon an Apoſtate Emperor, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted moſt to his Destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a very pretty Declamation, and would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſwade a man to think, that the Chriſtians in <hi>Julians</hi> Time had <hi>Army-Chaplains among them,</hi> and that they prayed to the Lord of Hoſts for his Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in <hi>Field-Conventicles,</hi> with Javelins in their Hands, and Swords by their Sides. <hi>The Nightly Squadrons,</hi> and <hi>lying upon the Ground</hi> doth much countenance this Notion; and if the unwary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Julian</hi> be carried into ſuch Miſtakes by the Authors Artillery-Metaphors, as ſome I know have been, is he not to Anſwer to God for it? Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering, that after ſo many falſe and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Charges upon thoſe Chriſtians in general: At
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40965:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>length he <note n="(‖)" place="margin">P. 95.</note> repreſents them; as Rebels in their Hearts, and ſaith, That <hi>they made uſe of other Ingredients beſides Prayers, and Tears in their Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt a Perſecutor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall hereafter ſhew the Falſeneſs of that Charge, and now proceed to examine the Juſtice of this. How doth it appear that the Chriſtians in <hi>Julians</hi> Time prayed for his Deſtruction? The Charge is General, &amp; like all other general Charges ought to be proved from a great Number of Particulars, eſpecially ſince the Society ſo charged is little leſs than the Catholik Church. Doth any Author ſay in general, That the Chriſtians prayed for the death of <hi>Julian;</hi> or can he furniſh us with ſo many particular Inſtances in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent places, as may, by the Laws of Induction ſerve to ground ſuch a General Charge upon? But inſtead of that he preſents us but with two Inſtances, which really are but one, even the Example of Old <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> and his Church at <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zum,</hi> for the <hi>We</hi> in Young <note n="(†)" place="margin">Invect. 1. p. 123.</note> 
               <hi>Gregory</hi> relates to the Chriſtians of that City, of whom he being one, ſpeaks in <hi>the Plural Number,</hi> We <hi>called for the Sword and the Plagues of Egypt; and</hi> We <hi>beſought him to judge his own Cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. And then, ſpeaking more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of himſelf, <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were my mental, and verbal Prayers unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is the Practiſe of Old <hi>Gregory</hi> and his Church to all the Churches, and Cities of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? Is this, without more Examples, ſufficient to prove that the reſt of the Churches in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire <hi>did publickly ſtrike the Villain</hi> [for ſo he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>with their Joynt Prayers and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> or that other Biſhops generally, ſpeaking
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40965:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>privately, Faſted, and Watched, and Prayed for his Deſtruction, and taught their People ſo to do? Would the ſingular Practiſe of one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhop, and of his People following his Example, be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Ground for a General Charge upon the whole Church of <hi>England?</hi> If it would not, how much leſs can the Example of one Biſhop or Church in <hi>the Roman Empire,</hi> ſignifie any thing to prove the General Practiſe of the reſt? But yet in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Logick, one Inſtance is ground enough for a Lawful Induction. It muſt be <hi>their</hi> Prayers, and <hi>their</hi> Tears, and <hi>they</hi> followed <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Example, and <hi>they</hi> darted theſe Prayers: But we need not wonder at his making an Induction from one Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, when he calls the few Months of <hi>Julians</hi> Reign an <hi>Age,</hi> p. 55. In that <hi>Age</hi> (ſaith he) the beſt Prayers, and Tears, were thoſe which did beſt Execution upon an Apoſtate Emperor.</p>
            <p>I do not queſtion but that the Chriſtians generally prayed for the Deliverance of the Church, but then it is reaſonable to believe, that they generally pray'd for <hi>Julians</hi> Converſion at the ſame time: Of this we can produce one Example, though our Author <note n="(‖)" place="margin">P. 96.</note> ſaith, That <hi>he could not find ſo much as one ſingle Wiſh among the Ancients for</hi> Julians <hi>Converſion, but all for his downright Deſtruction.</hi> If he could not, it was his own Fault, I fear the fault of his own willful Blindneſs; for in the very next Chapter to that <note n="(†)" place="margin">P. 59.

            <p>Now from this Example, in our Authors way of arguing, I might prove that the Chriſtians prayed for <hi>Julians</hi> return from his Error, and for the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the Church by that way: I am ſure it is very agreeable to their Charity, to think, That all would pray for his Repentance, that believed him capable of Repentance; and that none abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely prayed for his Deſtruction, but ſuch as thought him utterly uncapable of Repentance, and that he <hi>had ſinned the Sin unto death,</hi> for which it was in vain to pray.</p>
            <p>And indeed there was very good Reaſons to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that he was Irrecoverable, and had the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of a Devil againſt Chriſt, and the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and good grounds upon that preſumption to pray for his Deſtruction, and after his death in that unnatural Apoſtacy, <hi>to lodge him,</hi> as our Author ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>in Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to make out this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> let us conſider the Nature of his Apoſtacy; his Devotedneſs to the Devil, and his Spite to Chriſt, and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:40965:113"/>
            <p>As for his Apoſtacy, it was firſt occaſioned by his <note n="(‖)" place="margin">Theod. l. 3. c. 3.</note> Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Thirſt after the Empire, which made him go about <hi>Greece</hi> to find out Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and Fortune-Tellers, of whom he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, if he ſhould obtain his Deſire.

               <q>It may be (ſaith he) it was true, that he who killed <hi>Julian,</hi> was a Chriſtian; for it is not improbable, that ſome one of the Souldiers might take into conſideration, how the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and all Men to this day, ſtill praiſe the killers of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants in <hi>former times,</hi> as men that were willing to dye for the Common Liberty, and delivered their Country-men, Kindred, and Friends. And one then can ſcarce blame him, who ſhews himſelf ſo brave for God, and for that Religion, which he approves.</q> Theſe words of <hi>Sozomen</hi> are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as an Anſwer to <hi>Libanius</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Principles; for if according to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he deſerved Praiſe, who would hazard his life, to kill a Tyrant for the Common Liberty, upon the ſame Principles, one would ſcarce blame a man, who does the ſame, for God, and for the Religion which he approves.</p>
            <p>But although the words were to be taken abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and not as a Reply to <hi>Libanius,</hi> yet they are no Juſtification, but only an Extenuation of the Fact. The Phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But what if it had been certain, that a Chriſtian, perverted with <hi>Greek</hi> Principles, had killed <hi>Julian,</hi> what is that to the reſt of the Chriſtians of that Age?

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40965:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>than have been guilty of it, why doth he ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly endeavour to prove, that he was a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who did it, and that a Chriſtian Writer juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Fact, and yet neither blame the one, nor cenſure the other, according as they deſerved? A man can hardly deteſt that himſelf, which he doth not condemn, much more which he likes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and beſides, he hath with great delight and induſtry, moſt injuriouſly repreſented the Chriſtian Subjects of <hi>Julian,</hi> as <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Chriſtians before them, as men that did not reſiſt, not from any Chriſtian Principle of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but becauſe they were not in a <hi>probable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,</hi> wanting ſufficient Numbers, and Strength. Moreover, if he would rather have dyed, than mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Julian,</hi> why doth he ſpeak ſo ſlightly of the Fact, calling it only a <hi>Slippery Trick?</hi> The Learned Monſieur <hi>Nicol</hi> in his Logique, commonly called, the <hi>Janſeniſts Logique,</hi> diſtinguiſheth between the <hi>Principal,</hi> and <hi>Acceſſory</hi> ſignification of words. The Principal ſignification he calls that which ſignifies the Thing, and the <hi>Acceſſory</hi> is that which ſignifies the Love, or Hatred, the Honour or Contempt, the Delight or Abhorrence of him, who ſpeaks or writes of the Thing. As for Example, There are ſome Words to expreſs Fornication, which beſides the Principal ſignification, would plainly ſignifie, that he who uſed them, loved, and delighted, and was pleaſed with the thing. And others again there are, which beſides the Principal ſignification, would ſignifie the Turpitude of the thing, and the Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which the Speaker, or Writer had thereof. The great difference in Words and Phraſes comes from theſe <hi>Acceſſory Significations,</hi> and therefore me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks if Mr. <hi>J.</hi> who is a <hi>Man of Art,</hi> and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40965:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>would have had his Readers, eſpecially the Serious Part, really believe that he would <hi>have loſt his own Life, rather than have murdered</hi> Julian, he ſhould have found out fitting Words to have expreſſed the Horrour of the Wickedneſs, and not <hi>have called it a Slippery Trick.</hi> I ſhould be loth to truſt my ſelf in the Company of Fellows who counted Robbery, and Murder <hi>but Slippery Tricks,</hi> or commit my Daughter to the Cuſtody of a Man, who, though he proteſted he would rather dye, than Deflower her, yet made no more of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than a <hi>Slippery Trick.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">P. 68, 69, 70, 71, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>their Caſe and ours differs very much, and we are in quite other Circumſtances, than the former Chriſtians were. For when this Apoſtate came to the Crown, he found us in full and quiet poſſeſſion of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which we and our Fathers had enjoyed for above Fifty years, and which is ſo ineſtimable a Bleſſing, that we ſhall plainly undervalue it, if we do not our beſt to keep it. But the former Chriſtians were born to Perſecution, they neither knew better, nor expected it; they profeſſed their Religion, as in ſome places they propound new Laws, with Halters about their Necks; for the Laws of the Empire were always in force against them, though not always put in Execution; and the Edge of the Ax ſtood always towards them, though it were not at all times ſtained with their Blood. They perpetually lay at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Enemies; their Religion at the beſt was in the World but upon ſufferance, as</hi> Abraham <hi>was in the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>where he had none Inheritance, not ſo much as to ſet his Foot on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But as his afflicted Poſterity were afterwards Lords of that Country, ſo after another</hi> Egyptian <hi>Bondage, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was advanced by</hi> Conſtantine <hi>of Bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, to be the Religion of the Empire: Never any man in this World ſet his Heart ſo much upon any thing, as he
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40965:130"/>did to ſee the Chriſtians flouriſh, and to have all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Glory and Power; and we hope that all men, who value the Eſtabliſhment of their Religion, at this rate will not eaſily part with it. We hope they will not let</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, <hi>who by his Baptiſm firſt, and by entring into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders after, and by his going to Church after that, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently engaged himſelf to maintain Chriſtianity, diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them of their Freehold: No, it is an unſupportable Injury. Conſider, we beſeech you, is there no difference between being turn'd out as Sheep among Wolves, which was the Deplorable, but unavoidable caſe of the firſt Chriſtians, and being worried by one of their own Flock? Hath a man no more Right, nor Priviledge, after he is Naturalized, than when he was a Stranger, or Alien, or accounted an Enemy? Do not the ſame Laws, which forbid men to invade other mens Rights, enable them to maintain, and defend their own? Theſe are the plain and palpable differences between the State of the former Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and us; They ſuffered according to the Laws of their Country, whereas we are perſecuted contrary to Law: And the Goſpel only requires Paſſive Obedience from Chriſtians when the Laws are againſt them, and when the Laws of the Land make it death to profeſs Chriſtianity, then, and then only we are to lay down our Lives for Chriſts ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore we cannot but much wonder at ſuch men, who trouble the World with the unſeaſonable Preſcription of Prayers and Tears, and the Paſſive Obedience of the</hi> Thebaean <hi>Legion in the laſt Perſecution, which were proper only at ſuch times, when the Laws of the Empire were armed againſt our Religion. But what have we to do with the</hi> Thebaean <hi>Legion now? Bleſſed be God, who hath made the difference between us, and the former Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: Poor men, they died as Glorious Martyrs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Religion, yet they died as Criminals and Malefactors in the Eye of the Law. But we ſhall plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40965:130"/>throw away our Lives, if we practiſe any ſuch Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience, who have the Laws on our ſide: Nay, we juſtly deſerve to be ſo uſed as the</hi> Thebaean <hi>Legion was, and moreover, to be loaded with the Curſes of all Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if we ſuffer our ſelves to be brought into that Condition. Away then with the old Artillery of Prayers and Tears, and the unſeaſonable Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience, which makes the World for the Cut-Throats of</hi> Julian, <hi>and our Throats the Perquiſites of their Places: It is not now eſſential to the Goſpel to be a Suffering Religion, that is an Evil which only attends it in bad times, when the Laws are againſt it, as in the</hi> Neronian, Decian, <hi>and</hi> Diocleſian Perſecutions, when the <hi>Chriſtians quietly ſubmitted to the Laws; but all this is nothing to us, who may purſue Julian</hi> like a Midnight Thief, or High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Robber.</p>

There never was greater Examples of Paſſive Obedience, than in the ſhort Reign of <hi>Julian,</hi> whoſe Chriſtian Subjects, and Souldiers, tho far more numerous, than in any Age before them, not only patiently endured many grievous Miſeries, but, what was the moſt provoking and grievous of all Miſeries, they daily heard and ſaw themſelves, their Religion, and their Bleſſed Saviour moſt blaſphemouſly ſcorned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled.

For then the Chriſtians were perſecuted at a time, when they could not want the Help, nor likely the Sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their oppreſſed Heathen Fellow-Subjects, then if ever they might have taken up Arms under the Fine Pretence of defending their Liberties and the Laws, but there was not one word of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: No, <hi>poor Wretches,</hi> they were <hi>mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40965:141"/>and fettered with the Slaviſh Principle of Paſſive Obedience,</hi> which Chriſt and his Apoſtles, had taught them: The Chriſtian prevailed above the <hi>Greek</hi> Principles in their Conſciences: And the Tyrant knew, he was ſecure in their Numbers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from his <hi>Greek</hi> Subjects, among whom it was not only an allowed Principle to kill a Tyrant, but alſo counted a Meritorious Work.

            <p>Wherefore, to conclude this Chapter, ſeeing the Former Chriſtians, eſpecially thoſe under <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius,</hi> were Perſecuted, Oppreſſed, and Enſlaved, not only as Chriſtians, but as Subjects too, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Law.

               <hi>There</hi> (ſaith he, meaning in Dr. <hi>Hickes</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) <hi>it was I met with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Paſſive Obedience, which, when it is taught without any regard to Laws, and is preſcribed without Law, and againſt Law, is not Evangelical, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan, and the very</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Doctrine of the Bow-String.</hi> And in his Ninth Chapter, wherein he hath endeavoured to confute the Doctrine of Paſſive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience as it is ſo taught, and practiſed; all that he hath ſaid, is comprized in <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. p. 92. <hi>When the Laws of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and our Country interfere, and it is made death by the Law of the Land to be a Good Chriſtian, then we are to lay down our
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40965:143"/>Lives for Chriſts Sake. This is the</hi> only Caſe <hi>wherein the Goſpel requires Paſſive Obedience, namely, when the Laws are againſt a Man, and this was the caſe of the firſt Christians.</hi> And in p. 75. ſaith he, <hi>Men throw away their Lives, and are certainly weary of them, if they practiſe Paſſive Obedience againſt the Laws, and the Truth of it is, we juſtly deſerve to be ſo uſed as the</hi> Thebaean <hi>Legion was, and moreover to be loaded with the Curſes of all Posterity, if we ſuffer our ſelves to be brought into their Condition, for that can never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, but by our own Treachery to our Religion, in part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe good Laws, that protect it, and in agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch, as ſhall deſtroy it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am very well ſatisfied, that the Caſe of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baean</hi> Legion, or any other like it, can never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> we of theſe Kingdoms having ſuch Security againſt Tyranny, as no People ever had; but upon ſuppoſition, that it may happen, I am very well aſſured, that we ought patiently to ſuffer it, or any other Condition like unto it, though our ſufferings would be againſt Law.</p>
            <p>But to ſtate this matter clearly, and to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Reader, I muſt here beg leave to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the Laws in any Government, which declare, and aſcertain the <hi>Rights of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> and thoſe, which ſecure the <hi>Rights of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

            <p>Laſtly, To have the Legiſlative Power, or the Power that makes <hi>any form of Words a Law.</hi> The Soveraign Power may indeed be limited as to the Exerciſe of this Power, which may be confined to Bills, and Writings prepared by others, but ſtill it is the Soveraign Authority, who gives Life, and Soul to the dead Letter of them; and all Princes, or States which want this Authority, let their Names and Titles be never ſo great, are not compleat So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns, but Subjects, becauſe upon this ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they have not Power to make Laws to bind o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but others have Power to make Laws to bind them.</p>

               <item>3. <hi>When the Laws of God, and our Country interfere, and it is made death by the Law of the Land to be a good Chriſtian, then we are to lay down our Lives for Chriſts Sake.</hi> So far is very true, becauſe every man is bound to ſubmit to the Penalties of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <item>4. <hi>That the killing of a Man contrary to Law, is Murder;</hi> And if the Soveraign kill a Man contrary to Law, he is guilty of Murder, but muſt anſwer for it to God only.</item>
               <item>5. <hi>That every Man is bound to prevent Murder, as far as the Law allows;</hi> But the <hi>Imperial,</hi> or <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law,</hi> allows no Man to prevent his own Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by riſing up againſt, or reſiſting his Soveraign, and therefore the laſt words are falſe, <hi>And ought not to ſubmit to be murdered, if he can help it;</hi> unleſs by <hi>help it,</hi> he means help it by Prayers, and Tears.</item>

            <p>I hope I have already ſufficiently enervated <hi>the Strength, and Force</hi> of our Authors Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> or <hi>Non-reſiſtance;</hi> and now after his Example, I ſhall <hi>reduce the Strength and Force of what I have hitherto ſaid, into theſe following Propoſitions.</hi>

               </item>

               </item>
               <item>VI. <hi>Paſſive Obedience, or patient Suffering of Injuries from the Soveraign, is not forbid by Gods Laws, and therefore Subjects are bound to perform it, where it is required by the Imperial Laws.</hi>

               <hi>And now I ſhall deſire theſe Men, who of late</hi> have thundred ſo much with <hi>Julian</hi> againſt the <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion, to conſider well, what I have ſaid in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral about the <hi>Common Laws of Soveraignty;</hi> when they have digeſted it well, they will be convinced, how fallaciouſly the Author of that Pamphlet hath dealt with them in ſuppreſſing this Notion, and making them believe, That there were no Laws belonging to Government, but thoſe, which I call Political Laws. But, as I have ſhewed, there are <hi>two Tables</hi> belonging to every perfect, and regular Government, one which concerns the Majeſty of the Soveraign, Gods Vicegerent, which I may call the <hi>firſt Table;</hi> and another, which concerns the Good and Safety of the People, which may be called the <hi>ſecond Table;</hi> and theſe two together are the <hi>Compleat and Adequate Rule</hi> of Civil Obedience and Subjection, and Paſſive Obedience, or the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient bearing of the greateſt Injuries, when it is not a Duty by This, is very often ſo by That. When
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40965:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Laws are againſt us, then it is our Duty by the ſecond Table; and when the <hi>Soveraign</hi> is againſt us contrary to the Laws of the ſecond Table, then it is our Duty by the Laws of the firſt, which abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid us to bear the Sword againſt him, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel his Forces by Force. Wherefore to anſwer our Authors <note n="(†)" place="margin">P. 87.</note> Queſtion, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Dr. <hi>Hicks was very ſerious, and in earneſt when he taught, and preached up Paſſive Obedience for Evangelical in this caſe.</hi> It may be ſeen by the Drs. Sermon, and other of his Pieces, that he doth not write raſhly; and I have reaſon to preſume that he aſſerted <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> upon the ſame bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that I now defend it. He is far from having <hi>Men to proſtitute their Lives to Malice, and Violence,</hi> for he would rather have them to abſcond, or fly; but if they can, or will do neither in times of Illegal Perſecution, he thinks there remains nothing for them to do, <hi>but patiently to ſubmit</hi> to unavoidable Death. He had no reaſon to diſtinguiſh betwixt ſuffering <hi>according to, and contrary to Law,</hi> becauſe he knew that neither the Laws of God, nor Man allow any Subject the Benefit of forcible defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the illegal Violence of his Soveraign, but that by the <hi>Laws Imperial</hi> he ought to dye rather than reſiſt: And if this <note n="(‖)" place="margin">P. 87.</note> 
               <hi>was too light for the Pulpit, and juſt ſuch another Piece of Drollery, as that in the Dedication to</hi> Oliver Cromwel before <hi>Killing no Murder,</hi> I proteſt, I know not what it is to be ſerious in the Pulpit, nor what Apoſtolical Divinity is. The Goſpel from one end to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is full of this kind of <hi>Drollery;</hi> and for my own I ſeriouſly proteſt, I had rather be Paſſive, were

            </p>
            <p>Our Author in this, and ſuch like Reflections, writes more like an Apoſtate from the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than a Miniſter of it; and if any thing in this Anſwer may contribute to make him ſenſible of his Sin, and bring him to the Humiliation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of his Elder Brother <hi>Ecebolius,</hi> I ſhall think my pains well ſpent.</p>
            <p>But to bring this general Diſcourſe about the Common Laws of <hi>Soveraignty</hi> to <hi>our own Caſe,</hi> I ſhall now proceed to ſhew, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Realm is a <hi>perfect Soveraignty</hi> or Empire, and that the King of <hi>England,</hi> by the Imperial Laws of it, is a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, Imperial, and Independent Soveraign,</hi> to whom the foreſaid Rights of Soveraignty do inſeparably belong.</p>

            <p>Thus much may ſerve to ſhew, that the Realm of <hi>England</hi> is a Perfect Soveraignty, or Empire, and the King a Compleat Imperial Soveraign: Where, for the Readers ſatisfaction, I muſt obſerve, That the Regal Eſtate is then Imperial, when the King is Supream in his Dominions next under God, and hath full, perfect, and entire Jurisdiction from God alone, and all others within his Dominions, by ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from him. Now this Perfection and Fulneſs of Imperial Power which makes an <hi>Imperial Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> is of two ſorts, ſuch as is limited by the Laws of God and Nature only, or ſuch as is limited by the Laws of God, and Nature, and Civil Laws, and Pactions too. The Power in both ſorts of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns is Imperial, <hi>i. e.</hi> full, perfect, abſolute, and entire, but the Exerciſe of it is differently bounded, and regulated, one by the Laws of God and Nature; and the other by Humane Poſitive Laws; and the <hi>latter Limitation</hi> doth no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Fulneſs, and Perfection, and Supremacy of the Power, than <hi>the former;</hi> becauſe the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, who is under Political Limitations, as to the

To be Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is no more of the Eſſence of an Imperial So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, than to be free in the courſe of its Waters is of the Eſſence of a Fountain, but as the Fountain of an Aqueduct, for Example, is as perfect in its Kind, and generally more beneficial, and uſeful to Mankind, than a Free-flowing Spring: So limited Soveraigns are as perfect and eſſential Soveraigns, as the purely Arbitrary or Deſpotic, and generally more Beneficial, and Salutary to the World.</p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:40965:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>All that I have hitherto ſaid, may be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by diſtinguiſhing between the <hi>Being, and Eſſence</hi> of Imperial, or Soveraign Power, and the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> and <hi>Emanation</hi> thereof. As to the Being and Eſſence of it, it is in as full perfection in the Limited as in the Arbitrary Soveraign, though the Law confines and limits him in the Exerciſe thereof; but to be confined in the Exerciſe doth not deſtroy the Being, nor diminiſh the perfection of Soveraign Power, for then the Power of God himſelf could not be Soveraign, becauſe there are certain immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Rules of Truth, and Juſtice, within which it is neceſſarily limited, and confined. But God is nevertheleſs a perfect Imperial Soveraign over the Univerſe, though the Exerciſe of his Government over his Creatures be limited by the Eternal Laws of Truth and Equity. It is true, that this Limitation of Almighty God is <hi>Intrinſecal,</hi> and proceeds from the perfection of his Righteous and Holy Nature, but yet it ſhews, that the moſt perfect and abſolute Imperial Power may, without a Contradiction, be confined within bounds, and limited in the actual Exerciſe thereof; and that ſuch moderation, and limitation of Power Abſolute, and Imperial, doth only qualifie, and temper, and not deſtroy the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thereof. And therefore <hi>Cook</hi> in <hi>Caudreys Caſe</hi> ſaith, That <hi>by the Ancient Laws of this Realm</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>is an Abſolute Empire, and Monarchy; and that the King is furniſhed with Plenary, and Entire Power, Prerogative, and Juriſdiction, and is Supream Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour over all Perſons within this Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any man will but attend well to his own Thoughts, he will find no Inconſiſtency between the Fulneſs of Soveraign, or Imperial Power in the Root and Eſſence of it, and a legal limitation of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40965:149"/>the Uſe, and Exerciſe thereof. And from hence it comes to paſs, That the King of <hi>England,</hi> though he be limited in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Exerciſe</hi> of his Power, yet he is as much the Fountain of all Power, and Juriſdiction within his Dominions, as if he were Arbitrary; He hath none to ſhare with him in the Soveraignty, but all Power and Authority is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him like Light from the Sun; in Him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone it is Radically and Originally placed; He hath no Sharers or Co-partners in the Soveraignty; none Co-ordinate with him in Government; no Equal, nor Superior, but only God, to whom alone he is Subject.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40965:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>there were any Power in his Kingdoms, that could call him to account for Maladminiſtration, for that very Reaſon he would not be a <hi>Compleat Soveraign,</hi> but the Power to whom he was accountable would be Superior, and not he.

            <p>But 2dly, To ſay that <hi>the King is the only Supream Governour, inſtituted, and furniſhed with plenary, whole, and entire Power, and Juriſdiction, muſt needs imply,</hi> that he alone hath the Power of the Sword; for were the Power of the Sword in any elſe, he could not be furniſhed with <hi>plenary, whole, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Power.</hi> Beſides, the Civil Power is inſignificant without the Military, and therefore if the Civil Power were ſeated in him, and the Military in any other Perſon or State, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Realm would have two Soveraigns, one Civil, and another Military, which is moſt abſurd to think. Therefore by the Common Laws of Soveraignty, the Power of the Sword, like all other <hi>Temporal Power muſt be derived, and deducted from him, as Supream Head, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this Realm;</hi> and indeed <hi>his Soveraignty</hi> would be an empty inſignificant nothing, were the <hi>Scepter</hi> in his Hand, and the <hi>Sword</hi> in any others. And therefore <hi>Glanvil</hi> in his Prologue before his <hi>Tractat. de leg. &amp; conſuet. regni Anglae,</hi> ſuppoſeth the Power of the Sword primarily neceſſary for the King. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giam majestatem non ſolum armis oportet eſſe decoratam, ſed &amp; legibus; The Kings Majeſty ought to be fortified not only with Arms, but with Laws; with Arms</hi> in the firſt place, without which his Laws would be little worth. So ſaith <hi>Fletal.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 17. <hi>Habet Rex in manu ſuâ omnia Jura—Et materialem gladium, qui pertinet ad regni gubernaculum.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Bracton</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his firſt Book, <hi>In rege qui rectè regit, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaria ſunt duo haec, Arma videlicet &amp; Leges,</hi> &amp;c. And if the Sword be originally in the Kings Hand,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40965:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>and none can bear it without Authority derived from him, it muſt needs follow from hence, that he muſt be free from all Coercive, and Vindicative Power, and that no Man can lawfully reſiſt him, or his Forces, becauſe no Man can lawfully bear the Sword [except for private Defence] but by Commiſſion from him. I would fain be reſolved by the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer of <hi>Julian,</hi> who can Array the People againſt their Soveraign and his Armies, or who hath Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (for example) to make <hi>him</hi> a Captain, or as much as a Drummer of a Company, if there ſhould fall out an hopeful Occaſion of recovering ſome loſt Biſhops-Lands? All Commiſſions of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would be unauthoritative; and therefore how a man can either give, or receive ſuch unauthorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commiſſions, or oppoſe, or reſiſt the King and his Armies by vertue of them, without ſin, I deſire Mr. <hi>H.</hi> as a Lawyer, and Mr. <hi>J.</hi> as a Divine, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.</p>

            <p>Whatever it was, I will ſtand no longer gueſſing: But having ſhewed that <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> is required in all Perfect, and Regular Governments by the Common Laws of Soveraignty, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in this Realm by the <hi>Imperial Laws</hi> thereof; I will proceed to enquire how far the Church, and Ancient Churchmen have agreed with the <hi>Three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates;</hi> for I find, that our Author makes much uſe of Eccleſiaſtical Authority, particularly of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and of the Book of Homilies, when they favour him; but how far he will value them, when they are againſt him, eſpecially in this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie between him, and the Doctor, about <hi>Paſſive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> I will not undertake to tell.</p>
            <p>I will begin with <hi>the Neceſſary Doctrine and Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for any Christen Man,</hi> ſet forth by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. with the Adviſe of his Reforming Clergy, who were the Compilers of it, ſuch as <hi>Cramner,</hi> and other Martyrs, who on the Fifth Commandment write thus: <hi>Subjects be bound not to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their Fealty, Truth, Love, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards their Prince for any Cauſe whatſoever it be, ne for any cauſe they may Conſpire againſt his Perſon, ne do any thing towards the Hinderance, or Hurt thereof, nor of his Eſtate.</hi> And afterwards they prove this out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Whoſoever reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt the Ordinance of God ſhall get to themſelves Damnation.</hi> And upon the Sixth Commandment: <hi>No Subjects may draw their Swords againſt their Prince for any cauſe whatſoever it be, nor againſt any

                  <hi>Neither doth the Goſpel preſcribe any Remedy but Flight againſt the Perſecutions of the Lawful Magiſtrate, allowing of no other Mean, when we cannot eſcape, betwixt denying, and dying for the Faith.</hi>

                  <hi>What the Goſpel Preſcribes is one thing, what it Allows is another:</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>There are ten ten thouſand things allowed by the Goſpel, not one of which is preſcribed by it.</hi> But what is this to the purpoſe? the Doctor ſpeaks there of the only Goſpel-Expedient, or Remedy againſt Perſecution,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40965:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>which is <hi>Flight.</hi> He aſſerts, that the Goſpel allows of no other Mean againſt the Perſecutions of the Lawful Magiſtrate; and if it allow no other, then certainly it preſcribes <hi>That.</hi> The Phyſitian that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows but of one only Medicine againſt the Plague, doth certainly preſcribe it to the Patient: And to make no more words about the matter, Flight, by the Goſpel, is a preſcription as neceſſary for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Subject that would ſave his Life in time of Perſecution, as a Ship to a Man that would croſs the Seas.</p>

But there are Hereticks among Lawyers, as well as Divines, and they will wreſt the Laws, as the other do the Scriptures to their own Damnation: And truly this Doctrine of Depoſing Kings, makes the King of <hi>England</hi> a Subject, and the Three Eſtates his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. And it is a Treaſonable Doctrine in the ſame ſenſe that the Act of Uniformity declares the Poſition <hi>of taking up Arms by the Kings, Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Perſon,</hi> a Traiterous Poſition, becauſe it tends to Treaſon: And if a man ſhould write a Book to prove it, it would be a Treaſonable or Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Book.</p>
            <p>For the ſame Reaſon the Book, of which he ſaith my Lord <hi>Hollis</hi> is the Author, is an <hi>Impious, and Treaſonable Book; Impious,</hi> becauſe it abounds with Falſifications of Records, as the Authors <hi>of the Rights of the Biſhops,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Queſtion</hi> have proved; and <hi>Treaſonable,</hi> becauſe it aſſerts this Traiterous Poſition, that <hi>the King is one of the three Eſtates.</hi> The belief of this very Poſition, made Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> (as he himſelf declares) a <hi>Rebel,</hi> and I queſtion not, but it made thouſands more beſides him; and never did man diſgrace the Memory of a Peer more, than <hi>Julian</hi> hath done that of my Lord, in reporting him to be the Author of the Book: For he being a man Learned in the Laws, could not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert this Poſition but againſt his Conſcience, and with an Ill Intent, which makes Mr. <hi>J.</hi> anſwerable

               <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Wherein are further conſidered the <hi>Reaſons for Paſſive Obedience,</hi> or <hi>Non-Reſiſtance;</hi> and wherein it is ſhewn, that Reſiſtance would be a Greater Miſchief, than Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience.</head>
            <p>I Have ſhewed in the Precedent Chapter, how the <hi>Common Laws of Soveraignty,</hi> and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the <hi>Laws Imperial</hi> of this Realm, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do condemn all Reſiſtance, and Force againſt the Soveraign; and I think it will not be Superfluous to my Deſign in this Undertaking, to weigh and conſider a little further, the Reaſons, which the Acts, and Authors above cited aſſign for this Doctrine; and the moſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and that which comprehends all the reſt, is this, That the Soveraign <hi>hath neither Superior, nor Equal upon Earth, but is next unto God, whoſe Anointed and Vicegerent he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>Sovergain</hi> muſt be always underſtood the Real, and Compleat Soveraign, becauſe there are many ſeeming Soveraigns, which are not really Such. As for Example, The Kings of <hi>Sparta</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed the Soveraign Power, but they were not Real Soveraigns, becauſe they were accountable for their Miſ-government to the <hi>Ephori,</hi> who were choſen for that purpoſe by the People. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither the Kings, who were Subject to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori,</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:40965:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>nor the <hi>Ephori,</hi> who were appointed by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the People themſelves was the real Soveraign next under God: The Kings had only the Exerciſe of the Soveraign Power, but not the Soveraign Power it ſelf, that was Radically, and Originally in the People, and derivatively in the Kings, who were no more than Miniſters, and Truſtees of the People, whom they could call to an Account by Judges of their own Appointment.</p>
            <p>So in the Government of <hi>Venice,</hi> though there be but one Duke, yet becauſe the Supream Power is not inveſted in him but in the <hi>Senate,</hi> that State is not really Monarchical, but Ariſtocratical; and the Duke is not a Real, but only a Titular, or Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bratical Soveraign, the very Creature of the Senate, which is his Superior, and the true Soveraign next under God.</p>
            <p>So in the Cantons of <hi>Suitzerland,</hi> though the Adminiſtration of the Government be in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and ſo make it look like an <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> yet in reality it is a <hi>Democracy,</hi> becauſe they derive their Power from the People, and are to give an Account of the Exerciſe of it to them, or thoſe whom they appoint.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, though the Houſe of Commons bears the Shew of a Democracy, and the Peers look like an Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy among us, yet our Government is a perfect Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, becauſe the Supream Power is, (as I have proved) neither in the one, nor in the other, nor in both together, but ſolely in the Perſon of the King.</p>
            <p>I was the more willing to make this Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that when I ſpeak of Soveraign Princes, I may not be maliciouſly traduced, as if I ſpoke of them
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40965:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>excluſively of other Soveraigns, as if Monarchy were of Sole Divine Right. For want of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction other Writers have had this invidious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation laid upon them; But this Reaſon of not Reſiſting the <hi>Soveraign,</hi> becauſe he is Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, and only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Subject to him, is a Common Reaſon of Paſſive Obedience to all Soveraigns, as well, as unto Kings, and unto Kings, as well as unto any other Soveraigns.</p>
            <p>The forecited Acts, and Authors, render no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſon but this, which indeed is vertually ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Reaſons; for if the Government of Men, as well as of Angels, be from God, then it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Firſt, That upon whomſoever God is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to beſtow the Soveraign Authority, he muſt alſo be underſtood to beſtow upon him all the <hi>Jura Majeſtatis,</hi> or Eſſential Rights of Soveraignty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Maxim, <hi>Qui dat eſſe, dat &amp; omnia pertinentia ad eſſe; He that gives the Eſſenſe, gives alſo the Properties belonging to the Eſſenſe.</hi> Wherefore as an Architect, who makes a Piece of Timber a Cube, or a Sphere, gives it all the Properties of a Cube, or a Sphere: So God, when he makes any Man a Soveraign, he gives him all the Eſſential Rights of Soveraignty, one of which is to be <hi>free from Reſiſtance, or Forcible Repulſe;</hi> For if any man, or number of men under him, had lawful Power to take up Defenſive Arms, or uſe Defenſive Force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Soveraign, and his Forces, he could not for this Reaſon be Soveraign, becauſe he would be Subject unto a <hi>Controllable Power.</hi> For according to this Suppoſition, his Subjects would have a Power of Judging of his Actions, whether they were Juſt, or Injurious, Lawful, or Unlawful, and when they might make a War Defenſive, and when not, which
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40965:164"/>is in effect to deſtroy Soveraignty, and make the <hi>Soveraign</hi> Inferior to the People: And therefore to cut off all pretenſes of Reſiſtance in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the Three Eſtates (as I have proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) have declared againſt all Defenſive, as well as Offenſive War, it being impoſſible for the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty to conſiſt <hi>with the Liberty of that Pretenſe:</hi> Juſt as among the <hi>Romans</hi> it was inconſiſtent with the Soveraign Unaccountable Power, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by Law had over the Slaves, for them to have a Liberty of Riſing up againſt them, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Self-defence.</p>

            <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour never intended to diminiſh, or deſtroy the Rights of Soveraignty, but on the contrary was very tender of them, commanding his Diſciples to <hi>render unto Caeſar the things that were Caeſars,</hi> and this was ſaid by him with reſpect to <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who was a Man exceſſive in Cruelty, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Luſt. It was ſaid indeed upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of paying Tribute, but holds as well to all the Rights of Soveraignty, and particularly as to this of being the Maſter of the Sword; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when St. <hi>Peter</hi> drew his Sword in his Maſters Defence againſt the Officers of the Cruel <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> he ſharply rebuked him, ſaying, Put up thy Sword, for <hi>he that uſeth the Sword, ſhall periſh by the Sword.</hi> This very Text was ever underſtood by the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, as an abſolute Prohibition to uſe any Violence againſt the Soveraign, and was applyed by <hi>Maunitius</hi> the Commander of the <hi>Thebaean Legion,</hi> when he charged his Souldiers in Chriſts Name, not to Reſiſt under the Specious Pretext of Self-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>And truly, if the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> had given a Right to the Profeſſors of it to defend themſelves, and it againſt the Illegal Violence of the Soveraign, it had not been a taking <hi>up of the Croſs, but of the Sword,</hi> not <hi>Evangelical,</hi> as our Author ſpeaks of Paſſive Obedience, <hi>but Mahumetan;</hi> and truly one who knew no more of the Goſpel, than what he might learn of it out of <hi>Julian,</hi> would never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Jeſus had ſaid, <hi>If any man will come after me let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

            <p>I appeal to the Late Rebellion, which the Rebels called <hi>a Defenſive War</hi> to verifie this Doctrine; for there was more Blood ſhed in it in one Battel, than in all the Tyrannies and Perſecutions of the Nation ſince the Conqueſt; and in the two Kingdoms there hath been more Chriſtian Blood ſhed in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions ſince the Reformation by pretended Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Defenſive War, than throughout the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in nine of the firſt ten Famous Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40965:174"/>a Popiſh Prince as bigotted in Religion, and as ſanguinary in his Temper, as may be now Reigning over us, yet he could not likely cauſe ſo much Ruin, Bloodſhed, and Deſolation in his whole Reign, as a War between him and his Reſiſting Subjects would cauſe in one Year. Wherefore it is plain, that it is the Intereſt even of the People themſelves, that ſo great a Power ſhould be in the Soveraign, that none ſhould withſtand him, or riſe up againſt him, and that nothing can be more pernicious to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in any Government, than that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould have a Power of taking up Arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Liberties, and Religion.</p>

               <hi>Chap. XII.</hi> Wherein is ſhewed, That notwithſtanding this Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance or Paſſive Obedience,</hi> we are Secure enough of our <hi>Lives, Properties,</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ALL that I have hitherto ſaid of Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, hath been to ſatisfie the Reaſons of the Thinking, and Sober Part of Men, and now I proceed to propoſe ſome Conſiderations, which may ſerve as a ſufficient Anſwer to that Haſty Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which timourous and ſuſpicious men are apt to make againſt this Doctrine, ſaying, <hi>Where then is our Security?</hi> How can we be Safe from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Tyranny, and Oppreſſion of our Soveraign, if we may not be allowed to Reſiſt?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That I have already ſhewn, that the Remedy of Reſiſtance is as bad, or worſe than the Diſeaſe of Tyranny and Perſecution; and I furthermore add, that upon ſuppoſition there were ſome Caſes allowed, wherein we might take up Defenſive Arms againſt the Soveraign, what Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity could the Soveraign have upon deſiſting from Tyranny and Perſecution, that this Defenſive Army would lay down their Arms? Might they not ſay, that he was not to be truſted, having once broke his Coronation-Oath, and that it was neceſſary for them to keep up in Arms to prevent a ſecond Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? Nay, might they not ſerve him, as the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40965:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>Army ſerved our Late Bleſſed Soveraign, and if they went about to do ſo, who durſt queſtion them for what they did? Perhaps you will reply, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Army is to be raiſed to reduce this to their former Obedience: But how difficult would it be for an Oppreſſed Prince, and People to raiſe an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt another Conquering Army; or if they did, what diſmal Conſequences, far worſe than any Tyranny, would follow thereupon? Beſides the Ruines, and Devaſtations during the War, Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Arbitrary Government would naturally be the Event of it: For if the firſt Army prevailed, then the Injured Prince, as well as the People, whom they pretended to defend, muſt be Subject to their Diſcretion; but if the King, and his new Army raiſed to reduce them prevailed, what then will become of our Liberties and Religion, which the firſt Army roſe up to defend?</p>
            <p>But perhaps you will object, That you would have this Defenſive Army under the Conduct of ſworn Truſtees for the People; That they ſhould be Disbanded, as ſoon as they have reduced the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing Prince. But who ſhall ſee that theſe Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees ſhall perform their Truſt? How can you be Secure they will not break their Oaths? Or if they be Faithful to their Truſt, how can you be ſecure the Defenſive Army will be disbanded by them? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what hapned between <hi>Cromwels</hi> Army, and the Houſe. But ſtill you will object, that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent theſe Inconveniences, you would have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in more Hands than one, you would not have one man only entruſted with it? Well, let it be ſo: Let us ſuppoſe that the Three Eſtates in Parliament were our Governours, yet I can object as ſtrongly againſt this: Either they will agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40965:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>or diſagree. If they agree, how can you be ſecure they will not divide the Land among them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in a ſhort time govern us as Arbitrarily as the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ate of <hi>Venice,</hi> under which the People really are what we call Slaves. But if they diſagree, as is moſt probable, having the Paſſions of Men, Ambition, Covetouſneſs, and Emulations, then their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will become uncertain, and odious, and the moſt popular amongſt them will take an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſet up himſelf; and when he hath maſtered his Companions, he muſt ſecure his Uſurpation by Force, and then his Pleaſure muſt be our Law.</p>
            <p>All theſe Inconveniences would apparently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the new Model for the Aſſociation to back the Excluſion of the next Heir. For either the Heads of it would agree, or diſagree. If they continued to agree, then the prepoſterous Heir, after he was made King, and his People alſo, muſt be ſubject to their Diſcretion. But if they ſhould diſagree, as moſt probably they would, then as faſt as they fell out among themſelves, or grew diſcontented, their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity would oblige them to revolt unto the Seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Heir, and help him to get poſſeſſion of the Crown. And in what a Miſerable Condition would this Nation be during ſuch a Civil War, no Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in all probability could be ſo Deſtructive; and whether the Popiſh Prince, or the Oppoſing Army at laſt prevailed, we muſt be ſubject to their Sword.</p>
            <p>In a word, there neither is, nor can be any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Security either for the Soveraign againſt the Subjects, or for the Subjects againſt the Soveraign in any Government: And therefore in the ſecond place, it may be a ſufficient Anſwer to the Former Queſtion, to ſhew, That we have all the Security
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40965:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>againſt the King, that the King hath againſt us, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all the Security, that any People in the World ever had, have, or ought to have. an</p>
            <p>For firſt, We have the Care and Providence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God for our Security, who is King of Kings, Lord of Lords, and the only Ruler of Princes: For as <hi>Daniel</hi> told <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the moſt High ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men, and giveth it to whomſoever, he will. The Wellfare of the Publick is much more the Object of his Fatherly Care, than the Wellfare of private perſons, and he delights to ſee the Nations of the Earth Happy, and will not let them be Afflicted and Oppreſſed with Tyrants, but when Tyranny is neceſſary, for their Puniſhment, or Cure. But much more is he concerned for his own Family, I mean, for any Nation, whoſe People are part of his Houſhold, which is the Catholick Church. He delights to ſee them Happy, and were it not for their Sins, he would always ſet ſuch Princes over them, as would be Nurſing Fathers to them, and the Church. But when it is neceſſary for their Puniſhment, or Reformation, then he will ſuffer their Kings to turn Tyrants; and when he doth ſo, the People, like the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> muſt patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer them, as they do other Judgments, and not riſe up againſt them, leſt they be found guilty of Rebellion againſt God.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, when a ſinful People turn from thoſe Sins, by which they provoke God, he will ſet Juſt, and Merciful, and Valiant Princes over them, who ſhall Love them; and Protect them as their own Children; and this he can do both ways, either by taking away Good, or Bad Princes, or by turning of their Hearts, <hi>For the Hearts of Kings are in his Rule, and Governance, and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40965:176"/>he doth diſpoſe, and turn them, as ſeemeth best to his Godly Wiſdom:</hi> According to what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, and perhaps upon his own Experience, That <hi>the Kings Heart is in the Hand of the Lord, as the Rivers of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he turneth it whitherſoever he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jealous, and Suſpicious Men indeed may have a thouſand Contrivances, and Phancied Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to prevent or remove Evil Princes; but when God ſhall ſee it fit to puniſh them that way, he will in a Moment baffle, and defeat them all. And on the other ſide, Princes may have a thouſand Deviſes how to oppreſs, or enſlave their People, but God, whoſe Inſtruments they are, can in a Moment over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them, and their Devices, he can reſiſt the Strength of the Strongeſt Leviathan, as he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Senaccherib; I know thy Abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy Rage againſt me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy Rage, and thy Tumult is come into mine Ears, therefore I will put my Hook in thy Noſe, and my Bridle in thy Lips, and I will turn thee back by the way in which thou cameſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, as the Princes beſt Security againſt the People is the watchful Providence of God: So the ſame watchful Providence is the Peoples beſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt the Prince. The ſame God who <hi>ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Noiſe of the Waves, and the Tumult of the People</hi> in defence of the King, doth likewiſe ſtill the Thunder, and aſſwage the Fury of the King in defence of the People, and neither could be ſafe one from the other, unleſs God did Watch and Preſide, and as it were pitch his Tent between them both.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as it is the ſecureſt way for a Prince to have Peaceable, and Obedient Subjects to ſerve God, whoſe Vicegerent he is: So on the other
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40965:177"/>hand, the beſt Security the People can have for their Property, and Liberty againſt the Prince, is to obey God, who ſetteth up one King, and pulleth down an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and changeth their Hearts as he ſees fit. I hope Mr. <hi>J.</hi> will not think me ſingular in this piece of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, becauſe it is taught by the Church <hi>in the next beſt Book to the Bible,</hi> to which he, and the Doctor have both ſubſcribed, in <hi>The firſt part of the Sermon against Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God (ſay the Holy Scriptures) maketh a Wicked Man to Reign for the Sins of the People. Again, God giveth a Prince in his Anger, meaning an Evil One, and taketh away a Prince in his Diſpleaſure, meaning eſpecially when he taketh away a Good Prince for the Sins of the People—God giveth Wiſdom unto Princes, and maketh a wiſe, and good King to Reign over that People, whom he loveth, and who loveth him.—If therefore we will have a good Prince either to be given us, or to continue, let us by our Obedience to God, and to our Prince, move God thereunto. If we will have an Evil Prince, when God ſhall ſend ſuch an one, taken away, and a Good in his place, Let us take away our Wickedneſs, which provoketh God to place ſuch an one over us, and God will either diſplace him, or of an Evil Prince make him a Good Prince, ſo that we firſt will change our Evil into Good. For will you hear the Scriptures? The Heart of the Prince is in Gods Hand, which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall pleaſe him he turneth it. Thus ſay the Scriptures, Wherefore let us turn
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40965:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>from our Sins unto the Lord with all our Hearts, and he will turn the Heart of the Prince unto our Quiet and Wealth. Elſe for Subjects to deſerve for their Sins to have an Evil Prince, and then to Rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, were double, and treble evil by provoking God more to plague them. Nay, let us either deſerve to have a good Prince, or let us</hi> patiently ſuffer, <hi>and obey ſuch as we deſerve. Shall the Subjects both by their Wickedneſs provoke God for their deſerved puniſhment, to give them an Indiſcreet, and Evil Prince, and alſo Rebel againſt him, and withal againſt God, who for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Sins did give them ſuch a Prince?</hi> I leave Mr. <hi>J.</hi> to give the Church an Anſwer to this her Interrogatory, and ſo proceed to the ſecond thing, which we have for our Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that is the <hi>Conſcience of the Prince:</hi> For as the Princes Security againſt the Inſurrection of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects conſiſts very much in the Conſcience that they have of the Duty, which they owe unto him: So their Security againſt his tyrannical abuſe of his Power conſiſts as much un the ſenſe of that Duty, which he ows unto them. He hath the ſame Principles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him to check his Paſſions, that they have to check, and bridle their; and hath all the Moral Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Fear of God, who hateth Tyrants, to keep him from oppreſſing them, that they have to keep them from Rebelling againſt him.</p>
            <p>The common Principles of Humanity, Juſtice, and Equity are engraven by the Finger of God upon the Minds of Kings, as well as upon other Mens; and they cannot do wrong to any particular perſon, much leſs to great numbers of their Subjects without
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40965:178"/>undergoing the ſame uneaſie Remorſe, that other Men do, when they injure one another. This hath been found by ſad Experience in <hi>Pagan</hi> Princes, as in <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor, who was ſo tormented with the ſenſe of his own Sins, that he could not but diſcover his own Confuſion unto the Senate in a Remarkable Letter, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus: <note n="(‖)" place="margin">

               <hi>My Lords, and Gentlemen; If I know what, or how to write, or not to write to you at this time, let all the Gods and Goddeſſes confound me with a worſe Death than by which I feel my ſelf periſhing every day.</hi> In ſuch a manner, ſaith the Hiſtorian, did the Gods turn his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes into his own Puniſhment, ſo that what <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid is very true, That if the Breaſts of Tyrants could be laid open, we ſhould ſee what ſlaſhes and gaſhes they ſuffer from their own Conſciences, and that the Body cannot ſuffer more from the Whip, than their minds do from the ſenſe of their Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Luſts.</p>
            <p>And if Conſcience be a Reſtraining Principle in Heathen Princes, if they cannot without ſuch Soul-Torments pervert Juſtice, and violate their Oaths, and the Laws, it muſt needs much more be a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Principle of Reſtraint to Chriſtian Kings, who are taught to know that they are Gods Miniſters,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40965:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>and that he will call them to a ſevere Account for oppreſſing his People, over whom he ſet them; nay, that he moſt commonly ſends remarkable Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them or their Families for ſubverting the Laws, and perſecuting the True Religion. Shall the Fear of Gods Anger and Judgements more than any other thing keep ſo many thouſand Subjects from injuring their Soveraign, and ſhall not the Fear of the ſame God, and his Judgments keep the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign from injuring of them? Or ſhall the People take warning by the Judgments of God which in all Ages have remarkably fallen upon Rebels, and ſhall not the Soveraign make as much uſe of the Remarkable Judgments, which have fallen upon Tyrants? This Principle gives equal Security both ways, and therefore it may well paſs for one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the former Queſtion, That our Security conſiſts in the Conſcience of the Prince.</p>
            <p>But in the third place, As we have the Princes Conſcience, ſo we have his Honour for our Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For Princes (like other Men) are tender of their Honour, and Good Name, and are powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtrained by ſhame from doing Evil to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. They are as loath as other Men to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the cenſure of Mankind, or be recorded for Tyrants in the Annals of Time. Though they may be deſirous for their Honour to have the Times computed from their Conqueſts, yet the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Honour, will ordinarily make them aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have them computed from their Maſſacres, and Perſecutions, which will but get them the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>the Bloody,</hi> or <hi>the Tyrant</hi> unto the End of the World. Honour, as Moraliſts obſerve, is a Secondary, or Civil Conſcience, and if ſo many
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40965:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>Subjects will abſtain from Rebellion merely to avoid the Odious Character of a Traitor, why ſhould we not preſume, That a Prince will abſtain from Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Violence, eſpecially againſt a great Number of his People to avoid the Odious Name of Tyrant? How Black do <hi>Pharaoh, Achab,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> look in the Scriptures, and <hi>Nero, Domitian, Decius, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian, Maximian, Galerius, Maximin,</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians? And a Prince that knows any thing of Hiſtory, muſt naturally abhor to be reckoned among ſuch, as theſe, whoſe very Names are deteſted by all Mankind.</p>
            <p>This is all the Security, that moſt other People have, or ever had for their Rights and Properties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Princes; but we, the Inhabitants of this Fortunate Iſland, have (God be praiſed for it) a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Security from our Laws, to which every Man, be he never ſo great, is obnoxious, beſides the Prince himſelf. For whoſoever acts contrary to Law in this Realm to the prejudice of any other perſon, muſt be ſubject to make Reparation by Law, againſt which the King himſelf can protect no Man, as long as the Courts of Juſtice are kept open; ſo that there can be no Tyranny in <hi>England,</hi> but the utmoſt Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, nor any Perſecution, but a moſt Exorbitant and Illegal Perſecution, which muſt preſuppoſe, that Juſtice is obſtructed, the Laws and Lawyers ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the Courts of Judicature ſhut up, and that the King governs altogether by Arbitrary Power and the Sword. But to ſuppoſe this, is plainly to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the utmoſt poſſibility, which is next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, a poſſibility indeed in Theory, but ſcarce to be reduced into Practice; for in ſuch a Violent Undertaking all Good Men would withdraw from the Service, and Aſſiſtance of the King, and the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40965:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>Bad durſt not ſerve him, becauſe if he died, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his Undertaking, they muſt be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for all the Wrongs and Illegalities they were guilty of in his Service.</p>
            <p>Indeed were our Kings Immortal, or would they not (like other Men) grow weary, and repent of their Unjuſt Practiſes, then Men, who had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but their Intereſt, would willingly by Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Tyranny; but ſeeing they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and muſt die like other Men, no Man that would be ſafe, will venture to ſerve them againſt the Law, no Rational Man will venture into ſuch a Sea of Troubles, where there is no Haven.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration would help very much to quiet the Minds of Men, would their Fears but let their Reaſon have its perfect work. It would help them in a great meaſure to ſee, that a Popiſh Succeſſor, notwithſtanding all the diſmal Characters of him, would not be able, eſpecially on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to outrage his Proteſtant Subjects; for as long as the Laws were open he could not hurt them, and to ſhut them up, and obſtruct, or pervert Juſtice, would for the former Reaſons, prove an exceeding difficult, and almoſt impracticable Undertaking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all his Good Subjects, and all the Bad too that tendred their own ſafety, would deſert him; nay, <hi>Foreiners</hi> upon this Account would make a difficulty to ſerve him, becauſe he could not protect them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own Laws.</p>
            <p>Wherefore a Popiſh Prince, though he were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Blood-thirſty, and had never ſo little regard to Humanity, and his Coronation-Oath, would be infinitely puzled to perſecute his Proteſtant Subjects. He muſt be ſuppoſed to obſtruct Juſtice, and govern Arbitrarily by the Sword; which (as I have ſhew'd)
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40965:180"/>would be almoſt an Impoſſibility, becauſe it would be ſo exceeding difficult for him to get ſufficient Numbers of Men to aſſiſt him in ſuch a dangerous Attempt. But upon ſuppoſition, that he could find Means to maintain ſuch a Tyrannical State, I here aſſert from what I have written in the Doctors Vindication in the 10th, and 11th Chapters, That we ought as Chriſtian Subjects patiently to endure ſuch a <hi>Contralegal</hi> Perſecution, being forbid by the Imperial Laws of this Realm, and by the Goſpel, which confirms the Imperial Laws of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to riſe up in Arms againſt the King, or repel his Military Forces, by Military Violence and Force.</p>
            <p>Furthermore from this Conſideration, that there can be no Illegal Perſecution in this Realm while the Law is kept open, It may appear to every Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader, how maliciouſly the Author of <hi>Julian</hi> traduced Dr. <hi>Hickes</hi> and his Sermon, as if he had taught the People, That they were to Suffer, when they might be Protected by Laws. There are very many Fallacious Paſſages in his Book to this purpoſe, as where he talks of <hi>Throwing away our Lives,</hi> and <hi>Proſtituting our Lives:</hi> and where he ſeems to aſſert this ſtrongly <hi>againſt the Doctor, That if a man be illegally aſſaulted, in the way of Violence, and Aſsaſſination, he may uſe all Lawful Remedies to defend themſelves.</hi> But how doth the Doctors Sermon, or the Notion of Paſſive Obedience any way contradict this? <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra ſicarium quilibet homo eſt miles;</hi> The Laws of all Governments allow every Man to defend his Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Illegal Aſſaſſin, and he that doth not ſo when he can, dies not like a Martyr, but a Fool. He that doth not uſe all Lawful Means, and Remedies for his own Preſervation is mightily to be blamed, as
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40965:180"/>altogether unworthy of ſuch Protection, as bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, we enjoy. But the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience, as taught in general by the Doctor, is not juſtly chargeable with any ſuch odious Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as Mr. <hi>J.</hi> makes from it, as only forbidding ſuch Defence, as a man makes againſt the Laws of his Country, when he draws or uſes the Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch perſons, or in ſuch a manner to defend himſelf, as the Law hath not permitted him to do. In a word, the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience only condemns Illegal Reſiſtance, ſuch Reſiſtance as the Laws of every Soveraign Government forbid, againſt the King, his Army, or Officers; ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance more eſpecially, as is a Transgreſſion of the <hi>Imperial Laws.</hi> Thoſe are the Laws, which <hi>require Paſſive Obedience;</hi> thoſe are the Laws which the Doctor had <hi>a regard to in teaching</hi> that Doctrine: And as <hi>Chriſtianity doth not deveſt any People from their Rights and Priviledges,</hi> ſo neither doth it deveſt the Soveraign of His.</p>
            <p>And if the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience be not inconſiſtent with that Defence, which the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows every Man to make againſt an Illegal Aſſaſſin, much leſs is it inconſiſtent, as he <note n="(†)" place="margin">Preface p. 8.</note> maliciouſly aſſerts, with that Civil Defence, which every man is bound to make for himſelf before the Magiſtrate. <hi>St.</hi> Paul (ſaith he) <hi>was not for Paſſive Obedience; even when the Lawful Magiſtrate perſecuted him, if it were in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful way, but he ſtood upon his</hi> Birthright.—As he was a <hi>Roman;</hi> and <hi>more-over, That he ought not to be ſcourged</hi> Uncondemned. But what is this Civil pleading to Forcible and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Reſiſtance? What is the Defence, which a Man makes with his Tongue before any Tribunal,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40965:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the Defence which he makes with his Sword in the Field? I appeal to the Conſcience of Mr. <hi>J.</hi> as he will anſwer it to God, whether he thinks, That the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience precludes any man from pleading his Civil Rights, or whether the Doctor would contradict his own Doctrine, if he ſhould plead his Birthright, as an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, or the 29th Chapter of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> before a Popiſh Prince, or Judg? If he thinks he would not, then why would he ſhew ſo little common Honeſty, as to faſten ſuch Invidious Conſequences, upon that Doctrine, and the Doctor, againſt his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and Belief?</p>
            <p>To as little purpoſe hath he told us the Story of the Purſuivant of the High-Commiſſion-Court, who was ſent by the Commiſſioners to Arreſt the Body of a Man to bring him before them, and in the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving was killed. Whether this was Murder, or not (ſaith he out of <note n="(†)" place="margin">Rep. 12. p. p. 49.</note> 
               <hi>Coke</hi>) was doubted: And upon conference at the next Aſſizes, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that the Arreſt was <hi>Tortius</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> wrongful, or without Lawful Authority) and by conſequence, that it was <hi>no Murder.</hi> But then (with his wonted Integrity) he conceals the main Circumſtance from the Common Reader, which is implyed by <hi>Coke,</hi> and expreſſed by <note n="(‖)" place="margin">Rep. 2. part p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Brownlow, viz.</hi> That is was found <hi>Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,</hi> or <hi>Manſlaughter,</hi> which is a breach of the 6th Commandment, and Murder in the Eyes of God. For there are ſeveral degrees of Murder, whereof ſome are more Grievous than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. There is Murder <hi>Premeditate,</hi> and Murder <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npremedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> Murder of an Officer <hi>doing his Office</hi> as being more grievous ſorts of Murder, are in our Law eſpecially called <hi>Murder,</hi> and ſo the Difference between Manſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Murder is only Gradual, the Law allowing the benefit of Clergy to that, but not to this. Now the Purſuivant was a proper Officer of the High-Commiſſion, but becauſe that Court could give no Power to arreſt any Mans Body, but only to cite him to appear before them as Eccleſiaſtical Courts do, therefore the killing of their Purſuivant in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Arreſt, was judged Manſlaughter, becauſe it was Unpremeditate, and he was not doing his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; but yet the Verdict for Manſlaughter lays the Purſuivants Blood not upon his own, but upon his Murderers Head. He that killed him was a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and was to anſwer for his Blood to God, without Repentance, and to the King with his own Life, had he not read his Neck Verſe. And if Mr. <hi>J.</hi> think otherwiſe, as he ſeems to do, that an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide</hi> is not guilty of the Blood, which he ſheds, then before the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, no killing could be Murder, becauſe till then there was no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt Manſlaughter and Murder, but all Homicides whatſoever were equal in the Eye of the Law, and all Homicides had equally the Benefit of Clergy.</p>
            <pb n="278" facs="tcp:40965:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>I am confident Mr. <hi>J.</hi> by his learned Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> could not but know all this, and if he did, why did he go about to waſh the Guilty Man Clean of the Purſuivants Blood, in ſaying only that the killing of him was <hi>not found Murder,</hi> and <hi>that his Blood was upon his own Head?</hi> But the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is apparent, for had he told the Story with that plainneſs, that it became an Honeſt Writer; the Guilt of <hi>Manſlaughter</hi> would have ſpoiled the Grace of the Story, as it is told by him to juſtifie Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the Reſiſtance of a Purſuivant, and of a Purſuivant unto Blood.</p>
            <p>Theſe Purſuivants it ſeems, are plaguy Officers, but let them look to't, if any of them come to Arreſt the Body of Mr. <hi>J.</hi> and do it not with all Exactneſs of Law, at his own peril be it, he knows what to do, and he may ſafely truſt to his Neck Verſe, and then the poor miſtaken Purſuivants Blood ſhall be upon his own head.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe the Law gave a Man leave to kill an Officer in a Falſe Arreſt, to defend his Liberty, would Mr. <hi>J.</hi> take the advantage of the Law? Will he do, or omit the doing of every thing that the Law allows him? Will he make the Law the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and adequate Rule to walk by? If ſo, he may do, or omit the doing of many things, for which he ſhall be damned. He may abuſe his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, Siſter, Brother, Wife, Children, Neighbours, nay and his Prince too, to a mighty degree, and yet be ſafe within the Limits of the Law. He may write Seditious Books, burleſque the Doctrine of the Croſs, ſlander the Ancient Chriſtians, falſifie good Authors, and injure thoſe
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40965:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>that never did him hurt, and yet tranſgreſs no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law.</p>
            <p>For the Law hath the Civil, and not the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Capacity of the Man for its Object, therefore it only Commands, or Forbids things, the not doing or doing of which do viſibly tend to the deſtruction of the Peace, Order, and Welfare of the Common wealth; and he that is ſo little a Chriſtian, as to teach the People how far they may be troubleſome and vexatious to their Superiours without tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Law, doth teach them how to uſe <hi>their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for a Cloack of Maliciouſneſs,</hi> and a ſure, and eaſie way to Hell.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>J.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That any man may ſee that his Diſcourſe of the</hi> Purſuivant <hi>doth not deſcend to ſuch Petty Matters, as Falſe Arreſts,</hi> though <hi>a mans Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is not to be deſpiſed;</hi> To what then did that Story tend? Well, you may know his Meaning by his Mumping, it is to let the People underſtand, <hi>how tender the Laws, are of their Lives, and what a particular Care they have taken of all thoſe, who are put upon an inevitable neceſſity of defending themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Aſſaults of Violent, and Evil-diſpoſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> But the Laws are more tender of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns Honour, as he is Gods Miniſter, than of his Subjects Lives, and therefore have forbid us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelves in private Defence againſt his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or in publick Inſurrections againſt his Forces, though he be never ſo violent, or evil-diſpoſed, becauſe he is anſwerable to none, but God. But <hi>if by Inevitable neceſſity of defending themſelves</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands ſudden and private defence againſt an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40965:183"/>ſent by the Kings Order, as his Malice ſeems to ſuggeſt, then it is nothing to his purpoſe, becauſe the Kings Law, which is his moſt Authoritative Command, allows us (as I ſuppoſe) that Benefit; and if it do, it doth not in the leaſt contradict the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience, which allows a Man to Reſiſt, or uſe the Sword to defend his Life, when the Laws <hi>[from which I except all Laws De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the Kings Crown, and Regality]</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize him ſo to do.</p>
            <p>But in truth this laſt is a Caſe, which, though Malicious Men may ſuggeſt, yet ought not at all to be ſuppoſed, or taken into conſideration; for a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prince, as I argued before, will either let the Law have its free Courſe, or elſe he will obſtruct it: If he let the Law have its Free Courſe, then the moſt wicked Man will not dare to ſerve him in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Aſſaſſinations againſt Law, becauſe he cannot protect them againſt it; but if he Obſtruct it, then he muſt Govern ſolely by an Army, and ſo publick Violence will ſuperſede this private way of Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and many other Caſes, which Men do a great deal of hurt to talk of, and ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p>For as the talking of Spirits, and Goblins do mightily influence the Imaginations of Children, and make them fancy them to be in the Room; So all this Noiſe of a Popiſh Succeſſor, and the preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and ſuppoſing of what Cruelties he will do, makes the People take it for granted not only that his <hi>R. Hs.</hi> is a Real Papiſt, but that he is <hi>bigotted</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worſt Principles of Popery, into a Bloody Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Humour, ſo that he will do nothing but <hi>aſſaſſinate</hi> his Proteſtant Subjects, were he once upon the Throne. But whoever thus repreſent him, as they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40965:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>act contrary to all Rules of Candour, and Chriſtian Charity: So they contradict the Belief of many, as good Proteſtants, as themſelves, who have the Honour to know Him, and his Temper better than theſe ſort of Men do; and withal they do Infinite Diſſervice to the Proteſtant Religion, whilſt they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Well-meaning People to ſuch Ill Practiſes, as (were they agreeable to their Principles) would give his <hi>R.

            <p>They have indeed moſt accurately painted the <hi>Jailes,</hi> and <hi>Fetters,</hi> and <hi>Dungeons,</hi> and <hi>Gibbets,</hi> and <hi>Flames,</hi> and all other Inſtruments of Torment to provoke them beyond the Meaſures of Chriſtian Patience, but they have ſaid nothing of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and the Love of God, and of the <hi>Special Aſſiſtances</hi> which he gives in times of Perſecution, becauſe the Conſideration of theſe Things would at the ſame time have ſpoiled their Deſign by quieting the Minds of their Readers, and qualifying their Fears, and letting them ſee that Perſecution really was not ſo Terrible, and Intolerable, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented it to be.</p>
            <pb n="283" facs="tcp:40965:184"/>
            <p>Wherefore, as they have ſet forth the Tyranny of Perſecution as <hi>Greeks,</hi> I ſhall now ſet it forth as a Chriſtian Writer, ſhewing from the Scriptures, and other Eccleſiaſtical Acts and Monuments of Perſecution, that it is a Condition, which Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may endure with Comfort, and Satisfaction, nay, in which they may delight, and rejoyce, if they look unto Jeſus the Author, and Finiſher of our Faith; who for the Joy, that was ſet before him endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame of it, for which he is ſet down at the Right Hand of God.</p>

               <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> had been whipt with many Stripes, and were hurried upon it into the innermoſt Priſon, and ſet in the Stocks there, they prayed and ſang Praiſes unto God, doubtleſs for enabling them by the Aſſiſtance of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to preach his word boldneſs, and ſuffer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently in his Cauſe. How often doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles glory in his <hi>Infirmities,</hi> which is a Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>term for <hi>Sufferings;</hi> and with what pleaſure doth he <note n="(†)" place="margin">2 Cor. c. 6. c. 11. c 12.</note> ſpeak of his Afflictions, Neceſſities, and Diſtreſſes, of his Stripes, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments, Labours, Tumults, Watchings, Faſtings, Shipwrach, and daily danger of Death. Then the Chriſtians ſuffered after the Example of their Saviour according to the Will of God, who called them unto Suffering, committing their Souls unto him as unto

            </p>
            <p>The Second Cauſe of ſuch wonderful Patience and Courage in the Confeſſors, and Martyrs of the Chriſtian Religion, was <hi>Faith,</hi> or their full and undoubted Perſwaſion of receiving thoſe great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which the Goſpel promiſed them for Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to that Definition of the Apoſtle, which ſaith, That Faith conſiſts in the Subſtance, or Confidence of things hoped for, and in the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen. It was through this Faith, that the Jewiſh, and Primitive Chriſtian Martyrs were tortured, not accepting of Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they might have a better Reſurrection, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Reſurrection of the Juſt; that others of them had tryal of cruel Mockings, and Scourgings, yea moreover of Bonds, and Impriſonments, and that others alſo were Stoned, Sawn aſunder, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paled, and ſlain with the Sword; and laſtly, That others, who took the allowed Benefit of Flight, wandered about in Sheepskins, and Goatskins, and in Deſerts, and Mountains, and in Dens, and Caves of the Earth. It was this Faith, which the Apoſtle compares to a Shield, and by which (he ſaith) the Juſt did live in times of Perſecutions, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the World, according to St. <hi>John,</hi> who ſaith, This is the Victory, that overcometh the World, even our Faith. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Caſt not away your Confidence which hath great Recompence of Reward; in the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of receiving whereof, he alſo ſaid in his
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40965:186"/>2d.

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:40965:192"/>Advantages of a Good Conſcience, a ſtrong Faith in the promiſed Reward for Suffering, a Zealous Love for God, and laſtly, of his ſpecial Aids, Aſſiſtances, and Conſolations againſt all the Difficulties, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which alone they have painted Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo tempering the terrible Appearance of the One, with the comfortable, and delightful Proſpect of the Other, I am no more concerned for a Po;piſh Persecution, than for other common Calamities, which happen to Good Men: Nor ſhall the Fear of it (by Gods Grace) ever tranſport me beyond the Bounds of Chriſtian Decency, and Moderation; much leſs make me write ſuch a wicked Book <hi>as the Life of Julian,</hi> which indeed would make me afraid to dye even for my Religion, before I had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, and begg'd the Pardon of God, and Man.</p>
            <p>The Author of it had ſpent his time far better, and more like a Primitive Chriſtian, and a Miniſter of the Paſſive Church of <hi>England,</hi> if he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his Parts in writing a Book upon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which I have here laid down, to allay the Fears, and quiet the Minds of the Fearful, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Multitude, by ſhewing of them, That Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was not ſo Black as Senſe would paint it, nor ſo Terrible as it looked at a Diſtance, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to a People, that had lived long in Eaſe, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and Plenty, but that God would aſſuredly give us Suffering Spirits, if he called us to Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Times; and thereupon to exhort them to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs their Souls in Patience, and endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it by conſtant and hearty Prayer to God, and forſaking thoſe ſinful Courſes, for which perhaps the eye of Infinite Wiſdom ſees, that Perſecution will be the moſt Effectual Cure.</p>
            <pb n="299" facs="tcp:40965:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>This is the Deſign, that I have had in drawing this new and compleat Landskip of Perſecution, and I am ſo well ſatisfied with the truth and certainty of theſe things, that I have added to Mr. <hi>J</hi>'s Pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of it, That if it pleaſe God to ſuffer a Popiſh Prince to Reign over us, rather than he ſhould prove a <hi>Julian indeed</hi> to Undermine our Religion by Crafty Arts, and tempt us out of it by Worldly Honours and Rewards, I heartily wiſh for the Churches good that he may rather prove a <hi>Maximin,</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian</hi> (I mean a down right Bloody perſecutor) though I were the Proto-Martyr of the Cauſe. I ſpeak this not rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my own Strength, but on the Gracious Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God, in whom I truſt, that he will Inſpire me with the boldneſs of a Confeſſor, and the Patience, Courage, and Conſtancy of a Martyr, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he ſhall pleaſe to call me to <hi>Confeſs</hi> his Truths, and ſuffer for his Holy Name.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let the Event of things be what it will, I ſhall wait the good Pleaſure of God, and carefully endeavour (as my Safety obligeth me) to prepare my ſelf for Perſecution, according to the Principles which I have here laid down, and the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Admonition of that Famous Martyr Mr. <hi>John Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> which he wrote in the New Teſtament of one of his Friends.</p>
            <p>
