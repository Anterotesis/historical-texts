            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE SPEECH OF Sir CHARLES SIDLEY IN THE House of Commons.</head>
            <p>WE have provided for the Navy, we have provided for the Army, and now at the latter End of a Sessions here is a new Reckoning brought us, we must provide like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for the Civil List: Truly, Mr. Speaker, it is a sad Reflection that some Men should wallow in Wealth and Places, whilst others pay away in Taxes the fourth part of their Yearly Revenue for the Support of the same Government; we are not upon equal Terms for his Majesties Service, the Courtiers and great Officers Charge as it were in Armour, they feel not the Taxes by Reason of their Places, while the Country Gentlemen are shot through and through with them.</p>
            <p>The King is pleased to lay his Wants before us, and I am confident expects our Advice upon it: We ought therefore to tell him what Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are too great, what Places may be extinguish'd during this Time of War and Publick Calamities. His Majesty is encompass'd with, and sees nothing but, Plenty, great Tables, Coaches and six Horses, and all things suitable; and therefore cannot imagine the Want and Misery of the rest of his Subjects: He's a Wise and Virtuous Prince, but he is but a Young King, encompassed and hemm'd in among a Company of Crafty old Courtiers, to say no more of them, with Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, some of three thousand, some of six, and some of eleven thousand: I am told the Commissioners of the Treasury have three thousand Pound a Year a Piece: Certainly such Pensions, whatever they may have been formerly, are much too great in the present Want and Calamities that reigns every where else, and it is a general Scandal, That a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so sick at Heart as ours, should look so well in the Face. We must save the King Money where ever we can, for I am afraid our Work is too big for our Purses, if things be not mannaged wi<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Thrift imaginable. When the People of <hi>England</hi> see that all is saved that can be saved, that there are no exorbitant Pensions nor unnecessary Sallaries, that all is applved to the Use for which it was given, we shall give and they will cheerfully pay whatever his Majesty can want to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Protestant Religion, to keep out the King of <hi>France,</hi> I, and King <hi>James</hi> too: Whom, by the way, I have not heard named this Session, wheter out of Fear, Respect or Discretion I cannot tell. I conclude, Mr. Speaker, Let us save the King what we can, and then let us proceed to give him what we are able.</p>
