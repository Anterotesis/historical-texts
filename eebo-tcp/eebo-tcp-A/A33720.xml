            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>I Dictate nothing to thee, I only offer my
thoughts about some Points; if you find
them agreeable to the line and measure of
the Word of God, receive them; if not,
you cannot do either your self, or me, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
kindness then to reject them. To take all
for truth that we read in humane Authors,
hath filled the world with Error; therefore
search the Scriptures, whether things are so
or no; and impartially pronounce that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which the Word gives of them, whether
for, or against them. I pretend to no new
discoveries, neither do I affect to be wise
above what is Written; an improvement of
known truths, is all I aim at: Here is no new
unscriptural Light hung up, I only snuff the
Candle that is already burning; seeking
to free the Truth from some Obscurities,
that hinder a right perception of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:98282:3"/>
I am persuaded, the chief, if not the only
cause of difference among real Christians, lies
not so much in different thoughts, as different
expressions; they mean right, but are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
wrong: We are not so Angelical yet, as
to have an intuitive knowledge, that looks
Truth directly in the face, and judges of it,
as it is. But we range about in a discoursive
way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inferring one thing from another; the
least error in the Premises, affects the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and leaves a blemish upon it, that renders
it suspected by all wise men. If our more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
thoughts aud speculations in some abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
notions of truth that we please our selves
with, lose something of their beauty and
lustre when put into Words, we must allow for
the grossness of the medium thorough which
they pass, all things being handed to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
by our senses; we must phansy some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
before we know any thing. Common
sense that rises from particulars, may present
very unintelligible species to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and occasion much confusion there, by
those false images of things, upon which
right notions of truth cannot well be built.
To avoid these Vncertainties, Ambiguities,
and indistinct Conceptions, that our own words
are apt to lead us into; our surest way is to
ground our judgment upon the Infallible Word
of God, not receeding from the literal Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:98282:3"/>
of Scripture, so far as it agrees
with the Analogy of Faith, and the general
scope of the Bible in other places. We must
not suppose a Figure, where there is none; nor
Allegorize plain Texts into a foreign sense, not
intended by the Holy Ghost. In all our Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of such plain Scriptures, we should
justifie the Letter of the Text, and not force a
sense of our own upon it, which the words will
not bear; this is the real cause of those unscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Expressions, that some men cloath their
false Conceptions with: They cannot speak as
the Scripture speaks, which argues thoughts
within, very disagreeable to the Word of God;
all their Labour and Study, is, to distinguish
the Scripture out of its own sense into theirs,
that they may have some shew of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to maintain their brain-sick Notions,
which this giddy Age abounds too much
with.</p>
            <p>The use of Reason in Divine Mysteries, lies
in Three things: 1. In observing what is
plainly laid down in Scripture; that it is so and
so Written. 2. In understanding the true
sense and signification of Scripture-terms.
3. In discerning the natural consequences of
plain truths, how one thing follows by a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
deduction from another. But as some
men would have it, we must first look into the
nature of the most incomprehensible Mysteries
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:98282:4"/>
of the Gospel, and draw up a Rationale of the
Bible, that reason may judge what is fit to be
believed, before we give any credit to the
Word of God; which is to make our selves the
first judges of Gospel-truths, and in effect to
slight all Divine Testimony.</p>
            <p>If I keep not always the common road, but
now and then step out of it, all I have to say
is this, I count not my self obliged to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
thick and thin for Company, especially
when I see a nearer and a cleaner way: There is
some latitude, even in the narrow way to
Heaven; we may take a compass and go wide
of each other, yet have our faces fixed upon the
same point, and meet at the same place at
night. Where there is the greetest agreement
among Saints in any point of Doctrine, yet
we may find some difference in their conceptions
of the same thing; we are not yet come to that
Vnity of knowledge, which will make us intirely
one in our perfect state: In the mean time,
let us not except against that diversity of gifts
and operations, that flow from the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
One may follow another, though his pace
be slower, though he tread not directly in his
steps, who goes before; nay, short steps often
repeated, may rid more ground than long deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
paces; one shows how far he can stride,
the other how fast he can go; and a nimble
Feet, is better than a long, lazy Leg, that
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:98282:4"/>
out-strides those, whom it cannot out-go.</p>
            <p>I shall give thee only this brief Account of
the ensuing discourse: I suppose thou hast read
the Title Page; if thou thinkest thy self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in so weighty a Subject, read on; if not,
I fear thy hope is only in this life. <hi>Paul</hi> will
tell thee what a miserable man thou art,
1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15. None in the world more wretched
than thy self. So I leave thee, to give thy
self a reason, if thou canst, why thou slightest
the <hi>Hope of Glory,</hi> and art so unconcerned
in the next state of things, when this world
shall be no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Knowledg of God in Christ,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
frequent and fervent Prayer, serious
Meditation, and diligent searching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which testifie of Christ: God never
made himself visible to man, but in the person
of Christ Incarnate, who is the express Image
of the Father, best able to make the truest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of God to man, being himself
both God and man.</p>
            <p>What is occasionally spoken of some other
Points, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Law; of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
of the Instrumentality of Faith in
Justification; of Repentance and New Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
as required in all who are Justified,
though not unto the Justification of any, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to thy serious consideration: My design is
not to satisfie the captious reason of the Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:98282:5"/>
of this world, but to speak to the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of humble Christians: If I do that, I
shall have witnesses enough to the truth of
what I say. Though some may not understand,
in a Christian, Faith is the best understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Were there more of this among our men
of Reason, Gospel-Mysteries would not seem
such unintelligible Notions as they do to
many, who think there is no ground of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
but Logical Evidence: The Divine
Authority of the Scripture stands for little
with such men, who resolve to believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
leaning in all things to their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings:
And under that Spiritual
slumber I must leave them, till it pleases God
to awaken them.</p>
            <p>As for those who make previous Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
performed by themselves, the ground of
their Faith in Christ for Pardon, not daring
to trust in Christ for Salvation, 'till they have
first prepared themselves by such doings of
their own, as may give them a right and title
to it, and encourage them to trust in Christ
for that Salvation; whereas I conceive the bare
offer and tender of Grace made to sinners in
the Gospel, is sufficient to give them a right
and title to it, who thankfully accept the offer,
though they come without Money, have no
Righteousness of their own to make way for
them, coming as they are in their nakedness
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:98282:5"/>
and Poverty, casting themselves upon Christ
for all, looking for acceptance only in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.
Besides, to require such preparatory
works before believing, I mean, before we
close in with Christ by an act of justifying-Faith,
is to put natural men upon supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
acts, which they have no strength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;
and doth suppose, that in their natural
state, they may be brought to true holiness;
may reform their lives, and attain to some
degree of Sanctification, before their hearts
are changed, and purified by Faith: There
must be a change of state, before there can be
a change of life; in a real turning to God, by a
sincere obedience: In Preaching the Gospel, we
exhort and press our Hearers to holiness; not
as if we thought to bring them to it, while in
their natural state, but because there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
Power in the Gospel to make them new
Creatures, that must be first done, before any
acceptable obedience can be performed: 'Tis Faith
that unites us to Christ, and being so united,
all principles and habits of holiness are infused,
which the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us,
draws into act upon all occasions. Some car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it, as if all holy dispositions and inclinations
were acquired by our own endeavours: But as
original Corruption was propagated by our des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
from the first <hi>Adam,</hi> so the first seeds and
principles of true holiness, are propagated by
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:98282:6"/>
our descent from the second <hi>Adam</hi> in our new
birth: Let us not think to become holy any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way than by Faith in Christ, in whom we
are sanctified, and by whose Spirit, the Saints
are stirred up and quickned to all those duties
that tend to the perfecting of holiness in them.
Christ is the root that bears us, our fruit is
found in him, all our springs are in him; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
me (says Christ) you can do nothing; we
shall be sorry doers of Righteousness, if we set
about it in our own strength; therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
we must begin our Religion with Faith in
Christ, and Pray that we may be led by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,
in all ways of holiness to our lives end.
I see no ground in all the new Testament, to
press and exhort Sinners to humiliation, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and reformation of life, from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
motive, than that of Gospel Grace, which
must be received and taken in, in some degree
of Saving-faith, before we can heartily set about
the foresaid duties; and this is all I contend
for: This reception of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or faith in Christ, must
go before all things that are afterwards to be
received from Christ: That which leads many
into a mistake in this matter, it their putting
too great a difference between saving Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Conviction of sin, and true saving-Faith;
as if such a Conviction of our lost undone state
by nature, were but a preparative to saving-Faith;
whereas it is an essential part of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying-Faith
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:98282:6"/>
to convince us of sin, from which
we are justified by Christ; they are always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant,
and cannot be separated in any act
of saving-Faith we put forth upon Christ:
What is Faith, but a Conviction of sin, and
righteousness, shewing us our sins, that we
may seek after righteousness in Christ? As for
legal Conviction and repentance, that is but a
common work. As God pleases to awaken na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Conscience, by setting home the threats
and terrors of the Law; this may, or may not
be previous to Conversion; and is wrought in
whom, and in what degree God pleases: Some
lie in a spiritual slumber all their days, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any legal touch upon their Consciences,
are fast asleep, 'till they awake in Hell; which
is full of legal Convictions: Sometimes God
reserves the whole of Conviction for saving-Faith;
he lets in a sense of sin, and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
at once; and this Faith may first shew it
self in some, more in an humbling Conviction of
sin, than in the comfortable application of
Christ's righteousness, that may come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when Faith has done its humbling
work, under which, there is a secret looking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, tho not with that comfortable sense
of our interest in him, as we are made after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to understand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:98282:7"/>
What I urge is this: We must begin our
Religion with Faith in Christ, which never
fails to produce repentance and new obedience;
but how to attain to any degree of either, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are in Christ, is to me unconceiveable:
They who so much contend for these Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
do run upon Rocks, and will be forced
to deny such fundamental Points of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion, which I am persuaded they
will be ashamed to disown, when closely put
to it; many things are required of those who
are in Covenant, that are not required as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of our first entring into Covenant: We
must not think to bring any Grace to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
but must fetch all Grace from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
even Faith it self; a power to believe,
being the first thing promised in the Covenant;
and by our passive reception of this first Grace,

mind that more; some would find those very
Arguments which they take up against their
Antagonists, whilst they are acting the part
of Opponents, contending more for Victory,
than Truth, to make against the inward
Judgment of their own Consciences, when
once it comes to be their own case. I am
persuaded many plead for those opinions
and notions, upon which they would be loth
to venture their own Souls in a dying
hour; I value more the Judgment of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Saint about Justification, than all the
wrangling Disputes of Learned men, who
are under a great temptation sometimes of
shewing their parts, in speaking Learnedly
against the truth; and whilst they seek to
bafflle others, they baffle themselves into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of those errors; which for Disputation
sake, they at first so stifly maintained, being
not able to answer their studied Objections;
they are judiciously punished for making so
bold an attempt against the truth; God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them up to strong delusion, to believe
lyes.</p>
            <p>I conclude, That every Sinner whose
heart God inclines by the Preaching of the
Gospel, to rely upon Christ for Salvation,
hath right so to do; and from this first
Faith in Christ habitually disposing the Soul
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:98282:8"/>
to all holiness, do arise actual repentance,
and new obedience, as the fruits and effects
of that Faith, evidencing the truth of
it, to the great comfort of all sincere Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>

(1.) Speak to the
Coherence. (2.) Explain
the Terms of the Text.
(3.) Draw both parts of
the Text together into
one Doctrinal Observation.</p>
            <div type="chapter">
               <p>The <hi>Coherence</hi> lies thus: <hi>Colosse</hi> was a
City in <hi>Phrygia</hi> in the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> where
by the Ministry of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> a Church
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98282:10"/>
was gathered, and soon after troubled by
certain Seducers, pressing upon them the
Observation of <hi>Mosaical</hi> Ceremonies, and
many Human Traditions. <hi>Epaphras</hi> goes
to <hi>Rome</hi> to acquaint <hi>Paul</hi> with the present
state of this Church, <hi>verse</hi> 8. whereupon
he, as the great Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
upon whom the Care of all the Churches
lay, writes this Epistle to the <hi>Collossians;</hi>
taking notice of their Conversion to the
Faith, and giving Thanks to God upon
that account, <hi>v.</hi> 3. Praying for them, <hi>That
they might be filled with the knowledge of his
will, in all wisdom and spiritual understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they might walk worthy of the Lord
unto all pleasing, and be strengthned with all
might, unto all patience and long-suffering,
with joyfulness,</hi> verse 9, 10, 11. Then he
takes occasion to set forth the Excellency
of Christ preached unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open the Benefits of our Redeemer,
<hi>vers.</hi> 12, 13, 14. And then he gives an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Character of the Divine Person of
the Redeemer, from the 15<hi>th</hi> verse to the
23<hi>d.</hi> exhorting them thereupon to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
<hi>v.</hi> 23. by divers Arguments drawn
from the Necessity of Perseverance; from
the Multitude of those who had embraced
the Gospel; from his own Ministry; from
the Afflictions they suffered for the Gospel,
<hi>v.</hi> 24. and from that Obligation that lay
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98282:10"/>
upon him to preach the Gospel to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
v. 25. extolling the Dignity of the
Gospel as a Mystery hid from Ages, but
now made manifest to the Saints, <hi>v.</hi> 26.
And in the beginning of this 27<hi>th</hi> verse,
he sets forth the Riches of this Mystery;
He shews in the Words of the Text, how
all this is contained in Christ, of whom they
were now possessed; they had him in their
very hearts, dwelling there, which is,
<hi>Christ in you the Hope of Glory.</hi> So much
for the Coherence.</p>
               <p>I now come to open the <hi>Terms</hi> of the
Text; To shew you what is meant by <hi>Christ;</hi>
and what by the <hi>Hope of Glory.</hi> And because
there is more of Mystery in the first part
of the Text, <hi>Christ in us;</hi> than in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part, <hi>the Hope of Glory;</hi> not but that
there is great Mystery in this too, as will
appear by and by: But I say, there is more
of Mystery in the first part, because we
have some Natural Notions of Hope and
Glory, that may help to lead us up into the
Spiritual Sense of the Apostle here. But we
can have no natural Notion of Christ
being in us; this is above all the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of Reason, and must be taken in
by pure Faith, from the Word of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
it: Therefore I will dispatch the
second part of the Text first; and shew,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98282:11"/>
What we are to understand by the <hi>Hope of
Glory.</hi> First, <hi>What by Hope,</hi> Secondly,
<hi>What by Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Hope presupposes Desire, tho eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Desire doth not amount to Hope; It
must be desire continued. Hope implies
that; Desire maintain'd and kept up in the
Soul. We may have a sudden liking, a
pleasing, transient fancy to such or such a
thing from the first glance of the eye upon
it; this is not properly Hope. The <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists</hi>
tell us it is <hi>durabilis Affectus,</hi> a dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
permanent, fixed, habitual Desire,
when the Mind is set upon such a thing,
dwells upon it, must have it, is continually
reaching out after it from an eager Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
towards it, so as it cannot be satisfied
without it: This is continued Desire,
strong Desire; <hi>Valdè vult;</hi> the Will is bent
upon it, cannot be taken off from looking,
waiting, and longing after it. And this is
the Nature of that <hi>Hope</hi> in the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What are we to understand by
<hi>Glory,</hi> which begets all this waiting and
longing Desire? Now, Brethren! I must
rise upon you a little: We have a great
Subject before us. I will give you first the
plainest Exposition of it, and then go as
far higher as I can.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Glory</hi> we commonly understand the
Happiness of Saints in Heaven; the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98282:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Grace in Glory. It is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Degree of that Good, that man is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of to Eternity. It is the Consummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Divine Election: The actual accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of all that Good that God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man from Eternity.</p>
               <p>Having given you this plain Account of
<hi>Glory,</hi> let us now look a little further into
it, and consider it as flowing from God the
Fountain of it. Let us, as well as our weak
eyes will bear, look upon this Excelling,
Overcoming Object, <hi>Heavenly Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is called <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>The Glory of God,</hi>
because God is the Author of it: He is the
Fountain and first Subject of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is stiled, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 2. <hi>The God of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
and the <hi>Father of Glory,</hi> Eph. 1. 17.
Compare <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30.
and you will find that we are said to glorifie
God; and God also is said to glorifie us;
but with this difference; We glorifie God
by declaring those Divine Excellencies that
were in God before; God glorifies us, by
putting an Excellency upon us which we
had not before. We glorifie God here on
Earth, God glorifies us in Heaven; as our
Saviour saith, <hi>John</hi> 17. 4, 5. <hi>I have glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
thee on earth; now, O Father, glorifie
thou me with the glory which I had with thee
before the world was.</hi> What was that? I
wish I were able to tell you: It may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98282:12"/>
some of you may think I say too much;
and others too little. I desire, as God will
help me, to say something of it, that may
lead your Thoughts into a further Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this matter: Therefore I shall
endeavour to open that difficult Scripture,
<hi>Glorifie thou me with that glory which I had
with thee before the World was,</hi> John 17. 5.</p>
               <p>I conceive thus; That Christ's Human
Nature upon his Ascension to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
was, according to its finite capacity,
lifted up by vertue of the Hypostatical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
into the Essential Glory of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;
which did not so shine forth in the
Man Christ here on Earth, as it doth now
in Heaven: It was under an Eclipse then
in his state of Humiliation; but now this
Glory is fully communicated to the Human
Nature of Christ, and through Christ unto
us, <hi>John</hi> 17. 22. compared with <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 20.
<hi>I am in my father, and ye in me, and I in you,</hi>
saith he: I say, the Glory of the Godhead
is communicated to the Human Nature of
Christ, and through Christ unto us who
are united to him: And by vertue of this
Union, the other Two Persons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the Father and the Holy Ghost, are
said to dwell in us, and to be in us: The
<hi>Father dwells in us, and we in him,</hi> 1 John
4. 12, 13, 16. If we dwell in Love, we
dwell in God, and God dwells in us; that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98282:12"/>
is, we have deep Apprehensions of the
Love of God. And the <hi>Spirit dwells in us,
Rom.</hi> 8. 11. comp. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. I
speak this, to shew how near we are brought
to God in Glory, to the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost. And thus you see how Saints
are glorified in Christ; blessed with all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Blessings in Heavenly Places in
Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. And how Christ is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in them, <hi>John</hi> 17. 10. Christ takes the
Saints into his own Glory, which is their
Glorification, <hi>perfective</hi> of their Happiness.
And this Manifestation of the Glory of
Christ in and upon the Saints, is said to be
<hi>a glorifying of Christ,</hi> John 17. 10. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
Glory of Christ shining out upon
us, is our Glorification; which doth consist
in the <hi>Beatifical Vision,</hi> in beholding the
Glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ;
we <hi>see him face to face,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. Mat.
18. 10. <hi>We see him as he is;</hi> which trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us into his likeness, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2. We then
<hi>appear with him in glory,</hi> Col. 3. 4. Joh. 7. 24.</p>
               <p>What can we conceive of this Glory?
What is this Glory?</p>
               <p>The Scripture sets it forth by Allusions
to things that are natural; and so shall I.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glory,</hi> then, is a Splendor or Lustre arising
up, and resulting from the Beauty and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of a thing above other things. So God
outshines all Creatures, being transcendingly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98282:13"/>
Good. So that Glory, in its perfection, as it is
in God the Fountain of it, it is a continual
Effulgency and Brightness flowing from
God the Perfection of Beauty. He dwells
in inaccessible Light. This is called some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<hi>The brightness of his glory, Heb.</hi> 1. 3.
always sending forth resplendent Beams
and Rays of Light, which do reach us in
Heaven, and do reflect a Glory upon us.</p>
               <p>Thus the Glory of God is set forth in
Scripture by things that are most glorious
in our sight: And I must tell you, That
Faith sees something in God, that is beyond
all these Metaphors of Light and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
I say, beyond all these Notions of
Light and Brightness, a more excelling
Glory; in comparison of which, all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Glory is no Glory. But the Beatifical
Vision is abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e all the Visions of this Glory,
that Faith now gives us, because it fills and
satisfies the whole Capacity of our Souls:
We are then possessed of all, and desire no
more. The School-men tell us, Heaven is
<hi>Appetitus quietivum,</hi> doth satisfie and quiet
the Desires of a man. So saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>When I awake, I shall be
satisfied with thy likeness;</hi> speaking of the
Resurrection. <hi>If the Love of the world is
in you, the love of the father is not in you,</hi>
1 John 2. 15. If we are still flying out in
our affections after worldly things, it is a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98282:13"/>
sign our minds are not quieted and satisfied
with God alone. School-Divines say fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
That in Hell there is fear, but Heaven
is above all Hope: And they give this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it, Because in Hell there is <hi>Successio
Poenarum,</hi> a Succession of Punishment,
which causes Fear; but, say they, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Glory is <hi>absque Successione,</hi> without
Succession; <hi>i. e.</hi> 'Tis all present before 'em.
I suppose they mean this, That the Saints
above, have a kind of actual Comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Eternal Beatitude, in which
there is nothing past, or to come, but all
as present before them. They don't Hope,
but certainly know that their Blessedness
doth continue for ever: That is, I say, the
Saints above, after the Resurrection, cannot
be more happy to all Eternity, than they
are the first moment of their Glorification.
And this I mean by an actual Comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Eternal Beatitude: All is as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to Glorified Saints.</p>
               <p>Brethren! If these things seem difficult
to you, and do pass your knowledge, are
above your comprehension, it is your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
it is so, that there is more Glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for you, than you can conceive. <hi>Eye
hath not seen, ear hath not heard, neither
hath it entred into the heart of man, the
things that God hath prepared for them that
love him.</hi> Besides, pray consider; we that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98282:14"/>
are Ministers, do prophesie but in part; we
see but through a glass darkly; no wonder
then if these things seem abstruse and enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical.
The more spiritually-minded you
are about these deep things of God, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
considering the Sufferings of Christ,
and the Glory that shall follow, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1. 11. the more plain and evident will this
Glory be unto you. You will know more
of it than the Tongue of Men or Angels
can express. There are certain Elevations
of an enlightned mind, that do sometimes
raise our Apprehensions of Divine Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
above and beyond our ordinary
thoughts of them. The Spirit takes us up
into the Mount of Glory, and shews us
the things of Christ more demonstatively
than any Minister in the World is able to
do. When we are heaving at some heavy
body, we lift here, and we lift there, and
it may be upon some sudden strain, we
move it a little, though ordinarily we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stir it: So there are some certain strains
of Faith, that give us that discerning of
Spiritual Things, that we never had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
lifting up our heads within the Vail.</p>
               <p>Let us then wait upon God for such fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manifestations of his Spirit, and pray,
That he would shine in our hearts the
Light of the Knowledge of his Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98282:14"/>
What shall I say more? Now we live
upon Creatures, and have but a remote
View of God in them and through them;
and this is our Grace. But when we come
to Heaven, God will be all in all: We
shall stand in no need of Creature-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
to Eternity, but shall derive all our
support, satisfaction, and joy, immediately
from God himself. His Spirit will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Meat, Drink, and Cloaths to our
bodies, and will to Eternity fill up the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of our Souls with Ravishing Joys
and Delights: And this is our Glory.</p>
               <p>The sum of all is, That Christ received
into the heart by Faith, as our Jesus, our
Redeemer and Saviour, doth beget in the
Soul thus relying upon him, an earnest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
and lively Hope of all that Good
that may consummate and perfect mans
Happiness to Eternity. And this in the
Text is called Glory, <hi>Christ in us the Hope
of Glory.</hi> So much for that part of the
Text.</p>
               <p>I come now to the First Part of the Text.
What are we to understand by <hi>Christ in us?</hi>
And this is Mystery upon Mystery: It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that in Scripture Christ is said <hi>to be
in us, and we in him; he to abide in us, and
we to abide in him.</hi> I shall now only give
you a more general Exposition of these
Words; in the general sense of the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98282:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I say, Christ is said to be in us, and we
in him; <hi>To abide in us, and we in him,
John</hi> 15. 4. And all this must be spiritually
understood; all this is by Believing; by
Faith we receive him, and by continued
Acts of Faith we do keep him dwelling
in our hearts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. We abide in
Christ, and Christ in us; we are in him,
and he in us, when we do persevere in the
Faith; when we have in our hearts an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
belief and persuasion of all the Gospel
saith, concerning Christ as our Redeemer
and Saviour: He is in the thoughts and
imaginations of our hearts continually;
and we do act towards him according to
what we believe of him; this is believing
indeed. And here comes in hope, as most
suitable to the apprehensions of our Faith
concerning Christ as our Jesus: Christ in
you, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; some render the Greek
thus, Christ among you, outwardly Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to you, is the hope of Glory. This is
Doctrinally true; but this is not enough to
beget Hope: Many hear, and don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
they have much of Christ without
them, but nothing of Christ within them.
Hope arises from something within im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
upon the mind; the Soul doth not
stir till then, doth not put forth any act of
Hope till Faith comes; That sets all the
wheels in motion, draws our affections
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98282:15"/>
after him; such is the power of Faith,
that we cannot but love and desire what
we believe to be so good and desirable.
Hope naturally springs out of Faith; and
in this Hope you have the comfort of your
Faith; you see the benefits of Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
in what you believe. Gospel truths
are very advantageous to a believer, when
he sees the advantage that accrues to him
by them; and therefore is filled with joy
unspeakable, and full of Glory, by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
We should be little concerned in
our Faith, were it not for the Hope it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets.
It is life Eternal to know Christ;
in the light of that knowledge you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how you live in him, and by him: As
Faith carries up our Souls to Heaven, so it
brings down all the good things of Heaven
to our Souls. Faith is a very enriching
Grace; <hi>rich in Faith,</hi> saith the Apostle;
when the Soul takes notice of this, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but Hope: What Faith hath obtained
of God through Christ, Hope goes out
after, longs for, and patiently waits for
things unseen: Faith hath ensured them,
and therefore Hope will expect them. So
that Christ outwardly Preached, is the
Hope of Glory; that is, Doctrinally so:
It is Doctrinally true, but it is not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
true to you and me, that Christ
is our Hope of Glory, till we do believe in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98282:16"/>
him: Christ must be ours, before this
Hope in the Text can be ours: Christ is
not ours, till we receive him by Faith from
an inward Revelation of him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16.
Till then, he is a Christ without us, not
in us. With the heart man believes; It is
an inward act of the mind to believe in
Christ. The Soul doth converse with
Christ about its own Salvation; our
Thoughts are much taken up in considering
him; applying to our selves the benefits of
his Death. If Christ be thus in you, you
cannot but have Hope.</p>
               <p>I am upon the general Exposition,
and shall shew you more at large, how
Christ is in us by believing.</p>
               <p>I say Faith lets Christ into the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
Will, and Affections.</p>
               <p>Naturally when the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> acts
upon any Object, it draws the species and
image of that Object into its self: Hence
they say, <hi>Intellectus intelligendo fit omnia;</hi>
the Understanding is every thing it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands;
That is, it takes in the Idea, Shape
Image of that thing which it knows, under
all its distinguishing Properties; else there
would be confusion in the Understanding;
we should not know one thing from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is not to know at all.</p>
               <p>So Faith brings in Christ into the Soul
under a peculiar Character, as the fairest
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98282:16"/>
of Ten thousand; proposes him as the
greatest truth to the Understanding; as the
greatest good to the Will, and frames con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of him accordingly; thus is Christ
formed in us. Faith doth not take in Christ
notionally only, to lye by, as other notions
do in which we are little concerned; but
it takes him in in reference to our selves, as a
new Mould into which the Soul is to be cast,
as a Spirit and Principle of new life: He
comes to rule and reign, and to reduce man
to a conformity to himself. And here lies
the difference between historical and saving
Knowledg; one is purely Speculative, the
other is Experimentally Practical; that is,
there is always something done upon it, in
and by the Soul, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>We do behold
as in a glass the glory of God, and are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Pray observe that Text: There is a
Beholding, and there is a Transformation
upon that beholding, a being changed into
the same Glory. We do not know Christ
savingly, if every thing we know of him
doth not help to change us more and more
into his Image; I say, we do not know
Christ savingly till then. You must judge
of your saving knowledge of Gospel
Truths, by the lively impressions they make
upon your hearts. Are you brought to
act, do, think, that which you never did
before? Do you find Christ hath had a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98282:17"/>
quickning influence upon your Hearts? is
indeed become your life? He savingly
knows Jesus Christ, who doth act towards
him according to what he believes of him.
Let men talk of this or that concerning
Christ, and pretend to understand all
Mysteries, to have all knowledge; yet
unless they can shew the work of the
Gospel written in their hearts, as the
Apostle speaks of the work of the Law,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. I say, unless they can shew
the work of the Gospel written in their
hearts, I am sure they are nothing. For
it is impossible to receive Christ by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
knowledge of Faith, and not to have
his Image impressed upon all the faculties of
the Soul by that Faith which first brought it
in. The very conceptions of Faith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ, are the very thoughts of a mans
own heart; so he is, so he thinks, so
he acts, even as he believes. Gospel truths
cannot enter into our rational Nature at any
other door, than that of Faith: When
Faith comes, there needs nothing else to
turn that Soul unto God. Every man
is an his Faith is. Faith contains the true
inward sense of the Soul about Jesus
Christ: And God is the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher
of this Faith, and understood to be
so by all true Believers. Pray let us close
up all with this; for I am only now labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98282:17"/>
as well as I can to shew you in general,
how Faith lets Christ into the Soul. The
main thing in Conversion, is Faith; and
the main thing in Faith, is the Power of
God in working it. These two things are
principally taken notice of by all Believers.
They observe them in others, much more
in themselves, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 17, 18. compared
with <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. What notice did they
take there of the Faith God had wrought
in those? They perceived they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the same Faith with themselves; that
God had granted unto the <hi>Gentiles,
Repentance unto life.</hi> Faith is the main
thing in Conversion: Christ is the
same in himself, both before and after
Conversion: So are all Gospel-truths the
same in themselves; only then we did not
believe them, and now we do. It is Faith
makes all the difference; and the principal
thing in Faith, is the power of God in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. How doth <hi>Paul</hi> admire the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God to him, that <hi>he</hi> should obtain
Mercy, and believe in <hi>Jesus! Lord,</hi> saith
he, <hi>What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
called him Lord before: The High
Priest was his Lord and Master before,
from whom he received his orders what to
do against the Saints. Now he is Sick of
that imployment; he lays down his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
at the feet of Christ, and desires
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98282:18"/>
he would give him instructions what to
do: None should be his Lord; None
should now command him but <hi>Christ;
Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi>
The beginning of Faith and Conversion,
lyes in looking unto Christ for Power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
And our first Faith usually breaks
out in an <hi>Outcry</hi> to God to help our unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.
All true Converts are sensible of
this, they in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 47. How did they
Praise God for their Conversion? They
ascribe it all to him. I say, our first
Faith in the Lord Jesus, comes in with a
sense of God's Power in working it; and
Faith is known to be the gift of God, by
those who have it. They who begin their
Faith in the strength of their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
thinking to take in such considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God and Christ, and to draw such
arguments from Scripture, as can induce
them to believe, will find themselves mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
I am persuaded the doubts and fears
of many Believers have their rise from
hence; That they did not begin their
Faith in such an humble dependance upon
God for strength to believe; they did not,
I say, do this as they should. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that that is the cause of their fears,
because nothing but such a dependance
upon Christ for Grace does cure them.
When once they have learned the right way
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98282:18"/>
of believing and trusting in Christ, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into rest, there is an end of all their fears.</p>
               <p>There are Promises in Scripture made
unto Faith; and there are Promises made
of Faith. These, so far as we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in them, seem to be made to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
quite void of Faith: Though to
Unbelievers remaining in unbelief, nothing
is promised; yet all things are promised
to Unbelievers, going out by Faith unto
Jesus Christ: Or, if you will, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
express it thus; These promises of our
first faith, of the first Grace, of giving
the Spirit, and the like, they are made to
Christ in the behalf of Unbelievers, such
who were from Eternity ordained unto
Life; so many of them whose Names
were written in the Lamb's Book of Life.
The Covenant of Grace made between
God and us, doth respect the Covenant of
Redemption between the Father and the
Son. This first Faith is wrought in us in
such a manner, that we are sensible of
the Divine Power and Efficacy of God's
Grace in working it. Though God
doth lead out our Souls into rational
considerations of Himself and his Son;
yet we find that these considerations do
flow into our Minds from an inward
Revelation made of Christ. We do
know, that such thoughts of God and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98282:19"/>
Christ, could never have come into our
minds, if the Holy Ghost had not suggested
them. In his Light we see Light; and
our coming to Christ, is always by the
Father's drawing.</p>

            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">More Particularly,
How Christ is in us by Faith: How Faith
brings Christ into the Soul: Or, how
Christ conveys himself into our hearts
through Faith: And also, How we may
discern this in our selves.</head>
               <p>THis is the Point, and a Point of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
concernment it is unto us all: And
therefore, I beseech you follow me with
your strictest Attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That Christ may be in us, it is
necessary that he should be first outwardly
proposed unto us. There is an outward
Light of the letter proposing Christ to us;
and there is an inward Light of the Spirit
revealing Christ in us. It is one thing to
speak Notionally, from the outward Light
of the Letter; another thing to speak Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally,
from an inward Light of
the thing it self in our own Souls. Besides
the outward Light of the Word, there is
in every true Believer an inward Light,
flowing through the Word from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98282:19"/>
or thing spoken of. The Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
Christ the Object, and so making us
Light in the Lord, in his Light we see
Light. As we cannot see the Sun but by
its own Light, so neither can we see Christ
but in his own Light. By Faith we go
unto Christ, by Faith we go into Christ,
and we sit down in his Light, entertaining
our selves with Spiritual Contemplations of
his Glory. I say, that Christ presents
himself to us in a Gospel Promise, as our
God and Saviour: He offers himself to us
as such; and by offering himself, or under
that proposal, he doth act as a Gracious
God towards us. Here lyes the Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
point, the effectual working of the
Word; when together with the outward
proposal, Christ lets forth some Virtue
from himself, to draw in the Heart unto
him. When God owns us for his Children,
who were not his Children before, yet his
Adoption makes us Children; that is
the time of our effectual Calling: When
under the outward Preaching of the Gospel,
Christ doth so powerfully impress his own
first act of Love upon us, in dying for us,
that we cannot but be sensible of it. His
Love is shed abroad in our hearts, we
are overcome by it; we cannot but call
him Father, who by calling us Children,
hath made us so; letting in at the same
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98282:20"/>
time the Spirit of the Son into our hearts.
God's owning us for his Children, is a
sufficient proof that he is our Father, we
cannot but call him so ever after <hi>Zec.</hi> 13. 9.</p>
               <p>Thus Christ makes himself inwardly
known to us, by giving us Faith in himself;
for there is no other way of knowing
Christ, but by believing. Sense and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
cannot bring Christ into the Soul, but
Faith can, giving that account of him from
the Word, that is fully satisfactory. How
Glorious is Christ in the Eye of Faith!
How is a believing Soul taken with him
as the Fairest of Ten thousand! And this
is the first step, according to the Method of
the Holy Ghost, that God takes in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ into the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christ is let into the Soul by
an appropriating act of Faith, by which
we do take him into our hearts as our Jesus:
Every Believer saith for himself, the Lord
Jesus, my Righteousness, and my Life, and
my Salvation, my God, and my Lord! The
Soul knows this by that sense that Faith
gives of that act by which we do receive
him; I say, by that sense that Faith gives
of that appropriating act by which we do
receive Christ as our Jesus. Those who
understand themselves in an act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
know it to be so. Saving
Faith, so far as it reaches, is all evidence;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98282:20"/>
it carries conviction along with it of those
Truths which we believe. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. I
told you the last time, How Faith doth
Spiritually draw in the object upon which
it acts, into every believing Soul. Faith
is in us, Christ is in our Faith, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it, always in the view and eye of
Faith. Faith hath nothing else to act upon
for Justification, but Christ held forth in the
Word: Now Faith takes Christ out of the
Word into the Heart. And this I would
a little open to you; for here lyes the
Mystery of your Faith; this is the critical
Act of Faith.</p>
               <p>I say thus; Faith takes in the Promise,
and in and with the Promise, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who is wrapt up in it. Faith takes in
the Promise; and in and with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
the Mercy it self that is Promised.
Our Title to, and Interest in the Lord
Jesus Christ, it doth arise out of this Act
of Faith. By this Act of Faith, all is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
both on God's part and our part,
that may confirm our Title to Christ.
God hath past his word in the Promise,
Faith lays hold upon that Promise, receives
Christ from the hand of the Father as his
Gift, hath it from God's own Mouth that
Christ is ours; and Faith doth so interpret
the Promise of God to the Soul, by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
application of it unto us by Name;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98282:21"/>
which gives us that security of mind about
our real Interest in Christ, that we do no
longer doubt of it. We are under a sense
of the greatness of the Gift, of the free
Grace of the Donor, of our Propriety and
Interest in so great a Gift; and all this by
our actual receiving the Promise, and in
and with the Promise, Christ himself pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.
Faith draws both into the heart
together, Christ and the Promise; and
Faith keeps them together; it is impossible
to have and to hold one without the other.
A Promise of Christ, is Christ to a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
Faith takes hold of Christ in and by
the Promise. Faith carries in the Promise,
as well as Christ, into the Soul: To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all after challenges, The Devil is ready
to question our Interest in Christ; How
came you by Christ? By Peace? And
Pardon? What have you to shew that
Christ is yours? Then the Soul holds up a
Promise. Here is the offer that God hath
made of Christ to me, saith a Believer;
and what should hinder my acceptance of
it? I have accepted it, and I will keep my
hold on this Promise; It is the Word of
God to me, who cannot lye; and what
have you, Satan, to say against this? Thus
by resisting the Devil, we make him fly
from us. And this Armour of Light doth
so dazzle the Eyes of the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98282:21"/>
that he is not able to stand before
it.</p>
               <p>Many complain that Christ is not theirs,
but they do not consider, that it is long of
themselves, because they don't receive
him: <hi>To as many as received him,</hi> to them
<hi>he gives power to become the Childreu of
Cod.</hi> You will never be able to apprehend
your self to be a Child of God, till you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Christ; do that, and you will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find the Spirit witnessing with your
spirit, that you are a true Child of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We always have in this appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating
act of Faith, by which we take
Christ into our Souls, a respect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to Christ without us, to him as
actually Incarnate, according to the Word,
and personally Glorified now in Heaven,
yet Spiritually present in us. I speak this
against a late Generation of Men, who
speak so much of the Light within them,
and would seem to understand the same
that we do by Christ in us; though it is
evident they put a mere natural Principle
for Christ; it is not the Person of Christ
as God-Man who dyed at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
is now Glorified in Heaven, and in our
Nature in Heaven; it is not this Christ
whom they rely upon, but a Principle of
Light in themselves, which they call
Christ; a mere imaginary Christ.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98282:22"/>
If our Faith doth not terminate
upon the Person of Christ without us, and
fix distinctly upon him, observing what
was done in, by, and upon his Person, as
Dying for us; Rising, Ascending up to
Heaven, continually making Intercession
there for us: I say, if our Faith doth not
begin with the Person of Christ, and end
in the Person of Christ, we may be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in all our seeming Spiritual apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Christ. The Spirit of Christ is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of a real Person, of the second Person in
the Trinity, who is very God and very Man.
To talk of the Spirit of Christ, without any
relation and reference to the Divine Person
of Christ, is mere Enthusiasm, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
the foundation of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
When the Scriptures speak of Christ as
dwelling in us, it still refers to the Person
of Christ, to what was really done, and
acted by, and upon that Person. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11.
His Spirit dwells in you, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Spirit
of him that Rose from the Dead, and is
now Alive in Heaven. When we speak of
Christ being in us, we do not mean his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
Personal Presence, but his Spiritual
Presence. <hi>If any man hath not the Spirit
of Christ, he is none of his,</hi> so saith the
Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 10. Though his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be taken away from us, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 11.
and is contained in Heaven till his second
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98282:22"/>
Coming; Yet the Life, Power and Spirit
of Christ doth dwell in us now; and this
is the Spiritual Presence of Christ in the
hearts of Believers now; this is a good proof
of Christ being <hi>in us of a truth, in power
and spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Christ appears to be in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
by the inward Communion they have
with him, by the daily moving of their
hearts towards him; the Soul gathering
up it self more and more into Christ, often
revolving what Christ hath done for them.
<hi>Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and
with his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> We have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
serious Thoughts of Christ: That
which is in you, is in your Thoughts,
must be in your Thoughts, you are full of
him. Some can think of nothing but the
world, and the things of the world; and
it is a sign Christ is not in them: That's
the Fourth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly;</hi> By the suitable actings of the
Soul towards Christ in the most proper and
seasonable Exercise of those Graces that
such or such a Manifestation of Christ unto
us, may call for.</p>
               <p>A Soul in communion with Christ, is
very observant of him, very attentive to
him, eyes him strictly; <hi>As the eye of the
servant looks unto the hand of his master, and
the eye of the maiden to the hand of her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98282:23"/>
so do our eyes wait upon thee, O God;</hi>
Psal. 123. 9. You would take it ill, and
count it a great neglect in a servant, if
while you are speaking to him, he should
look another way, not minding what you
say: And so doth Christ: If you will not
keep him company when he comes to visit
you; if you will not sit with him, and
converse with him, and perform your part
of Communion with him, readily answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Call, making suitable Returns to
all the Motions of his Holy Spirit, you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Holy Ghost, and give him just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to leave you to your worldly, sullen
frame of Spirit. See what the Spouse in
the <hi>Canticles</hi> lost by such a carriage, <hi>chap.</hi>
5. 2. She was in a sleepy frame when Christ
came to visit her, not at all disposed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
him: He calls, and knocks at the
door, uses many loving compellations to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
her to open to him: <hi>Open to me, my
love, my dove, my sister, my undefiled.</hi> What
kind, soft words are here! Christ would
fain have had Admittance; tells her how
long he had waited, that he was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted,
and suffered the injury of the
weather, was wringing wet: Nothing
would do; she is loth to rise; <hi>I have put off
my coat, how shall I put it on; I have washed
my feet, and how shall I defile them?</hi> What!
set her naked feet upon the bare ground! not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98282:23"/>
she; tho but a step or two to the door. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
she had paused a while, she bethought
her self, and arose; <hi>I rose up to open to my
beloved, and my beloved had withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and was gone:</hi> And well he might after
such ill usage. If Christ be in you, be sure
you use him well, lest he withdraw from
you. They who know what it is to have
Christ within them, unless it be under
some such Temptations as the Spouse was
assaulted with, they will do all they can to
keep him dwelling in their hearts: They
study to please him; their Carriage towards
him is suitable to the Apprehensions their
Fath hath of him. There are many things
in Christ, that fall under the consideration
of a Believer, some at one time, and some
at another; some upon one occasion, and
some upon another, as the matter they
come to Christ about, may require; and
as he is pleased to let out himself more or
less to us: This must be attended to: We
must answer the Call of Christ, by stirring
up that Grace by which we may best expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
the sense of what Christ is to us, doth
for us, requires of us, at such or such a
season, under such or such circumstances,
in reference to this or that particular disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Christ makes of himself unto us.
Sometimes our duty lies in acting this
Grace, sometimes in acting that Grace;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98282:24"/>
whether it be Faith, Love, Fear, Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Tho we cannot act one Grace aright, but
we must in some degree act every Grace;
for all Graces run into that one, which bears
the name for the time, as most suited to the
present occasion we have for the Exercise of
our Grace. Hence the Saints sometimes
speak of one Grace, and sometimes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Grace. Sometimes it is Faith, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is Love, Zeal, Joy. <hi>I protest by
our rejoicing in Christ Jesus.</hi> Sometimes it
is this, sometimes it is that Grace, that
their Souls are most taken up with. There
is that in Christ that will draw out every
Grace in its season; and we should at all
times be in the actual exercise of some
Grace: If you ask, Which? I say, That
which best suits the present occasion that is
given for the exercise of your Grace. We
should labour to pitch our Thoughts upon
that in Christ, that doth most directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to our present case; and many are the
cases of our Souls; God hath ordered it so,
that we might have recourse to all his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
sometimes to one, sometimes to
another: God hath suited our dependance
upon him to his several Attributes, and to
the several Properties of his Name, and of
his Son's Name. He expects our Faith in
him should be always grounded upon that
in Christ, which we see makes most for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98282:24"/>
our present Relief: Whether we want Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Righteousness, Strength, Patience,
Pardon, Comfort, we must eye that in
Christ that is the next immediate Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to our Faith for that thing.</p>
               <p>In the next place I shall shew you the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Christ being in us; and that upon
a double ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First;</hi> Because otherwise there can be no
Vital Union between Christ and us; no
real Communion with him, no saving Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of him to our Souls; no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of Life and Grace to us. <hi>A Branch
can't bear fruit, unless it abide in the Vine;
no more can ye, except ye abide in me,</hi> John
15. 4. He saith further, <hi>Every branch that
brings not forth fruit,</hi> v. 2. (A dreadful
Text; it should make Professors tremble at
the reading of it); <hi>every branch in me that
brings not fruit.</hi> No wonder to hear of
fruitless Professors out of Christ; but to
hear how fruitless many are who are in
Christ, that is outwardly by Profession!
We may seem to be in Christ, when Christ
is not really in us. The unfruitfulness of
many Professors, gives sad Demonstration
of this Truth. When Christ is really in
us, we must needs be in him; there is a
mutual in-being in each other, <hi>John 17. 21.
That they may be all one, as thou Father art in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98282:25"/>
me, and I in thee, that they may be one in us.</hi>
This is meant, not of a Personal, but of a
Mystical Union, a Spiritual Union, Christ
letting in the Virtue, the Power of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
upon us,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14. 1 Pet. 1. 18.</note> so purging our hearts
from corruption, and redeeming us <hi>from
our vain conversation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> Christ must be in us, because
Christ hath much to do within us. <hi>He hath
a kingdom to set up,</hi> Luke 17. 21. Many
strong holds of Satan to pull down; the
strong man to cast out; many lusts and
corruptions to mortifie; many Graces to
raise up and strengthen: He sanctifies us
throughout, not only in Body, but in Mind
and Spirit; and therefore he must deal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
with us: He takes away an heart
of stone, and gives an heart of flesh; and
this is inward work: The Spirit of Christ
strives with our Spirits about this; deals
with the hearts of men to turn them unto
himself. Many Checks, many Calls, many
Pangs, many Throws, before Christ be
formed in us, <hi>Gal. 2. 19. He is a Jew, who
is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of
the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter,</hi>
Rom. 2. 29. <hi>This inward man is renewed
and strengthned day by day, by Christ living in
us,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. comp. with 2 Cor. 4. 16.
Tho Christ hath done much without us, in
dying for us, yet if he did not come into
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98282:25"/>
us by his Spirit, we should be little the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for all he hath done without us. Christ
is a Saviour out of us by his Merit, and in
us by the Virtue and Efficacy of his Spirit.
He makes a powerful entrance at our first
Conversion; he creates new Principles,
by which he works further and further up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the heart, till he hath reduced it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
conformity to himself.</p>
               <p>Now here may come in a <hi>Query;</hi> Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
some may say, Could not Christ have
done all within us? What need he do any
thing without us? Might he not come and
live in us, without dying for us? Might
he not enter in the Soul, and sanctifie us,
though he had not first suffered outwardly
for us?</p>
               <p>I answer, <hi>No;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Because the Justice of God had been
then unsatisfied: God the Father, God the
Son, and God the Holy Ghost, were all
unsatisfied: They could have nothing to
do with fallen Man in a way of Mercy, till
Satisfaction was made to Divine Justice.</p>
               <p>2. Supposing such a Sanctification, man
must be damned notwithstanding, for his
former sins. Now no man will be at the
pains to wash and cleanse a Vessel that must
presently be broken in pieces, and thrown
away. What Christ did in Person in our
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98282:26"/>
Nature without us, that he doth Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in our Hearts. As he suffered on the
Cross for us, truly so he suffers much in us,
and by us, meets with much opposition
from in-dwelling Corruption: The Fight
of Faith is great and long, even to our lives
end; our Warfare is not accomplished till
then. Tho Christ hath satisfied the Law
and Justice of God in dying for us, yet the
same power must be put forth to make us
believe this, as in raising up Christ from
the dead. Christ meets with a Legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in every man, that will not readily
admit of the Grace of God, till it be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
by the Spirit of Christ, and sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled
with his Blood. It is a mighty work
of Divine Power, to bring over a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
convinced sinner, to trust in Christ
for the Pardon of all his Sins. There are
many carnal Reasonings against this, many
thoughts and imaginations that do with a
great deal of confidence exalt themselves
against the Mystery of God's Grace in
Christ. Now all these Thoughts must be
brought into Captivity to the Obedience
of Christ: And this is a mighty work of
Divine Power, like levelling of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and breaking Rocks asunder, giving
hearts of Flesh, that may take in Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God's Love to us in Christ, and
thankfully accept of Eternal Life, as the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98282:26"/>
Free Gift of God. When it pleases God to
open the wonderful Mysteries of his Grace
to us, by shining into our hearts, he doth
at last fully convince us of that which we
could never believe before Were there
more of this inward Religion among us;
more of the Power and Efficacy of the
Gospel experienced in the hearts of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
the savour of it would be much
stronger in our lives. Christ within makes
every thing in the Soul bow down before
him.</p>
               <p>Let us not then keep at a distance from
Christ, but gather up nearer and nearer to
him by Faith, till we are united and joined
to the Lord in one Spirit, and then the
Power of Christ will rest upon us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 11. <hi>We shall be strengthned with might in
our inward man,</hi> Eph. 3. 16, 17. It must
needs be so, if Christ be in us. How strong
is the Devil in the hearts of Wicked Men?
How doth he rage and rule <hi>in the children
of disobedience?</hi> Eph. 2. 2. Let Satan enter
into <hi>Iudas,</hi> what bold Attempts doth he
make upon his Master? How ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
him? Thus when the Devil is in men,
how mad are they? How doth he hurry
them on to all manner of Wickedness; till
Christ, who is stronger than this strong
man, <hi>enters in and binds him, casting him
forth,</hi> Matt. 12. 25. Unconverted men act
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98282:27"/>
like so many mad-men; the Devil is in
them; Satan reigns in them; and it will
never be otherwise, till Christ comes into
them: The Power of Satan's Kingdom is
founded in the Darkness of our Minds;
and when one beam of Saving Gospel-Light
shines in upon us, we are turned
from the Power of Satan unto God, the
whole Soul is subjected to him; every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Thought is captivated to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ. Till we feel Christ thus
living in us, we know not where we are,
nor what our state is. If Christ be not in
you, I am sure you are not in Christ; and
what the sad consequence of that is, you
may see <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>At that time ye were
without Christ, being aliens from the common-wealth
of</hi> Israel, <hi>and strangers from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
of promise; without God in the
world, having no Hope:</hi> But Christ in us is
our Hope of Glory.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>I Shall now draw both Parts of the Text
into one Doctrinal Observation, which
is plainly this, <hi>That Christ in us is our Hope
of Glory;</hi> or Christ dwelling in our hearts
by Faith now, is the only sure ground and
foundation of our Hope of Glory hereafter.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98282:27"/>
And therefore (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 1.) Christ is
called our <hi>Hope.</hi> Why he is so called; and
how our Hope is grounded upon him, I am
now to shew;</p>
               <p>(1.) From the Nature of Faith, by
which we receive Christ. And</p>
               <p>(2.) From the Object of Faith, Christ
received, or, <hi>Christ in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall shew you, How Faith, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Christ into the Soul, begets Hope:
And also, How Christ received, doth feed,
nourish, and maintain this Hope, keep
it up.</p>
               <p>I begin with the</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To consider the Nature of Faith,
as it is a Cause of Hope. When the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, <hi>Christ in us is the Hope of Glory;</hi>
he means Christ received by us, or Christ
believed on: For nothing but Faith can
raise up Hope; no, not from Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Faith is before all other Graces, is
the Mother of them all. Hope, Love,
Fear, Joy, Zeal, and the like, are but the
several Motions of the Heart towards
Christ, as he is represented to us by Faith.
Faith raises and sanctifies our Affections;
lets them out upon Christ, so leading out
our Souls towards him, by all those holy
Passions that may be any way expressive of
the high Veneration we have for him. Our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98282:28"/>
Affections do express the sense of our Souls,
whether we like or dislike; how we stand
affected towards any thing proposed to us.</p>
               <p>My business is, To shew how Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
Hope; how naturally Hope rises out
of Faith, and is founded upon it. And I
shall argue from the Nature of Faith, as
it stands in relation to Hope; so it is spoken
of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Faith is the substance
of things hoped for, and the evidence of
things not seen.</hi> It is the Substance, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Quasi fulcrum rerum sperendarum.</hi> It
is <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Notation upon the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Institut. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 41. Faith is
that which under-props Hope, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rendred <hi>the substance of things hoped for;
à substando,</hi> denoting not only the subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the things hoped for, in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of a Believer, but also the help
that Faith gives our Minds to conceive of
things to come, as if they were now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes, and in our hands. Faith is
<hi>Hypostasis,</hi> that which under-props our
Hope, that which Hope stands upon. Faith
bears up Hope; Hope stands upon the
shoulders of Faith, and looks over into
Eternity, upon things to come, which are
lifted up as it were by Faith, out of their
Futurity, and rendred as present to us in
their very substance; that is, The Objects
of a lively Hope do affect the Mind of a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98282:28"/>
Believer, as much as present Objects do
our Senses. Hence Faith is also called
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Index,</hi> Ostension, Probation,
or Conviction of things hoped for; that is,
it is the evidence of things not appearing;
the sight or intellectual Vision of things
not seen; it is the Perspicuity or plain Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of things obscure; it is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of things absent; the demonstration
of things occult and hidden; and all this,
because Faith doth secure to us what is
hoped for from the Promise of God: Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is a rational, intellectual thing, the
demonstration of something to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings:
But the Substance of a Thing
is the Thing it self, it is as if it were so, to
a Lively Hope thus raised and influenced
by Faith. <hi>Faith is the substance of things
hoped for, and the evidence of things not
seen.</hi> Besides, Faith sees that in Christ that
answers all Objections against our Hope.
His Power and Ability to save, is unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to every true Believer; whether he
will save such vile sinners as we are, many
doubts may come in at this door; but it is
of the Essence of Saving Faith to believe
the Power and Ability of Christ to save to
the uttermost; there can be no Faith till
then, neither weak nor strong. Where
there is nothing to relye upon, there can
be no reliance. That which we rely upon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98282:29"/>
must be sure and certain in it self. Hence
Christ is compared to a Rock, to a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to a Corner-Stone that bears up the
Weight of the whole Building. He is one
mighty to save, and must be looked upon
as such, before a poor trembling Sinner will
venture to trust in him. I grant, they who
don't question his Power, may doubt of
his Will; as that <hi>Leper,</hi> Matth. 18. 2. <hi>If
thou wilt, thou canst make me whole.</hi> Yet
when things come to extremity between
God and a Sinner, Faith in the Power and
Ability in Christ to save us, will carry it
against all surmizes of any unwillingness in
him to save us: When we are put to it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
Faith will make the venture; the
Consideration whether he will or will not
save thee, is out of doors then; you'll cast
your selves upon him at all adventure; <hi>if
I perish, I perish; tho thou killest me, I will
trust in thee: To whom should we go? with thee
only are the words of eternal life. There is no
other name under heaven, salvation is in no
other,</hi> Acts 4. 12. There is many a soul
goes o Christ for Salvation, who at the
same time may fear, and think, and it may
be, say, That Christ will not save them,
will not own them, nor look upon them;
but having none else to flye unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to him
they must, and to him they will go at
last, if they belong to God; <hi>Lord save
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98282:29"/>
us, we perish,</hi> say they. They come
to Christ under fears of perishing, as
appears by their Outcries; and yet not
without some hope of Deliverance, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by their Coming. I am persuaded
many a dear Child of God goes out of the
world, under such a trembling Act of
Faith; and blessed are they that do so; for
certainly that is dying in the Lord. It may
not be so comfortable, yet it is a safe state.
And this may be not only the concluding
Act of Faith in a dying hour, but Faith
may and doth so act in weak Christians at
other seasons; it brings them to the feet of
Christ full of Fears and Doubts, and there
they lye, and there they will lye, till help
comes from the Lord. They are long a
coming to Christ, but come they will, first
or last; It shews they have some hope,
more it may be than they themselves take
notice of: They express it rather by their
Actions than by their Words: They act
like those who have hope, tho they speak
like those who have none; <hi>Master, save us,
we perish!</hi> I must allow something for these
doubts and fears of our Acceptance with
God upon the account of our own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,
as consistent with the Nature of
Saving Faith in the main: Yet whatever
shew of Humility they have, they are but
a proud piece of Unbelief: And I will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98282:30"/>
say, That these distrustful Thoughts
of Christ's Willingness to save us, are most
directly opposite to the Hope in the Text,
and do arise, I am persuaded, from a secret
Distrust of his All-sufficiency and Power;
tho we may not discern this in our selves.
That act of Unbelief that is uppermost,
and most palpable, goes for all the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
that is in our heart, when it is quite
otherwise, if they were searched to the
bottom. Unbelief hath many Strings and
Fibres; it is a complicated thing, all evil
is in it, even Atheism it self; let us carry
it how we will, it is a denial of God. See
how the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 7, 8, 9. under
a fit of Unbelief, doth not so much questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himself, as God's Faithfulness and
Truth; <hi>Is his Mercy clean gone? doth his
promise fail for evermore? hath God forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to be gracious?</hi> He had forgot himself,
and he thought that God had forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
But as I told you before, Faith in the
Power of Christ, will carry it at last
against all our fears: <hi>At what time I am
afraid, I will trust in thee.</hi> As there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Fear that makes us draw back from
God, so there is something in it that puts
us forward. The greater the extremity is,
the more apt we are to venture. As a man
pursued by an Enemy, and running for his
life, tho he may boggle at some difficult
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98282:30"/>
pass, he tries, and tries again; draws back
his foot, thinks he feels the ground sink
under him; but the Enemy being now at
his heels, he must through, or Perish; and
so he ventures without any more ado, and
glad he is to find firm ground under his feet;
he did not think so, till he was upon it. And
so it is with a weak Believer; Faith doth
not presently drop all its fears when it is
coming to Christ. Act reliance upon
Christ, and you will find support, which
was the thing you doubted of; by taking
hold of Christ, you will stay your selves,
and feel your selves upheld. A Soul when
actually come to Christ, is rid of many
fears it was under all the while it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and lives under a more comfortable
Hope ever after.</p>
               <p>Thus you see how Faith begets Hope,
how naturally it arises out of Faith.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Next</hi> place, I shall shew you,
how Christ received; or, Christ in us,
doth cherish, maintain, and keep up
this Hope in Believers: <hi>Christ in us, the
hope of Glory,</hi> saith the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren!</hi> Glory is a great thing, and
the Hope of Glory is a great Hope: And
great hopes must have a great foundation
to support them. There must be that in
the ground of my Hope, that will, at least,
make it probable to me, that the thing I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98282:31"/>
Hope for, is attainable that way, else it is
not a rational ground of Hope. Now I
will make it evident to you, That a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
is the most rational man in the world
in all the actings of his Faith and Hope.
He goes upon sure ground, he hath the
clearest Evidence, the fullest Conviction,
the most demonstrable Proof on his side,
that can be, which heightens his Hope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.
Do you make good the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<hi>that Christ is in you of a truth;</hi>
and I will make good the Hope built
upon it; and prove it to be sufficiently
grounded, provided you are grounded,
and setled, and stablished in the Faith.
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 23. comp. with <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 7. I am
sure you will not be moved away from the
Hope of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>I shall shew you, that Christ is the only
foundation of a Christians Hope of Glory:
I prove it many ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Christ removes all that may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
<hi>our Hope of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He hath done all that may raise
and strengthen <hi>our Hope of Glory:</hi> All that
conduces to it, that any ways tends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
us in it, and make it ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christ hath given us a famous
instance of the full actual accomplishment
of his whole Undertaking for us in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:98282:31"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He hath given us some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
earnest of all this in our selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly and Lastly.</hi> Lest Death should
dash all our Hopes, he hath assured us of a
Glorious Resurrection.</p>
               <p>If I make out all this to you, there will
be no scruple left in the Case, you must
needs be convinced, <hi>That Christ in you is
your hope of Glory.</hi> I begin with the
<hi>First,</hi> Christ hath removed all that may
obstruct <hi>our Hope of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. He hath overcome the Devil, that
grand Adversary to our Souls. <hi>The strong
man is bound,</hi> Matth. 12. 29. <hi>Captivity is
led captive,</hi> Ephes. 2. 4, 8. <hi>Satan falls like
lightning from heaven,</hi> Luke 10. 18. <hi>He
that had the power of death is destroyed,</hi> Heb.
2. 14. <hi>The prince of this world is cast out.</hi>
Joh. 12. 37. <hi>Principalities and powers are
spoyled, triumphed over,</hi> Col. 2. 15. <hi>And thus
the head of the old serpent is bruised,</hi> Gen. 3.
15. <hi>We are turned from the power of Satan
unto God,</hi> Acts 26. 18. <hi>And for this very
purpose, the Son of God was manifest, that
he might destroy the works of the Devil,</hi>
1 Joh. 3. 8.</p>
               <p>You see how full, how particular, the
Scripture is in setting forth the Victory
that Christ gained over the Devil: And all,
that he might secure unto us this <hi>Hope of
Glory.</hi> The devil was once in Hope to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98282:32"/>
bring us all into the same place of Torment
with himself; but Christ hath appeared,
and hath destroyed, and overcome that
great destroyer of Souls.</p>
               <p>2. Christ hath freed us from the Curse
of the Law, and the Wrath of God.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. comp. with 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>He
hath redeemed us from the curse, being made
a curse for us; and hath delivered us from the
wrath to come. He was wounded for our
transgressions: He was made under the law,</hi>
Gal. 4. 4. <hi>He fulfilled all righteousness, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the law.</hi> Matth. 3. 15. And</p>
               <p>3. Christ hath taken away all Sin, that
causes shame, and is therefore directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to this Glory in the Text. Sin is a
reproach to a man, it fills him with shame
and confusion of Face, is a blot upon him,
leaves a note of infamy upon him: Now
Jesus Christ <hi>he bore our Sins in his own body
on the tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>That we being dead
to sin, might live to righteousness.</hi> While
we live in Sin, and live unto Sin; we live
to the dishonour of God, to the reproach
of our Profession, and of all the pretended
Hopes that we were under of our Eternal
Salvation. <hi>He was made sin for us, who knew
no sin, that we might be made the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>He gave
himself for us, to redeem us from all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
Tit. 2. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:98282:32"/>
Thus you see how Christ hath removed
all that may obstruct our Hope of Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> He hath done all that may raise
and strengthen our <hi>Hope of Glory:</hi> All
that conduces to it, that any way tends to
invest us in it, and make it ours.</p>
               <p>1. He satisfies the Justice of God in order
to the free Remission of our Sins. We are
justified freely by his Grace, through <hi>the
redemption that is in Jesus,</hi> Rom. 3. 24,
25, 26.</p>
               <p>2. Christ doth not only justifie us, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Pardon of our Sins; but he also recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles
us to the Holiness of God, by his san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
Spirit. Before, we were Enemies
to God in our minds by wicked works; but
being justified, God doth immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to sanctifie, to reconcile us to himself,
to the Power, Purity, and Strictness of
Gospel-Holiness; he transforms us more
and more into his own Image from Glory
to Glory; (all this tends to Glory you see)
by the <hi>Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 8.</p>
               <p>God's Holiness inclines him to hate Sin,
and his Justice to punish it: And till these
Two Attributes of God be for us, there is
no <hi>Hope of Glory.</hi> Christ by taking our
Nature, put himself into a capacity of
suffering for us. He took not on him the
Nature of Angels; this is some ground of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98282:33"/>
Hope to Man; and having drawn his heart
to believe in him, rely upon him, it is a sure
sign he intends good unto him. Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
become Man, he doth through our own
nature, convey himself to us in the most
intimate, familiar manner that can be. His
Spirit enters into us, passes through all the
Faculties of our Souls, leaving a Spiritual
Inclination in them all towards God, which
by degrees prevails over all the sinful incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of our corrupt natures, making us
at last perfectly conformable to the Son of
God; and this is our Sanctification. <hi>Christ
in us</hi> demonstrates the Love of God to us,
sheds it abroad in our hearts by his Spirit.
We hope for little from those who have no
kindness for us, no love to us: But the love
of God most eminently appears to us in
Christ; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>God having given us
his Son, how shall he not with him give us all
things?</hi> There is ground enough for Hope.
Faith having Christ, raises our Hope for
every thing else: If Christ be ours, all is
ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Christ hath given us a famous
Instance in himself, of the full actual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of his whole Undertaking
for us; which I find insisted upon in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as an Encouragement to Believers.
Saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. There are
many Promises and Prophesies not yet come
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98282:33"/>
to pass, many things we do not see fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
But do we see nothing fulfilled? Ay,
saith he, we see Jesus entred into Glory,
that is enough for us, so 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. saith
he, God hath raised up Christ from the
dead, and given him Glory; to what end,
pray? That your Faith and Hope might be
in God. Believers by virtue of their
Union to Christ, their Head and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,
they are in Heaven already,
made to sit together in Heavenly places in
Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
               <p>All is already fulfilled in Christ that
you hope for. You hope for full pardon
of Sin, full sense of Comfort, full sense
of your Justification; you hope for tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
Mortification of your Sin, perfect
Sanctification; you hope for full delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from all afflictions, for a Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Grave; you hope to ascend up
to Heaven, to be Glorified there: All this
is past upon Christ already; he hath finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Transgression, as to what concerns the
business of our sins, Christ hath finished
it; he hath finished Transgression, and
brought in Everlasting Righteousness:
It is not a thing to be done, but already
actually done; he hath finished Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.
<hi>Sin when finished brings forth
death,</hi> saith <hi>James,</hi> this is the perfection of
Sin, in the utmost extent of its fatal Energy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98282:34"/>
and Efficacy; when it is finished it brings
forth Death. But Christ's finishing Sin,
was to prevent Death, the dispatching it
out of the World. He by finishing Sin,
utterly abolished Death, and Sin too, by
the infinite Merit of his precious Blood.
Christ's finishing Transgression, was the
blotting it out, the undoing and reversing
of all that Evil that Sin had brought upon
us, that it might not be able to bring down
a Curse upon us any more.</p>
               <p>The consideration of this famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
is a wonderful support to our Faith.
Let me tell you this, that a bare word of
Promise concerning things to be done for
us, by God, without this famous instance
of their being done and actually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
in the Man Christ Jesus, would
not have been such a confirmation of our
Faith, tho in it self it ought to be; yet
through our weakness and infirmity, it
would not have been such a convincing
confirmation, as now it is in conjunction
with this undeniable instance. It strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
the very Word of God, and helps us
with more confidence to settle upon it.
There is nothing we hope for, but the
Man Christ Jesus is already possessed of;
he is Risen, he is Ascended, he is sate down
at the right Hand of God upon his Throne,
he is Glorified in our Nature; and what is
done to man, may be done again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98282:34"/>
So that Christ is the most rational
ground of a Christians Hope that can be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Christ hath not only given us
a famous instance in himself, of the coming
to pass of all that is promised to us; but in
the <hi>Fourth</hi> place, he gives us present earnest
of all this in our selves. <hi>We have the first
fruits, the earnest of the spirit in our hearts,</hi>
2 Cor. 1. 22. We <hi>are sealed by the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of promise, which is the earnest of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi>
Ephes. 1. 13, 14. They who are
so sealed, do <hi>walk in the comfort of the Holy-Ghost,</hi>
Acts 9. 31. as well they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
so great an Assurance of Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Some Rays of this Glory do shine
in upon the hearts of Believers here: <hi>A spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of glory rests upon them now,</hi> 1 Pet.
4. 14.</p>
               <p>Now from these Beginnings we may
hope for all that is to follow. Our Light is
come, and the Glory of the Lord is risen
upon us in some measure already, and is
continually rising higher and higher to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Noon-day Light, which is our
perfect day. Thus we are transformed
now from Glory to Glory. Believers find
it so in themselves: And therefore experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
should beget Hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 4. And
then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly:</hi> Lest Death should dash all our
Hopes, Christ hath assured us of a Glorious
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98282:35"/>
Resurrection: <hi>If in this life only we have
hope in Christ, we are of all men most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. 19. Christ hath taken off
this Objection, that we might not be <hi>in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
through fear of death,</hi> Heb. 2. 16. It is
evident he hath power to raise the dead, as
he hath raised himself from the Grave.
They deny matter of Fact, who deny the
Resurrection. 1 Cor. 15. 13. <hi>If there be
no resurrection, then Christ is not risen;</hi> but
that is matter of fact, <hi>he is risen;</hi> we know
it: <hi>Christ is the first fruits of them that sleep</hi>
in the Grave: <hi>The first begotten of the dead,</hi>
Rev. 1. 5. <hi>The first who rose from the
dead,</hi> Acts 26. 23. <hi>He is the first-born from
the dead,</hi> Col. 1. 18. <hi>And he will change our
vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his
glorious body,</hi> Phil. 3. 21.</p>
               <p>See what ground there is for your Hope
of Glory, from the Resurrection of Christ.
<hi>That which is sown in dishonour, shall be raised
in glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 43. This still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
your <hi>Hope of Glory. Therefore my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
brethren,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, be stedfast, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,
always abounding in the work of the
Lord, for as much as you know your labour is
not in vain in the Lord,</hi> v. 58. Were there
no Resurrection, all the pains we take in
Religion, would be labour in vain; but we
know our labour is not in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:98282:35"/>
Thus you see how <hi>Christ in us, is our Hope
of Glory;</hi> because Christ without us, is
now personally in Heaven: And if since
his Ascension and Glorification, he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to descend down into us by his Spirit,
and dwell in us, this is a sure sign he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to bring us to the same place of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with himself. Christ was to bring <hi>many
sons to glory,</hi> Heb. 2. 7. And he sends his
Spirit as an earnest to assure us of this. The
Spirit never quite leaves that soul, into
whom he once comes. <hi>He abides with us for
ever,</hi> John 14. 16. He comes to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
for Christ; he enters in in his name,
he sets his mark upon the Soul; casts out
the Devil, seals up the Soul for Christ;
<hi>Thou art mine,</hi> saith the Spirit of Christ:
<hi>The Spirit it self bears witness with our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that we are the children of God,</hi> Rom.
8. 16. Saints are sensible of this, and do
give themselves unto the Lord: As Christ
gives himself unto the Saints, so they give
themselves unto the Lord. <hi>My beloved is
mine, and I am his;</hi> they do mutually own
each other. And this is the happy day of
our Espousals; we are married unto the
Lord, and he is become an husband to us,
and ever after we dwell comfortably toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren:</hi> If we set our minds to know
these things, the Spirit will shew us out of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98282:36"/>
the Word, what Christ is now doing for
us in Heaven; That <hi>he is gone to prepare a
place for us,</hi> John 14. 2. <hi>To make intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for us,</hi> Rom. 8. 34. He is entred in for
us as a <hi>forerunner,</hi> Heb. 6. 20. that we may
follow after. <hi>He will come again, and receive
us to himself,</hi> John 14. 3. We shall partake
<hi>of his glory,</hi> Joh. 17. 22. <hi>We shall sit down
with him on his Throne,</hi> Rev. 3. 21. These
are good grounds of Hope; we should se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
weigh and consider these things, we
should ponder them well in our hearts.
Some apply themselves with great earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to outward Duties of Religion: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
they study the Controversial part,
and rest in an Orthodox Judgment, in the
bare knowledge of the Truth: And may
be neither the one nor the other do attend to
the acting of their Faith upon Christ,
which only brings down Religion to our
selves, engages our Hearts and Consciences
in it: And I am sure till then, let our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and Knowledge be what it will, we
are not real Christians in the sight of God;
<hi>Christ is not in us of a truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I see many Professors wrapt up close in
their several Forms, crying, <hi>Lo here,</hi> and
<hi>Lo there;</hi> each one contending for his own
Opinion, pleasing themselves with their
different ways and methods of outward
Devotion: Here they rest, and are no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98282:36"/>
concerned in Religion, than to join to
such or such a Party, going under such or
such a Name. We may see many Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts
of all sorts and forms, walking softly
to Hell, talking of Christ all the way they
go. This is Truth; This is Gospel; This
is the Protestant Religion; This and that
is a good Sermon: And yet it is visible,
that the most important Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
have not that weight with them as
they should: They do not carry on the
grand design of their Profession: They
don't live and walk as if they really belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
what they so solemnly profess. This is
the Charge I have against the Professors of
this Age; I am afraid of them; I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of you, I am afraid of my self. Let
every one examine himself. If you know
these things, happy are ye if you do them.
Let us either resolve to live up to our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Principles, or lay aside that Name to
live, by which we deceive both our selves
and others. Let us lay aside all Hope of
Salvation by Christ; or study Christ more
who is the only sure Ground and Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our <hi>Hope of Glory.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>THAT I may take occasion to look
a little further into the Text, I shall
put this <hi>Query</hi> from the running of the
Words as they lye before us, <hi>Christ in us,
our Hope of Glory.</hi> The <hi>Query</hi> is this:</p>
               <p>If Christ be in us, can we hope for any
thing more? If Christ be ours, all is ours;
How then can <hi>Christ in us,</hi> beget Hope of
any thing further? Is there any thing more
than Christ? Can Christ be nearer to us,
than to be within us? Is any thing beyond
Christ? Any thing more desirable than
Christ? One would think that <hi>Christ in us,</hi>
should compleat our Fruition, and not lead
out our Souls to a Hope and Expectation of
something else. This is the <hi>Query.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I answer;</hi> We must distinguish between
the Spiritual and Personal Presence of
Christ: Christ is present with us in Spirit
here; but he will be personally present with
us in Glory hereafter. It is a great deal
more; or, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>far better
for us to be with Christ;</hi> that is, with his
Glorified Person, than for Christ to be in
us now by his Spirit. This is in order to
that; to fit us for himself, and <hi>to make us
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98282:37"/>
meet for the inheritance of the saints in light.</hi>
All is ours, if Christ be ours: All ours;
How? Not in hand, not in full possession;
but only in Hope, in the account and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
of Faith; all is made over and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to us; our Title is firm and good to
the whole Inheritance, and all that God
hath promised; but still the <hi>Inheritance is
reserved,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 4. We are not yet entred
into it, are not yet invested with all that
belongs to us. God hath begun a good work
here, which he will not finish till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
               <p>Our Grace lies in the Spiritual Presence
of Christ in us here; our Glory lies in the
Personal Presence of Christ with us in
Heaven hereafter. We must speak of these
things as men, and you must bear with our
infirmity, and with the weakness of our
expression. I beseech you consider what I
am now saying: The Glorified Person of
Christ will not bear that which the Spirit
of Christ bears now in the Saints. The
Spirit comes to sanctifie us, comes where
Sin is, and casts it out. Tho the Spirit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
mingles with our Sins, yet the Spirit
will hold Communion with those in whom
Sin dwells, which the Glorified Person of
Christ will not. No unclean thing shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Heaven: We must not think to come
so near to the Person of Christ, till we are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98282:38"/>
perfectly sanctified. We must be without
spot, or blemish, or wrinkle, or any such
thing, before we can have immediate Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with the Father and the Son in
Glory.</p>
               <p>The Presence of the Spirit now, tho it
be an inward, intimate Presence, yet it is
but a mediate Presence through the Word,
through Gospel-Ordinances: But the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Presence of God and the Saints with
each other in Heaven, is an immediate
Presence, face to face. We had need have
no spot upon our face then, but be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
washed and cleansed, that no filth may
be found in our skirts. Christ hath espoused
us now by his Spirit to himself here under
all our Infirmities: And he sends his Spirit
to put a Beauty and a Comeliness upon us,
to adorn the Bride, to clothe her with beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
garments against the day of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that she may be fit to stand in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Bridegroom, <hi>as the king's
daughter, all glorious within,</hi> and without
too; then, being perfectly sanctified both
in Body, Mind, and Spirit. The Spirit
of Christ gives us access now into the
Grace of God; but nothing but the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Person of Christ can gives us access in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Glory of God; <hi>Come ye blessed:</hi> All
are admitted into Heaven by the glorified
Person of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98282:38"/>
Christ acting now through the Word, in
the Absence of the Person of Christ, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
us for his coming, keeps us waiting for
that blessed day: <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>The spirit
and the bride say, Come.</hi> The spirit saith so
in the Word, saith so in the hearts of the
Saints, that is, makes them to say so: The
whole Church, and every particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
saith the same thing for himself, <hi>Amen,
so come Lord Jesus, come quickly.</hi> If Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
were asked one by one, Whether they
desire the Coming of their Lord, they
would all agree with <hi>John,</hi> and say, <hi>Amen,
so come Lord Jesus;</hi> they care not how soon,
<hi>Come quickly.</hi> They are all of a mind in
that thing. The earnest longings of every
gracious Soul after Christ, are from the
Spirit of Christ breathing in Believers,
kindling and keeping up strong desires in
them after Christ: They retain these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
in their Spirits after death. The Souls
under the Altar cry out, <hi>How long, Lord,
holy and true,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 9, 10. We are
still to conceive of the Spirit, as the Spirit
of Christ. It is Christ in us shedding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
his Love in our hearts, uniting them
to himself: He will see we shall not forget
him; therefore he dwells in us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to keep up love in our hearts to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And is not this a good ground of hope,
That Christ and Saints shall have a joyful
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98282:39"/>
meeting ere long, who do thus continually
remember each other: The heart of Christ
is towards them, and their hearts are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. They are joined together in
one spirit now. The Glory of the Saints
lies in beholding the Glorified Person of
Christ, because in him they see the Human
Nature so highly dignified and exalted in
the Divine Person of Christ. They see the
express Image of God in Christ shining out
in the brightness of Glory: They see the
Image of Christ in themselves, shining out
in the Perfection of Grace. <hi>When he shall
appear, they shall be like him,</hi> which is their
Glory.</p>
               <p>Thus Christ dwelling in us now by his
Spirit, raises our Souls to the Hope of this
Glory in the Text.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Application</hi> contains a Threefold
Exhortation:</p>
               <p>(1.) That you would be persuaded to
examine and prove your Hopes, Whether
they be well grounded, yea or no.</p>
               <p>(2.) If you find them otherwise, not
sufficiently grounded upon Christ, that you
would be persuaded to throw away those
vain Hopes, to lay them aside. And</p>
               <p>(3.) That you would earnestly labour
every one of you, to come under the Power
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98282:39"/>
of this true Christian Hope in the Text;
and then you will know where you are.</p>
               <p>I begin with the</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First:</hi> Let us examine and prove our
Hope to be well-grounded upon Christ
within us. 2 Cor. 13. 5. <hi>Know ye not your
own selves, how that Christ is in you of a truth,</hi>
except ye be Reprobates; that is, such
(who dying in that state) God will reject
at the last day. We should do all we can to
secure our Hopes, lest our Crown be taken
from us. Hope rises out of Faith; yet we
must not so take it upon trust, as not to be
able to give a Reason of it, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 3. 15.
Hope without Faith, is Presumption,
Hope without Faith, is without a Reason,
a foolish Hope. Till we are justified by
Faith, we can have no Hope, but we lye
under all the damning Circumstances of
our sins, exposed to the Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of God. To be without Christ,
implies all misery: <hi>Then we have no hope,</hi>
Eph. 2. 12. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life;
and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not
life, nor shall ever see life,</hi> 1 John 5. 12.</p>
               <p>We should not rest till we know this,
because it may be known. The Spirit is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us to this very end, 1 John 3 24. To
shew us <hi>that we are in Christ, and Christ in
us,</hi> John 14. 20, 21. Such a manifestation
of Christ to us, is a great Argument of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98282:40"/>
                  <hi>his love to us,</hi> ver. 21. <hi>The Spirit doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
of Christ,</hi> John 15. 26. Besides, it is a
Glory to Christ, to make him our <hi>Hope of
Glory.</hi> We render him great in the eyes
of men, when we look upon him as one
who makes us great. The generality of
men know nothing of Christ, but what
the Faith and Hope of Christians speak
him to be. They understand the Language
of your Hope, who have none themselves.
How mean thoughts soever they have of
Christ, yet they cannot but look upon him
as one greatly admired by others, whose
expectations from him are so high. Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is natural to men; all would have
Glory, tho few take the right way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it. The present satisfaction men take
in sins, may be great, yet their Hopes of
any future good from them, are very small:
When they give themselves time to think,
they are usually surprized with some fear
of the ill consequence of their sins; they
are under some secret bodings of some evil
that will follow: Let them ask their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
if it be not so. Therefore that you
may have more solid grounds of Future
Blessedness, search for Christ within you;
rest not till you feel the quicking Influences
of his Divine Power and Spirit in your
selves; till you feel Christ living in you. It
is one thing to walk as men, another thing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98282:40"/>
to walk as Christians, in the Spirit of
Christ. Did we pray more to the Father
to reveal his Son in us, form Christ in us,
make us Partakers of the Divine Nature;
waiting for the coming down of the Spirit
upon us; we should be endued with Power
from on High, we should know what it is
to do all things in the strength of Christ, to
have all our Works wrought in God: What
it is to act supernaturally, which every
Christian should aim at, experimentally to
know what it is to act supernaturally: They
who do so, will know that they do so;
They cannot be well ignorant of that which
is so new, so much another thing from all
that is Natural. They are lifted up above
themselves, they are carried away by the
Spirit of God, and they may know that
they are in that Spirit; every such appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of God in the Soul, is a manifestation
of the Spirit; not only to others, but more
especially to our selves. The Spirit bears
Witness, that the Spirit is truth; The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
witnesseth with, and to our Spirits.</p>
               <p>When the Spirit comes as a witness,
he stands forth distinct from our Spirit,
that the joynt Testimony of the Spirit of
God with ours, may be discerned from the
single Testimony of our own Spirit, which
could not be, if the Holy Ghost when giving
in his Witness, laying down his propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98282:41"/>
did not stand forth by himself, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
from the spirit of a man, that
the truth may be confirmed out of the
mouth of two Witnesses, at least in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of a Believer.</p>
               <p>Some of the Heathen of old had their
Extasies and Raptures, were sensible they
were acted by a spirit higher than their
own, and thought themselves Divinely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
when they were under the greatest
Infatuation of Satan imaginable. But it doth
not hence follow, that those who are truly
inspired by God, may not know it: Were
Christ in us of a truth, we should find our
selves strong in the power of his Might.
He that is in us, is greater than he that is in
the World; could we take hold of this
great one, and go forth in his Name, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and Strength, we should do great
things; I can do all things, saith <hi>Paul,</hi>
through Christ that strengthneth me; what
do we then in the strength of Christ, which
we know we could not do of our selves? I
live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.
We should labour after some experience of
this in our own selves, not to rest satisfied
till we can experimentally say it of our
selves: Without this experience, we live
but at a low rate, do no more than others,
and sometimes not so much neither;
whereas we should hold forth Christ, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98282:41"/>
walk in his Spirit, having our conversation
more in Heaven, resisting the Devil, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the World, denying our selves, as
those who are strengthned by Christ in our
inward man so to do.</p>
               <p>While I am putting you upon this search
to feel for Christ within you, as the Ground
of your Hope; I shall lay down Two <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. This Mystical Union between Christ
and Believers, this Spiritual In-being of
Christ in our hearts, is a great <hi>Mystery.</hi> We
cannot fully comprehend it in this world.
Some experience we now have of such a
thing in our selves; but a perfect, distinct
knowledge of these deep Mysteries, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for Heaven. Then we shall have a
clearer Revelation of the Mystery of the
Trinity: <hi>At that day,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>you
shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in
me, and I in you,</hi> John 14. 20. At that day,
but not before: In that day you shall know
it perfectly; now you know something,
you see something, tho but darkly; and we
must be content.</p>
               <p>2. Never take that to be from the Spirit
of Christ in you, that leads you from the
Scripture, and would make you wise above
what is written. Some have run into strong
delusions this way, fancying every thing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98282:42"/>
they do or say, to be by Divine Inspiration.
What tho some are deceived in thinking
they have the Spirit of Christ, when they
have him not? It doth not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that those who have the Spirit <hi>indeed
and in truth,</hi> may not know that they have
him. One man's Error in this case, cannot
overthrow another man's Experience. He
that hath not the Spirit, may think he hath
him; but he that hath the Spirit indeed,
may know he hath the Spirit. Because
some men mistake the Truth, it doth not
follow therefore, it cannot be known by
any. When you seek for Christ in your
selves, and for further Teachings of his
Spirit, you should always pray over some
Word; have your eye upon some Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
which you beg a right understanding
of; for no inward Revelation is now to be
expected; but only of things already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the Word, which the Spirit opens
to us; that is, <hi>Christ in us</hi> doth this. But
in Heaven we have an Intuitive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the things themselves in God,
who is the First Spring, the First Cause,
the Fountain of all supernatural Truths
contained in the Bible. In Heaven we
shall know the Truth only as it is in Jesus;
now we know it as it is in our Bibles; we
know it by the Word, as a Sign and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol
of the Will of God, from whence we
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98282:42"/>
abstract all our knowledge of Divine things
in a discoursive way. But Intuitive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in Heaven is another thing; there
needs no written Word, no other Bible in
Heaven, but Christ the Essential Word of
God, who will shew us all in himself, all
Gospel-Truths do center in him; which
shews, that for us to be with Christ in
Glory, is more than for Christ to be in us
by his Spirit here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> Let us lay aside all vain Hopes,
that confound and <hi>make us ashamed,</hi> Job
6. 20. The Vanity of Hope lies not so
much in the Object of Hope, as in our Hope
it self: The Object may be real, to wit,
Life and Eternal Glory: They are gay
things, desirable things, and they are real
things too: But we must see that our Hope
be well-grounded: If the Grounds be
weak, such as by no just Consequence of
Reason will bear what we infer from them,
then our Hope is vain; we must <hi>give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the hope that is in us;</hi> and such a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as may answer all Objections against
our Hope. The Object of Hope is <hi>Bonum
arduum futurum, sed possibile:</hi> If there be
not a possibility of obtaining what we hope
for, upon the ground we go upon, our
Hope is vain, and will certainly make us
ashamed, the issue not answering our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
<hi>Job</hi> 11. 20. comp. with <hi>Prov.</hi>
10. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:98282:43"/>
There are Two Things which men
ground their vain Hope of Salvation, of
Heaven and Glory upon; in both which
they overlook Christ, and pass him by.</p>
               <p>1. Their own Righteousness, so far as
they can pretend to any, they make the
most of it, grow proud of it, look to be
considered by God for it; as if he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
to them for their good Lives, and
inoffensive Carriage; that they run not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same excess of Riot with others. But
alas! what a sandy foundation is this to
build our Hope of Heaven upon!</p>
               <p>Be not offended at what I am saying, but
weigh it well in the Balance of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
consider it strictly by Gospel-Light:
I say this; We may as soon be saved in our
Sins, as by our own Righteousness. It is as
contrary to the Gospel to trust in our own
Righteousness, as to the Law, not to do it.
Our Sins are not more opposite to the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Law, than trusting in our own
Righteousness is to the Free Grace of the
Gospel. <hi>Not by works of righteousness
which we have done, but according to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
he saveth us,</hi> Tit. 3. 5. It is true, a Holy
Life becomes a Christian; we cannot be
Christians without it; but it doth not
make a Christian: Nothing but Faith in
Christ doth make a Christian, from whence
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98282:43"/>
all true Holiness found in Believers, doth
spring. I have sometimes told you, That
Preaching of Holiness, pressing Holiness
with little or no mention of Christ, will
never bring men to Christ; but Preaching
up Christ will bring men to Holiness; that
is the right spring and root of all true God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.
It doth as much belong to Christ to
Sanctifie us, as to Justifie us. We must go
out of our selves for Sanctification, as well
as Justification. <hi>Who shall bring a clean thing
out of an unclean? Not one: None but God.</hi>
No unjustified person can be sanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He whose sins are imputed to him,</hi> must
needs be under the power of them: Sin
will live under its own Guilt: If that be
removed, sin dies presently. If it cannot
kill us, it ceases to reign over us. <hi>The
strength of sin is the law.</hi> When the Law
cannot by any Act of Justice belonging to
it, curse us for our sin, sin in us grows
weaker as to its own Acts hereafter; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are no longer under the Law, but
under Grace, which teacheth us to <hi>deny-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness.</hi>
A man will never be brought off
from his own course, by all the teachings
of the Terrors of the Law, till the Grace
of God begins to tutor him, to instruct
him. The Law was not intended to be
our Teacher, but our Judge: It was given
to man in his Perfect State, who knew the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98282:44"/>
whole compass of his Duty, had the Law
written in his heart. The breach of the
Law left him under the Curse, where he
doth, and will lye, till free Grace relieve
him, and brings him under the Blessing of
the Gospel. The Law shews fallen man
his Transgression, but cannot shew him
any Righteousness in himself, because there
is nothing exactly answering the Law
found in man fallen. <hi>Malum est ex quolibet
defectu;</hi> The whole Action is sinful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
imperfect.</p>
               <p>The Righteousness of the Law, in a
strict Legal sense, (for I must be forced to
distinguish; I know many in this Age will
not understand me; but <hi>they that have ears
to hear, let them hear:</hi> I say, The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the Law in a strict Legal sense)
admits of no degrees; it must be perfect or
none: It is true, a gradual tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the exact Righteousness of the Law,
is commendable in any; but because it is
not a fulfilling of the Law, the Law will
not reward it, but punish that man as a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
not because he goes so far in his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
but because he goes no further. A
man may do many things, but if he doth
not always do every thing that is right
in the Law, <hi>the Law will curse that man,
and his former Righteousness shall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:98282:44"/>
2. The second false Ground of hope, is
the Gracious and Merciful Nature of God.
How is this cried up! his <hi>Philanthropia,</hi>
God's Love to his creature man! And this
they think will make God unnatural to
himself, and cause him to lay aside his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
that he may shew kindness to them
who have acted so contrary to him. And
therefore they hope God will have as little
regard to his own Justice and Holiness, as
they have had.</p>
               <p>All I shall say is this; That those who
reject the only way of Salvation by Christ,
in whom the Justice and Mercy of God
are reconciled, will find it a hard matter to
plead the Mercy of God for themselves in
a direct Opposition to his Justice: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they can dye in Peace under these
Thoughts, let them see to that. Men may
talk what they will of their Good Works,
and of their inherent Holiness; but sure
I am, Nothing but the Righteousness of
Christ imputed to us, will remove that
Guilt that cleaves to us in every thing that
we do; and you will never be Justified till
that be done. What is all your Duties, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
all Holy Works, What is all
this to the Pardon of thy Sin, Man? God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
absolves the sinner, never looks upon
him as Righteous, till he be found in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98282:45"/>
Christ, not having on his own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

               <head type="sub">Thirdly; Let us labour to come under the

               <p>WHether I shall Prophesie good to
you, or evil, from this Text, I
know not, it is according to the frame the
Word finds you in, which I am now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

hope in Christ, you are of all men</hi> and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<hi>the most miserable.</hi> But I hope better
things of you, of every one of you, tho I
thus speak; knowing that you all have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Souls, that cannot always live upon
the Bodies portion; I am jealous over you
with a Godly Jealousie, and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
you to give a <hi>reason of the hope that is
in you;</hi> not so much to satisfie me, as to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your selves: Give such a Reason as
may satisfie your own Consciences: And
this is all I aim at.</p>
               <p>All of us must be either under Hope, or
under fear, or in a dead, stupid, senseless
frame: I will suppose you are all under
some hope of Eternal Glory; for rruly I
see little else appear in the Faces of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98282:45"/>
They all hope to be Saved and go to
Heaven; I am not willing to weaken your
Hopes, nor disturb you in them, unless I
see cause: And truly I wish, that this
Hope do not prove a presumptuous Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in some, arising from carnal securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But be it what it will, let us look into
the matter, it may be while I am speaking
of the Power of Hope, some of you may
be made sensible of the weakness of your
Hope.</p>
               <p>Hope hath powerful influences upon the
Mind of a man, makes strong impressions,
and gives a sense of it self unto those that
have it: we can't but take notice of our own
Hopes: Many pretend to this Hope, say
they have it, who have it not: They are
willing to deceive themselves, to flatter
their own Souls, to think better of their
State than it is; but can give no reason that
will hold, why they think so: And yet
they will not be persuaded otherwise; they
take it ill to be suspected by those who see
further into their State than they do; till a
through conviction of Sin and Wrath come
upon them, they will never be otherwise
minded. But then all their Hopes vanish,
their Light goes out in utter Darkness, their
Spiders Web breaks and becomes vain
when they lay any stress upon it; their
Hope is as the giving up of the Ghost,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98282:46"/>
which makes them ashamed, fills them
with Confusion of Face. Whereas a true
lively Christian Hope, will carry us through
Death it self, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 32. This Hope in
the Text is not an empty name, but a real
thing, a real Grace, and hath real effects
that may be felt, and will be felt by those
who are under the Power of it. You know
what it is to be in fear, how discompos'd and
cast down, how perplexed and troubled,
how pale and wan. By the contrary
frame, you may know what it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Power of Hope, which is so revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and begets such <hi>strong consolation, Heb.</hi>
6. 18. <hi>It is a blessed hope,</hi> Tit. 2. 13. It will
comfort us in a Dungeon, there we may
sing <hi>as prisoners of hope,</hi> Zech. 9. 12. It is an
helmet to receive all Blows, securing the
head from hurt, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 17. It is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
to keep the Soul steady in a tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
season, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. Great is the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Hope, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 3. It bespeaks a
troubled Soul, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. <hi>Why art thou
cast down, O my soul, why art thou disquieted
within me: Hope thou in God.</hi> There is little
comfort for a Christian in this world, if the
hope of eternal life be cut off, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The usual Effects of this Hope,
when it is in any other Power, are these:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:98282:46"/>
1. Hope of Glory, and an earnest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the coming of Christ, are
joyned together, and indeed they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
the same: Waiting for his Coming;
looking for and hastning to the Coming of
the Day of the Lord: Christ was called
<hi>the hope of Israel, Acts</hi> 28. 20. Because our
Fathers looked for his first Coming; and
so he is now called the <hi>Hope of Glory,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Saints do so earnestly look for his
second Coming. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
               <p>2. This Hope and Prayer go together.
The Schools tell us, that <hi>Petitio</hi> is <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretativa
spei;</hi> we cannot better express our
Hopes, than by wishing, Praying, and
earnest breathing after what we Hope for.
Would you know, whether you shall enter
into Glory, and be Eternally Saved? If you
have the Spirit of Prayer, you will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be Saved: But mistake not the gift of
Prayer (which may be nothing but words)
for the grace of Prayer, that lies in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
earnestness of the heart, sometimes
in Groans that are unutterable: If you can
pray inwardly in the frame of your Hearts,
with Fervency and Affection in the Name
of Christ, this is Praying in the Holy
Ghost; let your words be never so few, and
your expressions never so broken and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
if the desire of your Souls be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christ, it is laid down as an infallible
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98282:47"/>
Mark of your title to Heaven. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6, 7.
<hi>Because you are sons, God hath sent forth
the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying,
Abba, Father. Wherefore we are no more
servants but Sons; and if sons, then heirs
of God through Christ.</hi> The Spirit of
Prayer is a convincing Evidence to those
that have it, or else the Spirit of God
would miss of his end, if he did not assure
us by that assuring act which is put forth
for that very purpose: Therefore be much
in Prayer. If you are not in that measure
of lively Hope as you would, be much in
Prayer for Hope. Saints can't but Pray
much under Hope. Hope invites to Prayer,
and disposes to it, if it be but to tell God
what we Hope for, which we cannot do
but under some present renewed Acts of
Hope, which possibly we may not perceive
in our selves. Yet however, Pray under all
your despondencies for Hope, that God
would raise it, and kindle it in you.
Though you pray but faintly, weakly,
through fear and diffidence, yet pray on:
God usually comes in with strengthning
Grace in the time of Prayer: He saith to
the fearful Soul, Fear not; there is a sudden
reviving, a shedding abroad of the Love
of God in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.
We may be under dismal apprehensions of
of the Wrath of God in the beginning of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98282:47"/>
Prayer, and yet conclude with rejoying
and triumphing in his Grace towards us.
There are many instances of this in the
Psalms. Faith, if it be right, knows not
how to conclude a Prayer, till it hath taken
some hold of Christ for relief; we cannot
say <hi>Amen,</hi> till then, we cannot come to
the conclusion till then; and then the Soul
rises up in a comfortable frame under some
Hope of Mercy.</p>
               <p>Thus Hope is raised, nourished, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
in us by earnest fervent Prayer.</p>
               <p>3. Hope of Glory and Mortification of
Sin go together. <hi>He that hath this hope,</hi>
saith the Apostle, <hi>purifies himself as God is
pure,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. Every Sin in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
Mortified, brings on a further degree
of Glory upon us, and leaves a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the Image of God upon the Soul;
you resemble him more, which brings you
nearer to your Heavenly State, when you
shall be exactly like him.</p>
               <p>4. Hope of Glory, and Chearfulness
under all outward Afflictions, go together.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16, 17, 18. <hi>We faint not, because
of that far more exceeding and eternal weight
of Glory. You should always hold fast the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
of your hope firm unto the end,</hi>
Heb. 3. 6. <hi>Gird up the loyns of your mind,
be sober, and hope unto the End; for the
Grace that is to be brought unto you at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98282:48"/>
of Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 13. We
are often assaulted by Temptations, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Afflictions, and inward Desertions
are ready to sink our hope: We say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as the Church did, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>My
strength and my hope is perished from the Lord.
Our hopes seems to be plucked up even by the
roots, as a tree that is removed,</hi> Job. 19. 10.
yet revives again, and springs up as God
turns his face towards us, <hi>filling us with joy
and peace in believing; then we abound in hope
tbrough the power of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
Rom. 15. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Directions how to get under the Power</hi> of
this Cristian Hope; for a Power it hath,
and it is nothing to us, till we come under
that Power.</p>
               <p>1. Labour to understand your Hopes;
What it is you look for from Christ, how
great the inheritance is. A <hi>Minor</hi> under
Age, who is born to a great Estate, is
little affected with it, till he comes to know
what he is Heir to; what Houses, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
and Lordships belong to him, then he
counts himself rich indeed: The Apostle
prays for this, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17, 18. <hi>That the
God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
Glory, may give to you the Spirit of wisdom
and revelation in the knowledge of him: The
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98282:48"/>
eyes of your understanding being enlightned,
that ye may know what is the hope of his calling,
and what the riches of the Glory of his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the Saints.</hi> Did you know what
a rich, Glorious Inheritance is reserved for
you, this would mightily raise, quicken,
strengthen your Hope: You would count
your Hope something then, and rejoyce
more in it.</p>
               <p>That is the First Direction; Labour to
understand your Hopes: Read over the
Inventory of God's Gifts bequeathed to
you in the Covenant of Grace, till you can
say, This is mine, and that is mine, and all
is mine through Christ.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Call over former experiences.</hi> What God
hath already done for you. Experience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
Hope, as in <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32. 10, 11,
12. <hi>With my staff did I come over this Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
and now I am become two Bands; Lord, I
am not worthy of the least of thy mercies, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me from the hand of my Brother Esau:</hi>
Thou that hast done such great things for
me, go on and deliver me. Be not afraid of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
danger, but remember what the Lord
hath done for you; suppress all discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
thoughts that may arise in thee.
<hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 17, 18, 19. <hi>If thou shalt say in thine
heart, these Nations are more than I, how
shall I dispossess them? Thou shalt not be
afraid of them, but shall well remember what
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98282:49"/>
the Lord thy God did to Pharaoh, and unto all
Egypt Thou shalt not be afrighted at them,
for the Lord thy God is among you, and he will
put out these Nations by little and little,</hi> v. 21,
22 We complain, things go on but slowly,
there is little done; God chuses to do
things by little and little; consider what hath
been done, and don't make it less than it is; it
may seem little in comparison of what shall
be, yet in it self, as it is, 'tis very great.
And therefore let us argue as <hi>David</hi> did,
1 <hi>Sam</hi> 17 37. <hi>Psal.</hi> 3. 7, 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 10, 11.
<hi>Psal</hi> 143 5, 6, 7, 8. so <hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
20. 7, 9, 12. so <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>God that
hath delivered, and doth deliver, and we trust
will yet deliver.</hi> The remembrance of what
God hath done, and doth do, will strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
our Hope in him for the future.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Converse much with the Scriptures,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
with the Promises, <hi>that through Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and comfort of the Scriptures you may have
hope,</hi> Rom 15. 4. How did <hi>David</hi> raise
his Hope from the Word of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.
in many places, <hi>v</hi> 42, 72. and elsewhere
in that Psalm? When a man gives his
word to us again and again, we believe him,
and reckon our selves sure of what we ask,
having so many repeated promises that
it shall be done. The Word of God is a
living Word in this respect, because as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as we mingle it with Faith, it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98282:49"/>
God speaking afresh to us in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
Faith hearing this again and again, is
more confirmed. Faith at first came by
hearing, and the oftner it hears God
speaking in his Word, the more it is
strengthned in a lively Hope of all that
God hath promised.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Look upon it as your Duty to Hope in
God.</hi> He hath commanded us, because
he knows we are apt to doubt and question
his Promises. It is not presumption, but
Duty to Hope in God, relying upon his
free Grace, and not upon our own deserts;
which never begets a true humble Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Hope, but a proud, arrogant Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in a mans self: Whereas the fiducial
Confidence of Hope is always derived from
Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
               <p>5<hi>thly. and Lastly.</hi> Look unto the God
of Hope. Live in a constant dependance
upon his Spirit to work it in you. <hi>It is
through the Power of the Holy Ghost we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in hope,</hi> Rom. 15. 13. That we are
brought under the Power of a Christian
Hope, which arises from such hidden
causes, such deep grounds, not known to
flesh and blood, that none but God can
demonstrate the reasonableness and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Hope. He knows how to beget
us again to a lively Hope by the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ from the Dead, which is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98282:50"/>
more than a Promise: It is the actual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing
of that in another, that makes it
credible to us, that God can raise the
Dead, and that as he hath raised up Christ,
so he will also raise up us at the last Day.</p>
               <p>To the former directions add these Two
things following.</p>
               <p>If you would ground your Hope aright
upon Christ within you, so as to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Power of it. Then</p>
               <p>1. Consider well, whether Christ be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in you; whether you have felt the
quickning influences of his Spirit in your
own Souls. Christ is your life, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4.
comp with <hi>John</hi> 11. 25. Consider then
whether he be indeed your Life; use all
your Spiritual senses about this; it is no
easy matter to understand this Mystery.
There are many who lead a Natural, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
Moral Life under a Christian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and may be estranged from the
Life of God all their Days. You see how
<hi>Paul</hi> distinguishes in the case, lest he should
mistake himself, or be mistaken by others.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>I live,</hi> saith he, <hi>yet not I, but
Christ liveth in me.</hi> And so may a Saint
now say, I understand Gospel Mysteries,
yet not I as a man, by the Light of my own
Reason, but as a Man in Christ, in the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98282:50"/>
Light of Faith; by which I know, not
only that such things are revealed in the
Word, but also, that they shall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
unto all those who rely upon
Christ: Neither can I give any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for their accomplishment, but so it is
Written, and thus saith the Lord. This
is to speak like a Christian, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
all into Christ, becoming fools in our
selves, that we may be wise in him. The
Life I now live in the Flesh, saith he, I
live by the Faith of the Son of God; take
away that Faith, and all my Hope as a
Christian vanishes away.</p>
               <p>You had need have a true Spiritual Light
rightly discerning of Spiritual things, to
know that Christ is in you, as your Life;
It cannot be known but by Faith. Though
Faith be very rational in all its arguings
from Gospel Principles, yet Faith it self
is not properly an act of Reason, but rather
an act above Reason; it carries the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
above its Reason, to act my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
so, as to assent to that which I
have no Natural Reason for: This is the
knowledge of Faith; a strange way of
knowing, which the world counts Foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Supernatural truths don't rise up into
our Minds, as the product and consequent
of our Reason; this is humane knowledge
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98282:51"/>
according to our Logick. But all super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
truths are let down through the
Word by the Spirit of God into our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings;
they are too deep, too mysterious
and profound to be conveyed to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
by the ordinary course of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
And therefore God opens another
door, and lets them into the Soul by Faith.
Thus he writes his Law in our Hearts, puts
his Truth into our inward parts; Where
is the Scribe? Where is the Wise? Where
is the Disputer of this World? How doth
God confound the Wisdom of the Wise,
from whom he hides these things, which he
reveals to Babes and Sucklings: Poor hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Souls, they have the knowledge of the
Heavenly Mysteries, and the World knows
not how they came by it. <hi>Whence hath
this man this wisdom, and this knowledge,
having never learned?</hi> say they of Christ,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 54. comp. with <hi>John</hi> 7. 15.
They wonder'd that any, not brought up in
their Schools, should be more knowing
than themselves. It is an astonishment to
the World, to consider what knowledge
poor humble Saints have of things, which
they do in no wise understand.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Have a care of too gross conceptions of
Christ within you.</hi> You must understand the
Text Spiritually: As Reason brings Natural
things into your Minds, and gives you an
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98282:51"/>
Intellectual Vision of them; So Faith
brings Heavenly things into your Minds,
and gives you a Spiritual Vision of them.
Christ is first known to us by Faith:
There is no knowing him but by Believing
in him; no coming to him, no seeing of
him, but as the Soul moves towards him in
the Light of Faith. God shines in our
hearts, saith the Scripture, the Light of
the knowledge of his Glory in the face of
Jesus Christ; and this Light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is Faith. When we Believe, we
know Christ, we See him, we Come to
him, we Rely upon him, Rejoyce in
him, we Love and Obey him; all the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Soul towards Christ, they are
from Faith, representing him to us out of
the Word. And when we believe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Gospel concerning him, we
are persuaded, and must be persuaded of
the Truth of that which by a present Act
of Faith we do Believe: There goes no
more to your knowledge, persuasion, and
satisfaction, than real Believing. Faith in
its own Nature, is all Evidence; though
Flesh and Blood do contradict this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
seek to cast clouds over it, yet
those doubts that arise, they come not
from Faith, but Unbelief that accompanies
it more or less in every act we perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:98282:52"/>
The more Faith, the more Hope; the
more Unbelief, the less Hope. Hope will
be in a proportion to the degree of our
Faith: The Spirit works Faith in us, and
then shews us Christ in the Light of it.
Christ is let into the Soul by Faith, there
he is, and there he dwells, transforming
us into his own Image by our Faith in
him. As Faith works by Love, so the
Spirit works by Faith; I mean by our
Faith in him. The Spirit knows how to
improve our Faith in Christ, to draw ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
from thence, to bring us to any
thing which the Gospel calls for.</p>
               <p>I am persuaded I speak to many who
have Christ within them, who would not
quit their Interest in him for Ten thousand
Worlds; if so, you must fetch the reason
of this from your Hope in Christ: What!
Not part with Christ upon any terms, and
yet Hope for nothing from him; not part
with Christ upon any terms, and yet get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by him! He doth not offer himself
to you upon these terms, but that ye may
be enriched by him in all things. You
dishonour Christ, and forget your Faith,
when you don't Hope for great things from
him. I Beseech you, Sirs! Bethink your
selves a little of your standing in Christ;
what hold you have taken of Eternal life
in him; and don't after all say, I have no
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98282:52"/>
Hope. Neither would I have you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
your selves in bare saying you have
Hope: But stir it up, act it, shew it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in it daily. Hope to the end, that
others may see, how happy you count your
selves in Jesus Christ; tell every one you
meet, <hi>That Christ in you, is your hope of
Glory.</hi> We often Preach and Hear of
Faith and Hope, but we practice those
Graces at leasure. Sermons of Faith and
Hope, don't beget these Graces in us, nor
draw them out into act: Pray consider of
this; were our hearts changed under the
Preaching of the Word, into a frame suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to it, this would be a token for good
unto us, that the Lord is indeed among us.
If Sermons of Hope did end in lively act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Hope, we should all go home Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
Blessing and Praising of God for
his abundant Mercy towards us. Great
Hopes can't easily be forgotten; we natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
run into our Hopes; we are fond of
them, they present themselves to our
Thoughts continually, have easy access to
us, they take up our Minds daily, making
pleasing representations to us of the Good
that is coming towards us: I would leave
you under the Contemplation of these
things. Did we converse more with our
Hopes of Heaven and Glory, this would
keep sorrow from our hearts, and cause
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98282:53"/>
us always to rejoyce in the Lord. Here is
a present Cordial for the Poorest, the most
Afflicted and Disconsolate Soul. How
uncomfortable soever your present circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
may be, if you would get up into
this Hope, what happy Men and Women
would you be! you would count your
selves happy, and be filled with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable,
and full of Glory. None of
your wants would pinch you, you would
be lifted up above the afflicting sense and
smart of any outward Cross that may now
lye heavy upon you: All your Afflictions
would be light, if compared to this Eternal
weight of Glory, which weighs down all
troubles, and doth wonderfully alleviate and
moderate all your Griefs. You may be AS
sorrowful in the Judgment of others, and
yet always rejoycing in your own Spirits
from the Power of Hope.</p>
               <p>It may be some will say, How can
this be? Were we never so high in these
Hopes, yet we should grow weary and
restless under them, because all is put
off to the Resurrection, till the Coming of
Christ; and who can tell when that will
be? <hi>Hope deferred makes the heart sick;</hi>
we may faint under our desires before they
come to pass, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:98282:53"/>
                  <hi>I Answer;</hi> In worldly hope it is so;
worldly hope is not so strengthned, is not
so established, hath not that overcoming
Power and Virtue in it, as this Christian
Hope hath; for these Two Reasons:</p>
               <p>1. Because of the firm Assurance we
have of the certain Accomplishment of our
Hopes; which cannot be said of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
humane, worldly hope. As Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
we know our <hi>hope will not make us
ashamed,</hi> Rom. 5. 5. comp. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
38, 39. A Christian knows his Hope is
founded upon immutable Promises, and this
doth strangely animate the Power of a
Christian Hope.</p>
               <p>2. We cannot flag in our Christian Hope,
because of the present satisfaction it gives
us: Wordly Hope is but a lank thing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
fair, but hath little present influence
upon the minds of men to give them any
real satisfaction; but a Christian Hope doth
give present satisfaction: There is always
something in hand, some pledges, some
earnest of all that is to follow; and this is
sufficient for our present occasions, to serve
the turn till we have finished our Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
here below. <hi>They that wait upon the
Lord, shall renew their strength; they shall
mount up as with eagles wings; they shall run
and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint,</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:98282:54"/>
Isa. 40. 31. There is a strange Strength
and Virtue in a Christian Hope. The Hope
of a Christian is a feeding Hope, a Soul-satisfying
Hope; there is no languishing
under it, it feeds upon the present over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings
of the Promise. Tho the thing
it self is not yet brought forth out of the
Promises, yet the Actings of Faith and
Hope do cause a strange present overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Promise, that drops into the
heart like Oil to refresh it: I say, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are continually dropping in fresh
Comforts, giving us fresh Tastes of the
Love and Goodness of God. Now under
this satisfaction, our expectation is raised;
and this again heightens our present satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
we have enough now, are full, are
rich, have all our hearts can now hold;
and yet we do see more a coming, with a
further Capacity, Skill, and Wisdom to
improve it. <hi>I shall see him, but not now,</hi>
Numb. 24. 17.</p>
               <p>The Soul cannot bear more of God in
this world, than what comes in by Faith
and Hope; and tho we are satisfied in our
present state, yet we wait for a change.
The Husbandman is satisfied to see the Seed
sown, coming up in the green tender blade;
but the joy of Harvest is another thing,
Nothing but the full Fruition of all that
good you are capable of to Eternity, can
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98282:54"/>
swallow up our Faith and Hope, which
will be continually reaching out after those
things which are before, till we have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. In Heaven there will be no need
of Hope; but prize it while you live upon
the earth, at a distance from your Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Countrey.</p>
               <p>If you would know, Whether indeed
you are under the Power of Christian
Hope, then try the Strength of it in your
selves, What it doth in you; How it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
and comforts you.</p>
               <p>1. Under all delays of Providence in
fulfilling the Promises, can you wait the
Lord's leisure, and not make haste, but
patiently wait for what you yet see not?
this is a sign of Hope in Power, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 25.</p>
               <p>2. Doth your Hope support you, not
only under delays, but when God seems to
act contrary to his Promises, to let out his
Anger against you? It is no easie matter
for us to turn towards God by Faith and
Hope, when God turns away in Anger
from us, hiding his face. It was well said
of the Prophet, <hi>I will wait for the Lord, that
hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I
will look for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. When things seem desperate as to all
second causes in the judgment of man, can
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98282:55"/>
you then count upon the Truth and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the Promise? And</p>
               <p>4. When you are actually surprized with
Fears, what doth Hope do then? Doth it
check your fears? Doth it raise you above
them? <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 3. <hi>What time I am afraid,
I will trust in thee.</hi> In the 4<hi>th.</hi> verse it is
read thus, <hi>What time I am afraid, I will not
fear:</hi> A brave Resolution: <hi>I will not fear
what man,</hi> what flesh <hi>can do unto me:</hi> What
is man? What is flesh to the great God of
Heaven and Earth? <hi>What time I am afraid,
I will not fear.</hi> If God be for me, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not who is against me.</p>
               <p>When you can thus reason your selves
out of all your carnal fears, it is a sign you
are under the Power of Christian Hope.
When Grace doth master that sinful Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is contrary to it, that is Grace in
Power, reigning Grace; it keeps Sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it shall not have dominion over us.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">How Hope rises from Christ in us higher and
higher, till we abound in Hope, and come
more fully under the Power of it.</head>
               <p>FIrst, viz. <hi>By a frequent serious Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Christ in his Divine Person</hi>
and Offices; what his end was in coming
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98282:55"/>
into the World, in taking our Nature upon
him, and in dying for us in that Nature.
We should ponder these things in our
minds, and be intent upon them. We are
exhorted to this in order to hope, <hi>Heb. 3.
1. and</hi> 6. verses comp. <hi>Therefore, holy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
partakers of the heavenly calling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Apostle and High-Priest of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
Jesus Christ:</hi> To what end? <hi>That
you may hold fast your confidence, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing
of your hope, firm unto the end,</hi> v. 6.</p>
               <p>There are Two Effects of this serious
and frequent Consideration of Christ.
(1.) We shall know him better; what he
is in himself. (2.) We shall better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
our own Interest in him, what he is
to us; which will mightily raise our
Hope.</p>
               <p>1. We shall know what he is in himself;
I say we shall know this better, the more
frequently and seriously we consider of
him. This was that which raised <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Hope, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 12. I know whom I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and am persuaded he is able to keep
that which I have committed to him. They
that know thy name,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.
9. 10. will trust in thee.</hi> By reflecting often
upon Christ in us, and conversing much
with him, we see further and further into
the Mystery of the Gospel; Christ opens
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98282:56"/>
himself more to us, shines in more clearly
upon us; gives us a fuller discerning of the
deep things of God, which lye at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Covenant; we must dig deep
to find them out. When we set our selves
to it in good earnest, praying the Father to
reveal his Son in us, Christ will further
<hi>manifest himself unto us,</hi> Joh. 14. 21. That
is not spoken of the first saving discovery
of Christ in Conversion, but of a further
Revelation of Christ to a Soul after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
<hi>He that keeps my commandments,
and loves me, to him will I further manifest
my self.</hi> So <hi>v. 23. If a man love me, and
keep my words, we will come unto him, and
make our abode with him.</hi> It is not meant of
his first coming to a Soul in Conversion,
but of an after-Visit that God will give
every Converted Soul who waits for him.
His Spirit shall teach us all things, and
bring all things to our remembrance. The
Spirit seldom makes any Repetition of a
Sermon in our Consciences, but it is with
further light, clearing up matters to us, that
which we did not so well understand before.
When we act our Faith afresh upon any
Gospel-Truth which we have formerly
heard and believed, we grow more expert
in the knowledge of that Truth; we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that by an after-Act of Faith, which
we could not discern by all former Actings
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98282:56"/>
of our Faith: And thus it pleases God to
supply what is wanting in our Faith, and
raise it up by degrees to an higher pitch,
making us to grow and encrease in our
knowledge of Christ, which makes Hope
to grow and encrease in us: We abound
more and more in Hope, the more we know
of Christ.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We shall better understand
our own Interest in him, get a greater As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of that which strengthens our Hope
exceedingly. Whilst we are under doubts
about our Interest in Christ, questioning
our state, our Hope is small, it runs very
low: Our fears being greater than our
Hopes, we are much dejected; there is not
that holy boasting and glorying in God, as
heretofore; the Soul is now under a Cloud,
sits in darkness, sees little or no light. And
it is a great Work of the Spirit of God, as
a Comforter, to revive our Hopes. Faith
may hold out in some Spiritual Reasonings
and Arguings from a bare Promise, when
Hope may fail as to any present comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Influence upon the Soul. Faith may
keep some hold of the Promise, when
Hope is ready to let go the things promised,
or at least, to put them afar off from us.
Tho it is not impossible, yet, saith a droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soul, it seems to me very improbable,
that such an one as I should be saved. Here
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98282:57"/>
is Hope at a very low ebb, labouring under
those Difficulties and seeming Improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that shake us exceedingly: But God
orders the matter so, that a weak Hope
puts us upon labouring after a stronger
Faith. When you find yonr Hopes sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then look to your Faith, for the
fault lies there; raise that, and Hope will
quickly recover it self. By often proving
and examining our selves about our Interest
in Christ, we come to know it more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
to be assured of it. Want of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
doth come from the want of Light in
the Understanding; hence that Phrase, <hi>Col.
2. 2. The full assurance of understanding.</hi>
When we have intire satisfaction in our
Judgment and Understandings, that things
are so and so, we know that <hi>Christ is in us
of a truth.</hi> We had need make good proof
of this, for all depends upon it: It is a
Truth Saints are apt to question, when a
good Work is begun in them, which they
and others take to be Conversion, and
which indeed is so, yet the Devil labours
to persuade them otherwise; puts in many
Exceptions: Tho he knows he cannot
overthrow their state, yet such is his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
he would rob them of the comfort of
it, and hide it from them if he can. He
seeks to blind the minds of men, to keep
out the Light of the Gospel from shining
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98282:57"/>
in upon us; and when it doth shine in, he
raises all the Mists and Fogs he can to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
it; he would fain turn day into night,
and draw a Cloud over that Day-star that
is risen in our hearts; and therefore we had
need have recourse to Christ within us. We
should often have recourse to Christ within
us, look well upon him, and consider him;
comparing Christ in our hearts, with Christ
in the Word; for we may take a false
Christ into our hearts, an Idol instead of
the true Christ; as the <hi>Galatians,</hi> chap. 1. 6.
They had another Gospel quite different
from what <hi>Paul</hi> preached to them: There
was no such Christ, no such Gospel as they
fancied to themselves: They had a wrong
notion of things; thought they must join
something to Christ, did not stick to say,
Unless they were circumcised, they could
not be saved; Christ himself could not save
them without Circumcision. We should
examine our selves about this, Whether our
sole dependance be upon Christ, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we join any thing with him in Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
piecing up a Righteousness partly
from Christ, and partly from our selves. I
am not against Works of Holiness and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Obedience;
but if we do not warily
and wisely distinguish between Faith as
Justifying, and Faith as it orders and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
the Life according to the Rule of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Obedience,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98282:58"/>
we shall run into endless
Disputes, and never understand one another.
Therefore, I say, let us consider whether
or no we rely upon Christ and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
for our Justification in the sight of
God. We should examine the Principle by
which we are carried out to holiness of life
afterward. We may know this by search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our hearts, and putting close Questions
to our selves, Whether our whole Trust
and Confidence be reposed in him alone?
Whether we desire to be found in him, <hi>not
having on our own righteousness?</hi> If we are
clear in this, and can say from the bottom
of our hearts, <hi>None but Christ, None but
Christ,</hi> is the stay and prop of our Souls;
we have nothing else to trust in, or rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
then all our Hope of Eternal Life must
needs flow from him, and be grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him only. Here we fix, and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
from the Hope of the Gospel all
our days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By imploring the help of the
Spirit to shew us those things of Christ
which we read and hear from the Word.
Without this, all our Reasonings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
of Gospel Mysteries will come
to little; we shall not have one right
thought of him; <hi>We are not sufficient of our
selves, as of our selves, to think a good
thought,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. <hi>As of our selves,</hi> i. e.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98282:58"/>
not by our own Wit, Parts, and Learning;
He speaks this chiefly of Ministers. And if
They stand in need of help from God to
guide their Thoughts and Meditations of
Christ, certainly private Christians do.
The Spirit <hi>shall teach you all things,</hi> Joh.
14. 26. <hi>He will guide you into all truth,</hi> John
16. 13. <hi>He shall receive of mine, and shew
it unto you,</hi> v. 15. And therefore when you
set your selves to think of any Gospel-Truth,
be sure you look up to God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
you, and to give you good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of that Truth as it is in Jesus; or
else all your Reading, Hearing, Studying,
Discourse, and Thinking, will come to
nothing.</p>
               <p>The Help of the Spirit lies in Two
Things: (1.) In Teaching. (2.) In Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying.</p>
               <p>1. In Teaching. The Teaching of the
Spirit, and the Testimony of the Spirit,
are Two Things: We are Taught, that
we may Believe; but we <hi>are sealed after
we believe,</hi> Ephes. 1. 13. For the Spirit
bears witness, not only to the Truth of the
Word, but to the Truth of a Work of
Grace in our hearts; and that must be
wrought, before the Spirit can witness to it;
and therefore Sealing comes after Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and is distinguished from it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98282:59"/>
21, 22. <hi>He that anoints us is God, who also
hath sealed us, and given us the earnest of the
Spirit in our hearts. Who also hath sealed
us;</hi> he speaks of it as a distinct thing, as
a further work of God upon the Soul;
first <hi>Anointing,</hi> then <hi>also Sealing, giving us
the Earnest:</hi> There seems to be some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between these Two Phrases, <hi>Sealing,</hi>
and <hi>giving Earnest; who also hath Sealed us,
and given us the Earnest of his Spirit in our
hearts. Sealing</hi> implies bare Assurance; but
the <hi>Earnest</hi> so assures us, as to put part of
the Inheritance into our hand: An <hi>Earnest</hi>
is something in hand; but <hi>Sealing</hi> is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative
Evidence of the Truth and
Certainty of a Thing to the Understanding
only; 'tis all Intellectual.</p>
               <p>I shall first shew you, How we are led
to the Knowledge of Christ in us, by the
Teaching of the Spirit; and then shew,
How we are confirmed in that Knowledg,
by the Testimony of the Spirit; and both
in order to the raising and strengthning our
Hope.</p>
               <p>1. The Spirit shews us Christ within,
formed in our hearts; then teaches us to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
from Christ within us. Consider that
Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. from 10. to 17. and see
what work <hi>Paul</hi> makes of it; how he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
from Christ within; <hi>If Christ be in
you, the body is dead because of sin; but the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98282:59"/>
Spirit is life, because of righteousness. If
the Spirit be in you, then you are assured of
the resurrection of the body. If the Spirit of
Christ be in you, then you are led by the Spirit,
then you know that you are the children of God;
and if children, then heirs, joint-heirs with
Christ, that we may be glorified together.</hi> So
you see he argues up to a lively Hope of
Glory; as if he had said, All this doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follow from Christ being in you:
<hi>He that hath the Son, hath life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 12.
Believers may have Christ, and may have
life in him and by him, and yet not know
that they have it. <hi>These things have I writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to you,</hi> (v. 13.) <hi>that believe in the Name
of the Son of God, that you may know that
ye have eternal life. John</hi> wrote this Epistle
purposely to satisfie weak Believers, that
whatsoever they thought of themselves,
they had Eternal Life, and he would have
them know as much. Put then the Trial
of your state upon this very point, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you have Christ, and in him Eternal
Life: Do you make good the former, and
we who are Ministers of the Gospel, may,
by the Blessing of God undertake to prove
the latter, to your great Comfort and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
<hi>These things have I written to you
that believe, that you may know you have
eternal life.</hi> Then Believers themselves
stand in need of such Writings, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98282:60"/>
as may help to open the Mysteries of
Christ to them; and to this end is a Gospel-Ministry
appointed to make <hi>manifest a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of his knowledg in every place,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.
14, 15. <hi>We are a sweet savour of Christ unto
God, in them that perish under our ministry,</hi>
saith he. We must seek to please God in
our Preaching, and not men, whatever the
issue be. Men have no savour, don't savour
such Sermons and Gospel-Discourses that
do lead them into the Mysteries of the
Gospel; they are for a more Rational way
of Preaching; they love Moral Preaching;
but this Mystical, Mysterious Preaching of
Christ, and Faith in him, and Union to
him, this they count foolishness; they don't
savour it; <hi>but,</hi> saith he, <hi>we are a sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Christ to God, even in them that
perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Spirit doth not only teach us to
know Christ in us, but confirms us in that
knowledge, by an after-Testimony, <hi>bearing
witness with our spirits,</hi> that so it is. This
fixes and settles our minds in a firm persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Truth. Had we no other witness
but our own Spirits, we should vary and
fluctuate in our minds about these great
Points of the Gospel; we should be of one
mind to day, and of another to morrow.
Reason is not always consistent with it self;
varies in its apprehensions of things, argues
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98282:60"/>
                  <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> according to the different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of things, the different Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that contrary Reasonings make
upon our unstable minds; I say, all these
things make Reason very uncertain. Fancy
and Imagination are very uncertain and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable,
and do strongly influence mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings:
It is hard to know whether
Sense or Reason do lead us; but the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spirit of God is a more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Testimony, doth never vary from it
self, always passes the same Judgment
about the same point: It is not <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay;</hi>
it doth not say and unsay, but stands to the
first judgment; it is purposely given to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
of Christ, and of the infallible conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of our Faith in him; which must
needs beget Hope. The oftner we appeal
to this witness, and hear the Testimony of
the Spirit in our hearts concerning Christ,
the more are we confirmed in our Faith and
Hope. They who are full of the Holy
Ghost, they are full of Faith and Hope.
When we have found out Christ within us,
we should appeal to the Spirit of God,
Whether it be not so indeed? Whether
Christ be not in us of a Truth? None knows
the Son, but the Father; and it is by his
Spirit he reveals him in us. Ask the Spirit
then, Whether this be the Christ of God,
which your Faith hath taken hold of, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98282:61"/>
brought into your Soul, to Live, Rule, and
Reign there. Did we live in more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Holy Ghost, we could not
be so much estranged from the Life of
Christ, we should not be so unacquainted
with Christ. No man can say, <hi>That Jesus
is the Lord,</hi> but by the Spirit. Say what
you will of Christ, you understand not
what you say, till the Spirit reveal him in
you. There is no thinking, talking, no
meditating on Christ in our own Light and
Strength, if the Holy Ghost doth not help
us. Believers have a sense of this, that God
hath taught them, and shined into their
hearts; it is in his Light they see Light,
and have a true Spiritual Discerning of the
Mystery of God in Christ. You know in
the first days of the Gospel, the Spirit bore
witness unto the Divine Person of Christ,
<hi>That he came from God, and was God;</hi> for
the world could believe neither, <hi>John</hi> 15.
26, 27. comp. with <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 32. It was the
great business of the Spirit, I say, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to the world, That Christ was sent of
God, and that he was very God. This the
Holy Ghost did by many signs, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
effects of the Divine Power of Christ,
wrought through Faith in his Name. And
so ever since, the same Spirit breathing in
the Consciences of Believers, doth testifie
of Christ in them, with that Evidence and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98282:61"/>
Power, that they cannot withstand, they
are convinced and satisfied, That Salvation
is only by him; and that relying upon him,
their Souls are secured to all Eternity. This
begets Peace in their (before affrightned)
Consciences.</p>
               <p>If you ask, how doth the Holy Ghost
bring over the Mind of a man, to be so
fully persuaded of the truth of that which
Flesh and Blood cannot reveal unto him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Answer;</hi> The Holy Ghost doth this as
a Spirit of Power, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 49. Christ is
said to Teach us as one having Authority:
There is Power and Authority, as well as
Teaching, Reasoning and Objective light.
I say, the Spirit acts as a Spirit of Power,
impressing a sense of God's Love so upon
our Hearts, that we cannot but count upon
it, rejoyce in it, feeling it shed abroad into
our Hearts. The Testimony of the Spirit,
is a convincing, undeniable Evidence,
able to persuade of the truth of that he
bears witness to, against all surmises of
Flesh and Blood. Were not the Spirit of
Christ, a Spirit of Power, it would be
impossible he should ever establish such a
a Doctrine, so contrary to all the sentiments
of Nature, and to all rational Inferences
men can make from any principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The Spirit comes as a Spirit of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98282:62"/>
will have the Heart open, will bring
over Man to assent, though it be to what
his Understanding cannot reach; and this
the Spirit of God doth, by particular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the Blood of Christ to us by
Name; so revealing Christ in us, that we
cannot but feel the Virtue of his Blood in
our Conscience, cannot but know him,
and own him as our Jesus. In all Hope
there is a peculiar Application of Promises
to our selves; <hi>He that believes, hath eternal
Life, John</hi> 3. 36. Is not only persuaded
there is such a thing, but that he hath it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
begun in him, and shall be further
let into it ere long; <hi>We shall be like him,</hi>
1 John 3. 2. <hi>We shall be made heirs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the hope of eternal life,</hi> Tit. 3. 7. <hi>For
the hope which is laid up for you,</hi> Col. 1. 5.
There is a particular Application to our
selves, of those things we Hope for. It
is impossible for a man to Hope, and be no
way concerned in his Hope; it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to leave himself quite out of his Hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Christ in you, be your hope of Glory;</hi>
Then look upon him as the only sure bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
and foundation of all your Hopes,
you will prize him the more: We natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
love and esteem that which gives us
hope of any goood coming towards us.
The Reason why Christ is so little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so lightly set by, is because men are
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98282:62"/>
afraid they shall be losers by him: <hi>Go and
sell all, and follow me;</hi> this is an hard saying
to such as understand not the gain of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
the excellency of Christ, that he is
able to do more for them, than all the
World can. <hi>Paul</hi> was so persuaded, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 37. Nothing could separate him
from the Love of God in Christ Jesus;
<hi>Neither life nor death, nor all evils that it
was possible for men and devils to bring upon
him: In all these things,</hi> saith he, <hi>we are
more than conquerors.</hi> As if he had said, we are
so far from being losers, that we are great
gainers, come off with advantage. <hi>Thanks
be to God, who hath given us the victory,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. 57. <hi>Thanks be to God who also
causes us to triumph in Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 14.
<hi>Thus he overcomes the world, who believes
Jesus is the Son of God,</hi> 1 John 5. 4, 5.
<hi>Quenches all the fiery darts of the wicked one,</hi>
Eph. 6. 16. <hi>Overcomes by the blood of the
Lamb,</hi> Rev. 12. 11.</p>
               <p>But after all this, If any should Object
and say, We cannot rejoyce in this Hope of
Glory by Christ; we cannot bring our
hearts under the Power of this Hope,
as you have been persuading us to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Answer;</hi> You cannot, but God can; God
by his Spirit of Power, can do this in you,
and upon you. We have a cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
to this, in all those Saints in former
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98282:63"/>
Ages, who have gone Triumphing to
Heaven in a Joyful Hope and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Eternal Glory; and you will find it
so in your selves, when the Spirit of God
comes upon you, as a Spirit of Power.
Let me tell you, The impressions of the
Spirit, are strange things, till you come
under them; then you feel the powerful
effects of them in your own Souls; will see
that done which you thought could never
have been done; find that made easy to you,
which you thought was impossible. And thus
it will be when you are begotten again to a
lively Hope. Many Professors have a dead
Hope of Eternal Life and Glory, which
make no impression upon them; but a
lively Hope, hath lively Effects that will
be felt.</p>
               <p>It may be you will further Object, and
say, It is true, there are some who have
this Hope, and this Joy; But may not
all this be a Delusion upon false Grounds?</p>
               <p>All I shall say in Answer, is this: I wish
you would make the same Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
your Worldly Hopes, as you do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Christian Hope; I am sure you
have more cause. How prone are men to
Object against the Hope of the Gospel?
And how willing are men to be flattering
themselves with all Worldly Hopes! they
follow them, are mightily pleased with
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98282:63"/>
them, they all run well, and are well
founded. But this Hope of Glory by Jesus
Christ, that is an ignote thing, they know
not what to make of it. Look to it,
Those who are willing to nourish vain
Hopes now, will have Hope little enough
ere long; they will be Punished with
Everlasting Despair in Hell. But alas!
with what confidence and security do Men
Hope in the Creature! but with what
trepidation and doubtfulness do some
Trembling Souls Hope in Christ! Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
their Reason might instruct their
Faith, to argue otherwise from Gospel
Principles, the consequence of which,
Sanctifi'd Reason may discern, and ought
to attend unto: You find a Thousand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in every Age of such whose World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Hopes have disappointed them, and made
them ashamed: But never since the World
began, could there be one Instance produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of any Believer, whose Hope in Christ
hath made him ashamed: It is strange that
we should rejoyce so much under that
Hope, which seldom or never answers our
expectation; and be so much cast down
and dispirited under those Hopes of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that never fail: I wish you would but
ask your selves the Reason of this: It is a
sign we are rather Carnal than Spiritual,
and savour more the things of this Earth,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98282:64"/>
than the things of Heaven. It is a shame to
think how little Influence this Hope of
Glory hath upon us. We usually count
our selves the better for our Hopes; but it
seems the Hope of Glory adds little to us;
we lay it by, as that which speaks of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to come, a great while hence, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, we know not when; we cannot
get our minds to attend to it, and look for
the accomplishment of it. And thus we
bereave our selves of much good, by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Hope to languish, as it will do, if
we don't take comfort in it, and daily solace
our selves with the thoughts of it. To think
of our Hopes, is enough to revive us at any
time, especially when we count them sure
and certain.</p>
               <p>I know not whence it is, but you may
observe many Christians to be more in the
Exercise of Faith and Love, than of Hope.
We reverence the Word, and dare not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
that, when we are under little or
no Hope of what is promised to us in the
Word. A little Fear drowns our Hope:
We believe the Truth of the Promises, but
in modesty suspend the application of them
to our selves; as if it were a piece of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
to Believe much, and Hope but little.
<hi>God is good, and gracious, and faithful,</hi> saith
the drooping Soul; here is Faith: <hi>But I am
unworthy, I am less than the least of all his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98282:64"/>
mercies,</hi> unfit to receive any thing at his
hand: Thus by sinking our Hope, we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
weaken our Faith; for a weak Faith
doth always follow a languid Hope; the
Promises will grow out of credit with us,
when in an affected Despondency we hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
our selves too much, in refusing our
own Mercies. It would make our hearts
ake, if God should take us at our word, and
say, Because you will not have this or that
Mercy, you shall not have it; because you
will not have life by applying this and that
Promise to your selves, I reverse it, call it
in, declare, you shall never have that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
I say, it would make our hearts ake, if
God should take us at our word, when in a
froward, sullen fit of Despondency. It is a
slight to his rich Grace, to be so shy of it,
to take but little, when much is offered.
Express then the greatness of your Faith,
by the greatness of your Hope. As God
hath abounded, yea, superabounded in his
Grace towards you, so do you abound more
and more in your Hope in him. Faith is
but a Notion, a mere empty Speculation,
when the good things of the Promise are
not brought down to our selves, by a lively
Hope; <hi>that we may taste and see how gracious
the Lord is:</hi> We never suck the sweet of a
Promise till then. Therefore judge of your
Faith by your Hope, and judge of your
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98282:65"/>
Hope by your Faith; Whether it be well
grounded upon the Word; if it be, it can
never rise too high; otherwise Hope is an
aspiring Passion, and usually flies too high,
when it is not fixed upon a right Object;
the Soul is overset by it. How are some
men intoxicated and drunk with their vain
hopes? There is no fear of any such excess
in true Christian Hope. No man was ever
questioned by God for having too much
Grace; we may all complain of too little:
More Grace, is the constant Desire of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
holy Soul; as there is a Propensity in
God to give it; <hi>To him that hath, more shall
be given:</hi> God loves to accumulate his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
to load us with his Benefits; he gives
liberally, that he may draw out our Hope
to follow him for more and more still. <hi>Let
us then abound in Hope, holding fast our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
firm unto the End.</hi>

                  <head>The Coherence.</head>
                  <p>Because the sense of the Text depends very
much upon what goes before in this and
the 7<hi>th</hi> Chapter; therefore I shall give you a
brief <hi>Analysis</hi> of both these Chapters, down
to the very Words of the Text.</p>
                  <p>In these two Chapters there are hot Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes
and Contests between Christ and the
<hi>Jews,</hi> about the Divinity of his Person, and
the Truth of his Doctrine; Christ main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
both.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the 7<hi>th</hi> Chapter, Christ
and his Brethren have a consultation about
his going up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to the Feast of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,
which was at hand, <hi>verse</hi> 2. The
Point they deliberate upon was this, <hi>viz.</hi>
Whether he should go up at the beginning
of the Feast; his Brethren who did not yet
believe in him, <hi>verse</hi> 5. were for it, tho up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
very slight grounds, <hi>vers.</hi> 3, 4. Christ is
against it, refuses to go then, <hi>verse</hi> 8. <hi>I go
not yet unto this feast, but go ye;</hi> I will go
when I see my time; <hi>my time is not yet full
come,</hi> vers. 8. Christ knew the proper sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and moments for every part of his
Work; so he sends 'em away, but himself
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98282:67"/>
                     <hi>abode still in Galilee,</hi> vers. 9. Upon this,
there were great Enquiries after Christ,
where he was, and why he was not there?
This occasioned a <hi>murmuring among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
concerning him,</hi> verse 12. About the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Feast <hi>Jesus</hi> appears among 'em,
Teaching in the Temple to the admiration
of all that heard him, <hi>vers.</hi> 14, 15. The
Points of Doctrine that he there handles,
with his Answers to all their Cavils and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
I shall for brevity sake omit; you
may read 'em in that Chapter, from the
16<hi>th.</hi> to the 37<hi>th verse;</hi> so ends his Sermon
at the midst of the Feast.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 37. He begins another Sermon at
the end of the Feast, for the Feast lasted
Eight days; and in the last day, that great
day of the Feast, wherein there used to be
the greatest Assemblies, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 36 <hi>On the
eighth day shall be a holy Convocation, a solemn
Assembly:</hi> And upon this day, that the
people might have something to meditate
on by the way, and to carry home with
'em, Christ pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aches an excellent Sermon
about Spiritual Water <hi>vers.</hi> 37 38, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which had different effects upon his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
some believed, and some believed not;
as it was then, so it is now.</p>
                  <p>The Feast being over, Christ continues
Preaching in the same place; you have him
early in the morning, <hi>teaching the people in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98282:67"/>
the Temple,</hi> Chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. 2. But the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Pbarisees</hi> purposely to interrupt his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
put an ensnaring question to him, about
a woman taken in the very Act of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
what his Judgment was concerning
her, Whether she should be put Death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law in that case, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 10.
How he managed himself in acquitting
the Woman, to the Shame and Conviction
of all his Opposers, I refer to your own
reading, from the 1<hi>st.</hi> verse of this 8<hi>th.</hi>
Chapter, to the 12<hi>th.</hi> verse. Having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
that business, he falls to Preaching
again, of many weighty and very useful
Points, suited to the present condition of
his Auditors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> He preaches himself to be the
true <hi>light of the world,</hi> vers. 12. which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
a long Dispute between him and
the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> about the validity of that
Testimony which he gave of himself;
Christ vindicates both himself and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and proves both to be from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
'Tis observable, how in the close of
one Point, Christ gives occasion for another,
which he knew their Objections would lead
him into (<hi>vers</hi> 32, 33.) about Spiritual
Freedom, declaring what that is; and that
the <hi>Jews</hi> had not yet attained to it, because
they were the servants of sin, <hi>vers.</hi> 34. in
bondage to their own Corruptions and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98282:68"/>
Lusts; this he urges close upon 'em, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their vain-glorious boasting
of their descent from <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
my Text comes in upon this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
I shall give you some account of
it. The <hi>Jews</hi> to prove themselves to be
Freemen, and never in bondage, alledge
that <hi>they were Abraham's seed,</hi> vers. 33.
They said, <hi>Abraham was their father,</hi> v. 39.
and <hi>God was their father,</hi> ver. 41. Christ
denies both, and says the Devil was their
Father, which he proves by their contempt
of him and his Doctrine, as more at large
appears in this Chapter. The Sum of all
is this; <hi>viz.</hi> They vainly pretend to an
Interest in God, who dishonour the Son of
God; it is my Father that honoureth me;
<hi>Of whom ye say he is your God, yet ye have not
known him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> I shall make good the Words of
our Saviour against the <hi>Jews,</hi> and prove,
That they knew not God, because they
knew not Christ the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>God cannot be savingly known, but as
he hath revealed himself in Christ. God
hath revealed himself to the <hi>Jews</hi> in his
word, not only as the Creator of Heaven
and Earth, and as that God who brought
them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (so they knew him);
but that he intended to send his Son into
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98282:68"/>
the world, the Seed of the Woman to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
Man. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 17.
Had the <hi>Jews</hi> believed this, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have treated Christ so scornfully, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Where is thy Father?</hi> v. 19. Such a
spiritual Redeemer they looked not for,
they thought the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be some
Temporal Prince, who should come of some
Noble Family, with great attendance, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with Power and Strength to deliver
them from the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoak; to restore the
people to their Liberties, to enlarge his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over other Nations, keeping up the
<hi>Mosaical</hi> Polity every where; they never
dreamed that the Son of God was to come in
man's Nature to dye for Sinners, to bring
in a new Everlasting Righteousness and
Life; though all this was foretold in the
Old-Testament, yet they did not so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it. All outward deliverances
promised to the <hi>Jews,</hi> were through
Christ. So to unbelieving <hi>Ahaz, Isa.</hi> 7.
14. All Mercies promised to the <hi>Jews,</hi> hung
upon the Kingdom of <hi>David,</hi> which point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Christ. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 3, 4,
5, 6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 22, 23. and <hi>Ezek</hi> 37. 25, &amp;c.
All the hope of <hi>Israel</hi> in all Ages, was repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Christ only: <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 9. &amp;c. <hi>Amos</hi>
9. 11. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Gospel being first to be Preached to
the <hi>Jews,</hi> Christ ceased not to Preach to

them; notwithstanding all their scorn and
contempt of Him and his Doctrine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by their Contumelious words, and
wicked attempts to take away his Life.
<hi>They took up stones and cast at him,</hi> v. 59.</p>
                  <p>'Tis evident that the greatest part of the

is strange! They knew there was a God,

but not according to the Gospel; therefore

know God, they are said not to know
him. But,</p>

1. <hi>Obs.</hi> Many do pretend to an Interest
in the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as their God and
Father, who yet know him not.</p>
                  <p>As there were many carnal <hi>Israelites</hi> of
old, who had a form of knowledg in the
Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 20. So there are many
formal Christians now, who have a form
of knowledg according to the Letter of the
Gospel, and yet do not truly know God in
Christ Jesus. Many call God their God
and Father, whom he will never own for
his true Children. God owns none for his
Children, who do not own Christ for his
Son, carrying it towards him accordingly:
Our relation to God as Children, springs
from our relation to Christ the Son of God;
our union to Christ by Faith, proves our
adoption; but whilst we are without
Christ, <hi>we are looked upon as aliens and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
as without God in the world,</hi> Eph. 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>I shall include all that I have further to
say from this Text, in this general observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s.</hi> A right saving Knowledge of
God, is only in and through Christ: We
cannot know God unto Salvation any other
way.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Analysis</hi> of these two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the coherence of the Text with
the Context it plainly appears by these
words of our Saviour to the <hi>Jews,</hi> That
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98282:70"/>
none do truly know God the Father, who
do not acknowledg Christ to be the Son of
God.</p>
                  <p>All the saving Knowledge we have of
God, is from the Knowledge Christ hath
of God, who lying in the bosom of the
Father, hath declared him to us, <hi>John</hi> 1.
18. <hi>John</hi> 14. 9.</p>
                  <p>We ought not to speak any thing of God,
but what he has said of himself in his
word: Theology is the Doctrine of God
concerning himself, concerning his works
and his will.</p>
                  <p>Christ, as man, was ignorant of some
things, and knew no more than the Father
revealed to him. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 32. so <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.
16, 17. <hi>My doctrine, says he, is not mine,
but his that sent me; 'tis of God, I speak not
of my self,</hi> or from my self, but as I hear.
<hi>John</hi> 5. 30. So he received the Revelation
from the Father, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
                  <p>As our Knowledge of God flows from
the Knowledge Christ has of God; So
our Knowledge of Christ is from himself.
<hi>John.</hi> 14. 21. As he does by his Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
himself to us, so he doth reveal the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to us in himself. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>John</hi>
6. 46. No man hath seen God at any time,
no not <hi>Moses</hi> himself hath seen the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but had all from Christ, who gave
the Law upon the Mount, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:98282:70"/>
Whatever Notices there may be in the
minds of men, of a Deity, yet they
know not God aright without faith in
Christ.</p>
                  <p>Saving Knowledge, is that by which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the right way of a sinners salvation
by Christ; or it's the Knowledge that shews
us what we must do to be saved. A convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
sinner is at a great loss about his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
till God open to him the Mystery of
his free Grace in Christ, giving him thereby
the Knowledge of Salvation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 7.</p>
                  <p>God's love is towards the Elect, before
they know him, but it is not in them till
they know him; then they understand how
they are beloved of God; his love is shed
abroad in their Hearts, Rom. 5. 5. <hi>'Tis in
them:</hi> John 17. 26. <hi>And I in them;</hi> Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for them, but in them; before we knew
God or Christ, Christ had suffered for us,
interceded for us; but before Faith, he is not
said to be in us: <hi>i. e.</hi> Not to live in us by his
Spirit, that we may live to God, <hi>Gal.</hi>
2. 20.</p>
                  <p>This Saving Knowledge of God, which
I am now speaking of, is not the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his Essence, but of his Grace,
Love, and Good-Will towards us in Christ,

1. 19, 20. This Natural Philosophical
knowledge of God, though it be not
sufficient to Save us, yet 'tis sufficient to
Damn us; to render us inexcusable, and
consequently to justifie our Damnation. It

Power of God, i. e.</hi> In the irresistible effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of his Grace: Though all Natural men

them at last; takes away all final prevailing
resistance, <hi>turning the heart of stone into a

Malice, and Pride.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gentiles</hi> knew God by the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but not by the Scriptures, forbidding
inward Lust and Concupiscence, which

2. All that may be known of God out
of Christ, is better known in and by
Christ: By Reason we know that the
World was made, but by Faith we know
it more certainly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3. The light of
Nature gathers up something from the
Works of God, but Faith gathers up more
from the Word of God; the Word speaks
more distinctly than the Works of God
do; these hold forth something of God in
the general Notion of a Deity, but leave
us in the dark where to find out this God:
They speak out God to our Reason, by
some remote consequences, leading us up
to a first cause, and in a discursive way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
us of the Being of a God; but few
men have such Logical heads, as to keep
themselves under the power of these reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
they are apt ever and anon, to sink
at last into practical Atheism: He is a
Practical Atheist, who does not order his
life according to those inward speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he has of God. The Word holds forth
God more powerfully, and directly to our
Faith, shewing us that God in Christ,
which it speaks of: Since in the Wisdom
of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the Fabrick of Heaven
and Earth, setting forth the Wisdom of
God, the World cannot by all its Wit and
Wisdom, comfortably know God unto
Salvation, therefore he calls us to Faith in
Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21.</p>

               <p>His Pardoning Grace, which as Sinners,
we are most of all concerned to know; all
other Attributes of God make against us,
without the knowledge of this, which
makes all to be for us. The way of a
Sinners Salvation, is no where revealed,
but in Christ; the last word the Law
speaks, is Death, <hi>in the day thou eatest, thou
shalt dye,</hi> and so leaves us under that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
till the day of Execution.</p>
               <p>The Devils knew God, without a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and therefore tremble, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 19.
The <hi>Gentiles</hi> knew God, but not in Christ,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. The <hi>Jews</hi> knew God as the
Creator of the World, as their Deliverer
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as the founder of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
but not as the Father of
Christ, the true Messiah: All this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God out of Christ, does represent
him to us only as our Judge; which leads
a Sinner to utter Despair, overwhelms
him with a sense of God's Wrath. 'Tis
only in Christ that we look upon God as a
Saviour, freely pardoning all our Sins:
This Pardoning Grace flows down to us
only through Christ, <hi>In whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
through his blood, even the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of sins,</hi> Col. 1. 14. <hi>Being justified

freely by his grace, through the redemption
that is in Jesus Christ: whom God hath set
forth to be ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>opitiation through Faith in his
blood, to deelare his righteousness for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins that are past, through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 24, 25. <hi>This is a
faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. <hi>Who hath saved us,
and called ws with a holy calling: Not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our works, but according to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and grace, which was given us in Christ
Jesus, before the world began; But is now
made manifest, by the appearing of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death,
and hath brought life and immortality to light
through the Gospel,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9, 10. From
all these Texts it plainly appears, that God
never had a thought from all Eternity of
Pardoning Sinners, but only in and
through Christ; and what applications
we have made, and do make every day
unto God in the Name of Christ for
the Pardon of Sin, does highly concern
every one of us seriously to consider. This
hidden Mystery of Gods Pardoning
Grace, unknown to the World before,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13 35. is revealed to us in and by
Christ, <hi>being intimate with the Father, even
in his bosom,</hi> Joh. 1. 18. <hi>And what he hath
seen and heard, that he testifieth,</hi> John 3. 32.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98282:73"/>
Let us receive his Testimony, and set to
our seal that God is true, and will never
pardon any who believe not in Jesus The
end of his Coming into the World in our
Nature, was to manifest the Name of
God to his Elect, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 6. to tell us all
things relating to our salvation, <hi>Joh. 4. 25.
Therefore let us hear him,</hi> Mat. 17. 5. by
Christ Angels have a clearer knowledge of
God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 1. He is seen of Angels as
the Redeemer of the World, and he only
gives us understanding of those truths that
lead unto Eternal Life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>He
is the way, the truth, and the life; no man
comes unto the Father but by him,</hi> Joh. 14. 6.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>What it is to know God in Christ:</hi> Of
this only in general, to make way to the
last Head, which I shall more enlarge
upon.</p>
               <p>He that knows Christ to be God, knows
God in Christ; this needs no proof.
But what is it know Christ to be God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> To own him to be the Eternal
Son of God. When do we own him as
such? <hi>Ans.</hi> when we acknowledge him
to be <hi>indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the
world,</hi> Joh. 4. 42. Trusting in him for the
Pardon of Sin. <hi>Jer. 31. 34. They shall all
know me, from the least to the greatest, saith
the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity,
and I will remember their sin no more.</hi> Till
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98282:74"/>
we know God, to be a God of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
casting our selves by Faith upon
Christ, for the pardon of <hi>our</hi> Sins, we do
not savingly know the Lord.</p>
               <p>To know, in the sense of the Text, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in it, Faith, Love, and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Faith in the Truth, Love to the
Truth, and a hearty Approbation of the
Truth which we profess to know; testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all this, by our ready subjection and
obedience to it. As to know, is to love
and approve, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 6. So not to know,
is to disallow, to disown, to disapprove,
to hate that which I do; I allow not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. I know not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
know not, because I allow not, I
hate it: So the Lord said to the foolish
Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 12. <hi>I know you not, i. e.</hi>
I do refuse, reject, and condemn you. So
<hi>Joh.</hi> 17 25. The World is said not to know

               <p>This saving-knowledge of God in Christ

light of Faith, discerning the God-head
of Christ; and therefore inclining us
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98282:74"/>
to trust in the Merits of his Precious Blood,
for the Pardon of all our Sins. 'Tis a very
gross corrupt Interpretation of that Text,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 16. that the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines
give, <hi>Tho we have known Christ after the
flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.
i. e.</hi> say they, in favour of their Ubiquity,
Tho we have known him as a Body circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
and limited to a certain place while
on earth, yet since his Ascention, we know
him so no more; but suppose a Corporeal
Ubiquity by virtue of his Divine Glorified
Person; which is in effect to deny the
Truth of his Human Nature, by ascribing
that to it, which is altogether inconsistent
with it.</p>
               <p>The Apostle's meaning is plainly this,
<hi>Henceforth know we no man after the flesh,</hi> i. e.
I and all true Believers since our Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
bear no affection, no carnal worldly
respect to any man living. Tho once we
knew Christ after the flesh, <hi>i. e.</hi> as the
world knew him by his outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
only, slighting and condemning that
in him, in his state of Humiliation, which
the world so much despised. Then we
looked upon him as a mere Man, as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor
worthy of death; therefore we
blasphemed him, and persecuted all his
Followers: This was the sense of the flesh:
But now we look upon him in the Light of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98282:75"/>
the Spirit, as the Son of God, who died to
save us from our sins.</p>
               <p>They counted <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ministry inferior to
that of the other Apostles, because he had
not conversed with Christ on earth. What
tho, says <hi>Paul,</hi> I have not known him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the flesh, as you have, who boast much
of this, That you knew his Parents, his
Brethren and Sisters, where he was born
and bred, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Yet I spiritually know him
by Faith, as the Redeemer of the world,
tho I have not known him after the flesh,
as you have; neither do I desire henceforth
so to know him; <hi>i. e.</hi> to account of him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to any mere human Endowments,
or outward worldly Circumstances; but I
judge of him according to his Divine, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Excellencies, and so I admire
and magnifie him.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>We know Christ no more
after the flesh,</hi> flesh here is not taken for the
substance of the flesh, but for the quality,
or natural Passions of his Human body,
being liable to all those natural, yet sin-less
Infirmities of Human Flesh: He was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
athirst, weary, <hi>a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with griefs:</hi> 'Tis not said, we
know no more the flesh of Christ, but <hi>we
know no more Christ after the flesh;</hi> i. e. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that mean, outward appearance
he made in the world, in his state of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98282:75"/>
Our thoughts run higher now, to
Christ glorified in Heaven, in our Nature.
These words, <hi>Not to know Christ any more
after the flesh,</hi> must not be taken in <hi>Serve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s
sense, as if the Human Nature of
Christ were now quite swallowed up by
the Divine; as if Christ had now put off his
Human Body, and was turned into a Spirit.
This overthrows the whole Foundation of
Christian Religion.</p>
               <p>Tho the Papists many of 'em seem to be
against the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Ubiquity, yet 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
That neither the Doctrine of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
nor Transubstantiation, can
possibly stand without a Corporal Ubiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and therefore both must fall to the
ground, as having no foundation in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>The Apostle's meaning is, That we
don't know Christ now, according to the
sense of the flesh, but by a Divine Spiritual
Knowledge, as New Creatures. <hi>Vers. 17.
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new
creature.</hi>

               <p>WHat that Saving Knowledge of God
in Christ, that every new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. True Religion flows from, and is
grounded upon a right Knowledge of the
True God.</p>
               <p>2. A Religion without a God, is a very
strange unaccountable thing, no reason can
be given for it.</p>
               <p>3. A man without a God, is a very lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
solitary Creature, he would not know
what to do with himself under extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
difficulties and distresses, if he had
not a God to go unto, and to rely upon.</p>
               <p>4. Man by Nature is a devout Creature,
he will have a God, and a Religion; he
hath a Conscience, and therefore he must
have a God, and a Religion of some sort
or other.</p>
               <p>5. Man by Nature is prone to Idolatry,
grossly mistaken in the choice of his God.</p>

6. Many of the more civilized sober Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,

in general Notions of a Deity; when they
don't know God himself, they don't know
him who is God.</p>
               <p>My Text leads me to speak of <hi>The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God in Christ;</hi> if what I shall say
be not so plain and easie as you would have
it: Pray remember that I am speaking of
that <hi>great mystery of godliness, God manifest

Yet I hope (through the guidance
of the Spirit of God) what I shall deliver
upon this high Subject, will fall in with
the Conceptions of your Faith, and with
the Spiritual Apprehensions of an Enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

these Three Things:

                     <item>That God manifest in the Flesh of

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Knowledge of God, in the Person of
Christ.</head>
               <p>WHat this Personal Knowledge of
God in Christ is, I shall explain.
We conceive God to be a distinct Being
from all created Beings; above all, beyond
all, and before all; the only <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the
Great Essentiator, who is an Eternal Being
himself, and gives Being to all other things;
this God we cannot see with our bodily
eyes, but with the eyes of a mind spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enlightned we may; <hi>i. e.</hi> we may see
him by an eye of Faith, conceiving him to
be all that which he hath revealed himself
to be in Christ. Till we see God in the
Person of Christ the Mediator, we have no
certain Object for our Faith to fix upon;
our natural Notions of God will never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us to any Person who is God; the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
only lead us to Christ, as the Son of
God: The Person of the Father and of
the Holy-Ghost, are invisible; but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Person hath made himself visible, by
taking our Nature upon him, and is the
only True Visible Image of the Invisible
God: He is God-Man; which signifies
not Two Personalities, but Two Natures
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98282:77"/>
united in One Divine Person: The Person
of Christ Incarnate is Divine, tho many
in the days of his flesh here, saw his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who did not own his Divinity; they
saw him who was God, but did not own
him to be God; 'tis Saving Knowledge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that gives us a true sight of God in
Christ; we never see him till then: God
in Christ, is God indeed; all other repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of God, do change his Glory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a lye; they are all idols and vanities: <hi>The
Heathens became vain in their imaginations,
multiplying gods to themselves;</hi> but never
agreed who was the only true God. Christ
said to the <hi>Jews,</hi> vers. 19. <hi>Ye neither know
me, nor my Father; if ye had known me, ye
should have known my Father also;</hi> because
the Will of the Father concerning the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Sinners, is revealed by Christ.</p>
               <p>To believe the Being of a God, That
there is a God, and to believe in God, are
two things: The light of Nature leads to
the former, but not to the latter; because
we must have a particular, distinct Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> of him in particular,
who is God, the only True, Living, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
God; we must know his Name, his
Attributes, his Power, Wisdom, Infinite
Love and Mercy: We must be able to
prove all this from Divine Revelation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we can have sufficient ground for our
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98282:78"/>
Faith and Hope in him; to believe we
know not why, in we know not whom,
is not Faith, but fond Credulity; this way
we render Faith a very irrational thing;
a mere fancy: We cannot prove the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God, but by the Almighty Acts
and Works of God; we believe him to be
God, for his Works sake, which the Word
gives us so full an account of. 'Tis strange
to see what a slight Knowledg of God men
do rest in, reposing so great a trust as they
pretend to do, in one whom they know
not whether he be able to answer that trust;
they worship they know not whom; they
trust they know not whom: Tho they own
God, whoever he be, to be Almighty, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in Wisdom, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they chuse
a God for themselves, who is none of all
this, and so deceive themselves. General
Notions of Infinite Power, Wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
unless we see where to place them, and to
whom they do belong, are but empty spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
no sufficient ground for our
Faith. Christ has outdone all that ever
were called gods; and therefore he only
deserves that Name, who has in himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
the true God to us; all the Idols of
the world are vanities.</p>
               <p>The Son of God hath made himself vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
by taking our flesh upon him, and
through that veil we look in upon the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98282:78"/>
whole Trinity, and know all that is called
God in Christ Jesus: <hi>He that hath seen me,
hath seen the Father,</hi> John 14. 9. hath seen
the Infinite Power of that Holy Spirit put
forth by me.</p>
               <p>No mere Creature holds forth two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but the Person of Christ does, and
therefore is the only Image of the Invisible
God, holding forth all that is contained in
the Infinite Essence of the Divine Nature,
truly representing God in all his Essential
Properties, as God and his Father. Christ
is properly the Image of the Father, not of
the God-head, for that is really in him, he
is <hi>very God:</hi> The thing it self cannot be
said to be the Image of it self; Christ
and the Father are one in the Essence of the
God-head. <hi>I and my father are one,</hi> John
10. 30. But Christ is not the same Person
with him whose Image he is: When Christ
is said to be the Image of God, God is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
personally for the Father, not essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the Divine Nature: I am not now
speaking of the Characteristical Differences
of the Three Persons, but of the Unity of
Essence in which they all agree: <hi>These
three are one:</hi> If you would know what
manner of God, the Father is, you must
look upon Christ his Image, and conceive
of him according to that manifestation of
himself in the Flesh of Christ, who has
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98282:79"/>
in that very flesh expressed and acted over
all the Divine Attributes of God, in the
Miracles he wrought upon earth, letting
out a Divine Power through our humane
Nature, acting as God in our flesh: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of God's Glory appears in the Works
of Creation, but the Brightness of his
Glory shines out only in the Face of
Christ; as men are known by their faces,
so God is known by Christ: God having
in an ineffable manner communicated his
Essence to Christ, he is therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
the <hi>express image of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi>
As he holds forth the Glory of God to
us, he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>brightness
of his glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that Divine Person, upon whom
the eye of our Faith must be fixed; I say
the eye of our Faith, because many who
looked upon Christ with their bodily eyes
when he was upon Earth, saw the man
Christ, but saw not God in that man;
Nay, they Crucified him as a Blasphemer,
for saying he was God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> How can we now see God in the

Who shall Ascend into Heaven after him?</p>

                  </gap>), discern God now in the
Person of Christ since his Ascension, as
they could who were present with him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98282:79"/>
Earth; for they could not discern his
Godhead, but by Faith, and so may we
now. But you will further</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> We cannot see his Person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Not with our bodily Eyes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would that help us to discern his God-head,
if we could so see him with our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
eyes, unless the Father did inwardly
reveal him, and this he does now to his
Saints, as well as then; then he did convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly
reveal the God-head of Christ, in
the Person of Christ livingupon Earth, now
he does reveal the same God-head of Christ,
in the same Person of Christ, though not
as living upon Earth, but as represented to
us in the word, and living now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>We must consider Christ, as held forth
in the word, it's enough that he was once
upon Earth, and that we have such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Character of him; such a full authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
description of the Person of Christ In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,
and of his coming again, left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
record in the Scriptures, the word is
nigh thee, act your faith upon that, and
you will quickly have a spiritual discerning
of God in Christ. You cannot believe all
that the Scripture says of Christ, but you
must believe him to be God, the very Son
of God, by eternal Generation from the
Father; and if you believe this, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98282:80"/>
but believe the eternal Procession of the
Spirit from them both. How can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a living eternal Father, and a living
eternal Son, without a living eternal Spirit?
The account the Scriptures give of the
Son of God incarnate, is ground enough
for our Faith to fix upon; set but your Faith
a-work upon Christ, and you'l quickly
have a spiritual sight of God in him; Faith
will observe that in Christ, that speaks out
his Godhead; 'twill spy out such Rays and
Beams of Divine Majesty, shining out in
his Person, that will create in us a holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
towards him, and cause us to fall
down and worship him.</p>
               <p>Though Christ be Personally Ascended,
yet he is Spiritually present with us, and in
us; faith knows how in the light of
the word, to follow him up to Heaven, to
sit down in Heavenly places by him, and
to keep up a constant Communion with
him.</p>
               <p>As Christ was in Heaven as God, when
he was upon Earth as Man, <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. So,
tho now he is contained in Heaven as Man,
yet he fills both Earth and Heaven as God:
Tho his finite Humane Nature cannot co-extend
it self to an Ubiquity, to reach as
far as the Divine, yet the Two Natures in
Christ are always hypostatically united;
and tho the Divine Nature do act in, with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98282:80"/>
and through the Humane, yet it does in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things act above, and beyond it, even
under this hypostatical Union, by which
God intended to advance Humane Nature,
but without any Contraction or Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Divine.</p>
               <p>If you ask, What is that Object which
we should set before us in every Act of
Worship, Publick or Private? <hi>I Answer;</hi>
The Father, Son, and Holy-Ghost, one
God, and Three Persons; <hi>Through Christ,
by one Spirit, we have access unto the Father,
Eph.</hi> 2. 18. According to that Oeconomy
we worship one God all along, applying
our selves in a distinct manner to each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
according to the Word, that the whole
of our Worship may center in one God.
We shall become vain in our imaginations,
if we worship God any otherwise. Our
own Notions of Omnipotency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let
them rise never so high, are but mere emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Speculations, till we know the subject
to whom they belong: If they are true,
they are true of something; Attributes
ascribed to nothing, are nothing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but when we see in whom they are
vested, they command a Reverence in us
towards so great an Object; <hi>they that know
thy name, will trust in thee;</hi> the name leads
us to the thing, to God himself, as an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
Eternal Being, cloathed with all those
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98282:81"/>
Attributes that render him worthy of all
Honour, Praise, and Glory from us.</p>
               <p>The Heathens for want of a right Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to fix their natural Notions of a Deity
upon, set up such Similitudes and Images
of God, as did no way represent him, but
rendred him like unto corruptible things:
God forbid us to make any Image or Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of him, and set up his Son, as his only
True, Living Image, that we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of him according to that Image, and
no otherwise.</p>
               <p>The Sum of all is this:</p>
               <p>The New Testament declares Christ to
be the <hi>Son of God, equal with the Father, the
express image of his person:</hi> Flesh and blood
cannot reveal this to us, <hi>i. e.</hi> can't perswade
us to believe it; but when it pleases the
Father to reveal his Son in us, then we see
the Eternal Father in his Son; in knowing
one, we know both, because both are one
and the same God: We see the Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in Christ also, who is called the Spirit of
Christ, residing in him without measure:
'Tis by the Son that we know both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Spirit, as One God, and Three
Persons; One, and yet Three; Three, and
yet One. God has said it, therefore let us
admire and believe: The greatest things
that are, cause no admiration till we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, and then we sit down asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98282:81"/>
That Three Personalities belong to
One Infinite Essence, must needs be true,
because God in effect says it, who knows
himself best: <hi>I am that I am,</hi> says God, <hi>i. e.</hi>
I am all that is revealed, and <hi>I am that I am</hi>
besides. Secret things belong to God, not
to know what is not revealed, is not culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ignorance, but a holy Nescience that
will become us.</p>
               <p>'Tis fit that God should so reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to us, that he may appear incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
by us; had he revealed himself as
comprehensible by us, we should have had
no reason to believe him to be God; for he
must have been a finite God, and therefore
none at all: 'Twas fit therefore that God
should shew himself to man in his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedent
Excellencies, as incomprehensible
by man; so that his very incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness,
which may occasion some doubt
and hessitation in us, yet if rightly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
it may be brought in as a strong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
to prove the truth and certainty of
his Divinity. Men are now for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending,
not Believing; but all men
are not Philosophers. Besides; the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
Reasons you bring for the Being
of a God, may prove there is a God, and
that you know there is a God; but they do
not prove, that you know who that God is.
Let me tell you, the wisest among you
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98282:82"/>
cannot comprehend God, you cannot
know him to Perfection; but the weakest
among you may be made to Believe, what
you can't Comprehend. If there be any
Atheists, or Scepticks here, who either
deny, or doubt of the Being of a God, let
them be persuaded for once to make trial
of Christ, to cast themselves upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
Almighty, Incomprehensible God.
held forth by Christ in the Gospel. We
stand in need of that which none can do for
us, but an Infinite God; let us not then be
startled, when we hear of such a God, but
get under the shadow of the Almighty as
fast as we can; then we shall count our
selves safe to Eternity.</p>
               <p>We may as soon comprehend the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Persons, as the Infinite Essence of
God; both are alike incomprehensible.</p>
               <p>Three finite Persons have each of them
an Essence, numerically different from
each other; but the Three Persons in the
Trinity have but one and the same numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Essence of the Godhead among them
all; else there would not be One only God,
but as many Gods as Persons. From what
hath been said, it appears, that God in
Christ is the true God, God indeed: Which
is the first thing implyed in a saving-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God: The second is this, <hi>viz.</hi>

not God aright, who do not know that there
is, and can be but One only God, none
like him; this takes us off from all Idolatry,

all Divine Worship; <hi>This is life eternal,

<hi>There is one God, and one Mediator,</hi> 1 Tim.
2. 5. To Worship many gods, as the
Heathens did, is to Blaspheme them all,
to ascribe Impotency, and Insufficiency to
them; one hand is too weak, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are required; there can be but one infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Supreme God: What we ascribe to
other gods, we detract from the true God;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98282:83"/>
we are commanded to <hi>Love God with all
our hearts, soul and strength,</hi> Luke 10. 27.
If all be due unto one God, What remains
for any other? We never truly rely upon
God, when we put confidence in any
thing else, <hi>He only is my rock, and my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
my soul wait thou upon God,</hi> Psal.
62. 25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?
and there is none upon earth that I desire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
thee,</hi> Psal. 77. 25.</p>
               <p>God is one, there is none like him,
therefore to be worshiped with a peculiar
singular Worship, appropriated to him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
which for the height and spirituality of
it, belongs to him, and to none else; he will
not give his Glory to another: There is a
Glory belonging to God that is truly Divine,
that is too much, and too great to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
unto any Creature. When we come
before the Lord, if our hearts are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
and extended to a further Degree
of Zeal and Fervency, deriving some eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more than ordinary, from the greatness
and excellency of the object that inflames
our Devotions, makes us to be otherwise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
towards God, than we find our selves
to be towards other things; we are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a true sense of the Greatness and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of God, neither do we know him, as
we ought to know him; they who know
God in Christ, do love him more, fear him
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98282:83"/>
more, rejoyce in him more, than we do in
other things; they are carried out in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
manner towards him, from
the high apprehensions they have of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Majesty. What made the Angels and
Elders <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>ad finem.</hi> raise their
Note so high in that Doxology, but because
they thought him worthy of the highest
Honour, more worthy than all Creatures
in Heaven or Earth. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>ad finem.</hi>
There is that in God, that calls for the
highest Adoration and Worship.</p>
               <p>Thou art worthy. <hi>i. e.</hi> It is most decent,
fit, and convenient to pay this just Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retce
to the great God: 'Tis highly ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
the worth and excellency of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
calls for it; 'tis injustice towards God, to
rob him of his Glory, by not rendring to
him the Praises due unto his Name. How
was <hi>Paul</hi> affected with the consideration of
God in Christ Jesus, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
               <p>We shall be apt to come in a slight com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Spirit to the worship of God, till we
apprehend it to be a special peculiar Service
of a higher Nature, requiring more intense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Spirit, more zeal and ardency of
Affection, then we exert and put forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other occasion; because we have to
do with God who is above all. If your
Hearts are not now fixed upon God,
wholly taken up with serious thoughts of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98282:84"/>
God, Trembling at his Word: You do
not behave your selves wisely in the House
of God. This one only true God, is
known by this distinguishing Character, as
the Father of Jesus Christ: to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the truth of a Deity, and of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Christ's Incarnation holding forth
this God unto us, are the Two points upon
which all our Religion hangs, every Gospel-truth,
hath relation to both these depending
upon 'em, and naturally flowing from them.</p>
               <p>Since we all profess our selves to be
Worshippers of God, it highly concerns
us to know that true God, and that this
God is but one, even he who hath appeared
in Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>To Worship God out of Christ, is to
Woiship as the Heathens do; in plain
<hi>English,</hi> 'tis to Worship the Devil. 1 <hi>Cor.
10. 20. The things which the Gentiles sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
they sacrifice to devils, and not to God;
I would not you should have fellowship with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi>
I am afraid there is a great deal of
Heathenish Worship among us; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
carries away all that Worship, that is
not directed to God in Christ. There is
no other medium of Worship but Christ;
'tis not the intention of Worshipping the
True God in or by an Image, that will
justifie Image-worship, from being down-right
Idolatry. We may be mistaken in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98282:84"/>
Worshipping one God, if that prove a
False one: Nay, if we intend the True
God, yet as represented by that which by
nature is no God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 8. 'tis a false ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Worship.</p>
               <p>All Creatures but the Devil do pay a
Worship to something which they call
God; he only is a constant Blasphemer;
though he be no Atheist, yet he is no
Worshipper of God, but a Malicious Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer
of him; he pretends to no manner
of Worship; he intends no such thing
towards God; though he promotes Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in others, yet does what in him lies to
eclipse his Glory altogether, and to set up
himself for the God of this world. The
Devil would be a God to this end, that
Wickedness may be accounted Godliness,
receiving its denomination from Satan,
usurping the name and title of God. But
from such a God, and such Godliness,
good Lord deliver us.</p>
               <p>Therefore that we may have clear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
apprehensions of the only True
God, let us keep the eye of our Faith fixed
upon Christ, in all the acts of Worship we
perform unto God; believing him, and
him only to be the True Living God, who
hath Manifested himself to us in the Flesh
of Christ.</p>

               <head type="sub">To know this only True God, to be OVR God.</head>
               <p>1. WHAT it is for God to be
our God.</p>
               <p>God as Creator and Sovereign Lord of
Heaven and Earth, might have dealt with
his creature Man, in a way of Absolute
Prerogative, commanding duty without
promising any Reward, being Debtor to
none; he might without shewing any
cause, why, have given to, or taken from
man, what he pleased; all was his own,
whether he gave, or took away, he did
with his own as he pleased. Thus he
might have disposed of Man, from time
to time, according to the secret good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his Will; not made known to us,
but by the unavoidable events of it upon
us. This had been a Government, not so
suitable to our rational Natures, to which
God was resolved to accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in all his dealings with us; therefore,
having made Man a knowing Creature, he
reveals his Will to him, tells him what
he expects from him, and binds himself
by Covenant to continue man in Life, as
long as he continues in his Obedience,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98282:85"/>
which his perfect State inclined him to.
Thus God set Life and Death before him,
left him to his choice; what he did, he
must do knowingly and willingly; if he
injure himself, the whole blame must lye
upon himself; he could not rebel against
God, but he must rebel against his own
Reason, and wilfully act against his own
Light; I say, wilfully: For there was
nothing in his perfect Nature, that could
incline him to the Sin he committed; his
will chose it without any direction from
the understanding; for it was absoltuely
impossible, that the perfect understanding
of man in Innocency, should be guilty of
such a mistake, and dictate such a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
no, the Devil dictated it, and the
mutable will of man was deceived by the
Tempter, and fell under a Curse, from that
time forward; the law could do nothing
but Curse fallen man, who had now lost
his legal Interest in the Love and Favour
of God. There is nothing due to a Sinner
by Law, but Death, <hi>the wages of sin is
death;</hi> by nature we are Children of
wrath, fallen under the heavy displeasure
of God, and must Perish Eternally, unless
some means be found out to reconcile us to
God again; some dayes-man to umpire the
business between God and us, and to take
up the quarrel. Christ undertook this, to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98282:86"/>
make our peace with God, to bring us nigh
by his blood, shed for the remission of our
sins, that God being pacified towards us,
might become our God and loving Father;
ceasing from his anger, receiving us
into a state of Grace and Favour with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>God lost none of his Power over us, when
we fell; 'tis so far from that, that we fell
into the hands of the living God; sin fitted
us for destruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. Laid our
Necks, as it were upon the block, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
us to the stroke of Divine Vengeance.
In respect of power, God is God over all
still; but in respect of Grace, he ceases to
be God; <hi>i. e.</hi> a gracious God, to those who
are shut out of his love, having forfeited all
their Interest in it.</p>
               <p>When God comes to a sinner, and says
(as to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7.) I am thy
God; 'tis as much as if he should say, what
I am in my self, I'll be on thy behalf, I'll
be all in all to thee; I'll confer all blessings
temporal and spiritual upon thee; I'll com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
all good to thee, Grace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;
I ll be with thee, whereever thou
goest, to bless thee.</p>
               <p>Alas! What if God be Almighty and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
in himself, unless he will help me,
and do good to me, what am I the better;
therefore says God, whatever I am, have, or
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98282:86"/>
can do, shall be for thy good; my Power,
Wisdom, Goodness, Mercy, shall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to thee and thine, for Blessing and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 144. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will be thy God:</hi> In words, a short pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
but in sense, the most ample promise
in the whole Bible; God here is taken rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
as he stands related to his people,
and his people to him; he is the God of such
a people, and they are the people of such
a God. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 23. God dwells among
them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 45, 46. As a God nigh at
hand to help them, ready upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to do them good; he does not only
dwell, but walk among us, he goes into
every room of the House; takes care of
every thing, keeps all in good order, <hi>Levit.</hi>
26. 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12.
This dwelling denotes, not only the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
presence of his Power, but the special
presence of his Grace. So he was with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,
Gen.</hi> 39. 2. And when he withdraws
his favour and assistance, he is said, not to be
among us, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 42. Then they are
smitten by their Enemies, but when God
appears, then their Enemies fly before
them, <hi>Psal</hi> 79. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>For God to be our God and our Father, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
us to eternity; whatever Chastisements
we pass through, all will issue well, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
7. 14. 15. if God be our God and Father.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98282:87"/>
For God to be our God, is equivalent to other
expressions of Scripture of the like import,
<hi>viz.</hi> to be for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31. To be on
our side, <hi>Psal.</hi> 124. 1, 2. To be round about
us, as the Mountains about <hi>Jerusalem, Psal.</hi>
125. 2. To be with us, in us, always nigh
at hand to help us. God is ours, when all
that he hath is ours, for our use and benefit.</p>
               <p>2. How comes God to be our God.</p>
               <p>This comes originally from himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he truly bestows himself upon us in
the new Covenant; by vertue of which
he becomes ours, and we become his, <hi>Gen.</hi>
17. 7. God and the Saints have a propriety
in each other. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>I will be to them
a God, and they shall be to me a people.</hi> God
gives himself to us, and then we resign up our
selves to him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44. 5. We must prove God
to be ours, by some grant or deed of gift which
God has made of himself to us in his word,
before we can lay claim to him: As God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Covenant and
Promise, so he becomes our God; he makes
a Covenant with us in Christ, to be our God;
that for his sake he will freely pardon our
sins, and receive us into a state of Grace and
Favour again; thus God offers himself in the
Covenant to be our God: But an outward
tender of grace, if not closed in with, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
is but a bare offer, not a gift, till we
receive it; when God intends to give grace,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98282:87"/>
he secretly joyns with the outward call,
speaks himself to the heart, and inclines us
to receive it; herein lyes the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
an outward and an inward effectual
Call. An effectual Call, is that which hath
its effect upon the Soul, makes us answer
to the call, and obey it; we are called to come
to Christ, and when we actually come,
then is the Call effectual, and not before;
when God offered himself to <hi>Abraham,</hi> it
was with a purpose not to be refused, and
therefore he inclined the heart of <hi>Abraham</hi>
to believe.</p>
               <p>You may live long under an outward
Call, and not be effectually called, <hi>i. e.</hi> not
called with such a Call, as God gives his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
at thir Conversion, <hi>many are called,
but few chosen, i. e.</hi> few called with such a
Call as God gives his Elect. We cannot be
sure of our Election, till we are thus ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
called: To be frequent Hearers
of the word, calling us to Christ, and yet
find no inclinations in our hearts to come to
him, is a sign that God hath not yet spoken
to us himself; Ministers have, but God
hath not yet by his Spirit set home his word
upon our hearts: The inclinations of the
Soul towards Christ, that arise from an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
Call are very strong, they put the
Soul upon coming to Christ, urge us to it eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day; there is something writ upon the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98282:88"/>
heart, whch he that runs may read, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is reading over that inward Writing
every day to the Soul, calls for a speedy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
why is not this done that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
that God has left upon record in thy
heart? Why so backward, why so slow of
heart to believe? Arise, arise, away to
Christ as fast as you can, run for your life
to the City of refuge that God has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
They who know what an inward Call is,
cannot resist it; an awakened Conscience is,
in hast, will have the business dispatched
out of hand, nothing can stop that man who
is effectually called. O that every one here
present were under such a Call this day God
is able to give it, and I am sure none of you
are able to resist it.</p>
               <p>Christ is offered to us in the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
as our Peace-maker, and Mediator,
therefore called, <hi>the covenant of the people,</hi>
Isa. 42. 6. the sure foundation of it, <hi>Isa.</hi>
26. 16. The Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
is said to be confirmed of God in
Christ before his Incarnation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17.
This Covenant was made between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son from Eternity, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 6.
<hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>The first outward declaration or revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it was in time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
               <p>The actual application of this Grace to
our selves, is, when we first Believe: We
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98282:88"/>
enter into Covenant by Faith, we set
our seal to the truth of the Promise, and
receive that right, that Christ Believed on,
gives to Eternal life. Faith it self gives no
right to Salvation unto us, but what it first
receives from Christ; we have nothing to
do with the promise, till we are in Christ by
Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. Faith dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Grace and Love of God to us in
Christ, and accepts of the offer of life
upon Gospel terms, which the Soul could
never be brought to, till Faith came. <hi>Who
has believed the report, and to whom has
the arm of the Lord been reveal'd,</hi> i. e. to
beget Faith which wins over a Sinner to
Christ: We should be much in the first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
acts of Faith, coming to Christ, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves on Christ, relying on Christ;
these direct acts of Faith, often repeated,
will sooner clear up our Interest in Christ,
than our judging by marks, signs, effects
and fruits, which can give no clearer Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their truth, than Faith does of its
truth in a real closing with Christ, in an
absolute Promise; this is the first act of
Saving Grace, antecedent to all qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in us, or conditions performed by us;
this alters our State: They understand not
the Gospel, who keep off from Christ, for
want of such and such qualifications;
which Christ expects not we should bring
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98282:89"/>
to him, but derive from him; an humble
sense of our vileness and unworthiness, is
qualification enough for a Sinner to come
to Christ, and cast himself upon him.
When God has once said he will be our
God, he is ever after minding us of that,
speaking it over again and again upon all
occasions, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c. Isa.</hi> 41. 10.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 11, 12. I will, and they shall; God
undertakes both parts of the Covenant.
The Covenant in the first initial Grace of
it, must be first executed on God's part
towards us, before it can be executed on
our part towards God; God begins with
us, doth his part first, and that enables us
to do our part, <hi>i. e.</hi> we cannot give up our
selves to him to be his people, till he has
writ his Laws in our Hearts, and put his
Spirit within us, thereby declaring himself
to be our God, and strongly inclining us
to give up our selves to him as his People.
God first enters into Covenant with us,
brings us under the bond of it, and then
governs us ever after by the Grace of that
Covenant freely conferred upon us: There
may be conditions in the Covenant, that
speak out the order of it, what is first, and
what follows upon it, according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of the All-wise God in bringing hom-Sinners
to Christ: But I do not conceive
there are any conditions previously requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98282:89"/>
in us, in order to our first entring into
Covenant. God takes whom he will into
Covenant, and leaves out whom he will;
'tis not of him that wills, nor of him that
runs, but of God that shews Mercy; 'tis
a Covenant of Free Grace, consisting of
absolute Promises, what God will do; our
doing comes afterwards, as a fruit and
effect of God's work in us: That which is
done by us in the virtue and power of that
which is first done in us by God, must
be ascribed to him, and not to our
selves; <hi>Turn thou me, and I shall be turned;</hi>
God gives the first turn, before we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any such thing as Conversion in our
selves; God lays in the principle, and then
draws us in the Power of it after himself:
The Terms of the Covenant may be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
propounded to many, who never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Covenant with God, nor God with
them; the Covenant is never executed in
them, and towards them, though it be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
preacht to them. <hi>How often would I
have gathered you, and you would not?</hi> Mat.
23. 37. When the word of God's grace
comes to us, we either receive it, or put
it from us; and 'twill be no joy of heart to
us in a dying Hour, to think how often
we have refused our own Mercies offered to
us, which nothing but our final unbelief
can hinder us of; you who do not now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98282:90"/>
know assuredly that you will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
'till God turn your hearts; and he
then begins to turn them, when he puts
you upon seeking earnestly to him for it, as
that which none can do besides: I wish
this sign of Conversion were more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in us all; how diligently should we
wait upon God for converting Grace in the
use of means? the reason why many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
so little benefit from the word, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they expect so little from it; they do
not come with raised expectations of a
powerful Revelation of the Arm of God
upon their hearts; you that do, have, I
doubt not, seen, and felt the mighty works
of God upon your Souls. Faith begins at the
promises, is raised from thence, and ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
waits for the performance of them;
it shall be done according to your Faith.</p>
               <p>Some think they must bring Faith to the
Covenant, as a preparatory Qualification
for all the Grace that is there promised;
whereas we must come to the Covenant for
our first Faith, and fetch it thence; the Spirit
by the outward proposal of the Covenant
kindles Faith in us, by which we cast our
selves upon the free Grace of God in Christ:
We have nothing to believe till then. Do
this, and then look for the Law written in
your hearts; for the Spirit of God, and all
the fruits of the Spirit in your repentance;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98282:90"/>
Love, Obedience, and holy walking with
God; all Graces flow from the Covenant
of Grace. Pray that God will give you a
heart to assent to, and close with Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the terms of the Covenant, and then see
if all be not made good to you. God will
do much for the Glory of his Grace, but he
will do nothing to nourish your Pride and
Conceitedness of your selves, and your own
righteousness; seek all from Grace, and you
have all; but if you go about to establish
your own righteousness, you will never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto righteousness, if you seek it not
by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 32.</p>
               <p>3. How come we to discern God to be our
God in Christ; or what is there in Christ,
that makes out this unto us?</p>
               <p>1. Christ, as Man, does own God to be
his God, and the God of all who are in
him. <hi>My Father, and your Father, my God
and your God,</hi> John 20. 17. God is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the God of Christ Personal, but of Christ
Mystical, his Head both ways, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3.
When we are one in Christ, then the God
of Christ is our God; we cannot since the
fall, have an Interest in God, but through
a Mediator; he is the great Peace maker;
'tis Christ makes God to be ours, who
otherwise would be against us, not for us;
God is in Christ, reconciling the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98282:91"/>
himself: As Christ owns God to be his
God, so God the Father owns Christ incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
as his wellbelovedSon; and the same
love he beareth to him, he beareth to all his
Members, <hi>John</hi> 17. 23, 26.</p>
               <p>We can have no immediate Knowledg
of God in his own Divine Essence; So he is
perfectly known only to himself; all that
concerns us to know of him, he has revealed
in Christ: Without a personal knowledge of
God in Christ, we cannot act our Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, nor have any real Communion
with him; Notions are not Persons or
Subsistencies, but Mental Conceptions;
neither can we apply our selves to those Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
if we know not the Person to
whom they belong; all Divine Attributes
relate to their proper Subject; nay more,
all Divine Attributes are of the essence of
God, they are God himself; neither do our
thoughts of Omnipotency, Allsufficiency,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> signify any thing to our relief, unless
we know him who is all this; we cannot
know Omnipotency to be God himself, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we see it acted, and expressed by him
who is God; 'tis a hard matter to prove the
reality of that which was never acted; and
'tis impossible to know that such Attributes
have been exerted, unless we know by
whom. None of the idol gods were ever able
to act over any one of the essential Attributes
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98282:91"/>
of God; by the help of the Devil they
pretended something that way, but it was
a mere pretence, easily disproved by any
considering man, strictly examining, either
their Predictions of future Events, or their
feigned Miracles, which were all mere Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
false and groundless.</p>
               <p>Christ out-did them all, he did the works
of God indeed, and for his work-sake
ought to be believed to be God indeed.</p>
               <p>2. In Christ we see God's Wrath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
his Justice satisfied for all our Offences,
all causes of Enmity between God and us
are taken away by Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13, 14.
The body of sin destroyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. We
Crucified to the World, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. The
Image of God restored, his Law writ in
our hearts.</p>
               <p>3. The Spirit of Christ dwelling in us,
tells us so, teaches us to cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father. As
no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but
by the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. So none
can say, that God is their God, but by the
Holy Ghost: By the Spirit of Christ, which
is the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. When
God himself tells you by his own Spirit,
that he is your God, he makes you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what he says, and to see how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
you are, in having God for your God:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98282:92"/>
Till we come to some sense of this, we
lose the comfort of our Religion, it has
little Influence upon us; whence does the
power of godliness arise, but from the
power of God, who is the Author of true
Religion, and puts that power into it, that
belongs to true godliness; take away
the relation that is between Godliness and
God, and you quite destroy the power of
godliness: Religion is a weak thing, if it
be not maintained and supported by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and power of God himself.</p>
               <p>4. We see that of God in Jesus Christ,
that makes us fall down and Worship him as
our God, crying out with <hi>Thomas, John</hi> 20.
28. <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> When we
look upon Christ with an eye of Faith, we
do with open face behold, as in a glass the
glory of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
his glory to pass before us, lets out some
beams of his Divine Majesty, that we may
know him to be the Lord; such Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of God to the Soul through Christ
have, I hope, fallen under your own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
many a time, and that you are not
now without such a sight of God in Christ,
as does create in you a holy Reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, a holy trembling at his word;
if you receive it as the word of God, of
your God, it must have this effect upon
you; any thing from our God, that bears
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98282:92"/>
his Name, comes with authority, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
a due respect from us.</p>
               <p>Since we are redeemed with the precious
Blood of Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. Justified by
his Blood, saved from Wrath through him,
reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9, 10. We may conclude from all
that has passed between God and Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our Salvation, that God is our God:
Christ has made him so.</p>
               <p>When we know who is our God, what
he will be unto us, and do for us, we may
enter into rest for ever, rejoycing in his
Salvation.</p>
               <p>Two things prove God to be ours.</p>
               <p>1. His giving himself to us in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
               <p>2. Our receiving him in that Promise by
Faith, which holds him fast, will not let
him go; neither will God wrest himself out
of the hand of our Faith, for that would
be to recede from his own Promise, to deny
himself; no he will approve himself to be
every way ours; taking a universal Care of
us, and providing eternally for us, causing
his fulness to flow in upon our Souls more
and more every day. Jer. 17. 8. <hi>For he shall
be as a tree planted by the waters, that sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
her roots by the river, and shall not see
when heat cometh; but her leaf shall be green,
nor shall cease from yeilding fruit.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Some further Evidences of God's being
OVR God.</head>
               <p>1. LOOK into your own hearts for
this; see what impressions of his
Love and Fear you can find there, what
measure of the Spirit of his Son breathing
in you; examine, prove your own selves,
that you may know whether Christ be in
you of a truth; he who has God for his
God, his heart is much set upon Christ,
who has brought this about, and by a Spirit
of Adoption made it known to us, that
God is our Father; the Spirit does not tell
us this only by an external Declaration of
it in the word; but by an internal operation,
or breathing in our hearts as the Spirit of the
Son, inclining us to go to God, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of our Heavenly Father. We know
God to be our Father by a Divine Instinct;
the spirit of the Son leads us naturally to our
Heavenly Father; the Spirit of the Son
knows no other Father but God, and God
acts as a Father towards all, in whom he
sees the Spirit of his Son; when we are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Lord in one Spirit, we stand in
the same relation to God the Father, as
Christ our elder Brother does; then it is, <hi>I
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98282:93"/>
and the children which thou hast given me,</hi>
Heb. 2. 13. All Children of the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I the first born, and these my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
Being partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that Nature tells us who is our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father; we need not say with <hi>Philip,</hi>
shew us the Father; we shall see the Father
in the Son, and move towards him in the
Spirit of the Son, feeling in our selves such
childlike affections towards God, as will
make us call him Father. We must be
clear in the actings of our Faith upon
Christ, before we can apprehend God to be
our Father; still remembring, that it's the
Father of Christ, who is our Father.</p>
               <p>2. By that inward satisfaction and rest
we find in our selves under this new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-relation
to God, he that believes, doth
enter into rest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 3. Soul, take thine
ease; a Child of God may truly say so; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our believing in Christ, there is a secret
shedding abroad of that love of God in the
Soul; when we turn to God, God turns
about to us, looks pleasingly upon us; we
tast and see that God is gracious, this is the
sinners welcome into a state of Grace,
he sees it much better with him than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>3. By the confidence we put in him for
help and comfort in all our times of need.

14, 15.</p>
               <p>4. By his appearing for us, against all our

hand; when things come to extremities
between God and his People, he will then

Consciences, Whether you have and do
carry it towards him, according to what
you profess to know of him? Who among
us is not guilty in this matter? O! that
the sense of our former neglects, may
quicken us up to a more diligent observance
of his Holy will, and to pay that just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
that is due unto his Name. Pray
consider what use do you make of your
God, your own God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 67. 6. We
should make use of our own things, we
should never boast of a Propriety in that,
which is not useful and beneficial to us;
then tell me, What dost thou expect from
thy God? And what think you does your
God expect from you? When <hi>Paul</hi> was
brought to the knowledge of God in
Christ, the first Word he said after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
was, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have
me to do? I am devoted to thy service while
I live:</hi> so <hi>Thomas, My God, and my Lord;</hi>
we never own God for our God, till we
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98282:96"/>
are savingly enlightned, then we turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
towards him, then we fall down and
Worship him, and have an awful sense of
God abiding in us ever after; then we
follow him crying, <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> then my
God and my Father in every Prayer we
make: You may know a Child of God by
his daily Crying, <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why many restrain Prayer, don't call
upon God from one end of the Week to the
other, is, because they do'nt own him to
be their God: 'Tis impossible to own him,
and not to pray to him continually upon all
occasions; he is a strange Christian who
stands in no need of God every day; and
if so, Why don't you go to him upon your
knees every day and beg his help? Not to
do this, is to live without God in the World.</p>
               <p>I appeal to your Consciences concerning
your God; you know, he is a jealous God,
he can't endure to behold iniquity; he is a
consuming fire to unbelieving impenitent
Sinners; he will prove so to them at last,
and since your God is such a God, How
dare you put forth your hand to the least
Iniquity? What trembling should seize
upon you, when you sin against such a
God? I beseech you go home and think
seriously of your God: Either you have a
God, or you have none; if you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
none, then profess your selves to be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98282:97"/>
Atheists, and let us never see your faces
more in the Assemblies of God's People;
if you own a God for your God, subject
your selves to him, and be willing to be
ruled by him.</p>
               <p>We can't look God in the face, and
say our Father, if we know him not to
be ours.</p>
               <p>God offers himself to many who reject
him, <hi>Israel would none of me,</hi> Psal. 81.
10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Let us have a care of this, lest God
make us to know to our sorrow, what it is
to be forsaken by him. Christ for a time
was under desertion, and he knew how to
cary himself under it, better than we do.
<hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me.</hi>
Christ did, and so may we plead our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in God as our God, and yet be forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by him for a time; <hi>my God, my God,</hi>
says a deserted Soul; hadst thou never been
mine, the hiding of thy face had not been
so terrible; but to lose the sight of my
God, with whom I enjoy'd such sweet
communion heretofore; this goes to my
heart, as a Sword passing through it. Few
under desertion are able to say as Christ did,
<hi>my God, my God;</hi> we are apt to think he
has cast us off, and that we hear him say,
<hi>lo ruhamah,</hi> I will no more have Mercy;
<hi>lo ammi, Ye are not my people, and I will not
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98282:97"/>
be your God,</hi> Hos. 1. 6, 9. We think every
Hand-writing of any bitter thing against
us, is a Bill of Divorce, and that God
will be our God no more; when he frowns
upon us, we start back farther than he
would have us.</p>
               <p>If we don't fear him, whom we call
our God, we have no God who is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ours, whom we own as such in our
Consciences. No, no! Such are without
God; their Belly is their God, their Riches,
Power, Parts, Places, are their God;
they think they can do any thing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this World; never seriously think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the immortality of their Souls, of
a future State; if they may enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Sin that are but for a season, they
don't consider how short that season is,
nor what comes after; they'd Eat, and
Drink, and be Merry, though to morrow
they may dye; and what care they? the
things of another World are Mysteries to
them, they won't trouble their heads about
them: This is the true real State of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
and Ten thousands in the World.
Could we see into their Hearts, we should
find it just so, and no otherwise; let their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
profession be what it will, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thoughts are as you have heard, let
them deny it if they can; I am sure, if they
will tell themselves what they think, they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98282:98"/>
must acknowledge all this to be so, and no
otherwise.</p>
               <p>If God be not your God, then he is none
of yours, <hi>i. e.</hi> he is against you; you'll
shortly feel the weight of his Almighty
hand pressing you sore, and giving you an
irrecoverable stroke; 'tis a fearful thing to
fall into the hands of the Living God. If
God be for us, Who can be against us?
But if God be against us, Who can be for
us, to secure us from his Vengeance?
None can deliver out of his hand; if God
be not your God, you are under the power
of the Devil, he is your God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18.
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
               <p>I don't ask what your Opinions are,
some difference may be among us there;
but I ask, Who is your God? I hope we
are all agreed in this; To us there is but one
God, and one Lord Jesus Christ: If so,
if God in Christ be indeed your God, then
his word must be the rule of all your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
both Civil and Religious: how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
should you be to keep his Word, to
do according to the revealed will of your
own God? you can't answer the contrary
to your Consciences. 'Tis a reasonable
motion to put you upon worshipping your
own God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 20, 21. <hi>Thou shalt
fear the Lord thy God; him shalt thou serve,
and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98282:98"/>
his name. He is thy praise, and he is thy
God, that hath done for thee great things.</hi> I
have not chosen your God for you, you
your selves have chosen him, as <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.
22, 23, 24. <hi>Ye are witnesses against your
selves; that ye have chosen the Lord to
serve him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vide.</hi> You say, he is your
God, then I say you ought to Fear and Obey
him: <hi>For all people will walk every one in the
name of his God; and we will walk in the name
of the Lord our God, for ever and ever,</hi> Micah
4. 5. All your Godliness lies in the respect
you shew to your God.</p>
               <p>If you shall still ask, How shall we know
that God is our God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> God comes himself and tells us so;
not only in his Word, but by some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Manifestation of himself to our Souls,
according to the Word, <hi>John</hi> 14. 21. God
does act over the grace of such a promise,
gives us undeniable experience of it in our
own Souls, that he has made good such a
promise to us: Here is more than a bare
promise; here is the Spirit of promise
sealing the truth of it to our souls: The
Holy Ghost is called the Spirit of Promise,
not only because he himself is the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the Father, but because he is the
best Interpreter of all the promises; gives
us light into them all, searches the deep
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98282:99"/>
things of God, that we might know the
things that are freely given to us of God,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. We take that that lies
uppermost in a promise; but we don't dig
deep enough to discover the hid treasures
that are there; in the light of the Spirit we
may look down to the bottom of a promise,
and see all that is contained in it, gathering
up the unsearchable riches of Christ. The
Spirit makes us to understand our interest
in God, bearing witness to our Adoption,
and shedding abroad the Love of God in
our Hearts; so that we are full of a sense
of God's love: <hi>In the midst of my thoughts
within me, thy comforts delight my soul,</hi>
Psal. 94. 19. <hi>q. d.</hi> When I could think
of nothing to revive my drooping
Soul, thy comforts did it presently. Let
us wait for this particular manifestation of
God to us, till he know us by name, as
<hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 12. <hi>I know thee by
name, and thou hast found grace in my sight.</hi>
What an accent did Christ put upon the
word <hi>Mary,</hi> when he spoke to her! She
knew his Voice presently, and turned her
self, saying, <hi>Rabboni, Master,</hi> Joh. 20. 16.
He first calls her <hi>Woman, v.</hi> 15. as if he
knew not whom she was; and 'tis plain
she knew not who he was, though many
words passed between them; but when he
called her by her Name <hi>Mary,</hi> he secretly
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98282:99"/>
told her his Name <hi>Jesus:</hi> She did not
own him for her Lord and Master till
then.</p>
               <p>Though all Believers have not always
a full sense and assurance that God is their
God; yet they always cleave to him as their
God; they look towards him, long for
clearer evidences of his Love, desire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than that God would be their
God: Sometimes Grace spends all its
strength in desires after more Grace, so
that what we have is hardly discernable by
us; we pray for more grace, as if we had
none at all, though the manner of our
praying argues the contrary: Where there
is but little Water in the Bucket, we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
pour it all into the Pump to fetch up
more; as he that hath, receives more; so
he that hath, desires more, and that makes
him forget what he hath, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. Our
longing after clearer views of God in
Christ may seem to obscure, at least to
take us off from the consideration of the
present sight we have of him.</p>
               <p>The Majesty of God out of Christ, is too
high for Mortal men to approach unto;
therefore consider your <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in the Flesh: Pray for a <hi>Spirit of
wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
him,</hi> Eph. 1. 17. 'Tis granted to some, but
not to others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98282:100"/>
'tis a signal effect of the Covenant of Grace,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>made</hi> to know that God is our
God; to know, or rather to be known of
him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 9. There is a mutual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
between God and the Saints, of
the interest they have one in another. <hi>I am
the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am
known of mine,</hi> Joh. 10. 14.</p>

counsel of God in this matter, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 27.

Wisdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. kept se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
since the World began, but now is
made manifest by the Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.
25, 26. That no man knows this but by a

<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. <hi>Men and brethren, what shall we do?</hi>
They knew not what to do. <hi>Sirs, what must

have entred into the heart of man, the

us by his Spirit. When we were yet without
strength,</hi> and could do nothing to help our
selves, <hi>in due time Christ died for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi>
Rom. 5. 6.</p>
               <p>This outward revelation in the letter of
the Scripture,<note place="margin">3. Obs.</note> of God's intended Grace
towards Sinners, is little regarded by the
generality of men; they cast the Word
of God behind their backs, and count the
Doctrine of the Cross foolishness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:98282:101"/>There are Two Causes of this.</p>
               <p>1. They are not convinced of their lost
Estate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>The whole need not a
physician,</hi> Mat. 9. 12.</p>
               <p>2. When they are convinced, I mean
when they are under the highest degree of
Conviction that a natural man is capable
of, yet they can't reach the mystery of the
Gospel; 'tis foolishness to them; nay,
the more they are Convinced of the sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sin, the further they see into the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
nature of it, the more improbable,
nay, impossible, does it seem to them, that
ever their sins should be pardoned: 'Tis an
easier matter to convince them of sin, than
it is under that Conviction, to perswade
them to believe in Christ for the pardon
of sin; there is something in Nature that
helps forward the Conviction of sin, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Conscience joyns with the Law to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
for sin; but there is nothing in Nature
that does any way promote our belief of
the Gospel; the first is a common work of
the Spirit; this latter, a special saving work.
Therefore,</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Obs.</hi> Besides the written word, which
God has put into every man's hand, who
lives under the outward light of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98282:102"/>
God ordained, and appointed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to go up and down as his Embassadors,
to beseech and intreat sinners to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unto God, and put them in mind of
what is written in the Word; to exhort them
to read it, to hear it, to consider seriously of
it; God sends his Ministers to discourse
them, to expostulate the case with them;
so unwilling is God that any should perish,
but that all should come to repentance, and
live.</p>
               <p>If any object, Why may not the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word suffice, without the Ministry, to
bring men to the knowledge of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>I answer. All cannot read, therefore
they must be spoken to, and instructed by
Preaching. Besides,</p>
               <p>'Tis not for us to prescribe unto God,
what means he should use to fit us for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
he hath appointed this Ordinance of
Preaching. <hi>It preased God by the foolishness
of preaching, to save them that believe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 21. Therefore let it not displease us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
should God speak to us immediately
in his own voice, we should not be able to
bear it, as they <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27.
Therefore he speaks in our voice and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
to us, that he may more secretly and
silently convey himself to our hearts, by the
ministry of man, speaking in his Name,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98282:102"/>
and uttering his words; which are capable
of more of the Spirit of God, than our
hearts can well bear; the Word of God, and
the Spirit of God, do perfectly agree, but
it is not so between the Spirit of God, and
our hearts; the Spirit enters not without
opposition; therefore to avoid all clamour
abroad, and noise in the streets, God chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
this more soft, easie way, by putting
his power into the word preached by man,
so making it effectual to what degree he
pleases. Thus God gets within us ere we are
aware, his word spoken by man, comes
home to our hearts with power, in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and demonstration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
shewing us the way of Salvation.</p>
               <p>Having thus led you to the Text, by
these things that are impli'd in it, and must
be first supposed, in order to a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the words read to you, which
I shall now speak more directly to.</p>
               <p>1. As relating to <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>The words of the Text, are part of that
Prophecy which <hi>Zacharias</hi> uttered, when
he was filled with the Holy-Ghost, <hi>vers.</hi> 67.
Concerning Christ, and concerning <hi>John;</hi> he
begins with Christ, great things he speaks
of him, lays open the whole mystery of the
Gospel, and of the Churches Salvation by
Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:98282:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Then in the same breath continuing his
Discourse, he makes a sudden Transition,
and directs his Speech to the Infant <hi>John</hi>
then present, as I suppose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou child shalt be called;</hi> and here is
a description of his Person, and <hi>thou child.</hi>
And of his Office, <hi>shalt be called a Prophet
of the highest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> was to teach them the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
to tell them the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
was at hand, and to call them to Faith and
Repentance, in order to the remission of
sin.</p>
               <p>The time of <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry was a middle
state, between the Law and Gospel,
between <hi>Moses</hi> and Christ; he is preferred
before all the Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 11. And
yet as to clearness of light, inferior to the
Apostles and Gospel-Ministers in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
state of the Church; though he knew
more than all that were before him, yet he
saw less than they who came after him;
<hi>This John is the voice of one crying in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
exhorting the people to believe on him that
should come after him,</hi> Acts 19. 4. Christ, as Man
was six Months younger than <hi>John,</hi> came a
little after into the world, and a little after
him into the Ministry; it was meet it should
be so; <hi>John</hi> being his fore-runner, a Messenger
sent before to prepare the way. <hi>Mark</hi> begins
his Gospel from the Ministry of <hi>John,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98282:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then the <hi>Judaical</hi> worship began to
cease, <hi>The Law and the Prophets were until
John,</hi> Luk. 16. 16. <hi>i. e.</hi> All the Prophets and
the Law prophesied until <hi>John, Mat.</hi> 11. 13.
They spoke of the <hi>Messiah</hi> to come; <hi>John</hi>
shews he is already come in the flesh, points
to him, <hi>Behold the lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world,</hi> John 1. 29. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>John</hi>'s Ministry is called the beginning
in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 1.
This Gospel-Administration we are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
began in <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, who brought
that New-Testament Ordinance of Baptism
into the Church.</p>
               <p>Thus much of that, which peculiarly
relates to <hi>John.</hi> I am now come to that
which relates.</p>
               <p>2. To a Gospel Ministry in general, and
shall shew you from this Text, what it is,
what you are to expect from it, what you
should aim at in your attendance upon it;
which is briefly this, <hi>viz.</hi> The knowledge
of Salvation for the remission of sin; this is
that which we are sent to teach, and
which you come hither to learn; if you
propose to your selves any other end than
his, you are not like to thrive under Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>In the Description of <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s Office,
we may see the nature, use, and end of a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98282:104"/>
Ministry, all must be called to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
who are imployed in it; they must
prepare the way, and seek to lead their
Hearers to Christ, Preaching remission of sin
through faith in him, shewing how all
flows from the tender Mercy of God, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth Christ as the true light of them
who sit in darkness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before Christ's time, the <hi>Patriarchs,
Priests, Levites,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> carried
on this Ministry: After Christ's Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>John</hi> the Baptist was the first Gospel-Minister;
after him, the Apostles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,
by an extraordinary Call; then
Pastors, and Teachers, as the ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Gospel, who continue still in
the Church, and whose duty still it is to seek
the Salvation of their Hearers, and Hearers
should come to learn the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Christ.</p>
               <p>To give knowledge of Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Not that Preachers can infuse knowledge
into their Hearers, none but God can do
this, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 17. There the words have
a greater Emphasis than here, when applied
to men, who only prepare the way by Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
afford some outward help to bring us
to the knowledge of Salvation; they do
<hi>aditum patefacere,</hi> they prepare the way,
make it plain, lay it open, setting before
you the <hi>credenda</hi> what you are to believe,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98282:104"/>
and do; they tell you, what way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
what manner and means, God has
made choice of, to bring about Salvation; for
they give us notice of all this, speaking in
a plain familiar manner, that men may
know what is contained in the Bible, what
the main drift and scope of the Gospel is,
which we cannot be ignorant of, when it's
told us in such plain and intelligible terms,
which if we do not stop our ears, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us, whether we will or no, of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the Bible; we cannot but conceive
something of the matter; they are willingly
ignorant, who being so taught, yet slight
all they hear, and won't regard it; where
there has been such an outward manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Truth, we may say as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.
2, 3. <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them
that are lost.</hi> Ministers should do what in
them lies, to help the understanding of
their Hearers; bringing down things to
their Capacities, giving the sense, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the people to understand the reading,
<hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 8. This is the way for a Minister
to save himself, and them that hear him,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. Many common Hearers can't
understand what they read and hear, unless
some man guide them, as the Eunuch said
of himself, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 30, 31. When we have
in handling the word, commended our
selves to every man's Conscience in the sight
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98282:105"/>
of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. we must leave the
success of our Ministry to him; whether
the word be a savour of life or death to him.
<hi>Paul</hi> may Plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> may Water, but
it's God who giveth all the encrease. You
see how Ministers give the Knowledge of
Salvation, by Publishing the Gospel, <hi>i. e.</hi>
by Preaching Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25. They
say to the People, what the Angel did to the
Shepherds, Luk. 2. 10, 11. <hi>Behold, I bring
you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to
all people, For unto you is born a Saviour,
which is Christ the Lord.</hi> A great multtitude
of the Heavenly Host, join with the Angel in
praising God for his <hi>good will towards men,</hi> v.
14. This is the Ministers work now, to
declare these glad Tidings, <hi>this faithful
saying, so worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sinners,</hi>
1 Tim. 1. 15. Christ commanded his Apostles
<hi>to go into all the world, and preach the gospel to
every creature,</hi> Mark 16. 15. To tell them
plainly, there is no other name under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by which we can be saved, but the
name of Christ. One would think this were
enough to set all the world upon enquiring
after Christ. <hi>But who hath believed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and to whom has the arm of the Lord been
revealed:</hi> Men will not receive this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that God hath given of his Son. We
who are Ministers, <hi>cannot finish our course
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98282:105"/>
with joy, and the ministry which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of the Lord Jesus, if we do not testifie
of the gospel of the grace of God,</hi> Act. 20.
24. And as for me, I would say with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
1 Sam. 12. 23. <hi>God forbid that I should
sin against the Lord, in ceasing to pray for
you, and to shew you the good and the right
way. He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having shewed, what this knowledge
or notice is, which Ministers give to
the People of the way of Salvation by
Christ; I shall now speak something of
the notice the People take of this, how they
resent it, how they receive it, what impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
it makes upon the generality of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.
They assent to it, seem to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of it, and do profess to believe it;
but in such a cold careless manner, that
they are not at all concerned in the matter;
Putting the greatest cheat upon themselves
that can be; 'tis below the reason of a man
in all it's other actings, to counterfeit know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in things so nearly relating to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and of so dreadful a consequence if
neglected, and not strictly attended to; to
profess to believe in Christ for Salvation,
and yet never come to him for that Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
never deal with him about it, is such a
gross piece of Hypocrisy and self-deceit;
that one would wonder men should be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98282:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of: Such a formal profession comes not
from any true conviction, or real belief of
what they profess; but from custom, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and a desire to be like other men;
they walk in the shadow of other mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
who have none of their own; they
take up the name of Believers, and say they
have Faith, when they know, or may
know they have none; such a feigned Faith
undoes Thousands.</p>
               <p>Since they say they have Faith, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it, how does it appear they have it
not?</p>
               <p>Appear!<note place="margin">Ans.</note> As plain as the Sun at Noon!
If a man say he is convinced there is but
one remedy in the whole World that can
cure that disease he is sick of, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
it when it's offered to him; I am sure
if he be in his right Wits, he lyes in saying
he is so convinc'd; what! convinced that his
House is on fire, and yet not call out for
help, and seek to quench it; or that this is
a Cup of Poyson in his hand, and yet drink
it off! This is to take away the force and
power of reason over man, to make him
unconcerned in, and for himself, even when
he is under the greatest sense of imminent
danger, that such a through conviction must
needs bring him to; nothing brings things
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98282:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nearer to a man's reason, then conviction
does; 'tis an Act of the understanding, by
which he owns and acknowledges that for
truth, which he never assented to before;
it is not a meer Speculation only, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the Judgment of a practical un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
about a matter that meerly
concerns himself; telling him, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
must be done in the case. Those in the
<hi>Acts,</hi> when convinced, cry out, <hi>Men and
brethren, what shall we do?</hi> they knew
something was to be done, they bestir
themselves under their convictions. What
shall we say of those who sit still under a
profession of Faith, and do nothing? Let
them say what they will, they are not
convinced, they do not indeed believe,
though they read and hear the Scriptures,
and own their Divine Authority; what
then, if the Spirit come not along with the
word, there is that cursed Principle of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
in their hearts, that will be too hard
for the Word and the Minister to; they will
put the Word from them, and if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
come up close to them, and say, Thou
art the man, they will fly in his face too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he does not Prophesy good to them.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Preacher's Power of binding and loosing.</head>
               <p>I Have one thing more about a Gospel
Ministry, which I would mind you of,
and bring into practice; I see a necessity of
it, to awaken Professors in this declining
Age, where Religion seems to have lost its
Primitive Glory, and that powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that formerly it had upon the minds
of men, who stood more in awe of their
Religion, than we do now; gave another-gates
account of it to their own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
than I fear many now-a-days can
do.</p>
               <p>I conceive it belongs to the Office of a
Gospel Minister, not only to declare the
way of Salvation by Christ, and shew how
remission of sin is to be had; but also to
bind or loose their Hearers, as they do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
come up to the Word, or reject it;
and this done Authoritatively in the Name
of Christ, according to Scripture-rule,
is a real discharge, or a real Condemnation
of that person who falls under such a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>I don't speak of binding and loosing, as
'tis an Act of Church-Discipline, in casting
Offenders out of the Church, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98282:107"/>
them into it again upon their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
for so it is in use among us, and
in that sense only we generally take it.</p>
               <p>But I conceive there is a binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
mentioned in Scripture, distinct from
all Church-Censures in a way of Discipline,
and is always to follow the Preaching of the
Doctrine of the Gospel, loosing those from
their sins, who do believe it, and binding
their sins upon them who believe it not;
and this I take to be an essential part of a
Gospel Ministry. Where Ministers do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in any of their Hearers, a visible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the grace that is offered in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
they ought to be is readiness to avenge
all such Disobedience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6. by bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their sins upon them, pronouncing such
persons to abide under the wrath of God, 'till
they do by Faith embrace a Promise of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
Those two places, <hi>viz. Mat.</hi> 16. 19.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23. relate to the Doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
shewing what follows upon it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
do confirm the Authority of it, for the
comfort of those who believe it, and for
the terror of those who reject it. That
place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18. relates to the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church, in all publick Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
pass'd upon impenitent Offenders: So
that he who acknowledges his Fault, and
repents of it, being admonish'd by the
Church, is absolved, not only by man, but
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98282:108"/>
by God, and taken into the Communion
of the Church again. The Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> admits of binding and loosing in the
latter sense, but they engross it all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and apply it wholly to their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Penance.</p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> Anathematizes
those who allow the power of binding and
loosing in any sense to the ordinary Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the Gospel; but <hi>Calvin</hi> is expresly
against them; <hi>Non separanda est,</hi> says he,
<hi>haec potestas remittendi Peccata, à docendi
officio, i. e.</hi> The power of binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
must not be separated from the office
of an ordinary Gospel Minister. There be
other Scriptures to confirm this, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 19. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18. The sum of the Gospel is,
<hi>to preach deliverance to captives.</hi> So <hi>Luk.</hi>
24. 47. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12.
<hi>vide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am not for Popish Absolutions, but I
think it the Duty of Ministers to tell their
People whom God will save, and whom he
will not; whose sins are, and whose are not
remitted to them; and to do this Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively,
by a particular Application, that
may reach the persons themselves whom
they most suspect, ay, and privately to tell
them by name, that they are the persons
they meant, warning them to consider their
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98282:108"/>
danger, lest sudden Destruction from
the Lord do come upon them.</p>
               <p>'Tis evident that general Preaching does
little good without this; men shift it off, and
distinguish themselves out of the power of
Religion, think their Profession secures
them from all that is threatned in the word,
and denounced against the Prophane and
Ungodly; Doctrines and Exhortations won't
do, without this particular Application of
the blessing to whom it belongs, and of the
curse of God to them over whose Heads it
certainly hangs; we must do our Duty
herein; there be some weak ones, who can't
speak peace to themselves, we must speak
it to them in the Name of the Lord; there
be others who won't speak Terror to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but go on in their wickedness, and
bless themselves; I say it is out Duty to curse
them in the Name of the Lord, and plainly
tell them, <hi>that they who do such things, shall
not inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> Gal. 5. 21.
1 Cor. 6. 9. Eph. 5. 5.</p>
               <p>There are too too many now-a days
who count hearing the word a very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
thing. They can come to it, and
they can forbear; 'tis all one to them which
they do, they are not much concerned ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way; when they come, they think
hearing the word, if it does them no good,
'twill do them no harm. But there is a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98282:109"/>
great mistake here, let me tell you; there
is a blessing or a curse at the end of every
Sermon you hear, and one or 'tother will
certainly light upon you; Scoffers may puff
at the Judgments of God, and say, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
take too much upon them, in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such a peremptory Sentence on them;
what care they what men say; ay, but know
who ever thou art, so Sermon-proof in your
own opinion, that the Minister shall never
take hold of thee; I say, thou art by those
very words, those binding words pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against thee in the Name of the Lord
by a Minister of the Gospel, as surely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
already, as if thou were already in
Hell; the wrath of God will certainly
come upon you, unless you repent, and
so I leave you, think of it at leisure.</p>
               <p>If we do not our Duty, who have these
Keys committed to us, we shall be questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at the last day for not shutting this
man or that woman out of the Kingdom of
Heaven, whom we saw walking so disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
under so visible a neglect of their own
Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> This way of Preaching may grieve
the Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What! to hear that impenitent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
Sinners remaining so, shall never

enter into Heaven; if this grieve them,
they must be grieved, we can't help it;
better they grieved, than others eternally
Damn'd for want of such an awakening
word. <hi>Am I your enemy because I tell you the
truth;</hi> if so, I desire never to be friends
with you upon other terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren!</hi> What we do of this kind, <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante
clave,</hi> affects no man's Conscience:
But if you find that you are the persons to
whom God intends Comfort, you ought to
receive it; if the persons to whom the
Curse belongs, you ought to apply it to
your selves, and to tremble under it; for
what is bound on Earth, is bound in
Heaven: The Curse will certainly come
upon you, if you repent not; you may
reverse the Sentence we pass, by a speedy
turning to God before you dye; else 'twill
be confirmed against you at the last Day, to
your eternal Destruction, by an irreversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sentence. You will frequently find, it
may be not presently, that as you are bound
or loosed by the Preachers of the Gospel, so
suitable impressions of God's Love, or
Anger, are made upon your Souls, even
in this World. God does this to keep up
the Authority of his Ministers, that they
may effectually comfort Believers, and as
effectually terrifie Unbelievers; therefore
if we are bold against some, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98282:110"/>
and <hi>do use sharpness according to the power
which the Lord Jesus has given us for your
edification,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 10. For that we aim
at in all these denunciations of God's
wrath against the impenitent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5.
I say, if we come with a Rod, and seem
not so kind and gentle to you, as you
would have us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 21. If at any time
we are found unto you such as ye would
not, 'tis because we do not find you such

                  <p>Thus I have shewed you what is implied
in this Text: And till men are wrought

                  <list>

and under Condemnation by Law.</item>
                     <item>2. That there is no Salvation to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
or hoped for, without a full
and free Remission of all their Sins.</item>
                     <item>3. That this Remission of Sin can never
be obtained, till full satisfaction be
first given to the Law and Justice of

God, for all our Offences and Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
against him.</item>
                     <item>4. That none but Christ is able to
make this satisfaction for Sin.</item>
                     <item>5. That in order hereunto, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the
effecting and compleating this satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
the Son of God took our

be Eternally Saved.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Till we can prevail with our hearers to
own and acknowledge these Generals, 'tis
impossible they should Believe in the Lord
Jesus, to the saving of their Souls. That
Faith that is saving, does necessarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose
and include in it a real assent unto,
and full conviction of all the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Truths.</p>
                  <p>Possibly some will say, We know all this
already; have heard these things over and
over; it may be so, but pray hear them
over once more, and consider them well in

there is no other way of Salvation.
Sometimes it pleases God by one Text set
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98282:111"/>
home by the Spirit upon our hearts, to lead
us into a more serious consideration of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Truths relating to it, which we
formerly gathered out of the letter of the
Word, without any application of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

who are Ministers, must insist upon these
things; we have nothing else to say to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
till they are convinced of these truths;
this is the first opening of the Gospel; we
cannot proceed one step farther, till some
credit be given to these first Principles of
the Christian Religion. I hope you who
are here present, and do frequent this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
do attend upon the Ministry of

truths: Therefore give me leave to put

make them the same, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 6, 7. I
think they are so inseparably joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that no man, who has obtained the
Pardon of all his Sins, ever was, or can be
at a loss for a Righteousness to compleat his
Justification, and entitle him to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98282:112"/>
of Eternal Life promised in the Law.
I conceive the Pardon of all our Sins, is a
Righteousness we may boldly appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God in; because it lays before God
that full satisfaction that Christ made for
Sin, by his active and passive Obedience,
which is not only satisfactory for Sin, but
also meritorious of Eternal Life; so that
all the ends of Justification are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
in the Remission of Sin: What
precise conceptions we may have of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Sin, and imputation of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
as differing in the notion, will not
argue any real difference in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
We must have a care we do not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
what God has so intimately joined
together. This hath occasioned all those
unhappy Controversies about Justification,
as I shall shew anon. They who want a
sufficient Justifying Righteousness, after
the full Remission of all their Sins, do not
rightly resolve Remission of Sin into the
proper procuring causes of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
that Christ made for Sin by
what he did and suffered for us, from his
Birth to his Death; so it became him to
fulfil all Righteousness, that he might be
the end of the Law for Righteousness to
them who Believe: So that Christ himself
is our Righteousness, the Lord Jehovah
our Righteousness; the Law is as well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98282:113"/>
with what Christ hath Done and
Suffered for us, as if we our selves and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
kept the Law, or Died by it for our
Sins.</p>
               <p>'Tis dangerous separating Christ and his
Righteousness; as if we were to derive a
justifying-Righteousness from Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the Person of Christ: This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has insensibly led men to seek a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
in themselves, not wrought out for
them, but wrought in them by Christ;
this indeed is the right way of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but not of our Justification. The
Scripture directs us to seek our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Person of Christ only, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
him, Believing in him; to them is
Remission of Sin Promised, and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. <hi>John</hi> 3. 15, 16. <hi>John</hi>
6. 40, 47. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>Acts</hi>
10. 43. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18.</p>
               <p>Some do too nicely distinguish between
freedom from Punishment, and a right to
eternal Life; as if one could be obtained
without the other, which is impossible:
Certainly not to Die, is to Live; not to
Die eternally, is to Live eternally; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
of Darkness, is the bringing in of
Light: He who is counted worthy to
escape the Punishment threatned by Law,
is worthy to receive the Reward promised
by Law; I see not what should hinder it,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98282:113"/>
since no fault of Omission or Commission
can be charged upon him whose Sins are
Pardoned.</p>
               <p>If after the full Remission of all our
Sins, we were to receive eternal Life from
the Law, then some Righteousness di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from Pardon, a Righteousness
wrought by our selves after Pardon, would
be antecedently necessary to our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto life: But that is not so, for every
Pardoned Sinner receives eternal Life from
the hand of Free-Grace, as the Gift of
God, freely given, without any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any works of Righteousness done
by us. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Knowing that a man is not
justified by the works of the law, but by the
faith of Jesus Christ; even we have believed
in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by
the faith of Christ, and not by the works of
the law, for by the works of the law shall no
flesh be justified. If there had been law which
could have given life, verily righteousness
should have been by the law,</hi> Gal. 3. 21. But
since the Law does not give Life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Righteousness that lets us into
eternal Life, is not of the Law, but that
of Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
               <p>The Law admits of no Pardon, allows
of none, is not at all concerned about that
matter, but seeks its own satisfaction in a
way of strict justice; the Law is all for
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98282:114"/>
Justice; Mercy comes in by another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:
'Twas never in the nature and
constitution of the Law, to give life to a
Sinner; the Law can't do that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.
It can give life to a Righteous man, but
not to a Sinner; The Law will prosecute
him to death; 'twould act contrary to it
self, to its own eternal Sanction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
judgment, if it should do otherwise;
and therefore the Law as a Covenant of
Life and Death, is fully determined in the
Death of Christ towards all Believers, who
are no longer under the Law, but under
Grace.</p>
               <p>Yet I say, the rigour of the Law in it
self, is not relaxed by the Pardon of Sin,
only it does not exert its condemning
power upon the persons of Believers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ has already Suffered for their
Sins; but still the Law remains, and ever
will remain a Sin-condemning, and Sin-avenging
Law, it has as much power as
ever to stay the Sinner, but it can slay him
but once; and the stroke of the Law is so
heavy in that case, that it need not smite
him a second time. Christ indeed being
God, as well as Man, recovered from that
deadly blow the Law gave him for our
Sins, and so saved himself and us. Here
is no relaxation of the Law, but a full exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it, full satisfaction given to it; the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98282:114"/>
whole debt is paid to the utmost farthing
by Christ our surety. Now all the Life,
Glory and Happiness that follows upon
this, comes in by Grace: Christ having
Redeemed us from the Curse of the Law
and the Law being fully satisfied, cannot be
against any thing that Christ shall do for
his Redeemed ones; he may freely bestow
what he will upon them, having brought
them under a Covenant of Grace; he may,
and he will pursue that Covenant to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
towards them for their good, till he
has made them as happy, as infinite Love
and Grace can make them: Sin being taken
away, and expiated by the Death of Christ,
Believers do pass over of course into his
Life; they Rise with him; he who has
called us into a Communion with him in
his Death, will not deny us Communion
with him in his Life and Resurrection;
otherwise the benefits accruing to us by his
Death in a freedom from Punishment,
would never have made us happy, had we
been quite shut out from his Life; 'twas
for that end he Died for us, that we might
Live for ever in him, by him, and with
him: The Law, and the works of the
Law, contribute nothing to this Life; and
for our Evangelical Holiness, that is but
the fruit and effect of this eternal Life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from Christ, already begun in us, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98282:115"/>
exerting it self gradually according to the
measure of our imperfect Sanctification
here: All our Evangelical works, are but
so many expressions of that new Life
which we are raised up unto in this World,
by the Power of Christ's Resurrection,
which hath a quickning influence upon our
Souls, raising us up to newness of Life:
There was some distance, though but a little
at first, between the Death and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ, only Three Days; during that
time they could not draw comfort from his
Death, till he Rose again: But since the
time of his actual Resurrection, the Death
and Resurrection of Christ stand closer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in our thoughts, and have a joint
Spiritual influence upon our Hearts; we
presently pass in the actings of our Faith
from one to the other; from the effects of
his Death, in the Pardon and Mortification,
of Sin, to the effects of his Resurrection,
in our Spiritual Vivification and quickning
up to new Obedience; thus the Death of
Christ lets us into his Life; being planted
together in the likeness of his Death, we
shall be also in the likeness of his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5. We deal with the Blood of
Christ for our justification from Sin; and
with the Spirit of Christ risen from the
Dead for our Sanctification: Did we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discern how our Sanctification flows
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98282:115"/>
from the Resurrection of Christ, as a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of that forgiveness of Sin purchased
by his Blood, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. we should not so
confound Justification and Sanctification,
as some do. So much as we ascribe to our
works in justification, so much we take off
from the Blood of Christ, to which the
whole of our Justification is ascribed: 'Tis
a Righteousness without works, by which
we are Justified; therefore it can never
pass thorough our hands; no part of it is
wrought by us; 'tis all imputed to us for
Pardon of Sin, that we may live and not
die; and this is Justification unto life.
Justification has different names in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
from the different respects it bears to
us: as we are obnoxious to Punishment,
'tis called Remission; as it relates to a state
of Sin, which is a state of servitude and
bondage, 'tis called Redemption; as we
are Enemies to God, 'tis called Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>
               <p>Remission of Sin is absolutely necessary
in order to Salvation; I will shew you the
necessity of pardon, and of Preaching this
Comfortable Doctrine to all.</p>
               <p>Having given you a general account of
that comfortable Gospel Doctrine, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the full and free remission of all our sins,
through Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; and
shewed you from Scripture, how the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98282:116"/>
of sin implies our Justification; I opened
to you that common distinction by which
Divines do well express the whole nature
of Justification, as consisting in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Sin, and imputation of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
and shewed you how these Two are
inseparably linked together whereever the
former is, <hi>viz.</hi> Remission of all Sin, there is
also the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> Imputation of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
I shall now proceed to the further
opening of the nature of Remission of Sin,
in these following Particulars:</p>
               <p>1. Remission of Sin does not change the
nature of Sin; that that which is Sin
should be counted no Sin, that Evil should
be called Good, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 20. Sin is as really
Sin after Pardon, as before; only Pardon
frees us from the guilt of Sin, takes away
<hi>meritum poenae,</hi> the deserved Punishment:
This it takes away, not from the Sin, but
from the Sinner only; still <hi>the wages of sin
is death, i. e.</hi> Sin deserves Death even after
'tis Pardoned, but this Death is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon him to whom Sin is Pardoned;
and this absolving from Guilt, is properly
the Justification of a Sinner as such in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but now looked upon by God, as
Righteous in Christ, by virtue of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
To make this yet more clear, take
it thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:98282:116"/>
Any act contrary to Law, is properly
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Transgression, or Sin; and Sin in
respect of its guilt binding us over to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
is called a Debt.</p>
               <p>The fact or action it self, cannot be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
because that which is done, is
done, and cannot be said not to be done;
yet the guilt of that evil act may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and is Remitted, when the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
which we have deserved is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
and this is properly pardon of Sin;
Sin is not imputed: To impute is an act of
Reason and Judgment, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>rationem
ineo, ratiocinando deduco,</hi> 'tis a mental act,
a rational inference, or conclusion from
such premises. So when applied to God,
'tis an act of Divine Reason and Wisdom;
to impute Sin is to deal with men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the just demerit of sin, to give it its due
reward, its wages according to reason and
justice; 'tis an act of the Divine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
God does think with himself,
what Sin deserves, and doth resolve upon
the Punishment of it, as a thing most just
and reasonable.</p>
               <p>So not to impute Sin, or to forgive Sin,
is not to enter into Judgment with the
Sinner, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 2. according to the
strict terms of the Law of Works: For
when God so enters into Judgment with us,
the reason of the Law, and Justice of God,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98282:117"/>
must needs carry it against the Sinner; and
yet not to impute Sin, is an act of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too, an act of Divine Reason and
Understanding in God: But in this act of
Judgement, whereby God does not impute
Sin, God judges of sin according to the terms
of the New Covenant, having in his Eye, and
under his Consideration, the full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Christ has made for Sin; upon this
account he judges it most reasonable not to
impute Sin to those for whom Christ has
died. <hi>Civilians</hi> do admit of a supposed
imaginary solution, when really nothing
is paid; this among men is to forgive the
Debt, <hi>acceptum ferre:</hi> Whence comes the
term, <hi>Acceptilatio,</hi> the Creditor counting
the Money as Received, which he forgives
the Debtor. But in God's forgiveness,
there is a great deal more than this, here is
real payment made, full satisfaction given
by Christ our Surety; and the Grace of
Pardon lies in the free application of all this
unto us; this is God's Grace towards us;
yet the Pardon of the Sins of Believers,
is but justice towards Christ; 'tis Grace
towards us, that God should accept
of satisfaction from the hand of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but upon full satisfaction given,
'tis an act of Justice to remit the
Debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:98282:117"/>
2. Pardoning Grace takes away that that
makes a man unrighteous in the sight of God,
it takes away sin; how that is, I have in part
shewed already, and shall more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate.
'Tis evident, that Gods counts
them righteous whose sins are pardoned,
and that he has nothing in his eye then, but
the full satisfaction Christ made for sin;
which is the Foundation of Pardon, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
meritorious of eternal Life; it was not
only bare satisfaction that Christ made, for
that is but Justice, paying what is due, not
a Penny over or under; but in Christ's satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
there is a redundancy of Merit,
procuring Grace and Glory for us; the
Merit of Christ procures the favour of God
for us, and a right to all the blessings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
in the Gospel, and his Spirit effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
applies all this to us, and works all this
in us.</p>
               <p>3. Remission of sin, as it is held forth and
offered in the Gospel, presupposes nothing
in man, as the cause and condition of it,
moving God to pardon him, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
God's gracious Indulgence towards
him, not reckoning his sin to him, upon
his believing in Christ; see how pardoning
Grace finds us, Col. 2. 13. <hi>And you being
dead in your sins, and the uncircumcision of
your flesh, hath he quickned together with him,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98282:118"/>
having forgiven you all trespasses.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi>
8. 10, 11, 12. God does not eye any Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
in us, but promises to do all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
<hi>I will, and they shall,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>'Tis objected, That Faith is the beginning
of Sanctification, and if Faith be required
unto Justification, then some part at least
of our Sanctification is required unto justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No part at all; for though Faith
be a supernatural Principle infused by God
in order to our Sanctification, as well as
our Justification; yet it first Justifies before
it Sanctifies; I speak of Faith now, not in
its first Principle, but in its first actings; I
say, it first acts upon Christ by receiving
him, before it begins actually to sanctify us;
there is a great difference between the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentality
of Faith in receiving Christ
for our Justification, and the efficacy of
Faith applying Christ received for our
Sanctification; to speak properly, 'tis not
God's working Faith, but Faith working
in us, and upon us, that Sanctifies; God
always gives Christ in and with our first
Faith for Justification and Pardon, this
must be first finished and compleated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Faith will or can begin to sanctifie us,
because Faith fetches all its sanctifying Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
from Christ received; but our first act
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98282:118"/>
of receiving Christ, is that that justifies:
Sanctification always follows upon it, and
is gradually carried on by a justifying Faith
to our lives end: in is not pardoned because
it is mortified; but because it is pardoned,
therefore it's mortified.</p>
               <p>Remission of sin presupposes no real
change in the man himself, as moving God
thereunto: Neither does remission of sin
alter the nature of sin, but only the state
of the Sinner; his sin is not imputed to him:
To forgive sin is, not to remember it, <hi>Jer.</hi>
31. 34. There 'tis; but God won't look
towards it, his thoughts are so taken up
with the blood of Christ, and the Interest
that Believers have in that blood, that he
willingly forgets their sins, <hi>he will not deal
with them after their sins, nor reward them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their iniquities,</hi> Psal 103. 10. And
that they may be sure of this, <hi>he casts their
sins into the depths of the sea,</hi> Mich. 7. 19. <hi>As
far as the east is from the west, so far hath he
removed our transgression from us,</hi> Psal. 103.
12. Not only from himself, but from us,
he sees no iniquity in <hi>Jacob.</hi> If pardoning
Grace does not presuppose, but make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
change in a man for the better, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as we are imperfectly Sanctified,
the Pardon of sin, and the being and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of sin may and do consist together in
every true Believer here below, provided
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:98282:119"/>
they do not allow themselves in the practise
of it.</p>
               <p>4. Remission of sin is an act of Mercy, not
Justice, yet not contrary to Justice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the sins that are pardoned to us, are
punished in Christ; 'tis from God's Justice
that he will not pardon sin without satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
'tis from his Mercy that he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of satisfaction from the hand of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>This answers that plausible Objection
that is commonly made against our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> Wicked men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for their evil works, therefore Saints
are justified for their good works. <hi>Answ.</hi>
This does not follow, because one is an act
of Justice, and the other of Mercy. Rom.
6. 23. <hi>The wages of sin is death, but the gift
of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.</hi> Death is wages due by Law; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life is a free gift through Jesus
Christ.</p>
               <p>5. Remission of sin, as 'tis an act of
Mercy, so 'tis act of Power too; God
has Power to forgive sin; none but the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
can forgive the Debtor; God is the
greater Creditor, and we are all his Debtors;
<hi>against thee only have I sinned;</hi> therefore God
only has Power to forgive sin; but yet it is
not an act of mere absolute Power neither,
but an act of Divine Jurisdiction, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98282:119"/>
in it a due respect unto the Law, which
God as the righteous Judge, and most wise
Governour of the world will not violate.
Therefore Remission of Sin, under this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
that God has made in Christ for
the satisfaction of his Law and Justice, is
called Justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 6. God is
Just as well as Merciful in Pardoning Sin,
<hi>Rom</hi> 3. 25, 26. So that Pardon flows from
the Love of God, acting towards us for
Christ's sake, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon the account of his
Merit and Satisfaction, which respect the
Justice of God: The truth is, the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ is the foundation of Pardon;
this satisfaction lyes in the expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
offered by Christ upon the Cross; hence
expiation or atonement, is joyned with
pardon in Scripture. Numb. 15. 25. Levit.
4. 20. <hi>The priest was to make an atonement,
that the sin should be forgiven;</hi> An expiatory
Sacrifice led the way to forgiveness under
the Law, and so it does now under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
without shedding of Blood, there is
no remission of sin: If you have not the
Blood of Christ is your eye, when you go
to God for Pardon, never think to speed.</p>

               <head>The APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>I Shall shut up all with a word of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
urging every one of you to a
frequent, deep, serious consideration of this
grand fundamental truth, concerning the
only way of Salvation by the remission of
sin through Faith in Christ Jesus. I know
the time will shortly come, when all our
Notions, and Disputes must be resolved into
our believing or not believing in Christ for
Pardon of sin; therefore be perswaded to
begin your Religion in pure Faith trusting
in Christ only for the remission of all your
sins, through the merit of his Blood; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
here, lay this as the Foundation of all
your Religion, make this sure, and then
you will more clearly see upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
you stand righteous before God; if
you joyn any thing with Christ here, and
miss your way in the first setting out, you'll
go wider and wider from the Gospel every
stop you take, and be forced to wrest the
Scriptures all along, to make good your
first grand mistake; therefore I say, beg of
God to bring your hearts to a true reliance
upon the free-Grace and Mercy of God in
Christ Jesus for the pardon of all your sins.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98282:120"/>
Take this as a clue in your hands to guide
you into such an understanding of all other
truths, as is consonant to this; put no other
sense upon any Scripture that is not consistent
with, and agreeable to this great fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Principle, keeping close to the just analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of Faith, in all your tenents and opinions:
I know there are other things to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
besides Remission of Sin; but be sure
you begin here, don't suppose that some
previous qualifications in your selves are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to incline God to pardon your sins,
for this will carry you unavoidably into a
self-righteousness, and then Christ will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
you nothing. We are not pardon'd because
we repent and lead holy lives, but we repent
and lead holy lives, because we are fully Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
for Christ's sake: Shut all self-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
out of your justification, and take
all that is Christ's into it, both his active
and passive Obedience; though I had rather
joyn them together as the Scriptures do,
and say, <hi>That by the obedience of one man,
many are made righteous, i. e.</hi> by the
Obedience of Christ in Suffering and doing
all that the Law required: And in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of this Grace to us, 'tis clear to me,
that upon the Remission of all our Sins,
Righteousness is imputed to us; and this is
that which the Apostle calls Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
without works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. The
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98282:121"/>
Righteousness of works, so far as it can be
attained in this life, is but an effect of the
Righteousness of Faith. You know not
the right way of Salvation, till you know
how to obtain the Pardon of all your Sins;
then you will see how Christ is become
your Righteousness. Let us not be too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in placing one part of our Justification
upon his Passive, and another part upon
his Active Obedience. Let us be sure to
place all upon Christ, and then we are
right; the Spirit does not reveal the whole
Mystery of Christ at once to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
there is a great deal of Christ to be
learned by those who are Justified and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
even after they are in a state of
Grace. Let us believe Christ to be our
Righteousness, and leave it to him to make
out the way and manner of his being so:
Our terms and distinctions applied to the
fundamental Points of Religion, have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
many mistakes about them.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore attend more strictly to
the simplicity of our own Faith, and not
call in our Reason to prompt our Faith, but
rather submit our Reason to the instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Faith. I would have all Christians
study their own Faith more, and dwell
more in the light of it; then they will be
more familiarly acquainted with it, and
better understand themselves in every act of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98282:121"/>
Faith they put forth. Let us give our
Faith time to act, to open it self further to
us, and our selves time to take in the full
sense of our Faith: Generally our acts of
Faith are too short, sudden, and transient.
We make a formal profession of Faith, and
say, We believe in Christ for the Pardon of
Sin, but don't so well weigh and consider
what we say, or what we bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eve; we
turn off presently to something else, as if
we had done with our Faith, when the
Mystery of it is not half apprehended by
us: We should attend to it, ponder it well
in our minds, look round it; this is the
way to keep up a presence of mind in us
about what we Believe. One act of Faith
attended to, will fill us with such thoughts
and apprehensions of the Love of Christ,
that will furnish us with matter of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
for many days: But I don't find
Professors so much concerned in their own
Faith; so much affected with it as they
should; they pass it over as a plain ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
piece of Religion, and having once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
they believe in Christ for the Pardon
of Sin, they have no more to do with him:
Whereas the Mystery of Faith should be
studied all our lives long, we should pray as
<hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Eph</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>7, &amp;c. vide. <hi>That we may
know what is the hope of his calling, and what
the riches of the glory of his inheritance in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98282:122"/>
the Saints.</hi> Faith has more in it than most
People are aware of: 'tis not so easy a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to know, comprehend, and remember
what is contained in an act of Saving-Faith;
we should discourse more with our own
Faith, look into all particulars, search to
the bottom, by gathering up more and
more of the unsearcheable riches of Christ.
He that would judge of a curious piece of
Workmanship, brings it to the light, views it
round in every part, till he has gathered up
all the excellencies of it into his mind, then
he can speak knowingly, in the praise and
commendation of such a thing, having
made observations before of all that was
admirable in it. So you should sit down and
consider the consequence of an act of Faith
upon Christ for Justification and Pardon;
what depends upon it, what you gain by it,
what you expect from it, all is yours if Christ
be yours; therefore be persuaded to enter into
your Chambers and Closets; sit down with a
Bible in your hands, stir up your Faith,
consider the state of a Believer, and then
gather up what makes for your comfort out
of the Word of God. O how would your
Faces shine! you would be filled <hi>with joy
unspeakable, and full of Glory,</hi> by Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
there is not that Joy among Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
because they don't think enough of
what they Believe. Do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you Believe in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98282:122"/>
Christ for the Remission of Sin? Then
there is a great deal in Christ, a great deal
in Sin, a great deal in the actings of thy
own Soul under this Faith, to be considered
of: The knowledge, experience, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Faith, are things that should be
particularly examined and seriously thought
of: There is a full business in Faith, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to imploy a gracious Soul all his
days; Faith fills the mind with deep ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of our own great concernments
in Christ Jesus. Were we wise indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Salvation, we should think of nothing
oftner, than of what we believe; there
may be Faith, and there may be Truth in
the heart, and yet these Two may not be
sufficiently mingled together; therefore
we should often apply our Faith to the
Word, that what it does not see at one
time, it may see at another; what it does not
reach by one act, it may take in by the next.
The oftner Faith looks into the Word, the
more distinctly does it gather up the
full sense of the Word; it dwells in us
in more Wisdom and Spiritual Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
Did we take this course we
should quickly find the benefit of it,
out of our Bellies would flow Rivers of
living water; we should be more skilful
in the word of Righteousness, more expert
Believers, ready to give a reason of the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98282:123"/>
hope that is in us; Believers have much to
say in defence of Christ, the Gospel, and
their own Profession; and the more they
study the point, the more ready are they
to give an answer to them, who ask them
any questions about their Religion; they
keep the word fresh in their Memories, by
reflecting often upon it, conversing much
with it. Whilst I am exhorting you to a
more frequent Consideration of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of Christianity, don't mistake me,
as if I were putting you upon reading
many Books, upon studying Controversies,
and knotty Disputes; no, no, study your
own hearts and the Bible more; keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the power of those truths that are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
revealed: We lose much of the joy of
Faith, by diverting our Minds to things of
an inferior Nature; I observe among all
sorts of Professors, there is more stir about
uninstituted things, more zeal for their own
unscriptural Traditions and Customs,
than for the grand fundamentals of Faith
and Holiness; there is utterly a fault among
us in this matter. If you would keep up
the joy of your Salvation, you must consult
often with your Faith about the prime fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of Religion, and muse often up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; examine your Faith about them;
consider what a priviledg it is to have all
your sins blotted out, and laid upon Christ,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98282:123"/>
who shed his Blood for the remission of
them; you must think, and think again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, till you find your hearts overcome
with the sense of God's Free-Grace towards
you in Christ. You cannot conceive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
what further Light will break
forth, what further Discoveries God will
make of the Mystery of his Grace; one
thought rises strangely out of another in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mediation; things come into our minds,
that all our hearing and reading could
not furnish us with; when we are in our
thoughts pursuing spiritual truths through
all the consequences of them, there is that
let into our minds, which before we were
not in a fit posture to receive or understand,
but when Faith hath set all before us which
we have attained unto, and drawn, as it
were, a Scheme of the whole Gospel in our
minds, the Spirit knows how to carry
on his work further in such a Soul.</p>
               <p>Having already given you a general,
and also a more particular account of the
nature of remission of sin; I shall now

is this, <hi>viz.</hi> To shew you</p>
               <p>2 How Salvation consists in the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all our sins. And to make way to
this, I shall speak something of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98282:124"/>
of remission of sin, in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
which can never be attained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</p>
               <p>The necessity of Forgiveness, and of
Preaching this comfortable Doctrine to
all.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Because all have sinned, and come short
of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 23. and are
therefore liable to Condemnation.</p>
               <p>2. No man is able to make satisfaction for
his sins; if we could, we should not need
a Pardon.</p>
               <p>3. There is no escaping Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
no flying from Justice; and <hi>it's a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing to fall into the hands of a living
God;</hi> if this be so, then either sin must
be Pardoned, or we must perish under it;
therefore, blessed is that man whose Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are forgiven.</p>
               <p>Further to evidence the necessity of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
consider this, <hi>viz.</hi> That all our
Sanctification, all our inherent holiness, all
our good works, will stand us in no stead
without a Pardon, because of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and sin that cleaves to them; this
makes Pardon so necessary; to remit sin, is
not to condemn us for sin; <hi>he that bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eveth
on him, is not condemned,</hi> John 3. 18. Not
to condemn, is to justifie; to justifie, is not to
impute sin, but to impute righteousness
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98282:124"/>
without works; either the sin that cleaves
to all our good works must be imputed to us,
or else a righteousness must be found out
for us without works, that does not touch
upon any of our works, but is imputed to
us, not done by us; man fell by his own
sin, but he rises by anothers righteousness,
which covers all his sins.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <head type="sub">How Salvation consists in the Remission of
Sin.</head>
               <p>THE knowledge of Salvation that
the Law gave, was by a legal
Righteousness in keeping the whole Law;
That which the Gospel gives, is by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sin.</p>
               <p>How Salvation consists in this, <hi>viz.</hi>
remission of sin.</p>
               <p>Because it takes away that which hinders
our Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> The guilt of sin, and the
wrath of God.</p>
               <p>The expiatory Sacrifices under the Law,
were called Sin-Offerings, because the sin
of the people; <hi>i. e.</hi> their guilt was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Sacrifice, and laid upon that;
<hi>it was to bear the iniquity of the Congregation,
to make atonement for them before the Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:98282:125"/>
Levit 10. 17. <hi>i. e.</hi> The sin was imputed
to the Sacrifice; the wrath of God, and
the Punishment due by Law for sin, was
inflicted upon the Sacrifice; in this sense
<hi>Christ is said to be made sin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.
21. Because he suffered in our stead, <hi>his
own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,</hi>
1 Pet. 2. 24. He bare our sins, alluding to
the Sacrifices that were lifted upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<hi>this is to offer up sacrifice,</hi> Heb. 7. 27.
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>sursum tollo.</hi> So
Christ lifted up, or took up the heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of all our sins upon his own back. God
looked upon Christ, lying under the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of our sins, as the object of his wrath,
and vengeance, that he might ever after
look upon us, under the imputation of his
righteousness, as the objects of his love and
delight; to bear iniquity, is to suffer the
punishment due for it, <hi>Levit. 5. 1. To bear
iniquity, and to be cut off for it, is all
one,</hi> Levit. 20. 17. <hi>He shall bear his
judgment,</hi> Gal. 5. 10. <hi>The blood of the
sacrifice was to make atonement for the soul of
man,</hi> Levit. 17. 11. I am shewing you
how remission of sin, takes away guilt by
a non-imputation of it to us; God forgives,
as men forgive. Mat. 6. 12, 14. <hi>Forgive
us our debts, as we forgive our Debtors.</hi> So
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 21. 35. Among men, Debts are
remitted, when nothing is required of the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98282:125"/>
Debtor; the Creditor counts the Money as
received, which he remits to the Debtor;
so it's in our Justification, God deals
with Believers, as with those for whose sins
he hath received satisfaction, though not
from their hands, yet from Christs; so
their sins are Pardoned and taken away. The
same word, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 25. That we
render Pardon, signifies to take away,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp; nunc tolle peccatum

                  <hi>abstulit, condonavit,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
so takes away sin, that God will not
visit it upon us, he will not require it;
which <hi>Joseph</hi>'s brethren feared their brother
would; <hi>Joseph will peradventure hate us, and
will certainly requite us all the evil which we
did unto him. Reddendo reddet,</hi> in requiting,
he will requite; <hi>i. e.</hi> he will fully requite
this evil, he will make it revert upon our
own heads; so the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies from

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>redire fecit:</hi> Both these significations
are to be carried into the Construction of
these Texts, <hi>viz.</hi> That remission takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
sin; and the taking away of sin is the
remission of sin, by which a sinner is
freed from the guilt of sin, from the curse
of the Law, and from the wrath of God;
hence it appears, that Salvation lies chiefly
in remission of sin. Psal. 32. 1, 2. <hi>Blessed
is he whose transgressions is forgiven, blessed
is he whose sin is covered, blessed is the man
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98282:126"/>
unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.</hi>
Neither does the consideration of any good
works done by man, come in as a motive for
God to pardon our sins, because to pardon
sin, is to impute Righteousness without
works: <hi>i. e.</hi> God looks upon pardoned sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
as righteous, through Faith in Christ,
though their works be not answerable to the
Law of Righteousness laid down in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works. Christ comes in, in the
room and place of our Good Works, and
Free Grace confers that upon us for Christ's
sake, which our own Good Works were to
procure for us under the Law: <hi>For by grace
are ye saved, through faith, and that not of
your selves; it is the gift of God; not of
works, lest any man should boast,</hi> Eph. 2. 8, 9.
<hi>Thus Christ is the end of the law, for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10. 4.
The end of the Law, under the Mosaical
Dispensation, whether Moral or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
was to lead a sinner to Christ for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
this Righteousness lies in the full
satisfaction that Christ made to the Law,
for the sin of man; we must bring to the
Law, either a perfect Righteousness of our
own, or a full satisfaction for all our sins,
which is equivalent to man's perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and not only equivalent, but much
beyond it; for our own perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
had we continued in it, would have
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98282:126"/>
kept us in a happy Paradisical state here on
earth. I know Divines speak of our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
afterwards into Heaven; but of that
the Scripture is silent; 'tis evident, that had
we kept the Law, we had not died; but
upon the satisfaction Christ has made to the
Law, we obtain Eternal Life, have a more
abundant entrance into the Kingdom of
Heaven; and this satisfaction accepted for
us, is in the infinite merit of it, our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
Thus the Law obtains its end, in
that full satisfaction that Christ gave it for
the sin of man, and can demand no more of
any believing sinner for his Justification;
it becomes the Law to bring things to a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Conclusion between the Justice of
God and a sinner. The Law cannot do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly,
but is righteous in condemning the
Unbeliever, and righteous in passing by the
Believing sinner. If any ask, How comes
a Believing sinner to escape the Vengeance
of the Law, to get out of the hands of a
sin-revenging Law? <hi>Answ.</hi> Because the
Law hath obtained its end in Christ, and
done full execution upon him for the sin of
man, to its own satisfaction; and this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
a man from the curse of the Law, as
much as his own perfect righteousness would
have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:98282:127"/>
The Papists deny the imputation of
Christ's Righteousness, and derive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Sin from inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
whereas inherent Righteousness
never frees us from all Sin in this World;
he is a liar who says he hath no Sin: But
imputed Righteousness is opposed to all
Sin in us, and covers it all. <hi>We are
holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable in
the sight of God,</hi> Col. 1. 22.</p>
               <p>New Obedience, and the practice of
Holiness, is the consequent of Pardon;
which must not be taken for a permission,
or licence to Sin. Pardoning-Grace lays
a strict injunction upon us to Sin no more,
as Christ did upon the man whom he healed
at the Pool of <hi>Bethesda, Behold, thou art
made whole; sin no more lest a worse thing
come upon thee,</hi> John 5. 14. Christ Died
primarily for our Justification from all Sins
committed by us; and also for our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
to prevent the Commission of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sin, <hi>To that end he purchased for us his
holy spirit, that we might live to God,</hi> 2 Cor.
5. 15. <hi>That being dead to sin we should live
to righteousness,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>The blood of
Christ purges the conscience from dead works
to serve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. <hi>There
are two special parts of the covenant of grace,</hi>
Heb. 8. 10, 11, 12. <hi>viz.</hi> Remission of sin,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98282:127"/>
and a change of Heart and Nature, they
always go together; to fancy a change of
State, without a change of Nature, is but
a fancy.</p>
               <p>Though Justification be a continued act,
yet that it may be continued to us in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
sense of it, Believers must sue out
their Pardon for every new sin, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
acts of Faith, apply the Blood of
Christ in particular for the Pardon of this
or that sin. In Justification, all sin is Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
past, present, and future, that no
place may be left for Condemnation, <hi>John</hi>
5. 24. Sins to come are virtually Remitted
to a Believer, <hi>i. e.</hi> we are by Faith put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a state of Pardon, Faith knows whither
to go for Pardon upon all occasions: Tho
the Commission of new sins does not cast a
Believer out of a state of Grace, does not
null and make void his former Justification
in the sight of God, yet he may lose the
comfortable sense of it in his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and lye under (though not judiciary
Punishments) yet under such castigatory
Chastisements from an Angry Father, that
may be a great bitterness of Soul unto him,
till by a renewed act of Faith he does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
himself to Christ for Pardon, and
make his peace with God. Faith it self can't
speak peace to an impenitent Believer, who
as to this or that sin may be called impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:98282:128"/>
though as to his state he be a Believer.
Till Faith do bring down the Blood of
Christ by a particular application of it to
the Conscience of a man for the Pardon of
this or that particular sin, he may and will
be very uneasy under it; and the longer
Repentance is deferred, the more angry
reflections will Conscience make against
that man; he may be brought to question
his own state by deferring his Repentance
so long: Care must be taken to set upon
this work of Repentance out of hand, and
when we go about it, we must still keep
Christ in our eye, and not sorrow as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope; that sorrow for sin, that in the
beginning may be Godly sorrow, may by
the cunning of the Devil rise so high, as to
become ungodly sorrow, sinking the Soul
into despair: Many do begin in the Spirit,
and end in the Flesh; therefore care must
be taken to keep our selves in a due temper
of mind, that we be not overwhelmed with
sorrow; that sorrow for sin that hinders
us from coming to Christ is sinful, and not
to be allowed in a Christian. So that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is required not as a previous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of our Justification, but as that
without which no man can, or will ever
come to Christ for Justification; Faith first
works Repentance under a secret hope of
Pardon, and then applies Christ not for the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98282:128"/>
sake of Repentance, but because by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
a man becomes willing to receive
Christ; 'tis a vain thing to pretend to
Faith in Christ for Pardon, unless we see
the Fruits of Faith in our selves, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of all other Graces, and in those
good works of Holiness that always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
Saving-Faith. Faith never speaks
but in some act, it never gives a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sense of it self, but in some present act,
now 'tis impossible truly to act Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an universal consent of the Soul to this
act; it diffuses its influence all over the
Soul, touches the Soul in every part,
strikes upon every string, puts the whole
Soul in tune; every thing in a man does
answer and correspond to such an act of
Faith; you may see your Faith in your
Hope, Love, fear, Zeal, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
All Graces rise or fall as Faith does, 'tis like
the spring of a Watch, it sets all the
Wheels in motion. We may have a clearer
discerning of Faith by a reflex act, whence
all assurance springs, then we can by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
act, though you cannot see your selves
closing in with Christ for Pardon; whilst
you only intend that thing, and would fain
prove Faith by it self and by its own justfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
act; yet if you look through your Love,
your Repentance, through all the fruits of
Faith in your Lives, you will more clearly
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:98282:129"/>
discern it in its Saving, Justifying Act,
that you do really and sincerely take Christ
as your only Righteousness, and to shew
that you do so, you produce those things as
proofs of your sincerity, which this Faith
hath put you upon, and which you could
never bring your selves to, till Faith came
drawing the whole Soul after Christ, and
strongly inclining you to a holy life; this
is God's way of teaching his Children, by
putting Principles of Faith and Holiness
into their Hearts, powerfully inclining
them to live to God; this is set forth by
God's teaching the Ants to provide their
Meat in the Summer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>i. e.</hi> God
inclines them naturally to do this; so does
God Spiritually incline his Children by his
Spirit dwelling in them, to act as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ought to do.</p>
               <p>The sum of all is this: The Justifying-Righteousness
of a Believing sinner before
God, lies in the Remission of sin, and
God's Gracious acceptation of sinful man,
upon the sole account of the Obedience of
Christ our Mediator, apprehended by Faith
and imputed to him for Righteousness;
thus the Righteousness of God without the
Law is manifest.</p>
               <p>In humane Judicatories, Forgiveness
implies a meer non-imputation of the fault
only, but no imputation of Righteousness;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98282:129"/>
because in our Courts, a man is Tried for
some particular Offence, and if he be found
Guilty, and through the Favour of the
Prince obtain his Pardon, that Pardon looks
no further than that time; for the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of his life he is accountable to the
Law, and must be Judged by it; he stands
upon his good Behaviour, and must be a
doer of Righteousness to avoid the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the Law; if not, he must
answer for his misdoing, and be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law. But 'tis not so in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
for when we obtain the Pardon of sin
by Faith, that Pardon is general and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
to a man's life's end; 'tis not only a
Pardon of this or that sin to such a time,
but a Pardon of all sins for ever; such
a Pardon does necessarily imply in it an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Righteousness, because no sin
can ever be imputed to him; his Pardon is
valid in all times to come; though the Law
be still a rule of Obedience, yet he is no
longer under the Law as a Covenant of life,
but under Grace; and for all his miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
under the New Covenant, he must
apply himself to the Grace of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
for Mercy and Pardon, but he shall
never be judged by the Law more; the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of Christ is instead of all legal
Righteousness to him, and to that he
stands, the Law having accepted of it,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98282:130"/>
delivers him up to Christ untouched by the
hand of Vengeance, to be governed ever
after by the Law of Grace, which esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes
the holiness of the Law; though it
shuts it out of our Justification, yet not out
of our lives, but strictly enjoins it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <head>The APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>SINCE God hath given us the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Salvation by the Remission of
sin, let us act according to that knowledge,
and begin our Religion with Remission of
sin; I mean, let us first study that point
well; when we are over that, are got into
the Mystery of that great Gospel-Truth,
we shall more clearly see upon what account
it is we are dealt with, looked upon, and
accepted as Righteous in Christ unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life.</p>
               <p>Faith ought to have both the active and
passive Obedience of Christ in its eye; but
I would not too nicely distinguish between
them, abstracting the active from the
Passive; ascribing the Remission of sin to
one, and our title to life to the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98282:130"/>
I find some who do so, apt to drop
the Righteousness of Christ; that will not
serve the turn; they must have a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of their own, an Evangelical righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
to strengthen their title to Life;
thus while they set up a Law of Grace
requiring such and such things to be done
by us in order to our Justification, they
turn Grace into Works, set up a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works, differing from the first on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this, that whereas the first Covenant
in Innocency justified upon the account of
perfect Obedience, this upon the account
of our imperfect Obedience.</p>
               <p>We know but in part, there will be some
difference among us in our Notions and
Conceptions of these things, and more in
our Words and Expressions; the same
thoughts in one and another seldom come
forth in the same words. I have offered you
what I take to be most agreeable to the
Mind of God; Do you search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and judge: I do conceive that the
New Covenant of Grace requires as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and perfect a Righteousness, nay, a
higher Righteousness for the Justification
of a Sinner, than the Law of Innocency
did for the Justification of a sinless man:
That was but the Righteousness of man;
this must be the Righteousness of God
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:98282:131"/>
reckoned or imputed to us, not his essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Righteousness, but that which is
wrought out for us by him who is God,
and which God approves of; and being thus
justified, God does graciously accept of our
sincere imperfect Obedience, together with
our persons. Let us not puzzle our selves
about a second Justification; get the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of all your sins sealed to you in the
Blood of Christ, and fear no after-charge
at the last day; that will answer all: I see
no room for a Second Justification. Can it
be imagined that defects of our Grace
here in this imperfect state, should be
brought in as proofs against the truth of
Grace in our perfect state hereafter: If
Grace in its perfection cannot sufficiently
evidence its Truth, I see not but there
may be matter of doubt among the Saints in
heaven it self, whether they be real Saints or
no. 'Tis the weakness and imperfection of
things, that casts them under a suspicion;
but when they shine out in their full beauty
and glory, there is no room for any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
Does any man question whether
the Sun be risen at Noon-day? If perfect
Day, will not pass for Day, then there is
no difference between Day and Night;
Light and Darkness must be all one.</p>
               <p>'Tis not a right way to a setled peace of
Conscience that some take, who instead of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98282:131"/>
an humble application to free Grace for the
Pardon of sin, do apply themselves to their
own goods works; considering how holy they
have been, how holy they are, how holy they
intend to be; and all this in order to their
Justification at last; 'tis a hard matter to
keep men humble under such thoughts,
they will be glorying in the flesh, and
think themselves something when they are
nothing: To look for Justification by our
own Holiness, will prove an ineffectual
motive unto Holiness; either they are
discouraged from the visible imperfection of
their Holiness, or else they grow remiss in
it, thinking that any thing will serve to
justifie them; since perfect Righteousness is
not required; such as they have must serve
the turn, rather then fail of eternal life;
any thing will do under the umbrage of (it
may be) but a pretended sincerity; a good
meaning must answer for a bad life; and
on they go in their wonted evil course;
all is but imperfection and weakness;
and the Covenant of Grace not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
perfection, will bear with that, and
pass it by.</p>
               <p>I confess there is Grace enough in
the Gospel to Pardon all, your sins; but
whether the best of you have good works
enough to justifie your Persons, you had
best see to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:98282:132"/>
I dare appeal to all your Consciences in
point of experience, whether you do not
find your selves growing more holy,
and conscientiously strict in your walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God, under an humble depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon the Free Grace of God in
Christ Jesus for the Pardon of all your sins,
than ever you did under your greatest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to save your selves by your own
works: The Grace of God teaches to deny
all ungodliness, and nothing will effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do it but that.</p>
               <p>The great question among us this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Justification, is, Whether our Good
Works, and Evangelical Righteousness,
have not some place in our Justification, as
con-causes, or social causes, having some
partial influence at least that way? I would
propound two Expedients for Peace.</p>
               <p>1. Since the main point of difference is
about the use of our Good Works at the
day of Judgment, when we shall be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially
justified, or pronounced just by
God, I would have the decision of this left
to that day; for I fear we are not likely to
agree sooner: Then 'twill appear, that
evidences of Faith are no cause of the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of our persons in the sight of God.
That will be resolved into pure Faith, rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Christ for Righteousness and life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:98282:132"/>
2. Since we cannot agree in the nature,
use, and proper ends of Evangelical Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
let us more strictly intend the
thing it self, and labour every one of us to
be more Evangelically holy and righteous
in our lives and conversations. Did we live
more by Faith in Christ Jesus, we should
quickly see how all good works rise out of
that Faith by which all true Believers are
already justified.</p>
               <p>All that <hi>An inomianism</hi> that the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Preachers of Free Grace are falsly
charged with, lies here; Because they
maintain, (and I hope ever will maintain)
that the first thing a convinced sinner is to
eye, in his turning to God, is the Free
Grace and Mercy of God in Christ for the
Pardon of Sin. Evangelical Conviction
leads him to a reliance upon Christ, in some
degree of Saving Faith, for the pardon of
all his Sins; and this Faith begets in him a
secret hope of Pardon, and is the spring of
all after Sanctification; <hi>viz.</hi> of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sin, of Repentance, of all new
Obedience. Let this be remembred as the
main thing we contend about, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
our Religion at the Grace of God, and
not think to ground our Faith in Christ,
upon any legal preparations, or works of
our own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:98282:133"/>
We ought not to hold a convinced sinner
one moment under Legal Terrors, without
making an offer of Grace in Christ to him.
I see not what should hinder a sinner under
the height of Legal Conviction, from hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself, as <hi>Judas</hi> did: I am sure a
thorough Legal Conviction of Sin, will
sink any man into utter despair, if Faith in
Christ come not in immediately to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:
Indeed those who are but half con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by the Law, and know not the strict
Spiritual sense of it, may betake themselves
to their works and duties, and think to save
themselves that way; but this is so vain a
thought, I will not spend time to confute it;
you who have lived so long under the
Light of the Gospel, can answer that your
selves.</p>
               <p>Besides: Pure Legal Convictions, have
a greater tendency to Despair, than to
Faith; they naturally work despair; but
'tis the work of God, a supernatural work
of his Spirit, that any under such Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are made to believe in Christ. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
becomes Evangelical in all who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and it is Faith makes it so: Evangelical
Conviction includes Legal: Faith indeed
pointing to Christ, abates something of the
Terror of the Law, and by a clearer Gospel-light
expounds the law into its true sense and
meaning, which no natural man can gather
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98282:133"/>
from the bare Letter of the Law; and thus
Faith by the Law, lets us further into the
knowledge of sin, than the Law alone,
without the Gospel, could ever do. And this
is that Faith we preach, as the beginning of
all true Conversion, and the only spring of
all true Holiness: We cannot begin to lead
a holy life, till we first look unto Christ by
Faith for the pardon of sin.</p>

qualified, he could not have been

us, <hi>bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh,</hi>
who undertakes that Office; therefore I
say, Christ took up that Body prepared of

into Heaven in it, is now glorified in it, to
shew what he intended to bring fallen Man
unto, <hi>as many as should believe in him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What was the price paid by

               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:98282:137"/>
Viz. <hi>His own Blood,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.
<hi>Pretium pretiorum,</hi> the greatest price that
ever was paid for any thing that ever was
bought; all the Gold and Silver in the
World heaped together, is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the value of the Blood of Christ;
by this you see the great love of Christ to
the Souls of Men, who in themselves were
hopeless and helpless; could do nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Redemption of their own Souls,
but Christ being God and Man, pours out
his Soul as man, and takes it up again as
God, when he had done his work, that we
might have a sure ground for our Faith and
Hope to rest upon; not doubting but as
Christ raised himself from the dead, so he
will also raise us at the last day, who dye in
him; that we may live by him, with him,
and upon him for ever; who is the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and the life, as his death is imputed
to us, and spiritually acted over upon us,
in the mortification of sin; so is his life
actually communicated in some degree to
all Believers here, by the same spirit that
dwells in him, and in them; and this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
spirit of life in Christ will never cease,
working higher and higher in the mystical
Body of Christ, diffusing it self more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
through all the Members, till Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity
be quite swallowed up of life; this
will be more manifest, when Christ, who
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98282:137"/>
is our life shall appear. You see that God
went not out of himself for a Mediator,
but appointed the Second person of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to that Office, that the whole transaction
between God and Man, might go through
his hands, who is both God and Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Who set he price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
so high?</p>
               <p>1. God the Father, who also found out
this Ransom; he knew the whole world
could not raise it; it must come out of the
Treasury of Heaven; God himself was at
the charge of our Redemption, and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it cost him, was resolved to effect it;
and therefore he spared not his own Son,
but parts with the greatest Jewel in the
Crown of Heaven, to buy off sinful man
from that Thraldom and Bondage he was
involved in, and could never have extrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himself out of.</p>
               <p>2. The Law sets the price by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
not that the Law provides a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator;
the Law seeks its own satisfaction,
in saving, and damning men; it promises
Salvation upon our perfect Obedience, and
all who come short of that, it threatens
with eternal Damnation; <hi>Cursed is every
one,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the day thou eatest, thou shalt
die.</hi> Nothing does establish this Law, and
give it its full course towards Believers, but
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:98282:138"/>
faith in Christ Jesus, who was made a curse,
and died according to Law for our sins; and
being risen again, he brings those whom
he freed from the curse of the Law, under
the blessing of the Gospel, giving eternal
Life as a free-gift to all who thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it from his hand by faith, owning him
as the Author and Donor of it.</p>
               <p>3. The nature of the Offence, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against an infinite God, requires a
price equivalent to it, of infinite value;
none but God could satisfie God; the wrath
of God is asswaged by the blood of God;
and that he might bleed, he became Man; the
Second Person of the Trinity, as incarnate,
died for man, tasted death for us in our
nature, which he still kept hypostatically
untied to his own Divine Person; for Christ
by dying, did not lay down humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but humane Life only, which he took
up again, and now lives for ever as a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Spirit; communicating eternal Life
to Believers, through his humane nature,
now glorified in Heaven: Therefore Christ
is said to be our life, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>And this
life is in his son,</hi> 1 John 5.11. <hi>Hid with
Christ in God,</hi> Col. 3. 3. The life which
we derive from mere humane nature, will
quickly fail; but the life which we derive
by faith form the Divine Person of the Son
of God, <hi>is everlasting,</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>As the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98282:138"/>
father hath life in himself, so hath he given
to the son to have life in himself,</hi> John 5. 26.
<hi>i. e.</hi> He is life essentially, the essence of
the Deity is communicated by the Father
to Christ incarnate, and so he becomes the
Fountain of life to us; therefore let all
those who hope to inherit eternal life, join
themselves by faith to Christ the only Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of life: How little of this hidden life
does appear in the effects of it among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors!
We live more by sense than faith;
very solicitous about natural life, but how
few do carry it as those who have <hi>eternal
life abiding in them?</hi> 1 John 3. 15. <hi>Living
in the flesh by the faith of the Son of God,</hi>
Gal. 2. 20. Who fell a Sacrifice for our
sins, but rose again, and now lives for
ever; <hi>And gives eternal life to as many as
the father hath given him,</hi> John 17. 2. He
has undertaken to the Father to draw all
the Elect into a participation of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life, which he as man possess now in
Heaven; and because he lives, we shall live
for ever in him.</p>
               <p>The Second person in the Trinity died as
a man in our human nature, to satisfie the
Law; and to evidence the reality of his
death, he lay buried three days in the Grave,
he was alive as God, when dead as Man;
what a profound Mystery is this, that the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98282:139"/>
Deity of Christ should suffer his human
Body to fall under the power of death for
three days; this shews the strength of sin, the
strength of the law, and the strength of the
wrath of God: that so great a man as
Christ was, could not stand under, and
live; die he must by the sanction of the
law, <hi>being found in the likeness of sinful
flesh,</hi> Rom. 8. 3. bearing our sins in his own
Body on the Tree; but the dignity of his
person was such, and the extremity of his
sufferings so great, that his three days death,
was equivalent to eternal death, he did
that in three days, which a damned sinner
in Hell cannot effect to eternity; for that
which is doing to eternity, can never be
actually done and compleated, <hi>i. e.</hi> Christ
gave full satisfaction to the Law in three
days, and therefore could not longer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Grave; there was no Law nor
Reason for it, having paid the utmost far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of our whole Debt, the Prison-doors
were opened, and Christ let out: That
which keeps the Damned in Hell for ever,
is, because they can never fully satisfie the
law of God by all their sufferings, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they must suffer on still to eternity;
but Christ <hi>by one offering, hath perfected for
ever them that are sanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14.
Christ could have chose whether he would
have died or no, but for this end he came
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98282:139"/>
into the World, and did voluntarily yield
up himself to the Death of the Cross; but
rising the Third Day he lives for ever, and
has brought eternal life into human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to be communicated to all his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
who cannot forfeit that life which
they derive from the second <hi>Adam,</hi> as we
all did that which we derived from the first
<hi>Adam. In Adam all die, and in Christ all are
made alive,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 22.</p>

that sinners are worthy of death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.
32. <hi>To this end Christ is our propitiation,</hi>
Rom. 3. 25. Reconciling God to us, that
we may be received into his favour again;
hence God declares in the new Covenant, <hi>I

their sins, and their iniquities will I remember
no more,</hi> Heb. 8. 12. <hi>Sing, O ye heavens,</hi> &amp;c.
Isa. 44. 23. vide. That satisfaction that
Christ gave to the Justice of God, lay in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98282:140"/>
his bearing the Punishment of our sins,
which is the wrath of God in all the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
effects of it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24.
<hi>He was made a curse for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. <hi>Died
for us,</hi> Mat. 20. 28. Isa. 53. 5. <hi>Was cut off

to make satisfaction for sin; <hi>In the day

Rom. 6. 23. There is no escaping this
death for us, but by dealing with the
Justice of God in some way, that may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
Justice and save the sinner; this Christ
undertook, and by his own Death effected
for us. <hi>He gave himself for our sins,</hi> Gal. 1.
4. His Blood was the Price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
Price here is not taken (as
vulgarly) for Money, but whatever may
satisfie him in whose hands the captive is;
that is the Price of Redemption: God
does not seek to make a gain of us; that
which he stand upon, is the vindication of
the honour of his Law and Justice, the
maintaining his Truth and Faithfulness.
<hi>To declare his righteousness, that he might be
just, and the justifier of him which believeth
ion Jesus,</hi> Rom. 3. 26.</p>
               <p>Christ did not pay the Price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
to the Devil, but to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who had power to condemn us, and
as a Judge to detain us in prison, till his
Justice was satisfied; therefore Christ deals
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98282:140"/>
with the Law-giver, takes the penalty
upon himself. Whilst the condemning
power of the Law is in force against us,
the Devil has a right in us, and to us, as
God's Executioner by virtue of that Law
which casts us into his hands; but when
the Law is satisfied, and the Curse taken
off, the Devil's claim ceases; where there
is no condemnation, there can be no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
inflicted: Just punishment is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law; but where no sentence of
judgment can be passed, there can be no
execution of the minatory part of the Law
upon that man; <hi>Currat lex, &amp; fiat justitia;</hi>
but where the due course of Law is stopped,
and by some means prevented, there can be
no trial, and consequently no judgment
pass upon that man unto condemnation:
The Devil detains us Captives, not in his
own right, but in God's, whose Prisoners
we are.</p>
               <p>Our Redemption by Christ, is a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Redemption, both of our Bodies and
Souls; as we are said to be sold under sin
by our own default, so we are said to be
Redeemed or freed from sin, by Christ's
giving satisfaction for our offences; the
Price was paid to God, Christ offered up
himself to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. Who as a
Righteous Judge has power to cast Body
and Soul into Hell: 'Twas his Divine
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:98282:141"/>
Majesty that we offended, 'twas his wrath
we lay under, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. We
don't ask pardon of the Devil, but of God;
'tis to his judgment that we are bound
over, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 32.
'Twas God that cast the Devils into Hell,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. So he delivers Impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
up to the Devil as his Executioner, as
that Lord delivered <hi>the unjust servant to the
tormentors,</hi> Mat. 18. 34. <hi>And the Judge to
the officer,</hi> Mat. 5. 25. The power of the
Devil over us, mentioned <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 26. is but a secondary power derived
from God the Judge, as Christ said of his
Murtherers, <hi>You could have no power over
me, if it were not given from above,</hi> John
19. 11. <hi>'Tis God who has power over all
plagues,</hi> Rev. 16. 9. <hi>Even over death it
self,</hi> Heb. 5. 7. <hi>He hath the keys of hell and
death,</hi> Rev. 1. 18. <hi>When we are redeemed
from the curse of the law, and from the wrath
of God,</hi> 1 Thes. 1. 10. we are Redeemed
from all the adjuncts and effects of these,
as a vain conversation, from the power of
Sin, Satan, and Death: Our Captivity lies
in our alienation and distance from God;
and when we are brought nigh by the Blood
of Christ, and reconciled to God, the ransom
being paid by Christ, we are delivered from
the wrath of God, and all the consequents of
it. As in Civil Corporal Redemptions, the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98282:141"/>
Price is paid, not to the Jaylor, to the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to the Tormentors, but to the Supreme
Judge, in whose power the Prisoner is; if
he be discharged by the Judge, he is freed
of course from his Chains, from the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
and the noysome stench of it.</p>
               <p>Thus you see how we are bought with
a Price; not one Penny or Farthing of this
comes out of our own Purses, <hi>Isa</hi> 45. 13.
<hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 3. No good thought, no good
word, no good work of our own, no not
any act of our own Faith does belong to
this sum, as part of the Price. <hi>We buy,
but without money,</hi> Isa. 55. 1. what is so
bought, is freely given: The hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Glory, is proposed in the Gospel as a
motive to, and reward of our good works;
but still 'tis Faith in Christ alone, that lets
us into this hope, begets it in us, and being
justified by Faith, perfectly justified in this
life, our good works, though imperfect
in themselves, are rewarded of mere
grace; yet the imperfection of them makes
them uncapable of a reward from Justice;
and if that imperfection were not covered
and pardoned, Grace it self would turn
away from them, and disregard them; but
being justified from the guilt of all our sins,
God remembers them no more, <hi>he will not
see iniquity in Jacob;</hi> there it is, but God
having pardoned it, he passes it by, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98282:142"/>
overlooks it, so as not to charge it upon us
to our condemnation. God considers the
Holiness of his children, as if it were by it
self, shining out under the covering of all
their infirmities, through their Faith and
Sincerity: 'Tis not the degree, but the
truth of their Holiness, that God takes
most notice of; he is pleased to see the fruits
of his own Spirit in Believers; he looks
through their good works, upon their Faith
from whence they spring, and so accepts
both of their persons and their works for
his Son's sake. Though Faith be an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
means instrumentally necessary to
apply and put on Christ, by whom alone
we are justified in the sight of God; we
shall never be the less justified for deriving
all from Christ alone; converting our own
inherent holiness to those proper uses the
Gospel hath assigned it unto, <hi>viz.</hi> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God in this World, a testimony of
our obedience and thankfulness to him, an
example to others, provoking them to
good works, and a meet fruit of true,
saving, justifying Faith; these are motives
strong enough to good works, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
them into the room and place of
Christ, robbing him of the Glory of our full
and free Redemption.</p>
               <p>What the <hi>Socinians</hi> object against this,
purposely to overthrow the satisfaction of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98282:142"/>
Christ, denying any Price to be really paid
to the Father for our Redemption, I shall
speak to next time, and clear the Text from
their Cavils.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinians,</hi> that they may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the necessity of Satisfaction for Sin,
deny the Divinity of Christ, and that he
paid any Price to the Father, for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:
They say the word <hi>Redemption</hi>
is but a Metaphor, signifying only simple
deliverance or freedom from Bondage,
without any Satisfaction given to any; they
make Mercy and Justice no essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
in God, but only mere voluntary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his Free-will, because God, say
they, may pardon sin without satisfaction,
by an Arbitrary Act of his Absolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
For this they quote many Scriptures,
speaking of God's redeeming his people
<hi>out of the house of bondage,</hi> from the hand
of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Deut. 7. 8. Deut. 15. 15. Neh.

about us; God does clasp us round as it

separating us from the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
<hi>These are mine,</hi> says Christ; I am the

right in them, and dominion over
them; they are my own, I am their Lord
and King, they are at my disposal, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

63. 16. <hi>A dwelling-house in a walled city, if it
were not redeemed within a whole year after
'twas sold, it was established for ever to him
that bought it,</hi> Levit. 25. 30. But the Saints
are Christ's own for ever; as soon as he has
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98282:145"/>
bought them, he will never sell them, never
part with them.</p>
               <p>What right did God recover in and to us,
by Redeeming us?</p>
               <p>1. God has an original right to, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over all Creatures, by the Law of
Creation: <hi>Hath not the Potter power over
the clay, of the same lump, to make what
vessels he pleases unto honour or dishonour?</hi>
Rom. 9. 21.</p>
               <p>2. God as a Creator and Judge, hath a
right to man fallen, to dispose of him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to justice, to execute his vengeance
upon him, <hi>To make his power known upon
vessels of wrath fitted to destruction,</hi> Rom.
9. 22. But</p>
               <p>3. God's Justice would not permit, that
man should be received into favour, and
freed from that misery he had brought upon
himself, 'till a sufficient Price was paid for
his ransom; nothing but the Blood of
Christ could quench that flaming Sword of
God's just Anger, that kept man, when cast
out of Paradise, from the Tree of Life. So
that the right that God recovered, was for
the good of man, a right to shew Mercy
to the worst of Penitent sinners, without
any reflection upon his Justice, <hi>That he
might be just, and the justifier of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
in Jesus,</hi> Rom. 3. 26. That a Holy
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98282:146"/>
God should justifie a sinful man, is the
greatest Mystery that ever the World heard
of; but God, who works wonders, hath in
his infinite Wisdom, <hi>Job</hi> 28. 23. glorified
his Justice and Mercy both in our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Christ. God had a special right by
Election in all his chosen Ones; but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
the fall of his Elect, he provides for
their Redemption in case of Transgression;
Election was unto Eternal Life; but sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening
between Election and Salvation,
threatens Eternal Death, puts such a rub in
the way, which must be removed, or else
the Elect themselves could not be Saved;
therefore that Election might stand and
obtain its end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7. God provides
for our Redemption, laies help upon one
that is Mighty; <hi>we were chosen in him, in
whom we have redemption,</hi> Eph. 1. 4, 7. God
had an Eye to Christ in our Election, 'tis
that makes it sure: What wonderful diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
does Election meet with! enough, if
it were possible, to hinder the Salvation
even of the Elect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. But Christ
has secured them, <hi>John</hi> 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>8. <hi>I give unto
them eternal life, and they shall never perish,
neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.</hi>
The end of our Redemption, was, not to
rescue us quite out of the hand of God, to
take us out of his power, for that cannot
be; but to let us into his Love, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:98282:146"/>
us to him, to bring us to a nearer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction

               <p>When in all our outward actions we go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
our selves by the law of Christ, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the rule of his word, and the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of his Spirit: The Body is for the
Lord, who is our Head to govern our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in all their motions; Christ is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of the body, and will raise it up to
eternal life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5. and make it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to his glorious body: Our Bodies
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:98282:147"/>
are the Members of Christ; and as such,
they ought to subject themselves to the
command of the Soul under Christ, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
the deeds of the Body through the
Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. The whole man is the
temple of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. Our
Bodies are, as it were, the Porch of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
therefore we should not touch any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16, 17. lest we
grieve the Spirit of God who dwells in us.
The Sanctification and Holiness of the Body,
is opposed to any outward pollution of it,
by which we do defile and dishonour the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5. If Christ has such an
undoubted right to your Bodies as they are
his members, and temples of the Holy-Ghost;
then be sure you keep them holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled.
I need not exhort you to flee
Fornication, you are all convinced of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
of that; but the outward Attire, I will
not say of whom, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 10.) lest I put
some to the blush, does not become serious
Worshippers of the true God; a more grave,
sober, modest Apparel, would convincingly
testify to others, the due respect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
you have for the holy Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in you; your Bodies are the temples of
the Holy-Ghost; do not then prophane these
temples by antick exotick dresses, the sure
emblems of a vain mind; such plumes and
wethercocks as some wear upon their heads,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98282:148"/>
become not the Pinacle of these Temples of
the Holy-Ghost: Therefore if there be any
fellowship of the Spirit, cloathe your selves
as women professing Godliness; and that I
may apply this to both Sexes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
14. I must tell you, it argues a very Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
age, to see so many men's head
thatch'd with Womens hair; what may be
brought by some, as an argument in point
of health for the cutting of their own Hair,
will never justifie what is put on by most in
the room of it.</p>
               <p>When you have trickt up your selves,
according to the Mode and Fashion of the
world, before you go forth to be seen of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
put this question to your selves, Is this
to Glorifie God in my body? or will it not
rather open the mouths of many to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
that profession of Godliness that I
have taken up? Answer it to your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
if you can: He that does not keep
his body in a due subjection to the Spirit of
Grace, will never keep his heart long in a
right frame.</p>
               <p>What to Glorifie God in our Spirit?</p>
               <p>To serve God only with our bodies, is
Hypocrisy, it must be with Body and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
else our service is not reasonable service,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. If our minds are not pure in
the sight of God, and our outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
answerable thereunto in the sight of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98282:148"/>
men; <hi>Paul</hi> sets forth this inward service
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>God is my witness, whom I serve
with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, and
with a pure conscience.</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 3. <hi>void of
offence towards God.</hi> Acts 24. 16. <hi>In simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and godly sincerity,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. <hi>When
with our minds we serve the law of God,</hi>
Rom. 7. 25. God is a Spirit, and will be
Worshipped in spirit and truth: You have
reason to enure your selves to this Spiritual
worship, because ere long you will be all
Spirit, when you have laid down these
earthly tabernacles. I mean, it is the will
of God, that the Souls of men should after
death, live a while out of the body in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
state, till the Resurrection, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with an innumerable company of
Angels and Spirits of just men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Though Believers now are Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
joined to the general Assembly of the
First-born, and in the apprehensions of
their Faith do rejoyce in that relation they
stand in to the Church-triumphant; yet
after death they will have actual communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with those blessed Spirits above; though
we cannot so clearly apprehend what this
happy Paradisical state is after death; yet
those who are spiritually minded, conceive
so much of it by Faith, as makes them long
to be dissolved and to be with Christ; they
grow weary of all earthly converses, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:98282:149"/>
till their change comes, that they may
enter into rest from all their Labours, and
from that hard travel of Soul, which they
cannot be freed from till their warfare be
fully accomplish'd; then they put off their
Armour as more than Conquerors, and sit
down in an everlasting Peace, with palms
in their hands, and crowns upon their heads,
triumphing in the Grace of Christ to all
Eternity.</p>
               <p>Could we look through the dark Entry
of the Grace into Eternity, lifting up our
heads within the Vail, we should see a
Glorious Light that would dazzle our eyes;
we should have a stronger taste of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the world to come. The wiser sort
of Heathens were not without some
thoughts of a future happy estate; they
did <hi>praesentire in posterum:</hi> They had some
bodings in their minds, of some great good
or evil that should befal them after death.
What a shame is it for Christians to be so
little affected with the future eternal state
of their Immortal Souls?</p>
               <p>Believers, while they are in this world,
are joyned to the Lord in one Spirit; <hi>i. e.</hi>
in one spiritual body, or in the same spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
nature with Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. We live
the life of Christ; the Head and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
being acted by the same Spirit. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
have not every one a diverse spirit, as
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:98282:149"/>
every man hath a divers Soul, numerically
distinct from the Soul of another man; but
as all Members of the Body have the same
Soul, though each of them divers opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 4. so we have all of us one
and the same Spirit, though the operations
of it be divers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 13. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if there be any fellowship of the Spirit,
let us glorifie God in our bodies, and in our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which are God's.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>BEfore I speak to the Words of the
Text, I shall premise Two Things.</p>
            <p>1. Compare the Covenant of Grace
with the Covenant of Works, shewing
in what they agree, and in what they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
            <p>2. Compare the New Covenant with
the Mount-<hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant.</p>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:98282:151"/>
               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">Christ the ONLY Mediator, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST,</hi> I shall Compare the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works, with the Covenant
of Grace, in sundry particulars.</p>
               <p>1. The Covenant of Grace frees a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
from two things, which by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works are in force against him.</p>
               <p>1. From the Curse.</p>
               <p>2. From perfect Obedience as a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life to be performed by man
himself. My meaning is, That the
Covenant of Grace does not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Condition of perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but only the Performance of it
by us: It is enough that Christ hath
performed it for us, by whose Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
we are made Righteous.</p>
               <p>2. The Covenant of Grace is so far a
friend to the Covenant of Works, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Good Works commanded by
that Covenant, that it takes in all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Duties of that Covenant; they are as
much our Duty now under the Gospel, as
they were under the Law; and our coming
short in any of them, is as much our sin
now as then; we ought as much to strive
against it; nay, which is more than could
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98282:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be expected under the Law, we are called
to repent of it: The Law neither gave
Grace to repent, neither did it admit of any
Repentance: You see how little counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the Covenant of Grace, rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
gives to Licentiousness, how much
it promotes Holiness, even the perfection
of Holiness: For when all the Grace of
that Covenant is given forth, it will issue
in Perfection; then the Saints will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
The reason why under the Gospel,
imperfect Obedience is accepted, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Imperfections of it are approved,
but because they are pardoned and covered.</p>
               <p>3. The Covenant of Works shews what
man must do to be justified; The Covenant
of Grace, what a justified man ought to do,
how he should carry himself ever after to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God.</p>
               <p>Holiness of life, by the Covenant of
Works, went before Justification, as the
procuring meritorious cause of it; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Covenant of Grace, it is the
consequent or effect of Justification.</p>
               <p>4. The Covenant of Grace, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it to us, begins in the pardon of
sin: No Grace reaches us, till pardoning
Grace begins with us; we are under a curse
till then, concluded or shut up under wrath;
but pardoning Mercy opens the door for all
manner of Mercies to enter in, turns the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98282:152"/>
whole stream and course of God's Grace
towards us. <hi>Blessed is the man whose trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
is forgiven,</hi> &amp;c. Psalm 32. 1. This
leads the way to all other blessings.</p>
               <p>5. In the Covenant of Grace, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
what he will be to us, and do for us,
and also what he will enable us to be to him,
and to do for his Glory; his free Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
both Parts of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>6. The Covenant of Grace, presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
full satisfaction made by Christ for all
our sins against the Covenant of Works,
else God would not be just in justifying a
Believer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>7. The Covenant of Grace finds nothing
in man to commed him to God, but what
it brings along with it: To suppose any
preparatory qualifications, conditions, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or motives, to make way for us into the
favour of God, does quite overthrow the
nature of free Grace, and take off greatly
from the glory of it.</p>
               <p>1. None can have an interest in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, or be said in a Gospel
sence, to be in Covenant, in whom the
essential parts of the Covenant are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in some measure fulfilled, <hi>viz.</hi> To
have the Law written in their heart, to
have a right Spirit put into us, to own God
for our God, to delight in his Law in the
inward man; these are so far from being
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:98282:152"/>
conditions of the Covenant, giving us
an interest in it, that they are rather the
Covenant it self fulfilled in us, which is an
undeniable proof of our being in Covenant.</p>
               <p>9. The New Covenant does not so much
imply an outward Law or Rule of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
set before us, as an inward Law, or
rather, a spirit and principle of Love and
Obedience, inclining us to a willing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of all those Duties that either Law
or Gospel call for. The Covenant of Grace
brings forth a new creature created in
Christ Jesus unto good works, that he
should walk in them; you put a force
upon the new creature, if you turn him
out of his walk.</p>
               <p>By the Covenant of Grace, our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
hangs not upon doing, but upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
               <p>That which much perplexes the point of
Justification, is, the separating of Faith
and Justification too far asunder, which
hath many ill consequences in it.</p>
               <p>1. If you suppose Faith as a quality pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existing
in the Soul before Justification,
and standing a while alone by it self, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to our Justification, this lets in
previous qualifications in us as necessary to
Justification: And if Faith, as a quality in
us, have any causal influence into our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:98282:153"/>
so must Repentance and all good
Works, which are linked to it. This lets
us into a justification by Works of our own
doing, and by qualities inherent in our
selves, which is downright Popery.</p>
               <p>2. If we place our personal Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before Faith; this runs us up to an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Justification of our persons from eternity,
which is of as ill consequence as the
former.</p>
               <p>Therefore the safest way is to put them
both togethet. <hi>What God hath joined, let no
man put asunder.</hi> He that believes, is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
and he that is justified, Believes; there
can be no justification without Faith, nor
no true Faith without justification. God's
act in justifying, doth symphonize and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond
to our act in Believing: There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be actual giving, without actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving;
one is naturally necessary to the
other. I know Faith and Justification are
different notions, and may in our way of
speaking and expression, be put one before
the other; but the things themselves are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
together; God justifies us, by working
Faith in us.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of Grace requires nothing
to be done by us, as an antecedent moral
condition, or procuring cause of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
it supposes Faith in all who actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
partake of the Grace of this Covenant.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:98282:153"/>
Nay, the Covenant of Grace, I mean, the
outward proposal of the terms of the New
Covenant, is an outward means appointed
by God for the working or begetting of
Faith in us. Faith comes by hearing, <hi>i. e.</hi>
by hearing the Doctrine of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Christ; and this Faith so wrought
by hearing the Word, disposes the Soul
ever after to Repentance, and new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which are the inseparable effects of
Faith in all who are justified: He who doth
not shew his Faith by his Works, is no
sound Believer.</p>
               <p>Though it be commonly said by many,
That Repentance is in order to justification;
the sense cannot be, that Repentance is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally
necessary to justification, as
Faith is: Do but keep up the different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
that Faith hath to justification, from
all other Graces and good Works, and we
shall quickly understand one another; and
not confound Faith and Works together in
our justification.</p>
               <p>We may differ in our expressions; but
that should make no real difference, if the
same thing be meant and intended.</p>
               <p>This account of Faith (or to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
for I will tie none to my words) does
answer all the ends of true Religion, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts
Christ, ascribes our free Justification
and Pardon to him, and his Righteousness
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:98282:154"/>
only; it secures our own Souls, it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
and discountenances all Vice, all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
loose living; it establishes the
Law as a Rule of life; it promotes all
practical Holiness by the most forcible
motives that can be.</p>
               <p>We can never keep up Religion in the
power of it, if we do not keep up the
plain notion of it, in the sense that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
received by all sober sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Arguings <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> may have their
use among the Learned; but still let us be
sure to sail by the Pole-Star, to keep that in
our Eye, as a fixed point that governs all
our motions. My meaning is this, let us
ultimately resolve Religion in the main
fundamentals of it, into such naked simple
truths, as may fall under the capacity of all
plain meaning Christians; that they may
know what we Believe, and what we Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess:
That we all aim at the same thing
in our Preaching; and that the same Spirit
may still appear in all the diversity of gifts
that is among us.</p>
               <p>The reason why the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17.
calls the Mount-<hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant a Law, is
because the Mount-<hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant is a mixt
Covenant, made up partly of the Law, and
partly of the Gospel; and the Apostle in
that place, opposes the Legalities of the
<hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant, to the promise made to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98282:154"/>
                  <hi>Abraham:</hi> There was no reason why he
should oppose the Gospel part of the <hi>Sinai</hi>-Covennat,
to the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
for they were both the same, they were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident,
there was no opposition between
them; therefore he calls the Mount-<hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant
a Law, in opposition to the
Covenant of pure Grace made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Covenant of Works made with
<hi>Adam,</hi> as to any benefit from it, ceased at
the entrance of sin, which laid all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
under a curse: This curse cannot be
taken away but by a New Covenant; you
see how sin disordered the whole world,
put all things out of frame. God's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the world, as to the outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of it, must be altered, or else
the whole world must be destroyed; there
must be a new Constitution, a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
What havock did sin make in one
day! that put God upon a second Creation,
making all things new, casting all into a
new mould, to prevent the utter destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of all mankind, that otherwise must
have ensued.</p>

have done, had the Law been then given to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:98282:155"/>
bring <hi>Israel</hi> under a Covenant of Works.
The Church of <hi>Israel</hi> continued under this
<hi>Sinai-Covenant,</hi> till this better, this second,
this New Covenant was introduced, <hi>Heb.</hi>
8. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>This Mount-<hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant, is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
called, the First, or the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
in comparison of the New, established
by Christ in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant, there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival,
or a repitition of the Law of Works,
and a Typical pointing to the time of the
promise, when Christ himself should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
hence the Law is said to be our
Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant had all the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Worship annexed to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1, 2,
3. but this whole System of <hi>Levitical</hi>
Worship in all its Rites and Ceremonies,
was to be disanull'd, that a more Spiritual
and Evangelical Church-state might be
established by a standing irrevocable Law,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Sancitum est,</hi> Heb. 8. 6.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant was suited to the
times of the Old-Testament; 'twas that
dispensation which God thought fit to place
the Church under at that season, till the
fulness of times should come, for a clearer
discovery of God's free Grace in Christ,
who was born under the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:98282:156"/>
made under the Law, to redeem us from the
curse of it, <hi>Gal</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Gal</hi> 4. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of Works put a double
bar to man's Salvation since the Fall. 1<hi>st.</hi>
The Curse lay upon man for sin, which
must be removed, or death was unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
2<hi>d.</hi> Perfect Righteousness was to be
performed, without which life was not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
by that Covenant; neither of these
done then under the <hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant.
Therefore Christ by virtue of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-sanction,
authorising him as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
to undertake both, he dies to free us
from the Curse of the Law, and by his
active Righteousness, or Obedience, made
us Righteous, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. It is as
plain as words can express it, that it is not
by our own Evangelical obedience, by works
of Righteousness that we do, but by the
Obedience of that one Man Christ, that
we are made Righteous unto Justification
of life. So that Gospel Grace, in the
right notion of it, doth not consist in aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the rigour of the Law; or that for
Christ's sake, our sincere imperfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
shall be accepted unto Justification,
instead of that which is perfect: But it lies
here, <hi>viz.</hi> in exempting us from a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
performance of perfect Righteousness
required by Law unto our Justification,
and admitting Christ to answer the Law for
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98282:156"/>
us in our stead, who accordingly fulfilled all
Righteousness for us, is become the end of
the Law for Righteousness, to every one
that believes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. This is that
Righteousness without works imputed to
us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. or the righteousness of God
by Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
or righteousness of that one man Christ
(as before) opposed to our own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3.</p>
               <p>Let us not carry it, as if there were no
way to Preach up Holiness and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but by Preaching down Justification
by Faith alone in Christ Jesus: Were some
persons as zealous for the Doctrine of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
as they who assert it, are for good
Works and strict Holiness of life, there
would not be that offence given by setting
up a new way of Justification by our own
Evangelical Obedience: All who oppose
this new scheme, are presently branded
with <hi>Antinomian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sm;</hi> a beadroll of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
errors are reckoned up, and obliquely
charged upon them. But the strength
of this way of Arguing I understand
not.</p>
               <p>Thus Christ as Mediator of the New
Testament, satisfied for the Transgressions
of the Old Covenant, <hi>That they which are
called, might receive the promise of eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi>
Heb. 9. 15, 16. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. He
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:98282:157"/>
brought in everlasting Righteousness, and
by one offering hath perfected for ever
them that are Sanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. So
Redeeming us from the Law, the <hi>Sinai</hi>
Law, for of that the Apostle there speaks,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 17. Let us have a care of living
in the Spirit of the Old Covenant, going
about to establish our own Righteousness;
Since by virtue of the New Covenant,
God hath accepted Christ in our stead to be

                  </gap>econd <hi>Adam,</hi> every way to answer the
demands of the Law, or Covenant of
Works, which was revived at Mount-<hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi>
and added because of Transgression,
that Christ by coming under the Law
might make satisfaction for that Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</p>
               <p>There was a necessity of a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that the fulfilling of the Old by
Jesus Christ might be imputed to us;
there must be a Law for that, before it
could be, that the benefit of Christ's Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
and active Obedience might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
unto us. The New Covenant (as
comprehending that of Redemption) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
Christ to satisfie for our breach of the
Old: But though Believers are Redeemed
from the curse of the Law, yet they are
still under the Law to Christ their Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
who satisfied for their breaking of it,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 21. they are indeed <hi>dead to the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:98282:157"/>
law by the body of Christ,</hi> Rom. 7. 4. <hi>i. e.</hi> Not
under the condemning power of the Law,
because Christ bore the curse of it on his
own Body; yet still obedience to the Law
is strictly required of all Believers, though
not in order to their Justification, but for
other ends; all doing for life is now over,
that is no <hi>Antinomian</hi> Doctrine. Gospel
motives to Holiness from the Love of God
in Christ Jesus, are far more forcible than
those drawn from the terror of the Law.
The New Covenant is a mild gentle Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
full of Grace; therefore called the
Covenant of Grace, consisting not of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and threatnings, but of absolute
Promises. <hi>I will, and they shall,</hi> Heb. 8.
10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of Grace, is one and the
same for substance all along ever since the
fall; there have been several discoveries
of it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In the promise to <hi>Adam</hi> in more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
terms.</item>
                  <item>2. In that to <hi>Abraham,</hi> limiting the seed
to his family.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And when the Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi>
multiplied into a Nation, the Covenant
was put into a National form, and was
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:98282:158"/>
made with <hi>Israel,</hi> as with a people, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the people of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when Christ came, the last edition
of the Covenant was more comprehensive
both of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> reckoning all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
to be the spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi>
and was more expressive of spiritual Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siugs
than before. This is called a New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
another Covenant, because it was
so different from the outward form, and
Systeme of the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant; and of this
New and better Covenant, Christ is the
Mediator; We are come unto <hi>Mount-Sion,</hi> to
Jesus the Mediator of the new Covenant.</p>
               <p>The Apostle persuades to more exact
holiness of life.</p>
               <p>1. From the greatness of Gospel Grace.</p>
               <p>2. From the sweet alluring nature of it;
it must needs draw our hearts towards it,
make us fall in love with it, thankfully
receiving it with Reverence and Fear, lest
we should not walk worthy of it unto all
well-pleasing: Grace pleases a Believer so
well, that he cannot but study to please God
in all things ever after; the Law of Grace
constrains him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> The clearer Gospel-Light we live
under, the more holy we should be in our
lives and conversations; not continuing in
sin, because Grace abounds. Since we are
delivered from the terror and bondage of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98282:158"/>
the Law, let us not desire to be under it;
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 21. We are not under the Law, but
under Grace; or which is all one, are not
come unto Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but unto Mount
<hi>Sion;</hi> God was very terrible upon Mount
<hi>Sinai,</hi> but very amiable and gentle upon
Mount <hi>Sion;</hi> sitting upon a Throne of
Grace, ready to shew Mercy to all who
come unto him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. he will in no
wise cast off any. So that Believers now
are in a far better case than they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Old Testament; they enjoy now far
greater Priviledges, and among the rest, we
have a more powerful Mediator than <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
was, even <hi>Jesus the Mediator of the
New Covenant.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> What a Mediator is: <hi>viz.</hi> One
who interposes himself as a middle person
between two or more who are at variance,
that he may reconcile them, and joyn them
together in a New Covenant.</p>
               <p>A Mediator is one coming between two
parties at variance, to take up the quarrel,
and reconcile them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Medium refertur ad duo extrema,</hi> the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
refers to two extremes; so a Mediator
is not of one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 20. There must be
two at variance; God is one, there must be
some other at variance with God, else no
need of a Mediator, whilst God and man
were one, <hi>i. e.</hi> united in love and affection;
for then they are said to be one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17 21.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. of the same nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.
But there being a difference between God
and man Christ is not the Mediator of one,
<hi>i. e.</hi> of God only, but of God and man,
God and sinful man; for God and a just
man are not at variance. The first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in Innocency was made between per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:98282:159"/>
perfectly united and agreed; the second
Covenant between persons mortally offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
therefore this needed a Mediator; <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trema
unjuntur in medio.</hi> So here, 2 Cor.
5 18, 19. A Mediator stands in the middle
to unite both extremes. So Christ is the
<hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> Isa. 9 6. The Parties dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
are God and Man; the cause of
the difference is sin, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 2. which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be expiated but by the blood of Christ;
and because God would not contend for
ever, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>6. he sent his Son to dye for
our sins, and so to make Peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10.
A Mediator is one who takes hold of both
disagreeing Parties, one with his right, the
other with his left hand, so bringing them
together in Love, as <hi>Job</hi> 9. 33. <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 10.

               <p>The Person of the Mediator, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
is inferior to the Father, by a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
exinanition of himself in the form of
a servant; but he is above us, 1. As God,
by his Divine Nature. 2. As Man, by the
Purity of his Humane Nature. 3. By ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his Office, and high Prerogatives
belonging to it. Mediator and Saviour are
all one; for Mediation is in order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
one the means, the other the end; <hi>He
is our Saviour, because he is our Mediator,</hi>
Heb. 7. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:98282:160"/>
The knowledg of a Mediator is not from
the Creatures, but from the Scriptures;
'tis a point of revealed Religion, to know
who is our Mediator, even the Son of
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The difference between <hi>Moses</hi>
and Christ, as to their Mediation.</p>
               <p>1. Christ as Mediator of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
effectually wins and draws to it, all
those to whom the benefit of this Covenant
belongs; he undertakes for the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of the Covenant on both sides.
So did not <hi>Moses, He was mediator of the
old covenant,</hi> Gal. 3. 19. Exod. 20. 19.
Deut. 5. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>2. The Mediator of the New Testament
must die, because he is the Testator, as
well as Mediator. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17. <hi>vide.</hi>
The Priests under the Law did offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
but did not offer up themselves as
Christ did. <hi>Moses</hi> was only a Ministerial
Mediator; he was not the Author of the
Covenant, but only a Witness to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
and publication of it in God's Name
by his Hand. But Christ himself is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the New Covenant, and he stands
engaged to make good the terms of it, to
take up the difference between God and us,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>He is our peace.</hi> Man's recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with God was drawn into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:98282:160"/>
therefore Christ is called the Mediator
of the New Covenant; he is both our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
and our Ransom; he that is our

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is also our <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>John</hi>
2. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>3. The Priest and Sacrifices of old were
tipes of Christ, the great Mediator of the
New Testament; the only high Priest, who
is both Priest and Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>4. Under the Law, many Sacrifices, and
they often repeated. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11. But in
the Gospel but one Sacrifice, and but once
offered. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 12, 14,
18.</p>
               <p>5. Christ does not only intercede with
the Father for us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 23. but promises
to do it himself, <hi>John</hi> 14. 14. He does not
only intercede for us as an Advocate, but
himself hears our Prayers, and grants our
Petitions, so could not <hi>Moses;</hi> he is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Mediator, not only procuring
remission from the Party offended, but actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
remitting the offence himself.</p>
               <p>6. The new Covenant comprehends both
<hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile, Eph.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.
10. So did not the old.</p>
               <p>7. There was only Typical forgiveness
in the old Covenant, <hi>as pertaining to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
Heb. 9. 9, 10, 13, 14. Heb. 10. 1,
2, 3. But real forgiveness in the new, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 16, 17. A real purging the Conscience,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:98282:161"/>
8. <hi>Moses</hi> was not Surety of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
unto God on the part of the people,
but only an Internuncius, or middle agent
between them, declaring the mind of God
unto the people.</p>
               <p>9. The <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant had relation to the
Covenant of Grace, and therefore the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
Law was annexed to it. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
was a Seal, not of the Covenant
of works, as the <hi>Jews</hi> misconceived, but of
the second Covenant of Righteousness by
Faith, Rom. 4. 11. <hi>Confirmed before of God in
Christ,</hi> Gal. 3. 17. The Law was given
430 Years after the promise made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
threatning the sinner, not with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that the Curse should be executed,
or the hand-writing against us fulfilled, but
rather blotted out, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Is the law
then against the promises?</hi> Gal. 3. 21. 'Tis
certain the Law as threatning, is against the
Promises, against us, and contrary to us,
as <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. But not so against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
as to vacate and abolish them, but
is rather subservient to them, stirring up
the sinner to fly to the Promise for a Pardon.
When the people, just after the giving of the
Law, had grievously sinned in making
the Calf, and God threatned to consume
them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 9, 10. <hi>Moses</hi> does not
plead the <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> Covenant, but the
Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, vers.</hi> 13. So
<hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 27. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:98282:161"/>
The condition of the <hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant
being performed by Christ, the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
becomes absolute to us; nothing
more can be demanded of us in a way of
satisfaction for sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. Christ as
our Advocate pleads this, and that we
ought to be discharged from the Curse of
the Law. All doing for life is over in the
New Covenant, our Surety has done that,
and therefore is become the Mediator of a
better Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. Having made
way for our receiving the Promise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.
15. This full satisfaction is the main thing
we are to believe in order to our Salvation;
this is the sense of every act of Justifying-Faith,
to which Salvation is annexed; we
must mean this in believing, or we mean
nothing, neither do we understand those
Scriptures, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, 36.
The Obedience of Christ comes instead of
our doing for life, he is <hi>the Lord our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
Jer. 23. 6. Christ being made of God
our Righteousness for Justification, it is
the will of God that he should by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
sanctifie us, and make us inherently
holy: Our Mediator does not only take
away the guilt of sin, which legal Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
could not do, they only purified the
Flesh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13. but not the Conscience;
the Blood of Christ only does this, <hi>v.</hi> 14.
So the Spirit of Christ by Faith purifies the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:98282:162"/>
Heart, sanctifies the whole person, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi>
5. 23. since we are come to the Mediator of
the New Covenant, let us see we don't
abuse the free Grace of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25.
In the New Covenant great Grace is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Believers, and great wrath against all
Unbelievers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7, 10, 12. <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.

               </p>
               <p>3. The necessity of a Mediator <hi>between
God and Fallen man;</hi> If one man sin against
another, the judge shall judge him: but if a
man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for
him? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25.</p>
               <p>This necessity appears</p>
               <p>1. From God's just anger against us.</p>
               <p>2. From our inability to appease his
wrath; I put them both together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was the Son of God by Creation,
<hi>Luk. 1. ult.</hi> but soon alienated himself and all
his Posterity from God his Father and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator;
neither could we ever become the
Children of God again, but by Christ, <hi>John</hi>
1. 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Angels, though they need no Redeemer,
yet they need a Mediator; a Head, in and
through whom they have access to God, and
communion with him; much more does
fallen man need a Mediator, by whom he
may come unto the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. 'Tis
impossible to see God any otherwise than
through Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1. 18. if any man sin,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:98282:162"/>
as every man does, let him not despair, for
we have an Advocate with the Father,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. in whom God is well pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. We cannot have immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
access to God himself, but through a
Mediator we may.</p>
               <p>3. By those terrors of Conscience which
we are under, when our hearts smite us for
any sin, <hi>accusing</hi> us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. telling us
that God knows all this evil and much
more by us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 20. Then <hi>whither shall
I go from thy spirit? whither shall I flee from
thy presence,</hi> Psalm 139. 7. How terrible
is God out of Christ to a convinced sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>4. The dreadful Punishments that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon sinners, upon the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
upon the old word; many particular
instances in former and latter times, do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>it a very fearful thing to fall into the hands
of the living God,</hi> Heb. 10. 31. When a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
sinner has none to speak for him, what
trembling must needs seize upon him, lest
God <hi>tear him in peices, and there be none to
deliver him?</hi> Psal. 50. 22.</p>
               <p>5. By the Sacrifices of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and also of the Heathens, which
were designed to pacifie God, some means
was to be used; all the Sacrifices of old ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God himself, could never expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
sin, nor pacifie God, but as they point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:98282:163"/>
to the great Sacrifice in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Christ is the great Reconciler, <hi>Col.</hi>
1. 20. We come to Jesus the Mediator of
the New Covenant, to be freed from the
curse of the Old, and invested in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the New.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of Works made at
the Creation with <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
broken, and the legal Administration
of the Mount-<hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant being faulty
and unprofitable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 13. Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
not continuing in it, God regarded
them not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9. And being thus alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
and enemies in their minds, by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Works; God thus provoked, gave up
man a child of wrath, to be a slave to sin,
Satan, and Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14,
15. <hi>Yet God so loved the world,</hi> John. 3.
16. <hi>Whilst we were yet without strength,</hi>
Rom. 5. 6. <hi>when we were sinners,</hi> v. 8. <hi>and
enemies,</hi> v. 10. Then did God reconcile us
to himself, by the death of his Son; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into a New Covenant with us, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
Christ to be the Mediator, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 5. and Surety of a better Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi>
7. 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>so reconciling us to himself,</hi>
2 Cor. 5. 18. <hi>God the Father provided this
Mediator,</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.
1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. You may see the greatness
of the sin, and of the Punishment too, in
the greatness of the Mediator; God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:98282:163"/>
in the person of his Son, became our
Mediator and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>6. The Law was ordained in the hand of
a Mediator, to shew, that 'tis not in the
power of any man since the Fall to satisfie
the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. By the hand of a
Mediator we must understand, not only
<hi>Moses,</hi> but the virtue and power of the
great Mediator Christ, of whom <hi>Moses</hi> was
a Type.</p>
               <p>Thus you see the necessity of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
Fallen man himself could not deal
with God because of sin; Angels could not,
being not of Humane nature; and since
there is but one God, then either the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of Heaven must descend down to us
immediately, which could not be; or else
this one God must become our Mediator,
our Immanuel; his Godhead, and our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature being joyned together in the
Divine Person of the Son.</p>
               <p>The low estate of man, made of the
dust of the Earth, laying aside all conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of sin, made it impossible for man to
be brought so near to God as Christ has
brought him: 'Tis something difficult to
apprehend how <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency held
Communion with God, how he could pray
without a Mediator. But after he fell,
for those few hours, before the Promise of
Christ came to him; no doubt he was full
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:98282:164"/>
of horror: The Text says, he was afraid, and
hid himself from the presence of the Lord,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10. But Christ interposes,
took our nature upon him, to convey his to
us, to make that ours by Grace, which
was his by Nature, so uniting us to God
again.</p>

               <head type="sub">4. How Christ was fitted and qualified
for the Office of a Mediator.</head>
               <p>HE had the Nature of both parties in
him as our <hi>Immanuel, Isa.</hi> 7. 14. He
had a right in both, as God manifest in the
Flesh; he stood in the middle between both
parties, and may be called the Third, <hi>Isa.</hi>
19. 24. because <hi>Israel</hi> was joined in league
and amity with <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Assyria,</hi> they all
had an interest in one another, all were
Blessed of God, <hi>v.</hi> 25. So God and man
considered as united in a Third Person, who
is God-man, they both have an interest in
him, and he is them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Mediator
is one who stands in the middle between
Two, partaking of both the extreams: In
this sense Christ is a middle Person, <hi>medius,</hi>
not only by Office, but by Nature, as God-man,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:98282:164"/>
Divinity and Humanity being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
united in his Person; he must
be God, that he may be able to satisfie; he
must be man that he may be in a capacity
to die: So that <hi>medius</hi> may refer to the
Person, Mediator to the Office; the Office
depends upon the Person; such an Office
requires such a Person, who was God-man.
Christ is a Mediator, according to both his
Natures as God-man, as his Divine Person
is Incarnate; in Christ's Mediation both
natures are imployed, and do act distinctly:
His Deity did what was Divine, his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
what was Humane; and what was
done according to either Nature, is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to his Person: The Person of the
Mediator hath something common to both
the dissenting parties, <hi>viz.</hi> The same es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Godhead, though not the
same Personality with the Father and the
Holy Ghost; and the same humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with us, not numerical, but specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
In the Incarnation of Christ, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature is not individuated to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
subsistency in this particular Man by
the Divine Essence, but by the Personality
of the Son; and therefore the Son is said
to be Incarnate; because the Person of the
Son gives humane Nature a subsistency in
himself. The Person of Christ joins Two
Natures not disagreeing; for the sinless
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:98282:165"/>
Humanity of Christ, was never contrary
to his Divinity, though inferior to it.
Christ thus Incarnate, lays out himself to
reconcile God and man, which his Two
Natures do fit him for, disposing and
giving an aptitude to the Office of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator;
for Christ is Mediator oeconomically
and by Office; Christ's assuming humane
Nature, was part of his Humiliation, and
did fit him for his Mediatory Office, <hi>Phil.</hi>
2. 7, 8. Though as has been said, there
was no enmity between God and Christ's
sinless humane Nature, yet as 'tis in us, 'tis
defiled and contrary to God, therefore
Christ mediates for us with the Father.</p>
               <p>Though Christ Offered up himself a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for us in humane Nature, yet the
whole Divine Person may be said to be
offered up in that Nature, <hi>John</hi> 10. 17, 18.
Christ speaks there as Mediator; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that he had of laying down, and taking
up his life, was the power of the Divine
Person, not of his humane Nature. Some
of the Schoolmen have this apt similitude,
<hi>viz.</hi> As a man draws a Sword out of a
Scabbard, holding the Sword in one hand,
and the Scabbard in the other; so the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Person of Christ separated his Soul
from the Body, as a Sword from the Scabard,
and yet kept both parts united to himself,
<hi>Toletus.</hi> Christ took our Flesh, in which he
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:98282:165"/>
was mortal, and freed even our flesh from
that mortality, when he raised it from
the dead. <hi>Aug. de Civ. D. l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem
habuit transeuntem;</hi> and so raising
us, <hi>ex mortuis facit immortales:</hi> Who could
swallow up death, but he who was life it
self?</p>
               <p>It makes much for the relief of fearful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
that our Mediator is God-man; we
should tremble at the mention of God only,
but when we hear he is Man as well as God;
then we come willingly to a man like our
selves; God hath hid and veiled his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
under our flesh, that the brightness of
his Glory might not overcome us. When
God appeared of old to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> it
was in some visible shape, which he took up
for that time, and laid down again; but
now he has really taken the substance and
truth of humane Nature into a fixed union
to the Person of his Son; never to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christus Incarnandus,</hi> was Mediator under
the Old Testament, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 20, 21. This
could not be a created Angel, because he
had power to forgive sin, therefore it was
Christ to come; <hi>apud Deum facta &amp; facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
things actually done, and to be done
hereafter; things present, and to come, are
all one, <hi>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, to
day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. <hi>Who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:98282:166"/>
fore-ordained,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 20. Faith in
Christ to come, saved our fore-fathers,
Christ was an effectual Mediator then,
in <hi>esse cognito,</hi> not in <hi>esse reali;</hi> this gives
present efficacy to a moral Cause; hence <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
had the benefit of Christ's Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>therefore he rejoyced,</hi> John 8. 56, 58.
The <hi>Israelites</hi> are said to tempt Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
10. 9. Therefore he was with the Church
then, so <hi>verse</hi> 4. called a rock; <hi>David</hi> calls
Christ, <hi>Lord, Psal.</hi> 110. 1. Which shews
that Christ had power over him, to save
him, to redeem him; so that you see Christ,
tho not actually Incarnate, procured Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sin for the Saints then, who act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Faith on Christ to come; they saw him
a far off, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 17. Promises do sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
something before they are fulfilled; the
Merits of Christ's Blood being known to
God, before it was actually shed, had its
vertue and influence from the beginning.</p>
               <p>According to the Divine Oeconomy,
Christ mediates with the Father only; he
is never in Scripture brought in, praying
to the Son or the Spirit; Christ as God-man
is Mediator to himself, as he is essentially God;
and Christ as Mediator, is inferior to himself.
As he is essentially God, so he is the Party
offended; but as Mediator God-man, so he
is the party that makes reconciliation: A
Mediator is not of one, <hi>i. e.</hi> He consists of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98282:166"/>
two distinct Natures; Angels, and Saints
are mere Creatures, and never will be more,
and therefore will make but sorry Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
the Man Christ is the highest Creature
Image of God, because he is God as well as
Man. The Hypostatical union of the two
natures in Christ, is the Foundation of our
spiritual and mystical union to God; God
and his Creature Man, meet in Christ the
Mediator.</p>
               <p>We must not understand our union to
Christ so grosly, as if we were Deified; I
abhor that blasphemous Famelistical Notion
of our being Christed and Godded; no,
the new Creature in its nearest union, and
highest communion with God, is but a
Creature, and never will be more; nothing
that is infinite, eternal, and uncreated, can
in its immensity enter into us, but we may
enter into it; hence the Saints are said to
enter into life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 17.
As a Barrel cast into the Sea, is in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Sea, tho the fulness of the Sea
be not in the Barrel, 'tis filled according to
its Capacity, and can hold no more: So is
the life of Christ derived to us by gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Communications in a way of influence
from Christ the Fountain of life; we live,
because he lives who hath life in himself,
and is a quickning Spirit in us; certainly
great things are intended by, and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:98282:167"/>
in our union to Christ; I remember a
late eminent Divine, now in Glory, expresses
it thus: That provided we keep below the
Hypostatical union of the two natures in
Christ; we cannot ascend too high in our
thoughts and conceptions of the mystical
union between Christ and his Members; all
that is below the hypostatical union, may
be allowed to this: So that I would not
have any interpret our union to Christ, and
communion with him, into so low a sense,
as not to apprehend how Believers by vertue
of their union to Christ, stand in a nearer
relation to God than the Angels do, whose
Nature Christ took not; I say, Believers
are under a more special, immediate influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the eternal Spirit; their life is hid
with Christ in God, and will be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by us in Heaven, than it is here
on Earth; though we should be studying
it more and more: I am sorry to see
the most spiritual expressions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
sealed up as it were by a common
short exposition of them, that goes with
most for the full sense of the Text; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
it may be, truth, but not all the
truth; or at least does not fully express all
the truth; 'tis looked upon as very unsafe
to put a further and higher construction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the words, than others has done before;
though they will bear it: I think while we
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98282:167"/>
keep within the Analogy of Faith, not
wounding any vital part, or fundamental
Principle of Religion, nor wresting the
Scriptures to a forced sense, we may admit
any farther light that shines through the
word unto us, waiting upon God to lead us
by his Spirit further and further into the
knowledge of the truth, as 'tis in Jesus,
that our light may shine out into the perfect
day.</p>
               <p>Christ being thus qualified for his Office, is</p>
               <p>1. Called the Messenger or Angel of the
Covenant, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. Because he does declare
and interpret the terms of the Covenant
between God and Man, as <hi>Moses</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi>
20. 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 5, 27. In this he was a
type of Christ, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15, 18, 19.
Therefore Christ as Mediator is referred to
in the Old Testament, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 8.</p>

Acts.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>As Mediating with God for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As Mediating with us on God's
behalf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>As Mediating with God for us,</hi> 1. By gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
satisfaction to his Father's Justice. He
undertook this as our Surety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7. And actually performed this
Undertaking, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28.
<hi>John</hi> 10. 15. To give satisfaction, is <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
facere, quantum satis est.</hi> Christ as a
Priest offering himself up to death for us,
was one of the chiefest acts of his Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he might take away the guilt of
sin; bur this was not all, for as our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
he puts forth a further act, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. By promising to sanctify us, to free
us from the filth of sin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26,
27. He shews there that Christ upon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
himself for the Church, laid himself
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:98282:169"/>
under Engagements to sanctifie and cleanse
it; here <hi>the law of the spirit of life in Christ,
makes us free from the law of sin and death,</hi>
Rom. 8. 2. Thus Christ by himself pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
our sins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p>3. By making Intercession for us.</p>
               <p>1. On Earth. John 17. 9. 20. <hi>I pray
for them, and for all that shall believe on me
through their word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In Heaven. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34.
1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. He ever lives to
make Intercession for us; 'tis continual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession;
should it cease but for a Moment,
we should be in great danger; therefore
Christ is continually representing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
what he has done, and suffered for us
in the flesh.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>As Mediating with us on God's behalf.</hi>
Christ as Mediator, came about the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
business, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 49. And deals with
us Prodigals, about our returning to our
Heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>1. By declaring the Father's Will to us,
<hi>John</hi> 1. 18. <hi>John</hi> 6. 38, 39, 40. <hi>John</hi> 17.
8, 14.</p>
               <p>2. By applying his Merits in the efficacy
of them unto us. <hi>The son quickneth whom
he will,</hi> John 5. 21. <hi>If when we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
we were reconciled to God by the deatb of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:98282:169"/>
his Son; much more being reconciled, we shall
be saved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. There is
a mighty Power in the Death and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3,
4, 5. When we are planted in the likeness of
both, we shall then as Branches abiding in
the true Vine, bring forth much fruit, <hi>John</hi>
15. 5.</p>
               <p>The efficacy of Christ's Mediation, and
the effectual Application of the Merits of
his Blood to us, in our Justification, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</p>
               <p>1. In our Regeneration, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>2. By preserving us from final Apostacy,
<hi>John</hi> 10. 28. <hi>John</hi> 17. 12.</p>
               <p>3. By raising us up unto glory at the last
day, <hi>John</hi> 6. 39, 40. <hi>John</hi> 17. 22.</p>
               <p>In order to all this, God chose us in
Christ our Mediator from Eternity, <hi>Eph.</hi>
1. 4. The office of a Mediator lies in Trans,
acting all things with God, that concerns
the people, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Heb. 2. 17.
<hi>That he may save his people from their sins,</hi>
Mat. 1. 21.</p>
               <p>Christ is Mediator of Redemption to
man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. Of Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and Confirmation unto Angels, who
need such a Mediator, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 10. Angels
were mutable Creatures, till Confirmed by
Christ, for which they are, no doubt, very
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:98282:170"/>
thankful unto God. We ought to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
not only for deliverance out of evils al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come upon us, but also for being
kept from many evils that might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
us, as <hi>Psal</hi> 86. 12, 13 <hi>Psal.</hi> 144.
9, 10, 11. Upon this account Christ is to
be worshipped not only by men, but by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1 6. And Angels being sensible
of so great a benefit by Christ their Head,
they do willingly Minister to his Members,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. They rejoyce at
the Conversion of sinners, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 10.
They gain more knowledge in Gospel
Mysteries by the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10.
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. They have all Prophetick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
from Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>The
testimony of Jesus, is the spirit of prophesy.</hi>
All such Gospel discoveries, are called the
Revelation of Jesus Christ, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1.
<hi>The word of God, and the testimony of Jesus,
v.</hi> 2. <hi>Who is the faithful witness, v.</hi> 5.
Men and Angels bare record to the truth of
this; <hi>John</hi> did, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 2. That Heavenly
Host of Angels did it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 13. 14. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are a part of the Church, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. They are
called the Sons of God, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 6 <hi>Job</hi> 2. 1.
Elect, and therefore in Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21.
Therefore that the Angels stand, and that
fallen man is raised up again, both are
from Christ, our great Mediator and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:98282:170"/>
whose Prayers are always heard for
the Church, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Because
Christ hath the same will with the
Father, <hi>John</hi> 10. 30. Because Christ is
well beloved, his Person is Accepted, and
we in him, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 6. and his Prayers
are offered on the Altar of his Godhead,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Answer</hi> Some Popish Objections, and
open some Scriptures very much perverted
by them.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Obj.</hi> Christ is Mediator in respect of
his Humane Nature, only as man, from
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>There is one God, and one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
between God and men, tbe Man Christ
Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Man here is taken in the concrete,
for the whole Person of the Mediator, not
in the abstract, for his Humane Nature only;
in saying the man Christ, we don't exclude
his Divinity; <hi>quia in homine Deus est,</hi>
Ambros. The Man Christ, and Christ as a
man, differ very much; the First signifies
God-man, the Second only Man: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we say against the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> That
though Christ, who is man, be every where,
yet Christ as man is not every where;
these Two Propositions are not <hi>equipollent;</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:98282:171"/>
The First is true, the Second is false; 'tis
the Error of the <hi>Vbiquitarians.</hi> If Christ
were only God, or only Man, then not
<hi>medius inter Deum &amp; hominem,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no Mediator. Therefore how can
Saints, who are only men, become fit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators?
When we say the <hi>Man Christ,</hi> the
Species is explained and limited by the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuum</hi>
to such a man, who is the Christ
of God, God and Man.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Obj.</hi> Since Christ our Mediator is
Ascended and Glorified, and is to resign up
his Mediatory Kingdom, 'tis necessary that
others be preferred to that Office, <hi>v.</hi> 9. the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Apostles, Martyrs, and
Confessors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Christ has not yet resigned up
his Mediatory Kingdom. 2. The Apostle
1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1, 2. confutes this, and says, <hi>We
now have an advocate with the Father, Iesus
Christ the righteous.</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 4. <hi>Thou
art a priest for ever, always making intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for us,</hi> Rom. 8. 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24.</p>
               <p>I grant indeed, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
24. that Christ will resign up his Mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Kingdom to the Father; when Sin,
Death, and all the Enemies of the Church
are overcome, there will be no need of
such a Mediator then, as Christ now is,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:98282:171"/>
riding on conquering and to conquer, <hi>Rev.</hi>
6. 2. So long as there are any to be conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Christ is in a Warlike posture on
Horseback; but when all are subdued,
then he possesses the Kingdom in peace
with his Father, Reigns with him as God
to Eternity, Triumphing in the final over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of all his Enemies: Though he
then cease from those Mediatory acts,
which the present necessities of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Church and People call for; yet he
continues a Mediator still; he did not finish
that Office in the Garden, or upon the
Cross, that he should be no more a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>When 'tis said Christ shall deliver up the
Kingdom to the Father, this is not to be so
taken, as if the Father did not now Reign,
or that the Son should not Reign after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
But because while the Prince of
Darkness reigns, and the far greater part
of the World goes after him, God seems
not to reign while they won't own
him for their King: But when Christ
shall have conquered all his Enemies, and
brought all the Elect into a due subjection
to God, then he shall deliver up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in a quiet setled state to the Father, so
as the Son shall Reign with him for ever;
<hi>for of his kingdom there is no end,</hi> Luke 1.
33. The subjection spoken of here, is not
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:98282:172"/>
any thing unworthy of Christ, but makes
rather for his glory, to have his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
more visibly subject to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For as long as Christ holds his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory
Kingdom, having all Judgment
committed to himself; doing all himself,
though by Commission from his Father;
yet while he is exerting this Regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by virtue of his Mediatory Office, it
does not so well appear, how as Man he is
subject to the Father, as it will do when
God shall be all in all: Yet still the Efficacy
of Christ's Offices is eternal, though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Execution of them may in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
then cease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. The Papists hold, That though
there be but one Mediator of Redemption,
yet there may be many Mediators of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If many Mediators, in any sense,
had been necessary to save man, this had
reflected upon the Grace of God; since the
sin of one man was enough to damn all
mankind. <hi>By one man's disobedience many
were made sinners,</hi> Rom 5. 19. Wy should
not the Obedience of one, especially
such a Man as Christ, make many Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
Therefore 'tis said, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5, 6.
<hi>One Mediator gave himself a ransom for all.
There is one Lord,</hi> Ephes. 4. 5.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. From <hi>Psal.</hi> 132. 10. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
infer from thence, That God does not
hear us for Christ's sake only, but for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
sake too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> When 'tis said for <hi>David</hi>'s sake,
'tis not meant for the Merit, Intercession or
Mediation of <hi>David,</hi> as we understand
when we say for Christ's sake: But here
'tis for the sake of the Covenant made
with <hi>David</hi> and his seed, from whom
should spring the <hi>Messiah;</hi> this Covenant is
mentioned, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 3, 4, 24. Hence the
Saints expostulate with God in the same
<hi>Psalm, v.</hi> 49, 50. So these words in <hi>Psalm</hi>

Christ our Mediator.</p>
               <p>Are we come to Jesus the Mediator of the
New Covenant? Then let us never think to
obtain any New Covenant-mercy without
the Mediation of Christ; 'tis great presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to come alone, and in our own names
to the Throne of Grace; all the force and
efficacy of our Prayers, depends upon the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:98282:173"/>
Intercession of Christ, who is our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with the Father, our great High-Priest,
always appearing in Heaven for us; he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
that our Prayers shall be heard,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 22. <hi>Whatsoever ye ask in prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
ye shall receive.</hi> Mark 11. 24. Joh.
14. 6. <hi>No coming unto the Father but by me;
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that
will I do. If ye shall ask any thing in my name
I will do it,</hi> V. 13, 14. <hi>Whatsoever ye shall
ask the Father in my name, he will give it
you,</hi> John 16. 23. What encouragement
does Christ give us to pray in his Name, to
make use of him for our Mediator in all
things, wherein we have to do with God!
He presents his People, and their servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to God for acceptance: What can a man
do for himself? How can he deal with God,
without a Mediator? <hi>I have sinned</hi> (says
<hi>Job</hi> 7. 20.) <hi>What shall I do unto thee, O
thou preserver of men?</hi> A Sinner knows
not what to do without a Mediator.</p>
               <p>We can have no Communion with God,
but by a Mediator; no Mediator but Christ;
our fellowship is with the Father and with
the Son, <hi>i. e.</hi> with the Father by the Son, and
no otherwise: 'Tis not enough to own one
God, unless we own one Mediator, <hi>the
man Christ,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. <hi>I am the door, no
entring but by me,</hi> John 10. 9. <hi>No other
name under heaven, whereby we must be saved,</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:98282:173"/>
Acts 4. 12. Christ is the Ladder reaching

climbing up to Heaven any other way;

                  <hi>To Jesus the Mediator of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
The New Covenant implies, That
God will deal with men upon new terms,
upon other Terms than he did before under
the first Covenant; this is a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
established upon better Promises,
more encouraging, more relieving to a
poor Sinner. The Mediator of the New
Covenant, lives for ever to make intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:98282:174"/>
for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. From this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
argues, That they shall be Saved to
the uttermost, or evermore, as in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,

or make alive: Christ as Mediator will
do every thing that tends to the perfecting
of eternal life; Christ is a very powerful
Advocate, heard in all the requests he makes
to the Father, <hi>John</hi> 11. 41, 42. If so, then
the perseverance of the Saints is built upon
a sure bottom, because Christ has prayed
for them, <hi>John</hi> 17. 24. That they may be
kept, <hi>v.</hi> 15. That their Faith fail not, <hi>Luke</hi>
22. 32.</p>
               <p>Christ's Mediation, as useful and necessary
as it is, extends not it self beyond his Church
and Chosen, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 33, 34. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>John</hi> 10. 14. He plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
this, <hi>John.</hi> 17. 9, 20. His Mediation
reaches no further than the Covenant; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Mediator is the Mediator of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
all men are not taken into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, though Christ prayed for
his Enemies here on Earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34.
That was because he knew some of his
Elect were to be found among his Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
this Prayer of Christ took effect, for
some of them were afterwards converted,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23, 37. You see how effectual the
Mediation of Christ is; therefore if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:98282:174"/>
to speed at the Throne of Grace, let
us be sure to direct all our Prayers to God
by Faith in the Name of Christ Jesus,
the Mediator of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p>As we are directed to come to God by
Christ, and through Christ; so we must
be sure to come to God in Christ, to God
in a Mediator, as well as by him. Christ,
though he be another Person, yet he is not
another God from the Father; and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, he is <hi>alius,</hi> but not <hi>aliud,</hi> not
differing in the essence of the Deity from
the Father; we shall become vain in our
imaginations, if we set our selves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of God out of Christ; we are apt to
pass through the Mediator to the Father,
as to a God distinct from the Mediator:
Some Christians have been very much at a
loss in the actings of their Faith upon God
through Christ, because they have not
looked unto God in Christ so much as
they should: Christ calls us to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of himself, that we might know
the Father in him, <hi>John</hi> 14. 7. <hi>If ye
had known me, ye should have known my
Father also. He that hath seen me, hath
seen the father,</hi> v. 9. <hi>I am in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the father in me,,</hi> v. 10. God
in Christ is the only true object of all
Divine Worship. <hi>In him the Godhead
dwells bodily,</hi> Col. 2. 9. We can have no
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:98282:175"/>
Communion with the Godhead, but
through the Flesh of Christ; as he is
God Incarnate, our <hi>Emanuel,</hi> and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
Faith first takes hold of the Flesh of
Christ, and through that veil draws nigh to
God who is a <hi>Spirit, Heb,</hi> 10. 19, 20. <hi>John</hi>
6. 56. The main end of Christ in dying
for us, was to bring us to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.
18. And that he may effect this, he shews
us God in himself. They who have not
seen God in Christ, they know not what
God is, they have never yet seen him who
is invisible: This is the Excellency of the
Christian Religion, That it brings us to
the knowledge of that very Person who is
God, which cannot be said of any other
Religion whatever.</p>

               <p>THE Apostle here shews the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

Gospel time, when Grace first broke out;

now run to a fulness, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>i. e. to the time
appointed of the father, v.</hi> 2. For the fuller
manifestation of Gospel-Grace; Adoption
is not to be restrained altogether to the
times of the New Testament; the Saints
of Old had their share of it, sucked some
comfort from those more obscure Promises
of Gospel-Grace; they were acted by some
love, as well as fear; truly, Saints now
are not altogether without their fears under
this abundance of Grace that is revealed to
them; so that their Adoption and ours, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not in substance, but in the manner
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:98282:176"/>
of Revelation; 'tis clearer to us, than it
was to them.</p>
               <p>Adoption in Scripture is taken more
largely, as including those who are Sons of
God by Name only, as all common Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
who are but externally in Covenant,
such are called the Sons of God, and of the
Kingdom, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 12. But
such Children may prove Bastards, not
true sons of God. So God chuseth the
Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be his peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
this is called Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4.
<hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 22. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 1. This was a type, or
resemblance of our spiritual Adoption in
Christ; and in this strict sense I now take
it, as it is applicable only to those who
are the Children of God from special Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Grace, who have the Nature, Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and Disposition of Children.</p>
               <p>Christ is the Son of God by eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
Angels by Creation, Believers by
a voluntary Adoption; and of this I am now
to speak.</p>
               <p>First, What this Adoption is.</p>
               <p>1. As to the thing it self. Adoption is
a high expression of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s love to us; a
clear evidence of that great intimacy and
nearness that is between God and Believers,
who are admitted into fellowship with the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:98282:177"/>
Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
How our Adoption rises from the Son-ship
of Christ, by vertue of our Union to, and
Communion with him, I shall shew in its
proper place. For the present, take this
general description of it, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
act of God, giving all Believers power
to become the Children of God, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12.
looking upon them ever after as such; taking
them into his Family, and under his eternal
Care, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Eph</hi> 3. 15. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>quasi filii
constituti,</hi> constituted, ordained, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God to be his Children, to be in the
state and condition of Children unto him.</p>
               <p>Power to become, <hi>i. e. jus,</hi> or right to
Adoption; the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifies a
lawful Liberty, or License given by God,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. So here, Believers do not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp
a Name or Title that does not belong
to them; God has called them his Children,
and made them his Children; therefore
they may lawfully and rightfully be called
by that Name: The word also implies a
special Prerogative, Dignity, and Honour
conferred upon them, which is primarily
intended in this place.</p>
               <p>As Justification, so Adoption makes only
a relative change of state in the Judgment
of God; reckoning, or reputing us to
be his Children, whom he will love and
own as such.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:98282:177"/>
2. As to its order and place in Divinity,
how comes it in, and where, after what?
'Tis an Article of Faith; I am now enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
What joint in the whole body of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
is the proper Seat of this Article;
that we may know what immediately goes
before it, and what immediately follows after
it: We have not a right Method or Scheme
of Divinity in our Heads, till we see the
coherence, dependance, and reference that
one Gospel-truth hath with, upon, and to
another, that stands next it.</p>
               <p>There is some variation here among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
tho no material difference; some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
it to Predestination, some to Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
some to Justification, some to Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and some to Glorification; indeed
it has some reference to all those, as will
appear by and by.</p>
               <p>I conceive Adoption comes orderly to be
considered after Justification, as an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,
or consequent of it; it presupposes
Faith, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. And therefore is no part
of Justification, but a Spiritual priviledge
flowing from it.</p>
               <p>Believers have a double right to Heaven,
one from Redemption, the other from Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
this is an accumulative right, <hi>ex a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundanti,</hi>
given purposely to confirm them
in their hope of Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
tends to Glorification, and gives a
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:98282:178"/>
right to it; I mean, it is not the Meritorious
cause, but only <hi>causa dispositiva,</hi> it doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
tend, both to Sanctification, and
Glorification. God draws Arguments from
one act of his Grace towards us, to proceed
further and further in a way of Grace with
us; having made us his Children, it pleases
him to give us a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> How it is brought about, as to
the cause, manner, and time of it.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>1. The cause of it.</head>
                  <p>1. The free Grace of God the Father,
not any Merit of ours, <hi>John</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Eph.</hi>
1. 5. Therefore we should be thankful to
him for it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>To the father who
hath made us meet, &amp;c. He hath wrought
us for the self-same thing,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 5. Who
hath not only conferred a right of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Glory, but also hath suited and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our hearts and nature by his Grace, to
enjoy this glory, and delight in it.</p>
                  <p>2. As God the Father is the prime Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Adoption, so Christ is the exemplar;
the Spirit impressing upon us the similitude
of that exemplar, we become the Children
of God. I shall open this a little, and shew
you what influence Christ has into our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption:
God gives the Elect to Christ as
his Children, as the Heirs of God, and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:98282:178"/>
joint-Heirs with Christ; they lostt-heir In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and recovered
it in the second <hi>Adam;</hi> they now stand in
the same relation to God, (in their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure)
as Christ does; <hi>I, and the children
thou hast given me,</hi> Heb. 2. 13. The Son
of God must become the Son of Man,
that we might be made the Sons of God in
him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 4, 5. Here comes in our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
by vertue of our relation to Christ
our elder Brother, as one with him, <hi>Gal.</hi>
3. 28. All God's Adopted Children are
found in his natural Son, mystically united to
him, deriving from him that filial relation
which they have to God: Al God's Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are of one mould, of one shape and
fashion, all conformable to the image of his
Son; this is the Mark by which they are
known and distinguished from others. The
great enquiry that God makes, is, What of
Christ there is in us? what of Christ there
is held forth by us? God owns none for
his Children, but such as resemble Christ;
Christ is the express Image of the Father,
and Christians are the express Image of
Christ. The reason why God the Father is
so well pleased with the man Christ, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he sees his own Image in him; he sees
himself, his own essence in Christ, not so in
the Saints; the Image of the Father in
Christ, and the Image of Christ in the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:98282:179"/>
Saints, do agree in many things, yet they
differ in some; the Image of Christ in the
Saints, is not the essence of God, for that
is incommunicable to any mere Creature;
but it is a lively resemblance of all the
communicable attributes of God in some
degree and measure drawn from the very
face of Christ, upon the faces, hearts, and
lives of all Christians; yet still, Christ is the
original, by eternal Generation; the Saints
are but so many Copies drawn in time from
that Original, and they are drawn to the
life, not only in a way of outward resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
but by a real inward participation
of the Life and Spirit of Christ, according
to their finite capacity. As the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
does subsist in the Divine Person of
Christ; so our humane Persons, so far
as we are new Creatures, do Subsist in
Christ, in whom we spiritually live, move,
and have our Being, as New Creatures; the
Divine Graces of Christ do subsist in the
Saints, by the Spirit of Christ dwelling in
them; <hi>i. e.</hi> They act the same Graces fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,
which Christ acts infinitely; they
receive of his fulness, but cannot contain
all his fulness, they have not a capacity for
that; they enter into his fulness, but all his
fulness cannot enter into them.</p>
                  <p>3. Our Adoption is brought about, not
only by the Father and the Son, but also by
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:98282:179"/>
the Spirit; bearing Witness with our spirit
to the truth of the Image of Christ drawn
upon the Soul, inferring from thence our
Adoption. The same Image bears the same
name, implies (in a measure) the same
nature and Spirit to be in us, that is in
Christ, puts us into the same relation to God,
that the Man Christ stands in; the names
of things would never occur to our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
if the likeness of the object we look
upon, did not teach us what to call it; <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniunt
rebus Nomina</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit witnesses by inward impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins,
tho no voice be heard; and these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
are always according to the word;
the Spirit does not speak from himself, sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
any thing to us not contained in the
word; but of this more hereafter. I am now
shewing how Adoption is carried on by the
Spirit, therefore called the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
because given only to the Adopted;
and because he bears witness to them of the
good Will of God, wherewith the Father
hath accepted them in the beloved, that he
might be a Father to them: Tho the Spirit
works all other saving Graces in us, yet
because Adoption is the prime, and chief
work of the Spirit, therefore he is called
the Spirit of Adoption.</p>

his nature, but the Father communicates to

               <p>3. Humane Adoption is for want of a
natural Son, 'tis an act of law, imitating
nature, for the comfort of those who have
no Children: But Divine Adoption is from
the abounding love of God to us, making
us joint heirs with his well-beloved Son.
Though God had a Son from eternity, yet
he had none of humane race, none of our
kind, all being fallen in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Our spiritual Sonship runs thus; <hi>If
children, then heirs;</hi> 'tis not so among
men, all Sons are not Heirs, but only the
eldest; but we shall every one possess the
whole Inheritance: <hi>Come ye blessed of my
father, inherit the kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.
34.</p>
               <p>5. Adoption among men, implies a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
into the inheritance after the death
of the Adopter: <hi>Haereditas est successio in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versum
jus defuncti, Civil.</hi> A Testament is
of force after men are dead, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 17. The
Heir, whether Natural or Adopted, has
nothing to do with the Estate till then.
But our Heavenly Father never dies, our
Elder brother never dies; and yet we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into possession, have a present Copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nership
with the Father and the Son; <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our fellowship is with the Father, and with
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:98282:181"/>
his Son Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 John 1. 3. Nay,
we actually enjoy the whole inheritance
with the Father and the Son; indeed they
are our inheritance, the only portion of
our Souls: Had God left us never so much
to be enjoyed by it self, apart from God,
'twould be as nothing to us; Heaven
would not be Heaven, if God were not
there; therefore we are said to be glorified
together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. Christ will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
among his Brethren, <hi>John</hi> 17. 24.
Their Glory lies in beholding his; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son will have all things to be in
common between them and the Saints, and
that to all Eternity: Here is a Glorious
Adoption indeed; the world never knew
the like. <hi>What manner of love is this, that we
we should be called the children of God.</hi> Tho our
Heavenly Father never die, nor our Elder
Brother never die, yet we must die before we
can have full possession of the whole inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
so did the Man Christ, and so must
we, <hi>If we suffer with him, we shall reign
with him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12.</p>

               <p>1. A Loving peaceable disposition. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are the peace-makers, for they
shall be called the children of God,</hi> Mat. 5. 9.
Who is the God of peace, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us with great earnestness, <hi>if it be
possible, and as much as lies in us, to live
peaceably with all men,</hi> Rom. 12. 18. So
far as may be without wrong to the truth
and our own Consciences, we must so fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Peace as not to quit Holiness, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
14. A zealous contending for the Truth,
is very consistent with the peaceable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of a true Christian, <hi>We may have salt
in our selves, and yet have peace one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
Mark 9. 50. Adoption is an uniting
principle; the Saints should live together in
Love, as the Children of one Father, as
joined in the same interest: <hi>Behold, how
good and how pleasant is it for brethren to dwell
together in unity,</hi> Psal. 133. 1. What <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
said unto <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 13. 8. we should
say to each other, <hi>Let there be no strife, I
pray thee, between me and thee, for we be bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
I wish there were more of this sign
of Adoption among the Children of God
this day: We have reason all of us to pray
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:98282:182"/>
for more of that Wisdom that is from
above, <hi>Which is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, and easy to be intreated,</hi> James 3. 17.</p>
               <p>2. A spiritual and holy Conversation,
<hi>Abraham's children do the works of Abraham:</hi>
Joh. 8. 39. <hi>Walk in the steps of his faith,</hi>
Rom. 4. 12. <hi>Who is the father of us all,</hi>
V. 16. The Children of God should not
debase themselves to the sordid practices
of the men of the World; they should
shine out as lights in the midst of a crooked
Generation, making streight paths for their
feet, walking evenly and uprightly, as
those who are led by the Spirit of God, and
thereby do approve themselves to be the
Children of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14</p>
               <p>3. A reverential Fear of God in all our
ways, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. joined with
filial Obedience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. which they
are led to, not from a mercenary hope of
reward, but from an innate Principle of
Love to God as their Heavenly Father;
they cannot but take after that will of God,
of which they were begotten.</p>
               <p>4. A restless breathing and panting after
God when he hides his face from us in any
displeasure: A child of God can't bear the
least distance between God and his soul, <hi>Psa.</hi>
42. 1, 2. There is nothing that a gracious
Soul more desires, than the presence of
God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84 10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 4. He is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:98282:183"/>
out by a Divine instinct after God,
his joy is full when he is in communion
with God, and he is presently troubled
when his face is hid. The more God sheds
abroad his Love in our hearts, the more are
our hearts captivated to him, made more
willing in the day of his power to serve
him; The Love of God is a conquering
Love, a heart-subduing Love, it has a
mighty constraining power over us, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the will after it. The Law presses du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but gives us no strength to perform it,
it pricks us forward, as with the point of a
Sword, but does not bear us up in doing it:
The Law commands Holiness, but under
the Gospel, Holiness commands us; the
Principles of it being inlaid in our renewed
Natures, <hi>We consent unto the law, that it is
good; we delight in it after the inward man,</hi>
Rom. 7. 16. 22. 'Tis written in our hearts,
we are a Law to our selves, and therefore
not without Law to God, but under the
Law to Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 21. The Grace
of the Gospel suits our wills to the will of
God, the free Spirit of Christ inclines us
to new Obedience; God knows how to
commend his Love to us, how to ingratiate
himself with us, till he has so taken our
hearts, that we begin to be sick of love
towards him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 9. Full of vehement
desires and longings after him. <hi>David</hi>'s
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:98282:183"/>
heart was ready to break under this most
holy frame, <hi>Psalm</hi> 119. 20.</p>
               <p>Till we are Adopted children, we are
(as to our state) under the Law.</p>
               <p>To be under the Law, is to be without a
Spirit of Grace; to be a debtor to the Law,
when we have nothing to pay; to be under
the curse and servitude of the Law, acting
out of Fear, not Love: We can't Love
God or Godliness, till we Believe God loves
us in Christ; this molifies and changes
the heart; we are holy by choice now, are
a Law to our selves; <hi>ergo,</hi> the Doctrine of
Free-Grace is no licentious Doctrine, as
some would make us believe. 'Tis not
wrangling about Faith and Works, but
living by Faith, that gives us an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
knowledge of the truth and power
of the Doctrine of Free-grace; which
makes us own God as our God. We must
break the First Commandment, before we
can break any of the other Nine. In a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hour, <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s <hi>Tutissimum est,</hi> will be
good Doctrine. When we bring things to
an issue between God and our own Souls
about Justification, we shall conclude as
<hi>Paul</hi> does, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. Then <hi>Blessed is the
man to whom the Lord imputes righteousness
without works,</hi> Romans 4. 6.</p>

               <p>ADoption carries all the outward pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of the Covenant along with
it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. But because this relates to
Adoption at large, I shall confine my self
to those special privileges of Adoption,
that belong to the true Children of God
only, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. A filial confidence and boldness at
the Throne of Grace; <hi>In whom we have
boldness and access with confidence, by the
faith of him,</hi> Ephes. 3. 12. Heb. 4. 16. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
heightens our trust and confidence
in God; Christ as a Son, trusted in God,
and so do all Christians, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p>2. Conformity to Christ; Christ is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. As Christ is, so
are they, each one resembles the children of
a King, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. 18. They will be exactly

unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

4. 7. We have not only a right, but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
participation of the inheritance in
some degree here; we have something in
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:98282:184"/>
hand, and more in hope; the earnest Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the first fruits we now have, the rest
is reserved for us in Heaven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14.
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. God makes us joint heirs with
Christ, to share with him, because the
Heavenly inheritance is not diminished by
being communicated to many: Every one
has all.</p>
               <p>The Sons of God are Heirs, 1. Of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. 5. 2. Of this World,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. 3. Of the Promise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.
17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 9.</p>
               <p>4. Adoption translates us out of a Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
estate, into a Happy estate; from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Children of the Devil, of Wrath, of
Perdition, of Darkness, to become the
Children of God, partakers of the Divine
Nature, Brethren of Christ, Children of
Light, Children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> being Aliens
and strangers before, standing at a great
distance from God, <hi>We are now brought nigh
by the blood of Christ,</hi> Eph. 2. 12, 13. Are
become children of the house, to abide there
for ever; God is in Covenant with us, and
we in him. <hi>I will receive you, and be a
father to you,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18. A great
promise indeed, it secures us for ever; like
that which God made to <hi>David</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 14, 15. <hi>I
will be his father, and he shall be my Son,
my mercy shall not depart away from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:98282:185"/>
Adoption casts us upon God, puts us
under his Fatherly care for ever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 25,
26, 32, 33. So <hi>Mordecai</hi> brought up <hi>Hester;</hi>
when he took her for his own Daughter,
<hi>Esther</hi> 2. 7. This title of being the Children
of God is very honourable; how do the
Saints glory in it! 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 1. it makes us
great indeed, as was said of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi>
1. 32. <hi>He shall be great, and shall be called
the son of the most High.</hi> How do men
value themselves upon the account of their
Birth, as descending from an Ancient Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Family? He that is born of God,
is better born, more Nobly descended than
they, and may vie Genealogies with the
best of them: By Faith <hi>Moses</hi> refused to
be called the Son of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter,
chusing rather to suffer Affliction with the
people of God; esteeming the reproach of
Christ greater riches than the Treasures in
<hi>Egypt, Heb.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>I shall chuse rather to insist upon those
privileges of Adoption that flow from
that Christian Liberty, which always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
it; <hi>If the son shall make you free,
ye shall be free indeed,</hi> John 8. 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> We are freed from the curse of the Law,
by the merit of the death of Christ; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
look above the Law and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of it for their Justification; they
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:98282:185"/>
have no respect to their own Works in
Justification; because they know they are
justified without them; they eye only the
Mercy of God in Christ for their Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
When the question is about Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
(and 'tis a question much agitated
among us now-a-days) 'tis not how we are
made Righteous in our selves, but how we
being Sinners in our selves, may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Righteous and Just before God; we
must consult with the Gospel about this,
not the Law; how God becomes propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to Sinners; 'tis Christ, not the Law,
gives us the reason of this: And when
Conscience is satisfied in this point, That
we shall not be Judged by the Law, the
Saints do willingly yield Obedience to the
Law, according to the measure of Grace
they have received; they know now, that
for Christ's sake, their sincere, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Obedience will be accepted. We
can never serve God chearfully till then;
we cannot believe that God counts himself
truly Worshipped by our imperfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
till we believe he will accept of it
through Christ: For the Law rejects all
imperfect Works, 'tis Faith in Christ only
procures their acceptance; <hi>For we are not
under the Law, but under grace,</hi> i. e. We
are not only freed from the Curse of the
Law: But</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:98282:186"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Are put into such a state of Grace, that
we seek not the Blessing from the Law
(indeed it has none for us) but from the
Gospel, which blesses us in the Name of
Christ, and for his sake, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23, 24.
<hi>Before faith came, we were kept under the law,
shut up unto the faith, which should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
be revealed. Wherefore the law was
our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that
we might be justified by faith.</hi> So Romans
8. 15.</p>
               <p>And as we are freed from the curse of
the Law, and also from the intollerable
yoak, and servile paedagogy of the Law. So</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> We are no longer tied up from the use
of those indifferent things prohibited by
the Law; and this is another part of the
glorious Liberty of the Children of God,
which we should always use to God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and the good of our Neighbour. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things are of that middle nature,
that in the simple use of them, or abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from them, there lies no Religion either
way, <hi>i. e.</hi> Conscience is not bound to one,
or to the other, but free to either: 'Tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to know this, to satisfy scrupulous
Consciences, that may be under the power
of a superstitious Opinion, as if the use of
this or that were unlawful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:98282:186"/>
'Tis a dangerous thing to speak too freely
of Christian Liberty, because many under
that pretence, allow themselves in very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
courses, running into excess, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aside all Moderation, Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of themselves in the use of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things: Therefore you must note,
That Christian Liberty is altogether Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Not to be used for an occasion
to the Flesh,</hi> Gal. 5. 13. So that Luxury in
Diet, Pride in Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can never
be justified by the doctrine of Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
which is principally intended to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
fearful Consciences in these Three
Things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Whether our sins be all pardoned.</item>
                  <item>2. Whether our imperfect Obedience
pleases God.</item>
                  <item>3. Whether God allows the free use of
all indifferent things.</item>
               </list>
               <p>These are the puzzling points that are
apt to disturb our Consciences, till we
rightly understand the nature of Christian
Liberty; which does not countenance that
excess, that too many of the Richer sort
run into, vying who shall be finest in their
Apparel, most sumptuous in their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments;
these things are not forbidden,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:98282:187"/>
say they: 'Tis true, the things themselves
are not forbidden, but the immoderate use
of them is forbidden. Therefore let your
moderation be seen in all things; and
know that your Christian Liberty lies as
well in abstaining from indifferent things,
when inexpedient, as in using them.
Christian Liberty relates to Conscience,
both thy own and thy Brothers: So use
your Estates, that you may glorifie God
and edifie your Brother, and we shall not
question your Liberty; 'tis not for nothing
that so many woes are pronounced against
the Rich, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 24, 25, 26. Read that
place, and also <hi>Amos</hi> 6. to <hi>v.</hi> 7. I don't
quote these places, that you should throw
away your Riches, and lay aside all Mirth;
no, do but throw out the sin that is in all
these, and I have nothing to say against the
lawful use of the things themselves, but
see you don't abuse them.</p>

               <head>The APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>LET us labour to live in the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sense of our Adoption, as the only
way to walk worthy of it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6.
'Tis a shame to do otherwise, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 6.</p>
               <p>The best way to keep up a sense of our
Adoption, and of all the high priviledges
belonging to it: Is</p>
               <p>1. To attend to the witness of the Spirit
within us: Our Adoption is a great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the grounds and reasons of it lie very
deep, quite out of the reach of a mere Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
understanding, that cannot discern
the deep things of God; we shall certainly
be at a loss in our own thoughts, how to
clear up our Adoption, if the Spirit do not
help us, and make it out plainly to our
Spirit from the word; and when that is
done, we sit down astonished at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God's Love; when the Spirit has
satisfied us, that it is so, we can give no
reason why it should be so; but must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
all into the Love of God in Christ,
that passes our knowledg; <hi>Behold what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of love is this,</hi> 1 John 3. 1. That we
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:98282:188"/>
should not only be called, but really be the
Children of God: We must observe what
inward evidence and demonstration the
Spirit gives of our particular Adoption by
name, that is properly the work of the
Spirit in witnessing to us, the Spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
in particular the promises of Life and
Pardon; they are generally propounded
by Ministers, but there comes a word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind;
from the Spirit, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 21. privily
assuring a man of his Adoption. You may
know 'tis not a delusion of your own
Spirit, nor of Satan. Not of your own
Spirit, because this testimony to the truth
of our interest in Christ, is usually given
in when we have no sensible apprehension
or feeling of the Love of God to us, as <hi>Mat.</hi>
27. 46. The Spirit comes in to comfort us
when we are most cast down, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
in our own spirits, and so not in
a condition to speak comfort to our selves.
Not from Satan, who at such a season seeks
to drive you to utter despair, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
strengthens our Faith at such a time,
sets it against all discouragement; 'tis not
said, he that feels, but <hi>He that believes
has everlasting life,</hi> John 3. 36. And there
is a feeling that belongs to Faith, that none
but the Spirit of God can give us the sense
of; hence it is that the Saints know more
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:98282:188"/>
certainly that they are the children of God,
than the men of the World do, that they
are the Children of those whom they call
their Fathers in the Flesh.</p>
               <p>The witness of the Spirit is a secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Love of God, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
affection to us; a still voice from
Heaven that God is thy God, which the
heart rests in, and is fully satisfied; 'tis
more than if an Angel should come from
Heaven and tell thee, Thou art greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 23. The earnest of the
Spirit in our hearts is more than all this,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. We may without this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spirit, know that there is
such a thing as Adoption spoken of in
Scripture; but that we in particular are
Adopted, none can assure us of this but
the Spirit by a particular application of this
Grace to our selves: The Spirit of God in
us, speaks particularly to us, to our case,
to our state, to our Souls. I hope he is so
speaking to you now, so speaking in you
at this time, shewing you what interest
you have in Christ, and what follows upon
it, reasoning you into a belief of the thing
in reference to your selves. When the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
comes in as a witness, 'twill be believed
the Spirit comes on purpose to answer all
our doubts and objections, to make the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:98282:189"/>
matter plain and evident to us; else the
Spirit could not be so effectual a Comforter,
if he did not bring convincing light along
with him into our dark Souls: You may
put by all that we can say to you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unsatisfied, after all the arguments
that Ministers may use to convince you of
your Adoption; you may hang down your
heads every one of you, and say, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this, I fear I am not a Child of
God: But when the Spirit himself comes
into that Soul, there is no resisting the
wisdom of the Holy Ghost; Ministers
have not wisdom enough to quiet a troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Conscience. We may set outward
light before a dark Soul, and yet that Soul
be as dark as ever for want of inward light;
we may speak the truth as it is in Jesus,
but we cannot give you a discerning of that
truth; we may hold the object before you,
but cannot give you eyes to see it; but the
Spirit does both, gives us a capacity to
learn and take in what he teaches us. I
grant an enlightned mind may reason it self
into some present sense of his Adoption,
but seeing so many things contrary to the
Divine Nature in himself, he doubts again,
and questions his Adoption, and will be
ever and anon at a loss, wavering in this
matter, 'till the testimony of the Spirit
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:98282:189"/>
confirm him, which is distinct from all his
own spiritual reasonings, from all the right
inferences that his Faith draws from the
word: I mean, the testimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath a greater cogency and force with
him, than all the apprehensions of his
Faith can have; though Faith and the
Spirit both go upon the same grounds, and
quote the same Scriptures, yet the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Spirit is stronger, than the bare
apprehensions of our Faith, and makes
deeper impression upon the mind of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
than their Faith can; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
are more easily retained and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
than all the just consequences of
our Faith; we have not always that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of mind, cannot so soon recollect
our selves, as to be always under the light
of that demonstration, that Faith well stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
and acted, can, and does sometimes
make of our Adoption, and then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
comes in, and helps us under our present
Temptations, gives such an unquestionable
Testimony of the truth of that which we
were in some suspence about, that we can
doubt no more, but are setled and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our belief of it; so that when the
Soul is clouded, when Faith is not so ready
and prompt as formerly to make clear aud
evident proof of our Adoption, cannot set
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:98282:190"/>
before us so plainly the reasons and grounds
of it; the Spirit's Testimony puts the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
out of doubt, and makes us not only to
know, but to feel that we are the true Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God; by that Childlike disposition
towards God and our Heavenly Father,
which we find in our selves.</p>
               <p>If you observe how the Children of God
come out of their doubts about their Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you'll find it to be this way; the same
Scriptures and spiritual reasons, that Faith
alone cannot set home at one time, do sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
enter and prevail at another
time; we see that in them now that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
us, which we could not see before;
and this is from the testimony of the Spirit,
witnessing with our Spirit; our Spirit was
alone before, labouring to perswade and
convince, but could not; then in comes the
Spirit, and gives such a corroborating Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
with our Spirit; that in the mouth
of these two Witnesses the truth is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and cleared up to our full satisfaction:
Worldly men boast of their being the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, tho they do the works of the
Devil; this is from their own Spirit, not
from God's.</p>
               <p>As we are to attend to the witness of the
Spirit, so we should</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:98282:190"/>
2. Apply our selves often to God as our
Father; say, <hi>Our father, which art in heaven;</hi>
from the instinct of the Divine Nature in
us, we cannot be beaten out of it, but
that God is our Father; <hi>Doubtless thou
art our father, tho Abraham be ignorant of us,</hi>
Isa. 63. 16. We don't doubt of that, we
will lie at thy feet, and commit our selves
to thy care, not questioning thy love to us.
<hi>A woman may forget her sucking child, and not
have compassion on the son of her womb, yet
thou wilt not forget us,</hi> Isa. 49. 15, 16.
Therefore cry <hi>Abba,</hi> Father; he is not the
God of the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
also; the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> may in their
several Languages, cry Father with as much
confidence, as the <hi>Jews</hi> cryed <hi>Abba;</hi> if you,
from your hearts own God as your Father,
he will answer to that name, and call you
his Children, make the Tryal when you
will in uprightness of heart, you will find
his Fatherly Bowels will earn towards you;
he has stiled himself your Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and your naming that word in Faith,
will have a secret influence upon your Souls,
and let in a sense of his Fatherly love to
you, and make you pray like his Children;
the more you do express a willingness to
have God for your Father, counting your
selves happy in that relation, the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:98282:191"/>
is God to own you for his Children;
here is a poor Soul, says God, who counts
himself utterly undone, if I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Father to him; he has cast himself
down at my Feet, I cannot contain my self
any longer, from owning him as my dear
Child; I must tell him so, Son, Daughter,
be of good cheer, I am thy Father, and
will be a Father to thee for ever; all that I
have is thine. This is the highest degree
of comfort we are capable of in this World,
to live under a clear manifestation of the
love of God to us in Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> I can sometimes call God Father,
and do think my self to be his Child; yet
I am afraid he won't own me, because I
have been a rebellious Child; I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
greatly against him, and am afraid to
come into his presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> So it was with the Prodigal, <hi>Luk.</hi>
15. 21. But his Father, instead of taking
notice of his former Miscarriages, sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to give him all the demonstrations of his
love immaginable, in the highest expressions
of his kindness to him, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, 24. And so
does God carry it towards a returning Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:98282:191"/>
But if after all, doubts still remain, you
are still under a secret Trepidation in your
own mind, that you shall not be accepted
of the Father, that he will not own you for
his Child. Then,</p>
               <p>3. Consider your alliance to Christ; apply
to him as your elder Brother; <hi>A brother is
born for the day of adversity,</hi> Prov. 17. 17.
Never was there such a Brother as Christ,
he is not ashamed to call us Brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi>
2. 11. Tho he be so infinitely above us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the only Natural Son of God, his first-born
yet Believers, by the Grace of Adoption,
are called his first-born too, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23.
Being mystically joyned to Christ, the
natural Son of God; <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
was never so joyned in that near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to God; the priviledge of the first-born
under the Law belongs to Believers
now, who are therefore made Priests unto
God. The Foundation of our Adoption
lies in our Alliance to Christ our elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who is able to bring us into, and to
fix us in that relation to God. Because</p>
               <p>1. He hath a great interest with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as his well-beloved Son; you may
think your selves not beloved, but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think so of Christ, who is the express
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:98282:192"/>
Image of the Father; if Christ be so like the
Father, and the Saints so like Christ, then
stand before God in the Image of Christ,
and you will find every cast of God's Eye
upon his Son Christ, will reach your hearts;
Christ in you, draws the eye and the heart
of God towards you; for all the acts of
love and complacency that God puts forth
towards the Person of the Son, do extend
themselves to all the operations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Son in the hearts of Believers;
let me tell you, God cannot disown you,
but he must disown Christ, in whom you
are, and who is in you; let God look ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon Christ, or upon Believers, he
still sees them both together, one in another,
<hi>John</hi> 17. 21, 22, 23. Then keep close to
Christ, go to the Father in his name; to
his Father, and your Father; if not to your
Father, yet go as to his Father; when Faith
cannot act one way, yet it may do the same
thing another way; when it cannot enter
in at one door, it may enter in at the other
door of the same House; what can't be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by one <hi>medium,</hi> may be proved by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the Devil can never so block up all
ways of access to God, but Faith will break
through somewhere; 'twill either find a
way, or make a way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:98282:192"/>
2. Because he is a merciful and faithful
High Priest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. Every way fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Office of a Mediator, touched
with the feeling of our Infirmities; in all
points tempted as we are, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>A
body hast thou prepared me,</hi> Heb. 10. 5. i. e.
Framed to such a temper, that Christ
through our nature, might best express
God's love to man; Christ acted over the
life of God in man's nature, therefore it
was necessary, that the humane Nature
of Christ should be adapted and suited to
the Divine Nature; which was done three
ways, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First,</p>
               <p>By the perfection of it, being free from
all contagion of sin, by a miraculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
the Holy Ghost over-shadowing
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and separating humane
Nature in the first conception of Christ,
from original sin that descends down upon
it, in all who come into the World by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Generation.</p>
               <p>Secondly,</p>
               <p>By the Hypostatical union of the humane
Nature to the Divine, in the second Person
of the Trinity, which eternally secures our
humane Nature in Christ, from all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:98282:193"/>
of the least defection, puts it quite
out of the power of the Devil any way to
corrupt or vitiate it, by all his subtil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
and temptations by which he
did vainly attempt such a thing; perfect
Nature in the first <hi>Adam</hi> (I don't say could
not, but) did not preserve it self. <hi>Adam</hi> did
not fall for want of light and knowledge;
no, he could never have fallen unless he
would; 'twas from the mutability of his
Will that he fell, but the humane Nature
of Christ, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> being under
the Government of a Divine immutable
Will, can never fall; hence it is, that our
standing in Christ, is secured to eternity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,</p>
               <p>By the pouring out of the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
measure upon him; that so strengthned
all his humane Faculties, that 'twas impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
the Devil should ever impose upon
him; such an overflowing fulness of the
Spirit, leaves no room for any carnal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
to be made upon him; his humane
Nature received such a Divine tincture
from the essence of the Godhead, so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
influencing his Manhood, that the
Devil found nothing in him to work upon;
he met with God in every thought, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
word, in every Action of Christ, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:98282:193"/>
motion and affection of his heart; and
finding one so much greater than himself,
continually aiding and strengthning the
Man Christ, he despairs of Victory, and
leaves him.</p>
               <p>The Devil was not mistaken in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Man Christ, which was really
humane; but he was mistaken in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ, which was solely Divine;
such a Person, in such a Nature, he never
thought to meet with; that which posed
the Devil, was the Person of Christ; he
might know him to be God, and yet apply
himself to him as Man, that he is sure he
was; he could not conceive how humane
Nature could subsist, but in a humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and as such a Person, he set upon him;
but found it hard to kick against the pricks;
such a mighty Man he never grapled with
before; he was so shamefully foyled in this
encounter, that he never durst look Christ
in the face afterwards; he came behind
him often like a Coward in disguise, and by
his wicked Instruments annoyed him all he
could, but durst not send him a second
Challenge, to fight it out with him once
more hand to hand; no, he had enough of
that already; now he foams and rages at a
distance, throws his fiery darts here and
there, strikes at the Image of Christ in the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:98282:194"/>
Saints, where ever he sees it, but dares not
come up to his Person face to face; the
great thing that the Devil dreads, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
coming of Christ; he knows that is
the time of his torment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore having such a high priest, who is
set on the right hand of the throne of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in the heavens,</hi> Heb. 8. 1. who is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to call us Brethren, let us not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to call God Father. Christ will bear
us out in it; the Children of God as such
are not known to the World, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 1.
Have hard usage from the World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 48.
9, 10. Yet God knows them, is kind to
them, and tender of them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 11.
<hi>Behold now we are the sons of God,</hi> 1 John
3. 2. Now under all our infirmities and
afflictions, God is with us in the fire, and
in the water; he has a great love to, and
very high esteem of all his Children;
<hi>since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast
been honourable, and I have loved thee,</hi> Isa.
43. 2, 3, 4. He will by no means take
away his loving kindness utterly from
them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89 32, 33. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 5. We
are apt to think otherwise. Isa. 49.
14. <hi>Zion said, the Lord hath forsaken me,
my Lord hath forgotten me.</hi> We shall
be apt to entertain hard thoughts of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:98282:194"/>
God upon all occasions, if we live not
under the daily sense of our Adoption;
in which we see the Fatherly love of
God flowing down so strongly towards
us, through Christ; that we cannot but
greatly rejoyce in it.</p>

            <head>THE
NECESSITY
OF
Preaching CHRIST.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>I COR. I. 23, 24.</bibl>
               <q>But we preach Christ crucified, &amp;c.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE design of the Apostle here,
is to vindicate the Doctrine of our
Salvation by Christ, from all those
Aspersions that were cast upon it both by
the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the Gospel then was
as much cry'd down by some, as it was
cry'd up by others. The Apostle tells you
who were for it, and who were against it;
he divides all men into two ranks, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Called, and Uncalled; the Converted,
and Unconverted; he tells you, that they
who were effectually Called and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:98282:196"/>
were for the Gospel, but the Uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and Unconverted, were against it; and
as it was then, so it is now. Hence note,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> That all unregenerate Persons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> will have a fling
at the Gospel; 'tis contrary to them, and
they are as contrary to it; they can't reach
the Mystery of it, and therefore do slight
and contemn it; but all who are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
called, and savingly enlightned, do
highly prize it; they see much of the
Power and Wisdom of God, in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
contrivance of Man's Salvation by
Christ; they desire to know nothing but
Christ, and him Crucified. Let us have a
care we do not darken the evidence of our
Conversion, by a Spirit of opposition to
the Gospel, in the main fundamental points
of it.</p>
            <p>I shall do little else in this Exercise, but
open the terms of the text, observing
some things by the way. <hi>But we preach
Christ crucified,</hi> &amp;c. He shews the matter
and manner of his Preaching in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
what he Preached, and how.</p>
            <p>1. The matter of his Preaching, or
what he Preached, <hi>viz.</hi> The Gospel, <hi>v.</hi> 17.
The Cross, <hi>v.</hi> 18. Or Christ Crucified,
<hi>v.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vnto the Jews a stumbling-block;</hi> they
were offended at Christ's low, mean, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
state in the flesh; they did not look for
any great matter from such a one; <hi>Can any
good thing come out of Nazareth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> When
the Apostles Preached the Mystery of Christ's
Incarnation, how he was Born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
what Miracles he did, how he was
Crucified, how he rose from the Dead, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
up to Heaven, and should come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to judg the World, the <hi>Jews</hi> were
offended, did not believe these things to be
true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 33. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 34. They saw
nothing but weakness in the Doctrine of the
Gospel, therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> require a Sign,
<hi>v.</hi> 32. Signs and Wonders were to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
the power of those who wrought
them. <hi>Moses</hi> confirmed his Doctrine by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Signs and Wonders; so must you, say
the <hi>Jews</hi> to Christ and his Apostles, if you
would have us to follow you. The <hi>Jews</hi> were
used to Signs and Wonders from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as appears in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
so they were instructed in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 10. and convinced of
the power of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 14. <hi>ad finem.</hi>
This made them so desirous of Signs under
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:98282:197"/>
the New Testament: Hence that Complaint,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 74. 9. We see not our Signs, we would
fain see Signs, as Mat. 12. 38. <hi>Master,
we would see a Sign from thee.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi>
16. 1. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>Zacharias</hi>
erred in this, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 18. The <hi>Jews</hi> are
sharply reproved by Christ for this, <hi>Mat.</hi>
16. 4. The Signs and Miracles by which
the Gospel was already confirmed, should
have satisfied them; the <hi>Jews</hi> did not require
a Sign, as <hi>Abraham, Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
did, for the strengthning of their Faith;
but out of Curiosity, and contempt of
Christ and the Gospel, resolving never to
be satisfied, they must have Sign after Sign,
they thought it absurd to trust in a Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ, to expect life from death; that
he who did not save himself, should be able
to save them: Unbelief, you see wants not
its seeming reasons to fortify it self against
the Gospel. Besides, they saw that such a
Profession of Faith in Christ, exposed them
to Sufferings, which made them the more
against it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And unto the Greeks foolishness.</hi> By <hi>Greeks</hi>
here we understand all <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
all their Wisdom and Learning
from the <hi>Greeks;</hi> or <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are
contradistinguished thus: One had the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:98282:197"/>
Written Law, the other had not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.
12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> would have the Mysteries of
the Gospel made out by Reason, else they
reject them as foolishness; they count that
foolishness, which transcends their Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
they thought the Gospel an idle
Fancy, a very simple absurd Doctrine;
they required Philosophical reasons, which
as men, they might comprehend; proving
Christ in a Logical way to be, what the
Scripture says he is. Moses <hi>magna dicit,
sed nihil probat,</hi> say <hi>Galen, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi>
They wanted Logical Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Scripture Mysteries, from the true
natural Causes of them, which cannot be;
for then they would not be Mysteries, if
Flesh and Blood could understand them,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 17.</p>
            <p>Thus you see both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> all
sorts of men unregenerate, have something
to say against the Gospel, they set themselves
studiously to object against it: All Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers

believing, that we answer to an effectual
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:98282:198"/>
Call, by which we are called to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Faith; and when we believe, we
obey God's Call, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5, 6. Such are
called according to his purpose, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.
You see the different opinion the Converted
and Unconverted have of Christ; highly
to prize Christ is a sign of true Conversion;
and to under-value him, to speak slightly
of him, or his Doctrine, is a sign of the
contrary; <hi>Paul</hi> here opposes the Judgment
of those who are Called, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or
<hi>Greeks,</hi> to the Judgment of the Uncalled
concerning Christ: Would you know what
Christ is, consult with Believers; they
know him; he is precious to them; never
regard what the blind World says of him,
but hear what the Saints say, what Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
say who know him best. I confess 'tis
a shame, and a reproach not to be excused,
that Christians do not magnifie Christ
more. I remember I have read of one,
who professed he knew not which was the
greater wonder, that Believers love Christ
no more, or that Unbelievers do hate him so
much; no doubt the former is far the greater
wonder, that they who know him so well,
should love him no better, than that they
who know him not at all, should hate him so
much; their blindness and ignorance runs
them into that gross mistake; but what can
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:98282:198"/>
cold lukewarm Believers plead, who have
so much light, and yet so little love!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Both Jews and Greeks,</hi> i. e. All sorts of
Believers, of what Countrey, Condition,
or outward state soever, they all agree in
this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ is the Power of
God, and the Wisdom of God; 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all Saints, and proper to them only
as Saints and Believers, to have a high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ the power of God.</hi> God shewed
his power in Creating the World by Christ
as God, <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. and by Redeeming it by
Christ as God-man.</p>
            <p>Christ in his Divine Nature is the God of
Power, a mighty one, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>A rock,

            <p>We are now shewing how Christ the

great things have been done.</p>

1. God by Christ satisfies his Justice,
and yet saves the Sinner, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles
Justice and Mercy together,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 85. 10, 11. They both act to the
height towards a Sinner: The Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of a Sinner is the greatest
instance of Justice and Mercy as
ever was; what is purchased, is also
freely given; he is our righteousness,
giving us right to eternal Life, as well
as our ransom, saving us from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

<hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18.</p>
            <p>5. Christ maintains a little Grace in his
Children, amidst many strong cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
and lusts; Grace is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
grain, and yet it lives and thrives,
'tis an abiding seed, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

In the next place, I shall speak of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and wisdom; not as they relate to the
Person of Christ, but to his Doctrine, or
to Christ Preached; we Preach Christ
Crucified: The Doctrine of Christ Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
is a powerful Doctrine, able to save those
who believe it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. This Doctrine is called the
<hi>Wisdom of God in a Mystery,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 7.
'tis the revelation of a Mystery, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25.
There are many Mysteries in this Doctrine,
<hi>The manifold wisdom of God,</hi> Ephes. 3. 10.
This way of saving sinners by Christ Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
is called <hi>The wisdom of God;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he doth thereby manifest his deep and
unsearchable wisdom; they who are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
enlightened, do count it so, they
desire to know nothing else, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2.
The Gospel contains the Glorious method
of a Sinner's Salvation by Christ, who is
therefore called the Wisdom of God, <hi>Prov.</hi>
8. 12. <hi>In whom are hid all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge,</hi> Col. 2. 3. The
Doctrine of the Gospel appears to be a
powerful Doctrine, because it is so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
a means for the Conversion of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who are so much against Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
certainly there is Wisdom and Power
in it, else it could never bring such a strange
thing as that to pass.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:98282:200"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The learned men of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> see
not any Wisdom in the Gospel; the <hi>Greeks</hi>
seek after Wisdom, but cannot find it
there, and therefore they count it foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
They seek after Wisdom; And why
not? Must we not speak reason in the
Pulpit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. We speak wisdom among them that
are perfect,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 6. <hi>i. e.</hi> That have
a true solid judgment of Spiritual things.
But if you mean by reason, that which falls
under our understanding, and is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
by us as men; I say, we speak
Mysteries above reason, which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
only to your Faith; the Doctrine
of the Gospel <hi>is worthy of all acceptation,</hi>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. Let not man oppose his wit
to the Wisdom of God. We speak Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but not the Wisdom of this world,
but the Wisdom of God, in a Mystery,
hidden Wisdom: When our frail reason
can do nothing in discerning this wisdom,
the Spirit comes and demonstrates the
Truth to us with power, by an invincible
internal perswasion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5. Men may
think by their Wit, Learning and prompt
Parts, to run down the Doctrine of the
Gospel: But let them remember, that
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:98282:200"/>
Christ is the Power and Wisdom of God.
They who do not rely only upon Christ
Crucisied for Justification unto life, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the Gospel, and count it foolishness;
they are ashamed of the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16.
<hi>Paul</hi> was not; let us follow his Example,
and labour to promote it, praying daily for
the propagation of the Doctrine of the
Gospel, That <hi>the way of God may be known
upon earth, and his saving health among all
nations,</hi> Psalm 67. 2. <hi>Because the foolishness
of God is wiser then men,</hi> &amp;c. V. 25. The
Power and Wisdom of God, by anironical
concession, are here called, weakness and
foolishness, <hi>i. e.</hi> admit this according to
the opinion of the unconverted <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles;</hi> Let them say what they will;
what they call foolishness is wiser then men,
<hi>i. e.</hi> then the wisdom of men; and what
they call weakness, is stronger than men,
<hi>i. e.</hi> then the strength of men. Any thing
that belongs to God, is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that which is but Humane; the least
things of God, do infinitely exceed the
greatest of mens: When we consider that
the Name of God is upon such a thing, it
should create a reverence in us towards it;
whatever is in God, is God. The way
that God has made choice of, and the
means he hath pitched upon, must needs
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:98282:201"/>
be the best; for all things are great or little,
weak or strong, as God makes them to be,
by putting more or less of his fulness into
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> They who count the Gospel foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
are the wise men of the world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sure they are in the right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Not many wife are called, and
when they are called, they see the folly of
their carnal wisdom, by which they judged
amiss of Christ before.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:98282:201"/>
               <head>The APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>LET us now consider seriously, how
we stand affected towards Christ and
the Gospel; whether we do receive the
truth in the love of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether we do
indeed believe in the Lord Jesus, and are
persuaded that nothing is required as a Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
procuring cause of our Justification
in the sight of God; but Christ and his
Righteousness received and applied by
Faith: And that all our Evangelical
righteousness, so much contended for, is
only to prove the truth and sincerity of our
Faith, from whence it springs; (though I
think there will not be any formal proving
of such matters then): Yet if this be all, I
would not contend about it, but leave
others to their own methods, schemes and
expressions, heartily wishing all may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them, as clearly and Orthodoxly
as they profess to understand themselves.
Though I must tell you, those words will
prove the most wholesome, and grow most
in use among serious Professors, which they
best understand, and which do most easily
and plainly convey the Spiritual sense of the
Gospel into their minds. If any should
say our own Evangelical Righteousness, hath
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:98282:202"/>
some causal influence into our Justification
(though I count it a very Unorthodox ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression)
yet I would in Charity think,
that the reason why they say so, is out of a
zeal to promote practical Holiness, by the
strongest motive imaginable: And if they
who say Holiness of life is only an effect of
Justification; making it as indispensably
necessary, in all who are justified, as the
former. Is not Holiness secured and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
this way, as well as the other way, and
without any suspicion of derogating from
Christ? Pray then, Why should we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
so much for the former way, laying
stumbling-blocks before others, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get over them, when all our ends are
better answered the other way? Let none
say we are <hi>Solifidians</hi> who hold this: We
know very well, that good works are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the New Covenant, as well as
Faith: but all that is required in the New
Covenant, is not required unto Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Besides, Justifying-Faith doth many
things by its influence, which must
not be put into the justifying act of Faith,
for then we shall confound Justification
and Sanctification, and make them as the
Papists do, all one.</p>
               <p>As the Apostle hath stated the point of
Justification, we are not only to consider
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:98282:202"/>
how we are justified in God's sight, but in
the first place to consider how God himself
is Just in his Justifying-act, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26.
If God be just in that act, and can Pardon
sin without any impeachment of his Justice,
then sure there is sufficient ground and
reason for it; God can do no unjust thing;
and if God in justifying Believers be just,
<hi>i. e.</hi> if there be merit enough in the Blood
of Christ to bear him out in this act, then
certainly we may safely rely upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Blood for our Justification: That
which Justifies God in his act of Justifying
a Believing sinner, must needs be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
cause of our Justification; else it could
not justifie God in his Justifying act, there
would be no equitable reason for it, besides,
to say that the Blood of Christ is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
procuring Meritorious cause of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<hi>i. e.</hi> of the acceptance of out
Persons and Performances: This is truth, but
not all the truth belonging to Justification.
For my next Query is, What is it that
gives us an interest in the Blood of Christ,
in the satisfaction he hath made for sin?
Here nothing must come in as instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
necessary to our receiving and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Faith only; Repentance
and new Obedience are the effects of the
Faith; either they are the effects of Faith,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:98282:203"/>
or of Unbelief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> None will say the latter,
then they must necessarily flow from the
real interest that Faith gives us in Christ;
if not, I don't see how we can attain to
them. At this rate, they must be done in our
own strength, not in Christ's, for being
conditions, as some say, of our interest in
Christ, they must be performed, before we
can have an interest in him.</p>
               <p>It is an excellent Note of <hi>Calvin,</hi> in his
Commentaries upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Whom
he did predestinate, them he called: and whom
he called, them he justified,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Scimus enim,
ubi de salute agitur, libenter homines à seipsis
incipere, fingeréque sibi praeparationes quibus
Dei gratiam antevertant,</hi> i. e. 'Tis natural
for men in the business of Salvation, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
at themselves, fancying some prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Works, by which they may prevent
the Grace of God, and do something for
themselves in their own strength, that may
fit and qualifie them for an interest in
Christ. In this rotten Principle, do many
begin their Religion, which corrupts their
minds ever after, from the simplicity that is
in Christ, and puts them upon seeking
Justification; <hi>Not by Faith, but as it were
by the works of the law,</hi> Rom. 9. 32. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
something in themselves to be the
first cause of their acceptance with God.
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:98282:203"/>
I wish all who call themselves <hi>Calvinists,</hi>
would read that place, and seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the sense of that Holy man in this
main point of our Religion. Some through
mistake, have counted <hi>Luther</hi> an <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
but none call <hi>Calvin</hi> so. 'Tis good to be
zealous in promoting practical Holiness
and Gospel-Obedience; but let us be sure
it be Gospel-Obedience, flowing from a
principle of Faith in Christ Jesus: For to
Preach up Holiness, from any other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
then that of Faith in our Lord Jesus
Christ, is not to Preach like Ministers of
the New Testament.</p>
               <p>Faith only is required <hi>in</hi> Justification,
rather than <hi>to</hi> it, I so phrase it, because
they are <hi>simultaneus;</hi> Repentance and
New Obedience do follow Faith; let them
be kept in their due place, and be allowed
no causal concurrence unto our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and we shall avoid all confusion; else
there will be a fundamental difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us; while some hold that Faith only
gives us an interest in Christ, others,
that Repentance and New Obedience do
equally with Faith, give us an interest in
Christ.</p>
               <p>Some carry it, as if the end of Christ's
coming into the world, was only to set
up a New Covenant of Works upon milder
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:98282:204"/>
and easier terms of sincere imperfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
which all men are to be exhorted
to, and urged to the performance of, upon
a supposed general sufficient Grace, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by Christ, enabling all men (who
do not wilfully refuse) to come up to the
terms of this New Covenant. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
hath many ill consequences in it, <hi>viz.</hi>
Of a General Redemption taking away
Original sin, restoring man to a freedom
of will in doing good; setting him upon
his own legs again to stand or fall, as he
comes up to, or falls short of the terms of
this New conditional Covenant: So that
all is resolved into mans own power and
will, all being now put into an equal capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Salvation by Christ; and having
said this, they have done with Christ,
have all in their own hands, may set up for
themselves, and love to be put upon duty
as persons sufficiently furnished for it
already: But notwithstanding this speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
new scheme of rational Divinity (as
some call it), I must in faithfulness to God,
to my own Conscience, and the Souls of
them that hear me, tell you plainly, That
they who trust in a general Redemption,
will fall short of their particular Salvation,
upon the Principles that those Universalists
go upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:98282:204"/>
We are all by nature dead in trespasses
and sins, reprobate to every good Word
and Work, and shall so remain, till we do
by a particular personal act of our own
Faith, come to Christ for life, that we may
be quickned by his Spirit, and made alive
unto Righteousness. We must have life
before we can live, or put forth any vital
operations; we must be first quickned by
Christ, the great quickning Spirit, before
we can live to God, or do any thing that is
Spiritually good. 'Tis Faith that unites
us to Christ, which is the gift of God to
some; for all men have not Faith; and till
this Faith comes by hearing the Gospel,
we are dead in sin. Christ came not only
as a Lawgiver, to prescribe rules of living
to dead sinners, but to create in us a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of life, to give us strength to perform
what he requires of us, as new Creatures
created in Christ Jesus unto good Works:
All our own endeavours after Holiness,
while we are out of Christ, will prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual;
we must be first engrafted into
the true Olive-Tree, deriving all our fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
from the root that bears us, else we
shall quickly wither away and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
No acceptable service ever was, or
can be done by man, till Faith brings us
to Christ, without whom we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:98282:205"/>
when Faith comes, life comes,
strength comes, a Spiritual ability to do
the will of God in some measure. And as
this Faith increases by the daily exercise of
it, so we increase in Spiritual strength, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
Holiness more and more in the
fear of God. Let no man think to be
made perfect in the flesh, Christ came not
to reform corrupt Nature, but to destroy
it, and utterly to extirpate it; the old man
will never learn to lead a new life; die he
must, and be Crucified; he must be put
off, that we may put on the New man,
which after God, is created in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and true Holiness, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. This is
the only way to true Holiness here, and to
Eternal Happiness hereafter: To as many
as the Lord our God shall effectually call to
this Faith, to them, and to them only,
doth the promise of Salvation by Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long;
'Tis the command of Christ, that
all should Believe on him; they that do,
and they only shall be saved by him,
with all manner of Salvation, not only
from Hell, but from the power of sin,
that they may live no longer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
<hi>Paul</hi> knew no other way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
according to his Gospel; they that
do, must invent another Gospel to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their New Divinity.</p>

I see no ground in Scripture for those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory
Works that some urge, as antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
necessary to our first Faith in Christ,
because Faith brings all along with it, <hi>viz.</hi>
Conviction of Sin, Humiliation, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Faith never comes to Christ,
but it shews us a reason why, and that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is drawn from our lost undone Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Nature, which true Faith is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some knowledge and sense of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sends us to Christ for help: By Nature,
all men are equally indisposed to Faith,
counting the Gospel, foolishness; when their
time of their Coversion comes, whether
prepared, or unprepared, whatever their
present practice or frame is, whether le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
Convinced, or Unconvinced, sitting
in gross darkness and unbelief; the Power
of God by the Preaching of the Gospel,
works a convincing, saving Faith in all
those, who are ordained unto life: God
calls one, and not another, of his meer good
Pleasure, being not moved thereunto, by
any thing in us, that may render one man
more capable of Conversion, than another;
sometimes they who (in an eye of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
seem furthest off from the Kingdom
of God, and are most unlikely to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;
them doth God call by his Grace,
even <hi>Publicans</hi> and Harlots. Before the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:98282:206"/>
stricter sort of formal Professors, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their Preparations, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
fitness for Conversion, are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
in their Natural State; when others
who sought not after God, are found of
him, and brought into a state of Grace;
God doth this, to shew that the Battel is
not to the strong, nor the Race to the
swift, <hi>not of him that runeth, but of God
that sheweth mercy to whom he will,</hi> Rom. 9.
15, 16. Many may outrun others in their
acquired Qualifications, <hi>and yet not so run, as
to obtain the prize,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 24. We are like
to make but a sorry Market of it, unless we
come without Money; many have been
too rich, too well qualified in their own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
for Christ; but none were ever too
poor and wretched for Christ, whose hearts
were stirred up by the Preaching of the
Word, to come unto him, and cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon him: There is nothing required
by way of Preparation, as antecedently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to our first Faith in Christ, but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word; let the Hearer be who he will,
never so unprepared, if he belong to God, the
Word will one time or other, make it's own
way to the heart of that man, and work
Faith in him; there is no resisting the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Holy-Ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:98282:206"/>
The Doctrine of Faith, and the Doctrine
of Good Works, are both very sound
Christian Doctrines; agreeing very well in
their proper place and order: As no man
can enter into a state of Grace by good
Works, so no man can conclude himself to be
in a state of Grace, without Good works;
'tis one thing to prove that I am already
in a state of Grace, another thing to shew
how a Sinner may now enter into a state of
Grace, and what is first to be done, in
order thereunto. 'Tis not said, he that
worketh, but he that believeth, shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and 'tis the work of God, that we
believe; and none but God can bring over the
heart of a Sinner to trust in Christ; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such a Faith, 'tis impossible not to lead
a holy life.</p>
               <p>We had need be clear and distinct in our
Conceptions of these things, since our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
depends upon our right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Point. I say, we had need consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what we mean, and how we express
our selves, lest instead of trusting in
Christ, we trust in our selves, and drop
the Gospel, whilst we seem to maintain it.</p>
               <p>If any scoff at this Doctrine, and count
it foolishness; I will only say, <hi>that the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness
of God is wiser than men; and the
weakness of God, is stronger than men.</hi>
