            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Reverend Sirs.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TWo Moneths have already paſt away, ſince with Aſtoniſhment I have beheld the moſt deplorable Condition of our Countrey; Into what a <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confuſion and Diſtraction have we run our ſelves? And in what a <hi>Labrinth</hi> of Miſeries and Perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ityes are we involved? 'Tis High Time now to make ſome ſerious Reflections on the ſtate of our Affairs.</p>
            <p>In the Firſt place therefore, 'Twill be Neceſſary to Examine our ſelves, and to Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> For what Reaſons, and to what End did we take up Arms?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Whether thoſe Reaſons be Subſtantial, and ſuch as carry with them Weight enough to juſtifie the Act; And whether the propoſed End can be obtained by ſuch Methods?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> If <hi>not,</hi> What will be the Event, and whether any way be left open to us for a peaceable and friendly Settlement?</p>
            <p>Although there be ſome (not of the meaneſt Capacities) among us, who are of Opinion, that a few perſons to gratiſie their Malice, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Revenge have been the <hi>plotters &amp; contrivers</hi> of our unhappy Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the better to carry it on have made uſe of the deluded Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men, as the <hi>Monkey did the Cat's foot to pluck the Cheſnut out of the fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Yet I ſhall not lightly be over credulous in that matter, nor give Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to ſuch Suggeſtions; I ſhall onely therefore inſtance ſuch things as Converſation &amp; Report have brought to my Knowledge, or as I ſhall find obvious in the <hi>Declaration;</hi> the ſumme of which is,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That above ten years ſince, there was an horrid Popiſh Plot in the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> in which the Extirpation of the Proteſtant Religion was deſigned.</q>

               <q>That there was great Reaſon to Apprehend the Reformed Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> were to be overwhelmed in the ſame pit of Ruine and Deſtruction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That the better to effect it, our Charter (the onely hedge which kept us from the Wild Beaſts of the field) was both injuriouſly and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legally Condemned, before it was poſſible for us to appear at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in the legall Defence of it, and without a faire Leave to Anſwer for our ſelves</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That by an illegall Commiſſion we were put under a Preſident and Councill, which was ſoon ſuperſeded by another more Arbitrary and Abſolute to Sr. <hi>Edmond Andros,</hi> giving him Power, by the Advice of his Councill, to make Lawes and levy Taxes as he pleaſed, to muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and imploy all perſons reſident in the Territory, as Occaſion ſhould require, and them to transfer to any Engliſh plantation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That ſeverall Red-Coats were brought over, to ſupport what ſhould be impoſed upon us, and more threatned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That Preferments were principally loaden on Strangers and Haters of the people.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That we were Squeez'd and Oppreſs'd by a Crew of abject perſons from <hi>New-York,</hi> who took and extorted extraordinary and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fees.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That it was impoſſible to know the Lawes that were made, and yet dangerous to break them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That by ſome in open Councill, and by the ſame in private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, it was affirmed, that the People in <hi>New-England</hi> were all Slaves, and the onely Difference between them and Slaves, was their not being bought and ſould; and that it was a Maxim delivered in Open Court, by one of the Councill, That we muſt not think the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Engliſh men would follow us to the End of the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That we were denied the priviledge of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and that Perſons who did but peaceably object againſt raiſing Taxes without an Aſſembly, were for it ſeverely fined.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That Juries have been picked and pack'd, and that ſome people have been fined without a Verdict, yea without a Jury.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That ſome People have been kept long in Priſon, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation againſt them, or being Charged with any Miſdemeanour, or <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> allowed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That Jury-men were fined and impriſoned, for Refuſing to lay their hand on the Booke, as they came to be Sworn, contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

            <p>
               <q>That there was a Diſcovery made of Flaws in the Titles of our Lands: and that the Governour denied that there was any ſuch thing as a <hi>Towne</hi> among us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That <hi>Writts of Intruſion</hi> were iſſued out.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That the Governour cauſed our Lands to be meaſur'd out for his Creatures, and that the Right Owners for Pulling up the ſtakes have been grievouſly moleſted.</q>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That the Forceing of the people at the Eaſt-ward thereto, gave a Riſe to the late unhappy Invaſion by the Indians.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That Blanke Patents were got ready, to be ſold at great prices, and ſeverall perſons had their Commons begg'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That the Governour and five or ſix of the Councill, did what they would, and that all ſuch who were Lovers of their Countrey were ſeldome admitted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That all manner of Craft and Rage was uſed to hinder Mr. <hi>Mather</hi>'s Voyage to <hi>England,</hi> and to ruine his perſon.</q>

               <q>That allthough the King promiſed Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> a <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for Redreſſe of Grievances, and that the Governour ſhould be writ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to forbeare thoſe Meaſures that he was upon; yet we were ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured in thoſe very things which were Complained of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That our Miniſters and Churches have been diſcountenanced.</q>

            <p>
               <q>That we were imbriared in an Indian-Warre, and that the Officers and Souldiers in the Army were under popiſh Commanders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That the reſt of the Engliſh plantations, being alarm'd with juſt Fears of the <hi>French,</hi> who have treated the Engliſh with more than <hi>Turkish</hi> Cruelty, could not but ſtirr us up to take care for our owne Preſervation, leſt we ſhould be delivered to the <hi>French,</hi> before Orders could come from His Higneſs the Prince of Orange, and the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
               </q>

            <p>
               <q>That we have for our Example the Nobility, Gentry and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and above all we eſteeme it our Duty to God ſo to have done.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far have I traced the <hi>Declaration,</hi> and do not know that any one thing materiall is omitted, I ſhall now mention ſome other things which have occurr'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33572:4"/>
'Twas credibly reported,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That <hi>Boſton</hi> and all the Inhabitants were to be deſtroyed, and to that end the <hi>Mahawks</hi> were to be brought down.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That there were ſeverall Fire-workes prepared in the Fort, and Vaults dugg under ground to blow up the Towne.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That the Souldiers at the Eaſt-ward were all poiſoned with Rumm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That there were Thirty ſail of <hi>French</hi> Frigots upon the Coaſt. With ſeverall other things which I cannot recollect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the principall Reaſons alledged for our takeing up Arms: now the End can be no other than the Redreſſe of thoſe evills complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next thing then to be conſidered of is,</hi> Whether all or any of the Reaſons aforeſaid, are ſufficient to juſtifie our Proceedings, and Whether the propoſed End can be attained by ſuch Meaſures.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, That there was an horrid popiſh Plott, is without doubt, and if <hi>England</hi> at that time had fallen under the Yoak of <hi>Roman</hi> Tyranny and Thraldome, tis as certainly true <hi>New-England</hi> muſt have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the ſame Fate: but that this ſhould be uſed or introduced as a Reaſon or Argument for Vacating our <hi>Charter</hi> is beyond my conception; for Fire and Sword were the deſigned inſtruments and miniſters of their barbarous and helliſh Contrivance: and if they had once prevailed, how weak a Rampart would our <hi>Charter</hi> have been againſt ſo cruell and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull an Enemy? Would a blood thirſty and conquering <hi>Papiſt</hi> have made <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> the Arbiter?

               <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second,</hi> by His Letters ſignified to us the many Complaints that were made to him of our Encroachments, and ill-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Government, and commanded that we ſhould ſend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Agents ſufficiently Authorized, to Anſwer the ſame, which we at length ſo far complyed with, as to ſend Agents, who when they were called to hear and Anſwer the ſaid Complaints, alwaies excuſed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the principall parts thereof pretending they were not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impowered for that purpoſe; and after, other Agents fully impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to Anſwer, but not to ſubmit or Conclude any thing: And when His Majeſty was pleaſed to cauſe a Writt of <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> to be ſued forth, againſt our <hi>Charter,</hi> and ſent over with his Gracious Declaration, and Propoſals of ſuch Regulations to be made therein, as might be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with His Majeſties Service &amp; the good &amp; well-fare of his <hi>ſubjects</hi> here, and required an entire Submiſſion from us therein; our <hi>Generall Court</hi> would not ſubmit to, or comply therewith; onely a Letter was ſent to the <hi>Right Honourable</hi> Sr. <hi>Lionell Jenkins,</hi> then Secretary of State, dated the 10. of <hi>December</hi> 1683, Subſcribed by the Governour &amp; Eight of the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants onely; wherein after the acknowledgement of their haveing had a Copy of the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> and His Majeſties Declaration, they ſay that the major part of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> have for ſeverall Weeks declared their Opinion, and voted to lay themſelves at His Majeſties feet, by an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Submiſſion and Reſignation of themſelves to His Majeſties pleaſure; not being willing to Contend with His Majeſtie in a Courſe of Law, but by the next Opportunity to diſpatch their Agents fully impowered to make their ſubmiſſion according to His Majeſties ſaid Declaration, but by no means can at preſent obtain the Conſent of the <hi>Deputyes</hi> whereby to make it an Act of the <hi>Corporation,</hi> and therefore have agreed with them to a power of Attourney-ſhip, to ſave a Default, in hopes that further time will prevail to diſpatch their Agents accordingly, and ſhall earneſtly endeavour to give the people a better Underſtanding before the next Ships ſaile from hence:</p>

faithfull and beloved <hi>Richard de Burg</hi> Juſtice of <hi>Ireland</hi> Greeting; We have Commanded you, firmly injoining you, that on a certain day and place, you make to come before you, the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, Priors, Earles, Barons, Knights, &amp; Free-Holders, and the Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifs of every County, and before them you cauſe to be publickly read, the Charter of the Lord King <hi>John</hi> our Father to which His Seal is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, and which He cauſed to be made and ſworne to by the Nobility of <hi>Ireland,</hi> concerning the Lawes and Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And command them on Our behalfe, that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they firmly keep and obſerve thoſe Laws and Cuſtoms conteined in the Charter aforeſaid,</q>
            </p>
            <p>By all which it is evident that after the Conqueſt, and before the recited Charters, the Inhabitants there, altho' compoſed of <hi>many free-borne Engliſh Subjects who ſettled themſelves among them,</hi> were neither govern'd by theire owne Laws, nor the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> but according to the good pleaſure of the <hi>Conqueror:</hi> and if you will take the opinion of Sr. <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> in his Annotations on the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> he tells you plainly That <hi>at the makeing thereof it did not extend to</hi> Ireland, <hi>or any of the King's</hi> forreigne <hi>Dominions,</hi> but after the making of <hi>Poynings</hi> Law, which was in the 11<hi>th</hi> yeare of <hi>H.</hi> the 7<hi>th</hi> (long after the <hi>Great Charter)</hi> it did Extend to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have onely one Inſtance more, and that is</hi> the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage of forreigne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in theire Plantations and Settlements abroad.</p>
            <p>The Government of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces &amp; Denmarke</hi> are well knowne in <hi>Europe,</hi> and yet in all theire Plantations, their Governments are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoticall and abſolute; all the power is in the hands of a Governour &amp; Councill, and every thing is ordered and appointed by them; as is well knowne to thoſe that are acquainted with <hi>Batavia, Surinam, Curaſao, New-Yorke</hi> (when formerly in their hands) and the Iſland of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By which it is it evident that</hi> Thoſe Kingdoms and Principalities which are of the Dominion of the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> are ſubject to ſuch Laws, Ordinances, and Methods of Government, as that <hi>Crowne</hi> ſhall think ſit to eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next thing then to be proved is,</hi> That <hi>New-England,</hi> and all the Engliſh Colonies are ſubject to the Dominion of the <hi>Crowne</hi> of England, <hi>as</hi> Wales <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>are, and not to the</hi> Empire of the King of England, <hi>as</hi> Scotland <hi>is,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a Fundamentall Point conſented unto by all Chriſtian Nations, that the Firſt Diſcovery of a Countrey inhabited by Inſidells, gives a Right and Dominion of that Countrey to the Prince in whoſe Service and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment

the Diſcoverers were ſent.

Rep. Craw</hi> verſus <hi>Ramſey.]</hi> which being granted, the Concluſion muſt neceſſarily be good, and it will follow, That <hi>Engliſhmen permitted to be tranſported into the Plantations,</hi> (for thither without the <hi>Kings Licence</hi> we cannot come) <hi>can pretend to no other Liberties, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledes</hi> or <hi>Immunities</hi> there, <hi>than anciently the ſubejcts of</hi> England <hi>who removed themſelves into</hi> Ireland <hi>could have done:</hi> For 'tis from the Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Crowne alone that all theſe flow and are diſpenſed at the pleaſure of him that ſits on the Throne: which is plaine in the <hi>Great Charter</hi> it-ſelfe; where after the Liberties therein granted by the King it concludes thus,—<hi>tenendas &amp; habendas de Nobis &amp; Haeredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Noſtris in perpetuum,</hi> 
               <q>To <hi>HAVE</hi> and to <hi>HOLD</hi> of Us and Our Heires for ever,</q> which by the learned Sr. <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained: <hi>Theſe Words</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are not inſerted to make a legall Tenure of the</hi> King, <hi>but to intimate that all Liberties at firſt were derived from the</hi> Crowne. <hi>[Inſtit. Pag.</hi> 2. <hi>Fol.</hi> 4.] <hi>Barbadoes, Jamaica,</hi> the <hi>Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward-Iſlands &amp; Virginia</hi> have their Aſſemblies, but, it is not <hi>ſui Juris,</hi> 'tis from the Grace &amp; Favour of the <hi>Crowne</hi> ſignified by <hi>Letters Patents</hi> under the broad Seale. But theſe Aſſemblies have not power to enforce any Act by them made above one year; the King haveing in all the Conſeſſions granted them, reſerved unto Himſelfe, the Annulling or Continuance of what Laws they make, according to His pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New-England</hi> had a <hi>Charter,</hi> but no one will be ſo ſtupid to imagine that the King was <hi>bound</hi> to grant it us: Neither can we without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching the prudent Conduct and diſcretion of our Fore-Fathers, ſo much as think, they would put themſelves to ſo vaſt an expence, and unneceſſary Trouble to Obtain that which as Engliſhmen, they thought themſelves to have a ſufficient right to before: We owe it onely to the Grace and Favour of our Soveraigne, and if we had made beter uſe of it to promote the Ends for which it was granted, the weight of thoſe Afflictions under which we now groan would not have laine ſo heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, at leaſt we ſhould have leſs deſerved them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, The <hi>Parliament of England</hi> have never by any Act of theirs
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33572:7"/>
favoured the Plantations, or declared or enlarged their Priviledges; but have all along plainly demonſtrated that they were much differenced from <hi>England,</hi> and not to have thoſe Priviledges and Liberties which <hi>England</hi> enjoyed; being in all Acts relateing to the Plantations, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and burthened beyond any in <hi>England,</hi> as appears by the ſeveral Acts made for the Encreaſing of Navigation and for Regulating and ſecuring the Plantation Trade.</p>
            <p>I think I have both by good Authority, Practice &amp; Precedent, made it plaine, that the Plantations are of the Dominion of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and without any Regard to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> may be Ruled and Governed, by ſuch wayes and methods, as the Perſon who wears that Crowne, for the good and advancement of thoſe Settlements, ſhall think moſt proper and convenient.

'Twill be but time loſt to ſay any thing of the Red-Coats, for no man can be ſo void of Sence and Reaſon to think that ſo many Thouſand men, which at this day inhabit this Colony, could be impoſed upon by one hundred Red-Goats, and if any body hath been ſo vain as to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us with more, I look upon it an effect of Paſſion or Folly; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which certainly is the moſt convinceing Argument in the world, tells us there is no ſuch thing.</p>

and Haters of the People, I muſt confeſſe, I cannot eaſily comprehend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs to inhabit fourteen or fifteen years within the Territory will make a man ſuch. Is their any one Gentleman of the Councill, that hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been diſplaced or put into that ſtation by the Authority here? Which of our Judges are ſtrangers? Were not Three of them brought up amongſt us and of our owne Communion? and was not the other in the ſame Imployment in ſome part of this Territority at the time of the Annexation? From whome had the Secretary and Collector his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion? certainly from no body here. Did the Alteration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment change our Treaſurer? Is it not the ſame Sr. <hi>Edmond</hi> found here? Is he not a man of eſtate, good Credit and Reputation, and one of our owne Countrey men? Were not all Officers in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well Magiſteriall as Miniſteriall, naturall borne Engliſh-men, &amp; Subjects to the Crowne of <hi>England?</hi> How then are Strangers &amp; Haters of the people preferr'd, when there is not one that can reaſonably and juſtly be ſo term'd in any place of Truſt or Office throughout the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Who are mean't by abject perſons from <hi>New-Yorke,</hi> wants an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation: for none of the Gentlemen that came from thence now in any Authority, but are well knowne to have liv'd there for a long time in eſteem and Reputation enough to merit a better Epethite of all good and honeſt men; and I believe it will one day appear, that their faithfull Diſcharge of their Dutyes, their Conſtancy and Steadineſs to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and unſhaken Loyalty &amp; Fidelity to the Crowne was their greateſt Crime.</p>
            <p>I am not well acquainted what Fees were taken, but this I knowe, that a Committee of the Councill were appointed to make a Settlement of Fees, for all Officers throughout the Government, which was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, approved of, and ſent to <hi>England,</hi> and if any one have exceeded thoſe Limits they deſerve to be called to Account: but it ought to be in a due Courſe of Law. For the perſonal Miſcarriages of a miniſteriall Officer, are no ſufficient Warrant for an Inſurrection; neither ought the Whole Government to be ſubverted becauſe <hi>Tom,</hi> or <hi>Harry</hi> are ill men. The Authority can but provide good and wholſome Lawes, for the Puniſhment of evill Doers, and cauſe thoſe Lawes to be put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution againſt Offenders; but if any one doth me a perſonall Wrong, for which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have a Remedy by Law, and I will not take it, I ought not to quarrell with the Government, for tis my own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fault, and I might have Redreſſe if I would. Perſonall Orimes muſt be cenſured perſonally:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33572:8"/>
and a Government ought no more to be ſcandalized and aſperſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an Extortioner is in it, than becauſe there is a Felon or a Traitor.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I need not tell you that the Statute Lawes of <hi>England</hi> are printed at large, and that many Abridgements of them are ſo Likewiſe, and eaſie enough to be procured, neither can it be but very well knowne that all the Acts of the Governour and Councill were ſolemnly publiſh'd with Sound of Trumpet as ſoon as made, and authentic Copies afterwards tranſmitted to the Clerks of each reſpective county throughout the Territory: why then it ſhould be ſaid, that <hi>It was impoſſible to know the Laws,</hi> I ſee no reaſon, unleſs by it is meant the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and if ſo, we may as well quarrell becauſe we do not underſtand <hi>Euclide,</hi> or <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;</hi> For the Knowledge of the Law cannot be attained without great Induſtry Study and Experience, and every capacity is not fitted for ſuch an Undertaking. <hi>Ex quovis Ligno non fit Mercurius.</hi> If this was a Grievance, what a miſerable Condition are we in <hi>now,</hi> that inſtead of not knowing the Law, there is no Law for us to know.</p>
            <p n="8">8. What raſh or indiſcreet Expreſſions may fall from any ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Councill, either in his private or politick Capacity, I will not undertake to juſtifie; all men are not endued with Qualifications a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, every one in that ſtation ought to give his Opinion, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe underſtands the matter; and if any one have unadviſedly uttered words ſo diſagreeable, I know no body injured by it, neither can the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be juſtly cenſured for it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That the Priviledges of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> &amp; other <hi>liberties of Engliſh men</hi> were denied us, is a thing which can never be made appear, however admitting it, I have ſufficiently diſcuſſed that point in the third Article.</p>
            <p n="10">10. By the perſons ſaid to be ſeverely ſined, for peaceble objecting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt raiſing of Taxes, without an Aſſembly, I conjecture are meant the <hi>Ipſwich</hi> men, who were ſo far from a peaceable objecting, that they aſſembled themſelves in a <hi>riotous manner,</hi> and by an Inſtrument conceived in Writing, did aſſociate and oblige themſelves to ſtand by each other in oppoſition to the Laws of the Government, and by their Example in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced their Neighbours to do the like. And this by the Law is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd an offence of that Nature, That it is next door to <hi>Rebellion,</hi> for which they were Indicted, Tryed, and Convicted, either by Verdict or their owne Confeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. I cannot juſtifie that Sheriffe who doth either pick or pack a Jury, tis both repugnant to the Law and his Oath, and he deſerves no Favour that can be guilty of ſuch a Crime, but let him firſt be known, &amp;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33572:9"/>
the thing proved, for I do not Remember any one that hath been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, nor ſo much as accuſed for ſuch an Offence.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Judgement upon <hi>Deumrrers</hi> and <hi>Defaults</hi> are ſo practicable and warrantable by the Law, that nothing can excuſe the Enumerating them amongſt the Grieviances in the Declaration but the Penman's want of Knowledge in that Profeſſion. Tis a Maxim, <hi>Volenti non fit Injuria,</hi> and when both Plaintiffe and Defendant do by a joint Conſent ſubmit to the Determination of the Court, or by their owne Negligence make Default; who hath the Wrong? Where is the injury? This hath been a Practice ſo frequently uſed in our <hi>former Government,</hi> that no body can be ignorant of it.</p>
            <p n="13">13 That any one hath been long impriſoned, without being charged with Crime or Miſdemeanour, is an Allegation which I dare be bold to ſay can never be proved. I have heard an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> was in one particular caſe denied, I will not enquire into the reaſons of it, nor pretend to juſtifie it, although much may be ſaid in that matter; Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Fact, 'twas but a perſonall injury, for which the Law gave an effectuall Remedy, and if the party grieved would not make uſe of ſuch, muſt the Government be in fault? If we do but conſider well <hi>how many perſons are now under farr worſe Circumſtances,</hi> I am ſure we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but <hi>bluſh</hi> when we read that part of the Declaration.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That Jury men were fined and impriſoned for Refuſeing to lay their hands on the Book, I preſume is a miſtake, probably they may have been fined for their Contempt, and ſent to Priſon for not paying that fine, which by the Law may be juſtified; for every Court may fine any man for a Contempt in open Court, and they themſelves are Judges of the Contempt.</p>
            <p>Whether it be a forceing of Conſcience or not, I ſhall leave to the Caſuiſts, but I am very well-ſatisfied <hi>it is not comprehended within the late Indulgence,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet admit it were, the Judges are ſworn to do their duties in their office according to the Lawes of the Land, <hi>Preſcription is a good &amp; ſufficient Law,</hi> the form of Laying the hand on the Booke hath been the onely <hi>modus</hi> of Swearing, Time out of mind; Therefore the Laying the hand on the Booke in Swearing is a good Law, and the Judges cannot diſpenſe with it <hi>ſalvo Sacramento,</hi> if they did, a Judgement in ſuch a Caſe would be erroneous &amp; reverſable: and <hi>'Tis dangerous to admit of Innovations,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Common Law of <hi>New-England</hi> is brought in to warrant the <hi>Lifting up</hi> the hand; but I take that to be the <hi>Rara avis in terris,</hi> for I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33572:9"/>
challenge the whole Territory to produce one Precedent of ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Caſe: but perhaps by it <hi>Preſcription</hi> is intended, if it be, that will as illy ſerve the turn as the other; for the Colony hath not been long enough ſettled to claim any Advantage by that Right, or if it had, could it be admitted without apparent Violation of our <hi>Charter,</hi> being abſolutely repugnant to the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. Fully to diſcuſs the queſtion concerning the Titles of our Lands, would be a Subject to copious for this preſent deſigne, Therefore I ſhall onely glance at it as I paſs by, being Reſolved, when time ſhall ſerve to declare my opinion more amply on that Subject; in the mean time let every conſidering man examine well our <hi>Charter,</hi> which is the very <hi>Baſis</hi> of all our Rights, (unleſs we will ſet up a power above the Kings) and then let him tell me in whome the Fee Simple of that Tract of Land betwixt <hi>Charles River &amp; Mirrimack</hi> remaines: if in the <hi>Grantees</hi> or <hi>their Heires,</hi> how do we derive our Titles from them? If in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Company of the Maſſathuſets Bay,</hi> we muſt enquire whether purſuant to the Directions and powers to them granted, it is by good &amp; ſufficient Conveyances in the Law derived unto us, if we find it ſo, we muſt not be diſturbed with Fears and Jealouſies, for nothing can hurt us: if not, we are infinitely obliged to thoſe perſons who have made us ſenſible of our Weakeneſſes, in a time when by <hi>His Majeſties Letters Patents</hi> the <hi>Governour</hi> was impowered to ſupply all ſuch defects, and not upon Terms either exceſſive or unreaſonable, but upon ſuch as were both eaſie &amp; <hi>moderate,</hi> which will plainly appear to any man who will but give himſelf the trouble to peruſe the Table of Fees, ſettled and allowed by the Councill. Yet ſtill every man was at his own Liberty to take a <hi>Patent of Confirmation</hi> or to let it alone, which is Apparent enough by the many Petitions now lying in the Secretaries Office, which although his Excellency was alwayes ready (ſo far as in him lay) to Grant, yet the more neceſſitous Affairs of the Government, which both he and all about him ever preferr'd to theire private Advantage, took up ſo much of his time, that not above Twenty ever paſt the ſeale, and I am very well aſſured, that not one Example can be produced that the leaſt compulſion was ever uſed in this Caſe to any man living within this Dominion.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That <hi>Writts of Intruſion</hi> were iſſued out, is doubtleſſe true, and the Government would have juſtly merited a ſevere Cenſure, if all Waies ſhould have been free &amp; open for the Subject to attaine his Right, and none left for the <hi>King.</hi> We ſhould think our ſelves highly injured to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33572:10"/>
be refuſed a <hi>Capias</hi> or any other Common Writt, and I'm ſure the other is as peremptory a one in the Kings Caſe, and had the Pen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>man been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little acquainted with the <hi>Natura Brevium,</hi> or the <hi>Regiſter,</hi> he would have been aſhamed to have ſtuffed up the Declaration with ſuch matter which can be of no other ſervice, than to amuſe &amp; deceive igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have their been any Writts of this kind dureing Sr. <hi>Edmond</hi>

And the buſineſs of Deer-iſland was brought on for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Intent than that Right might be done to the King here, and that the party, if agrieved, might in a Regular way have brought it to the Councill board in <hi>England,</hi> for their determination: and I think if this matter were rightly underſtood, it would be of excellent Service to the Countrey, for ſuch a Judgement would ſufficiently inſtruct us what we have to truſt to;</p>
            <p n="17">17. If the Governour did ſay, there was no ſuch thing amongſt us as a Towne, what can be inferred from thence? Tis not to be preſumed but his diſcourſe tended onely to a Body Corporate and politick, for we generally call that a Towne in <hi>America,</hi> where a number of people have ſeated themſelves together: yet its very well known, tis ſo in <hi>name</hi> onely not in fact: I take that Body of People to be a <hi>Towne,</hi> properly ſo called, who by ſome Act of Law have been <hi>Incorporated,</hi> and in that ſence there is no ſuch thing as a Towne in the Maſſachuſetts, neither was there a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make ſuch before his Excellencies Arrivall. For <hi>One Corporation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make another.</hi> [the caſe of <hi>Suttons Hoſpital.</hi> Co Rep.]</p>
            <p n="18">18. I am totally ignorant what is meant by <hi>Blank Patents,</hi> for tis the firſt time I ever heard of ſuch a thing; neither indeed can ſuch a thing be. For he that takes a Patent for his Land, doth it in ſuch a Form as beſt pleaſeth himſelf, or as he ſhall be adviſed to by his Councill, and how any man living can ſo far know my mind, to prepare ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for me, I leave the world to judge.</p>
            <p>This Notion did ariſe from one Roll of Parchment onely, brought over by Capt. <hi>Tanner,</hi> and if we do but conſider, that all Law proceſs was then in Parchment, it would ſerve but a little while for that uſe; for it contains not above ſixty ſheets.</p>
            <p>I am likewiſe gropeing in the darke, to finde out how the Forceing of the people at the Eaſtward to take Patents (although I know of no ſuch thing done) gave a Riſe to the late unhappy Invaſion by the Indians,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33572:10"/>
unleſs by that meames, they were deprived of thoſe Quit-Rents and and Acknowledgements, which by a baſe &amp; diſhonourable Agreement the people of thoſe parts ſome time ſince ſubmitted to pay them, as their <hi>Lords and Maſters.</hi>

            <p n="19">19. That our Commons might be begg'd, is not very ſtrange, but that the Governour muſt be criminall becauſe ſuch a thing is asked of him, is the moſt wonderfull thing in the world.

            <p>If <hi>Clarks-Iſland,</hi> (granted to Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> of <hi>Plimouth)</hi> I muſt tell you 'tis not within the <hi>Plimouth Patent,</hi> and therefore grantable at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the King, which was the Opinion of the Councill in that Caſe, and neither of the before-mentioned Grants, nor indeed any other, did ever paſs without <hi>their Approbation and conſent;</hi> and this is all that I know of that can be objected.</p>
            <p n="20">20. What an Age do we live in now, and how wonderful a thing is it, that it ſhould be counted a Crime in a land <hi>ſo well govern'd as once</hi> New-England <hi>was</hi> after a legall Tryal &amp; Conviction, to puniſh &amp; fine men for a Riot and the Contempt of Authority, in the higheſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture imaginable?

they came. And as he hath never done, nor ordered the leaſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relateing to the Government, without their Advice and Conſent, ſo he never did it without a ſufficient Number to make a <hi>Quorum,</hi> which was <hi>Seven.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>There was a particular difference between Mr. <hi>Randoph</hi> &amp; him, and I never heard of any other courſe taken by Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> than the <hi>ordinary Writt</hi> in ſuch Caſes uſual, which was ſo far from Retarding his Voyage, that an <hi>Attourny's entring a common Appearance</hi> in that Caſe, would have been ſufficient to have diſcharged him if the Writt had been ſerved.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Suppoſe his Majeſtie promiſed Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> a <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> for redreſs of Grievances, and that his Excellency ſhould be wrote unto, to forbear the meaſures he was upon, yet no ſuch thing being done, he was Obliged to the Obſervance of his Majeſties Commands, before Signified to him in his Letters Patents, which was a ſufficient warrant to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he ſhould receive ſomething ſubſequent to contradict it.</p>
            <p n="24">24. That our Churches and and Miniſters have been diſcouraged, is ſo generall an head, and the reſt of the Declaration ſo particular, that it gives me cauſe to ſuſpect the Truth of it, and I ſhall hardly alter my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, until any one of you be inſtanced who kept himſelf within his Province, and onely meddled with that which belonged to him.</p>
            <p>Tis the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that have moſt reaſon to Complain, onley we <hi>cry whore firſt.</hi> Has not their Miniſter been publiquely Affronted, &amp; hindred from doing his Duty?

            <p n="25">25. Should I undertake to recount all the particulars of the late <hi>Indian Rebellion,</hi> this would ſwell to a bulk bigger than ever I deſigned it, I ſhall onely tell you, we muſt look at home for the Reaſons of thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33572:11"/>
which is well knowne began when his Excellency was at <hi>New-York<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and that the Folly and Raſhneſs of the people, drew it on their owne heads. The Governours Conduct in that affair has been ſo prudent and diſcreet, that I have no Reaſon to doubt but the Councill, into whoſe hands all the Papers relating to that buſineſs did fall, are very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed with it. Things were brought to that paſs, that if our unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py domeſtic Troubles had not intervened, the War before this time would have been advantageouſly finiſhed, without any Rates or Taxes on the Countrey, for by His Excellencies good husbandry, the ſtanding Revenue would have deſrayed the Charge. Tis true, We have loſt ſome of our friends and Relations, in that Expedition, but could the <hi>Governour</hi> keep them alive? Are not Diſeaſes in Armies, as fatall to men as the Sword? When Death comes, tis not to be avoided; and we ſee that all our art &amp; care hath not been ſufficient to preſerve our deareſt friends at home, from the greater Mortality which hath run thro' the Countrey. Did any of them dye Neglected? Which of them wanted any thing to be had in theſe parts? Did his Excellency lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Beds of downe, and fare deliciouſly every day? No, the ſame Meat, the ſame Drink, the ſame Lodging in their Quarters &amp; Marches, were common to all, only <hi>He</hi> was generally the <hi>laſt</hi> taken care for. To what a degree of Madneſs &amp; impiety are we then grown, ſo <hi>faleſly &amp; maliciouſly</hi> to recriminate a perſon who hath ſo generouſly expoſed himſelf to the <hi>hardſhips</hi> of that cold &amp; uncomfortable Climate, &amp; the Fatigues of War, againſt a barbarous and ſavage people? And certainly if God Almighty hath not <hi>given us over to believe lies,</hi> our eyes muſt be by this time open, &amp; we cannot but knowe, we have been put-upon, ſhamm'd and abuſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are <hi>Popiſh Commanders</hi> in the Army?

It muſt be confeſſ'd, there was <hi>one</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander &amp; no more under that Circumſtance; but what had he to do with the Forces? His Poſt was the Command of the <hi>King</hi>'s Souldiers &amp; Fort at <hi>Pemaquid,</hi> and was not Commiſſionated for the Army; beſides if he had, hath he not lived long amongſt us? Did any one ever queſtion his ability, Courage, Fidelity or Conduct, and ought not that Liberty of Conſcience, which has been ſo hotly preached up, even to the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of immoral Acts amongſt us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be equally beneficiall to him with other men? Eſpecially when the Gentlemen in the Countrey were ſo far from offering their Service in the Expedition, that ſome of the moſt eminent amongſt them have abſolutely refuſed the ſervice. And I have been told, the Governour's propoſalls to the Councill, about his

Nay, the very Images of their falſe gods which were publickly erected, (and therefore could not but be ſcandalous to ſuch as were truly religious) yet were they never demoliſhed, ſo far as we can read of, but at the ſpecial Command either of the people when the Government was popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or of <hi>Kings,</hi> when the Government was kingly. And if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do make mention of any Violence ſometimes offered unto Kings, it is not to juſtifie the fact, but to ſhew the Equity of the Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in permitting it. And whereas they of the contrary perſwaſion do frequently urge that excellent Saying of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, who delivering a Sword to a Captain of the <hi>Praetorian Band,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Hoc pro me u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33572:19"/>
when the Dangers that threaten us be extream, and otherwiſe inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For ſome of the Laws of God Himſelf, though they ſound abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet ſeem to admit of ſome tacite Exceptions in caſes of Extream Neceſſity: For ſo it was, by the wiſeſt of the Jewiſh Doctors, expreſly determined concerning the Law of their Sabbath, in the times of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamonaeans,</hi> whence roſe that famous Saying among them, <hi>Periculum ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae impellit Sabbatum;</hi> The danger of a man's Life drives away the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. When the Jew in <hi>Syneſius,</hi> was accuſed for the breach of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, he excuſeth himſelf by another Law, and that more forcible, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>We were in manifeſt jeopardy of our lives.</hi> When <hi>Bacchides</hi> had brought the Army of the Jews into a great Strait on their Sabbath day, placing cing his Army before them and behind them, the River <hi>Jordan</hi> being on both ſides; <hi>Jonathan</hi> thus beſpake his Souldiers, <hi>Let us go up now &amp; fight for our lives, for it ſtandeth not with us to day, as in times paſt.</hi> (1. Mac. 9. 43, 44, 45.) Which caſe of Neceſſity is approved of, even by Chriſt Himſelf, as well in this Law of the Sabbath, as in that of not eating the Shew-bread. And the Hebrew Doctors pretending the Authority of an ancient Tradition, do rightly interpret their Laws made againſt the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of meats forbidden, with this tacite Exception: Not that it was not juſt with God to have obliged us even unto death, but that ſome Laws of His are converſant about ſuch matters as it cannot eaſily be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that they were intended to have been proſecuted with ſo much Rigour as to reduce us to ſuch an Extremity, as to dy rather than to diſobey them, which in humane laws doth yet further proceed. I deny not, but that ſome Acts of Vertue are ſo ſtrictly enjoyned, that if we perform them not, we may juſtly be put to Death: As for a Centinel, to forſake his Station. But neither is this raſhly to be underſtood to be the Will of the Law-giver. Nor do men aſſume ſo much Right over either themſelves or others, unleſs it be when, &amp; ſo far forth as extreme Neceſſity requires it. For all humane laws are ſo conſtituted, or ſo to be underſtood as that there ſhould be ſome allowance for humane Frailty. The right underſtanding of this Law of <hi>Reſiſting or not-Reſiſting</hi> the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt powers in caſes of inevitable Neceſſity, ſeems much to depend upon the Intention of thoſe who firſt entered into Civil Society, from whom the Right of Government is devolved upon the perſons governing: who had they been demanded, Whether they would have impoſed ſuch a yoke upon all Mankind as death it ſelf, rather than in any caſe by force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Inſolencies of their Superiours; I much queſtion whether they would have granted it, unleſs it had been in ſuch a caſe, where ſuch
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33572:20"/>
Reſiſtance could not be made without great Commotions in the Common-Wealth, or the certain Deſtruction of many Innocents, for what Charity commends in ſuch a caſe to be done, may, I doubt not, paſs for an humane Law. But ſome may ſay, that this rigid Obligation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o dye rather than at any time to Reſiſt Injuries done by our Superiours, is not impoſed on us by any Humane, but by the Divine Law. But we muſt obſerve, That men did not <hi>at firſt</hi> unite themſelves in Civil Society, by any ſpecial Command from God, but voluntarily, out of a ſence they had of their own impotency to repel force and Violence wh lſt they lived ſolitarily, and in Families appart; whence the civil power takes it Riſe: For which cauſe it is that St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it an humane Ordinance, although it be elſe-where called a Divine Ordinance, becauſe this wholeſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of men was approved of by God Himſef. But God in approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an humane Law, may be thought to approve of it as an humane law, &amp; after an humane manner. <hi>Barkly</hi> (who was the ſtouteſt Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion in defending Kingly Power) doth notwithſtanding thus far allow, That the People or the Nobler part of them, have a Right to defend themſelves againſt cruel Tyranny, and yet he confeſſeth, that the whole Body of the people is ſubject unto the King. <hi>[Barkley. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>contra Monarchomach. c.</hi> 8.] Now this I ſhall eaſily admit, That the more we deſire to ſecure any thing by Law, the more expreſs and peremptory ſhould that Law be, and the fewer exceptions there ſhould be from it; (for they that have a mind to violate that Law, will preſently ſeek ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and think themſelves priviledged by thoſe Exceptions, though their Caſes be far different;) yet dare I not condemn indifferently either every private man, or every, though leſſer part of the people, who as their laſt Refuge, in caſes of extream Neceſſity, have anciently made uſe of their Arms to defend themſelves, yet with reſpect had to the Common Good. For <hi>David,</hi> who (ſaving in ſome particular Facts) was ſo celebrated for his integrity, did yet entertain firſt four hundred, and afterwards more armed men; to what end, unleſs for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaurd of his own perſon, againſt any violence that ſhould be offered him? But this alſo we muſt note, That <hi>David</hi> did not this until he had been aſſured, both by <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and by many other infallible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that <hi>Saul</hi> ſought his life; and that even then, he never inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any City, nor made an offenſive Warr againſt any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but lurked only for his own ſecurity, ſometimes in Mountains, ſometimes in Caves, and ſuch like devious places, and ſometimes in forreign Nations, with this Reſolution, to decline all occaſions of annoying his own Countrey-men.

A Fact parallel to this of <hi>David</hi>'s, we may read in the <hi>Maccabees:</hi> For whereas ſome ſeek to defend the Wars of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> upon this ground, That <hi>Antiochus</hi> was not a King, but an Uſurper; this I account but fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous: for in the whole Story of the <hi>Macabees,</hi> we ſhall never find <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> mentioned by any of their own party, by any other Title than by that of <hi>King;</hi> and deſervedly: For the Hebrews had long before ſubmitted to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And whereas others ſay, That the Maccabees did act by the peoples Right, to whom belonged the Right of Governing themſelves by their own Laws, neither is this probable: For the Jews being firſt conquered by <hi>Nebuchad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There was nothing then that could juſtifie the Maccabees in their taking of Arms, but that invincible Law of <hi>Extream Neceſſity</hi> which might do it ſo long as they contained themſelves within the bounds of Self-Preſervation, and in imitation of <hi>David,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to ſecret places, in order to their own ſecurity; never offering to make uſe of their Armes unleſs violently aſſaulted. In the mean time, great Care is to be taken, that even when we are thus enforced to defend our ſelves in caſes of certain and extream danger, we ſpare the perſon of the King; for they that conceive the carriage of <hi>David</hi> towards <hi>Saul,</hi> to proceed not ſo much from the Neceſſity of Duty, as out of ſome deeper conſideration, are miſtaken: for <hi>David</hi> himſelf declares, that no man can be innocent that ſtretcheth forth his hand againſt the Lord's Annointed: (1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 9.)
