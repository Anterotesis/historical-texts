            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with the outward ſenſe, but not with the inward conſent. Now, why ſome men haue theſe eares, and others not, it is, becauſe it is giuen to ſome to come, and to others not.

               <p>For firſt, when it pleaſeth him to diſcloſe that ſecret which he had purpoſed from before all beginning 14, at ſuch time as men leaſt looke <note place="margin">Externall vocation.</note> for it 15 (as men are blinded and yet thinke they ſee moſt cleare 16, when as in verie deed death &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ouer their head 17) hee

And that ſtandeth in two points: the one, whereby
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15735:19"/>
wee knowe Chriſt in general, <note place="margin">Faith hath two parts.</note> in belieuing the ſtorie of Chriſt, and the Prophecies which are writ of him 37: the which part of faith, as vvee ſhall declare in due place, is ſometimes giuen to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate. The other, which is proper, and onely belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Faith which doth apore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Chriſt, and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to the elect, conſiſteth in applying Chriſt (who is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally and indifferentlie preached to all men) to our ſelues, as ours: and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man make himſelfe ſure of his election, which hath been hid before all time in Gods ſecret 38, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reuealed vnto vs, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the inward teſtimonie of our conſcience through the holy Ghoſt, ioyned to the externall preaching of Gods word 39: and partly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15735:19"/>
alſo by the vertue and power of the ſame ſpirit, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the elect from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude of ſin 40, perſwadeth and conducteth them to will and vvorke the things which pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>Theſe then be the degrees, whereby it pleaſeth God to create and forme by his eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace, that precious and peculiar gift of faith in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, to the intent that they may imbrace their ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſt. But becauſe this faith in vs is yet weake &amp; onely begun, to the end that we may not onely perſeuere in it, but alſo profit (vvhich thing is moſt neceſſary for al men to do) firſt, according to the time that our adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is reuealed vnto vs, this faith is ſealed in our harts by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15735:20"/>
the ſacrament of Baptiſme: <note place="margin">Baptiſme.</note> and after, euery day more &amp; more is confirmed and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in vs by the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: of the <note place="margin">The Lords Supper.</note> which two Sacraments, the principall end is, that they be ſure, and effectuall ſignes, and pledges, of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the faithfull vvith Chriſt 41, who is their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, iuſtice, ſanctification, and redemption 42.</p>
               <p>For this occaſion, it is ſo oftentimes mentioned with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that wee beeing iuſtified by faith, haue peace with God 43: for whoſoeuer hath obtained the gift of true faith, hath alſo by the ſame grace and liberalitie of God, obtained the gift of perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance 44. So that in all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of temptations and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15735:20"/>
hee doubteth not to call vpon God, vvith ſure confidence to obtaine his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt <note place="margin">A ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</note> (as farre as it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him) knowing that hee is of the number of Gods children, who cannot faile him 45.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he neuer ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſo from the right way, but at length, by the benefit of Gods grace, he returneth againe: for, although faith ſometime ſeeme in the elect (as it were for a time) hid and buried, ſo that a man would thinke it were vtterly quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched 46 (which God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that men might knowe their owne weakenes) yet it doth neuer ſo far leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the loue of God &amp; their neighbor is a together pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of their hearts. For
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15735:21"/>
no man is iuſtified in Chriſt, who alſo is not ſanctified in him 47, and framed to good works, which God prepared that we ſhould walke therein 48. This is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God by his mercie, doth prepare (to the full executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his eternall counſell) them amongſt his elect, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſeth him to reſerue, till they come to ripe age and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion.</p>
               <p>As touching the other, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he calleth into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſo ſoone as they are borne, or in their tender yeeres, he vſeth a more ſhort way. For ſeeing he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in that his free coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereof Ieſus Chriſt is the Mediator 49, not onely the faithfull, but alſo their poſteritie 50, into a thouſand

               <p>And as for the teſtimonies that God hath left to them of his diuinitie 7, ſerue them to no other vſe, but to make them without all excuſe 8,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15735:23"/>
and yet through their owne default, ſeeing their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſack of capacitie, is the iuſt puniſhment of that corruption, wherein they are borne.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, as touching that, that they can attaine vnto in knowing GOD, by their light, or rather natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall darknes (albeit they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer failed in the way, but ſo continued 9) yet were it not in no wiſe ſufficient for their ſaluation.

is more terrible 13.

               <p>There are yet others, vvhoſe harts almighty God openeth to receiue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the things that they heare: but this is with that generall faith, whereby the

               <p>To conclude, they which are moſt miſerable of all, thoſe climbe a degree high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that their fall might bee more grieuous: for they are raiſed ſo high by ſome gift of grace, that they are a little mooued with ſome taſte of the heauenly gift 21: ſo that for the time they ſeeme to haue receiued the ſeed, and to be planted in the Church of God 22, and alſo ſhew the way of ſaluation to others 23.

               <p>Firſt, as in al other things 1, ſo chiefly in this matter of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15735:29"/>
predeſtination, they ought to take diligent heed, that in ſtead of Gods pure and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple truth, they bring not forth vaine and curious ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations or dreams 2. which thing they cannot chuſe but do, which goe about to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe and accord theſe ſecret iudgements of GOD vvith mans wiſedome; and ſo doe not onely put difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt predeſtination, and the purpoſe of God, which thing they muſt needs do, but ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the one from the other: for they either imagine a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine naked and idle permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or elſe make a double purpoſe &amp; counſell in God. From the which errors, they muſt needs fall into many &amp; great abſurdities. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are conſtrained to

diuide thoſe things, which of themſelues are ioyned moſt ſtraightly: and ſometimes, they are compelled to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent a great ſort of fooliſh &amp; darke diſtinctions, wherein the far her they occupy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Now, to touch briefly how this doctrine may bee appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let vs marke that all the works of God, euen the leaſt of all, are ſuch, that man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not iudge of them, but in two ſorts: that is, either whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are done; or elſe, by foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to come to paſſe by the diſpoſition of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and manifeſt cauſes, whoſe effects haue been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,

In this matter then, which is moſt obſcure of all others, it is no maruel if mans wit be driuen into this ſtraight, that it can not otherwiſe vnderſtand, but by this meanes, what is determined as touching him ſelfe in this ſecret counſell of God.

ſo that to doubt any more of it, is euill and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked 21.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15735:38"/>
becauſe no man can cal to mind the determinat pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of election, but at the ſame inſtant the contrary wil come to remembrance (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture theſe two are oftentimes ioyned together) it muſt <note place="margin">The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation ought not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</note> needs he, that ſuch as eſteem this part curious, or vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and therfore not to be talked of, doe great iniury to the ſpirit of God.

For in this ſort al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it differeth from election, becauſe election (as hath
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15735:39"/>
beene ſaid) is reuealed to vs by the ſpirit of God with in our ſelues, not in others, whoſe harts we cannot know. And reprobation is euer hid from men, except it bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed by God, contrarie to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon courſe of things. For who can tell, if God haue determined to ſhew mercy at the laſt houſe of death to him which hath ſpent all his life paſt lowdly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 29? But this truſt ought not to encourage any man to maintaine, and continue in his ſinne and vngodlineſs. For I ſpeake of thoſe things which vvee ought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in others: for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſuch mercie of GOD, are very rare, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any man that is vviſe, vvill promiſe to himſelfe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:15735:39"/>
through a vaine ſecurity and truſt, that thing which is not in his owne power 30.</p>
               <p>It is therefore ſufficient if we can vnderſtand generally that there bee veſſels prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to perdition 31: the which ſeeing God doth not reueale vnto vs who they are, we ought both in example of life and prayer diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to win and recouer to <note place="margin">We muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to win all men.</note> their ſaluation, yea euen very ſuch of whom by ſeeing their horrible vices we almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire 32. And if wee obſerue this order, wee ſhall receiue great fruit of this doctrine. For firſt, by the knowledge <note place="margin">The doctrin of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion maketh men hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble.</note> heerof, we ſhal learn humbly to ſubmit our ſelues to the maieſtie of God, ſo that the more we ſhall feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him, the more we ought

to labour to confirme in our <note place="margin">It maketh the grace of God to be better kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen of the elect.</note> ſelues the teſtimonie of our election in Chriſt 33.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, when wee ſhall diligently conſider the difference, which through the mercie of God is betwixt men, which are all alike ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the ſelfe ſame curſe &amp; malediction, it cannot bee, but we muſt acknowledge &amp; imbrace more earneſtly, the ſingular goodneſſe of God, then if wee did make this grace common to all men indifferently, or elſe referred the cauſe of the inequality of this grace to men 34.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we know that faith is a ſpeciall gift of God, ſhall wee not receiue it more willingly when it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and be more careful to haue the ſame to increaſe,
