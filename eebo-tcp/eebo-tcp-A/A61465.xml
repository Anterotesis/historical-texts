            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>SIR,</l>
               <l>SInce you oft invite me to renew</l>
               <l>An Art I've either lost, or never knew,</l>
               <l>Pleas'd my past follies kindly to commend,</l>
               <l>And fondly lose the Critick in the Friend;</l>
               <l>Th√¥ my warm Youth untimely be decay'd,</l>
               <l>From Grave to Dull insensibly betray'd,</l>
               <l>I'll contradict the Humour of the Times,</l>
               <l>(Inclin'd to bus'ness, and averse to Rhimes)</l>
               <l>And to obey the Man I love, in spight</l>
               <l>Of the World's Genius, and my own, I'll write.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But think not that I vainly do aspire</l>
               <l>To Rival what I only wou'd Admire,</l>
               <l>The Heat and Beauty of your manly thought,</l>
               <l>And Force like that with which your Heroe fought.</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Riddle is that powerful Song,</l>
               <l>Sweet as the Honey, as the Lyon strong;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99121:3"/>The Colours there so artfully are laid,</l>
               <l>They fear no Lustre, and they want no Shade,</l>
               <l>But shall of writing a just model give,</l>
               <l>While <hi>Boyne</hi> shall flow, and <hi>William</hi>'s Glory live.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet since his ev'ry Act may well infuse</l>
               <l>Some happy Rapture in the humblest Muse,</l>
               <l>Th√¥ mine despairs to reach the wondrous height,</l>
               <l>She prunes her pinnions, eager of the flight;</l>
               <l>The <hi>King</hi>'s the Theme, and I've a <hi>Subject</hi>'s Right:</l>
               <l>When <hi>William</hi>'s Deeds, and rescu'd <hi>Europe</hi>'s Joy</l>
               <l>Do ev'ry Tongue and ev'ry Pen employ,</l>
               <l>'Tis to think Treason sure to shew no Zeal,</l>
               <l>And not to Write is almost to Rebel.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Let <hi>Albion</hi> then forgive her Meanest Son,</l>
               <l>Who wou'd continue what her Best begun;</l>
               <l>Who, leaving Conquests and the Pomp of War,</l>
               <l>Wou'd sing the pious King's divided Care;</l>
               <l>How eagerly he flew when <hi>Europe</hi>'s Fate</l>
               <l>Did for the Seeds of future Actions wait;</l>
               <l>And how two Nations did with Transport boast</l>
               <l>Which was belov'd, and lov'd the Victor most:</l>
               <l>How joyful <hi>Belgia</hi> gratefully prepar'd</l>
               <l>Trophies and Vows for her returning Lord;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99121:3"/>How the <hi>Fair Isle</hi> with rival passion strove,</l>
               <l>How by her Sorrow she exprest her Love,</l>
               <l>When He withdrew from what his Arm had free'd,</l>
               <l>And how she blest his way, yet sigh'd, and said,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Is it decree'd my Heroe ne'er shall rest,</l>
               <l>Ne'er be of me, and I of him possest?</l>
               <l>Scarce had I met his Vertue with my Throne,</l>
               <l>(By Right, by Merit, and by Arms his own)</l>
               <l>But <hi>Ireland</hi>'s freedom and the Wars alarms</l>
               <l>Call'd him from me and his <hi>Maria</hi>'s Charms.</l>
               <l>Oh gen'rous Prince! too prodigally kind,</l>
               <l>Can the diffusive Goodness of your Mind</l>
               <l>Be in no bounds, but of the World, confin'd?</l>
               <l>Shou'd sinking Nations summon You away,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Maria</hi>'s Love might justifie Your stay.</l>
               <l>Imperfectly the many Vows are paid,</l>
               <l>Which for your Safety to the Gods were made,</l>
               <l>While, on the <hi>Boyne,</hi> they labour'd to out-do</l>
               <l>Your Zeal for <hi>Albion</hi> by their Care for You;</l>
               <l>When too impatient of a glorious Ease,</l>
               <l>You tempt new Dangers on the Winter-Seas.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Belgick State</hi> has rested long secure</l>
               <l>Within the Circle of thy Guardian Power;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99121:4"/>Rear'd by thy care that noble <hi>Lyon,</hi> grown</l>
               <l>Mature in strength, can range the Woods Alone:</l>
               <l>When to my Arms they did the Prince resign,</l>
               <l>I blest the Change, and thought Him wholly mine;</l>
               <l>Conceiv'd Long hopes I jointly shou'd obey</l>
               <l>His stronger, and <hi>Maria</hi>'s gentle Sway,</l>
               <l>He fierce as Thunder, she as Lightning bright;</l>
               <l>One my Defence, and t'other my Delight.</l>
               <l>Yet go‚Äîwhere Honour calls the Heroe, go;</l>
               <l>Nor let your eyes behold how mine do flow;</l>
               <l>Go, meet your Country's joy, your Vertue's due,</l>
               <l>Receive their Triumphs, and prepare for new;</l>
               <l>Inlarge my Empire, and let <hi>France</hi> afford</l>
               <l>The next large Harvest to thy prosp'rous Sword;</l>
               <l>Again in <hi>Crecy</hi> let my Arms be rear'd,</l>

               <l>While under <hi>Mary</hi>'s tutelary Care,</l>
               <l>Far from the Danger, or the Noise of War,</l>
               <l>In honourable Pleasure I possess</l>
               <l>The Spoils of Conquest, and the Charms of Peace.</l>
               <l>As the <hi>Great Lamp</hi> by which the Globe is blest,</l>
               <l>Constant in toil, and ignorant of rest,</l>
               <l>Thr√¥ diff'rent Regions does his Course pursue,</l>
               <l>And leaves one World but to revive a new;</l>

               <l>Relieves his Lustre with a milder Light:</l>
               <l>So when your Beams do distant Nations chear,</l>
               <l>The Partner of your Crown shall mount the Sphere,</l>
               <l>Able Alone my Empire to sustain,</l>
               <l>And carry on the Glories of thy Reign‚Äî</l>
               <l>But why has fate maliciously decree'd,</l>
               <l>That greatest blessings must by turns succeed?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Here she relented, and would urge his stay</l>
               <l>By all that fondness and that grief could say;</l>
               <l>But soon did her presaging thoughts employ</l>
               <l>On Scenes of Triumphs and returning Joy:</l>
               <l>Thus, like the Tide, while her unconstant brest</l>
               <l>Was swell'd with Rapture, by Despair deprest,</l>
               <l>Fate call'd; The Heroe must his way pursue,</l>
               <l>And her cries lessen'd as the shore withdrew.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Winds were silent, and the <hi>Gentle</hi> Main</l>

               <l>(Ill suiting with the blessings of the day.)</l>
               <l>Our better fortune with our Prince was gone,</l>
               <l>Conquest was only there where He led on.</l>
               <l>Like the <hi>Palladium,</hi> wheresoe'er you go</l>
