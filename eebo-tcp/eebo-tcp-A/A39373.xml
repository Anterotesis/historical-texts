            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Grant that if I ſhould expoſe to <hi>Publick View</hi> any Aſſertion of yours in your <hi>Private Letter</hi> to me, that you your ſelf in the ſame, or in <hi>equivalent</hi> Terms have not declar'd to the World, you might have ſome Pretence to charge me with <hi>Incivility:</hi> But certainly there cannot be the leaſt Appearance of any Grounds for ſuch a Charge in this, that I endeavour before all the World to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you and your <hi>Adherents</hi> of the Falſhood of this Conceit, That <q>
                  <hi>there is not a tittle in all the Scripture that points at Chriſt, as a Light within every Man's Conſcience.</hi>
               </q> This you could not ſay (I ſpeak as in HIS Preſence, who is <hi>Ready to judge the Quick and the Dead)</hi> but by the Inſtigation of the <hi>Prince of</hi> DAR<gap reason="illegible" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>. If it be Evident in the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> that CHRIST is the True and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109241:2"/>
Eternal GOD, it is Evident that He is <hi>a Light within every Man's Conſcience:</hi> For GOD IS LIGHT, LIGHT <hi>INFINITE:</hi> So that there can be no <hi>Spiritual, or Intellectual</hi> ILLUMINATION, but what comes directly, and immediately from GOD. By CONSCIENCE we are to underſtand the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Law of GOD, of that which GOD Commands us to do, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from Doing, joyn'd with the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of our own Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or Difformity thereunto. By <hi>Light within the Conſcience</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>That,</hi> by which we ſee, or perceive clearly, and Effectually what it is that GOD Commands us to do, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from Doing: And by which we perceive our own Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Diſobedience, our Conformity, or Difformity to the Will of GOD. The Effect of this Sight, or Perceivance is the EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CUSING, or ACCUSING of our ſelves in the Sight of GOD, from which ariſes our Delight in GOD through an effectual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> or <hi>Veneration of Spirit</hi> for being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to <hi>his Holy Will,</hi> the Fountain of All <hi>Intellectual</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>I deſire you would Read all the Papers which have been Publiſht for me; which are Sold by <hi>Thomas Northcott,</hi> in <hi>George yard,</hi> in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet.</hi> I alſo deſire you wou'd peruſe a Treatiſe, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Spirit of Truth Vindicated,</hi> Written by my Honour'd Friend <hi>W. P.</hi> in which you will ſee the moſt Horrid and Deteſtable Falſhood of one of thoſe <hi>Abſurd, and Contradictory Calumnies, viz.</hi> That he is a PAPIST, yea, that he is a JESUITE, And that he is a SOCINIAN. Whether he be a SOCINIAN let any Man judge after he ſhall have read theſe Words, in the beginning of that Treatiſe: <q>I cannot but eſteem it a peculiar Providence of Mercy from the Moſt High GOD, <hi>to us his poor deſpiſed People, tho'</hi> an Inſtance of great Unkindneſs in our Adverſary, that after our ſeveral Years preſſure, <hi>under the heavy Calumnies of being involv'd with a Socinian Confederacy, he ſhould</hi> ſo ſuffer it to come to paſs, that without the leaſt Provocation given on our Parts,

                  <hi>one of that ſort of Men ſhould become our Compurgator,</hi> indeed our beſt Advocate in pleading againſt us; for whilſt he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to detect the <hi>Quakers</hi> of an Erronious Spirit, <hi>it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he denies them any ſhare in his; and therefore no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians.</hi>

            <p>I deſire that in all your Diſputes with me, or Mr. <hi>PENN, About the Light within,</hi> you would moſt Seriouſly Conſider that within a very ſhort Time You, and He, and I muſt give an Account of All our Thoughts, Words, Actions, and Omiſſions to the LORD Our GOD, who has been pleas'd to <hi>reveal</hi> Himſelf unto us in the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> under the Appellation of LIGHT, and LOVE.</p>

               </q> Mr. <hi>PENN</hi>'s Words are theſe, <hi>Reply, P.</hi> 53, 54. <q>Now tho' with a fair Adverſary, one might ſay without Offence, that God, or Chriſt is <hi>The Light

within Man,</hi> yet it is not the common way of our Expreſſing our ſelves. To be ſure we have no ſuch meaning in that way of ſpeaking, as ſome Adverſaries ſtrain, our Words to, as if God, and Chriſt were Comprehenſible in, and by Man, to render us Abſurd, and Blaſphemous.</q> I entreat you to conſider how great a Multitude in this Kingdom have provok'd the Wrath of GOD <hi>by Calumniating</hi> this Gentleman, Clamouring againſt him as if he was a PAPIST, yea a JESUITE. Is it <hi>Popery</hi> to aſſert that the <hi>Principal</hi> RULE of Faith to a Sincere Chriſtian is That, which Almighty GOD has WRITTEN in the Hearts of All Men? This the People call'd Quakers do affirm; and in this I fully Concur with them: And, I ſay, for want of a due Belief of this <hi>The whole World lyeth in Wickedneſs.</hi>
