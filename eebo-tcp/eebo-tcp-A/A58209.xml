            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="definition">
               <head>The Plague what it is.</head>
               <p>THe Plague is a Diſeaſe Venomous and Contagious and hateful to mankinde, and deadly for the moſt part, accompanied with grievous ſores, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunkles, Botches, Blains, and alſo ſpots, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colourings of the skin, by antient Writers, called <hi>Peſtities,</hi> and in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Gods Tokens; For the Peſtilential <hi>Bubo</hi> and <hi>Carbunkle,</hi> are more manifeſt ſignes of the Plague, than the ſpots, for ſpots are ſeen in Feavers, which are not Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential.</p>
               <p>The Plague may bee fitly called the Rod of God, for the ſins of the World: The word Plague, ſignifies, a wound, a ſtroke, or a hurt, for whoſoever hath this diſeaſe, hee is wounded, plagued, ſtrucken, and that by God, it is a killing Diſeaſe, fearful to man, unawares ſeizeth upon mans Body, ſleeping or waking, and being once entred, produceth deadly acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, it is compared with the <hi>Baſilisk</hi> that killeth man by his ſight, looking upon man; The Plague killeth thoſe whom it breatheth upon, no man can account himſelf free from it.</p>
               <p>Many learned Writers teſtifie this Diſeaſe proceeds from the influence of the Heavens, ſo that, by their great diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Ayre is Poyloned and infected, which wee are enforced
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33801:5"/>
to receive into the ſecret Cloſets of our Bodies.</p>
               <p>What ſafety have wee then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or what can be a more fearfuller enemy to man, than Peſtilential Feavers? which ſeizeth upon man as a Thief, at unawares, and lurks in every corner of the Houſe, in his Secret Chambers, threatning to take away his life; when hee leaſt miſtruſts, yea, when faſt aſleep; Such is this horrid Diſeaſe, from which God in his mercy deliver us and our Land.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the parts of Mans Body the Plague invadeth.</head>
               <p>Three parts Subject to Infection, the Animal, Vital, and Natural faculties, which have their Seats in the Brain, the Heart and the Liver, on one or all theſe the Infection ſeizeth upon, and once entred, tryumpheth over the whole body of man to his deſtruction, if God bee not more merciful in his Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Plague is a Feaver, hee that hath it, is not without a Feaver, neither is hee freed from the danger of this Feaver, till one, or more than one of the Criſis happen; for until the Botch, Carbunkle, Blain, or Spots manifeſt themſelves, no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can bee given, what will become of the Patient; Wee may expect death, the diſtemper continuing.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Symptomes of Recovery.</head>
               <p>The firſt is this: If a digeſtion in Nature follow, and the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe, the ſick reſt, a Botch come to good perfection, a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunkle to ſeparation, and the Blains drying, and withering, and chearfulneſs appearing, then wee may hope the worſt is paſt.</p>

               <p>And that is the ſins of all people; Sin makes God Execute this Judgement upon a Nation; <hi>Shall there bee evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now God can put the Hoſt of Heaven in order, to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and wee have no way to eſcape his Judgements but by Prayer and true Repentance, and this is that, which brings a bleſſing upon the means you uſe for your Recovery.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="causes">
               <head>The terreſtrial Cauſes of the Plague, are theſe:</head>
               <p>Vapours from ſtinking Ponds, Ditches, Dung-hills, Sinks,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33801:5"/>
Channels, Vaults, unclean Slaughter-houſes of Beaſts, dead Carkaſſes of Men; Stinking Fiſh, Fowle, any thing that hath contained life and is putrified, and in great Cities, as in <hi>London,</hi> unclean keeping of Houſes, and Lains, Alleys, and Streets, from theſe recited, and the like venomous Vapours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the warmth of the Sun exhailed, Infects the Bodies of Men, and produceth the Plague, which once produced, is too apt to ſpread it ſelf, and become popular, as experience ſheweth.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Accidental ſigns of the Plague.</head>
               <p>They are various and uncertain, not in all perſons alike, but to ſpeak in general:</p>
               <p>The firſt appearance of the Plague<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it appeareth cold, pain in the head, and in the ſtomach, and ſometimes in the back, and them took for an Ague and little feared.</p>
               <p>Thoſe whole pains begins in the back, all theſe kinde of beginnings, are more hopeful of healing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then when it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with pain and giddineſs of the head and ſtomach.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Others complain of Pain with great heat inward, in the ſtomach, and intrails; When the outward parts are chill and cold, ready to ſhake.</p>
               <p>Again, Some in the beginning complain of great thirſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of ſhortneſs of breath, ſwelling and ſoreneſs of the throat.</p>
               <p>Again, ſome are taken with deſire of ſleep, and unfrequent yawnings, and it is unſafe to let theſe ſleep before they are well ſweated, And therefore my deſire is, that you would not delay, but apply this Medicine:</p>
               <p>Take of Zedory In powther half a dram, common Treacle half a ſpoonful, white-Wine Vinegar three ſpoonfuls; Take this upon any Infection of the Plague, as ſoon as you are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it, and ſweat upon it, as long as the ſpirits will bear it; Repeat this over twice, to make the cure abſolute; drink with it Poſſet Drink, or Veal Broth, as in other courſes of Phyſick.</p>
               <p>Now as touching ſigns, and accidents of this Diſeaſe: No man can ſpeak of any terrible ſymptome, ſign, of any Diſeaſe whatſoever, that hath befallen any man, but the like hath been ſeen in ſome one perſon or other ſick of the Plague, and therefore it is called the ſickneſs, as comprehending all other ſickneſs in it ſelf.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33801:6"/>
               <head>Accidental ſignes which preſage Death.</head>
               <p>As namely, when the Patient is poſſeſſed with ſoundings, and faintings, and cold and clammy ſweats, often changing the countenance vomiting of ſlimy, ſharp, and ill-coloured flegme either greeniſh, yellowiſh, blackiſh, or blood-coloured Saines, or voiding of excrements diſordered, and diſcoloured, either fatty, blackiſh, unctious, or unnaturally ſtinking, Convulſions, contractions of the Nerves, grovelling and piddling with the fingers, as plucking the Bed-cloaths.</p>
               <p>We ſhall ſpeak ſomething of the three great out ward ſigns of the Plague.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Imprimis,</hi> Firſt the Bubo, theſe Buboes, Boyles, or Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Botches, commonly happen in the Emunctories, Sinkes or cleanſing parts of the Body, at the Artiſt terms them, and ſeldome elſewhere if they be Peſtilential: Namely, they come in the glandulous parts, under, or behinde the ears, if the brain bee oppreſſed, which is the place by which the brain, if Nature bee able, driveth out the Venome, or Poyſonous Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which would kill the whole Body.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, it cometh under the Arm holes, where are certain ſmall Glandules or Kernels, and to that part the heart ſendeth out the venomous vapours, or offending matter, which ſuddenly groweth there to an Impoſthume, Botch or Boyle.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt place where the Bubo Peſtilential cometh; is in the Groin, where when the Liver is oppreſſed, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtrong, ſhe ſendeth forth the Diſeaſe or botch thither, and this is the third part where the botch appeareth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond outward ſign of the Plague, is the fierce burning Carbunckle, called the burning Cole, which happeneth in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of mans body, without Order, Rule, or Controule, within the body, as well as without, it does appear, firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, hard in the midſt thereof, with a burning pain, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the ſick like the burning fire, and itching much, which if ſcratched, will come forth, a rediſh, yellowiſh, dusky colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Icour; and ſometimes the pain is ſo great, the Patient will grow mad.</p>

               <p>The third ſigne of this Diſeaſe is the Blaine, whereof ſome infected have many, and ſome againe not one; and this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is a painful angry Puſh, ſomewhat like the ſmall Pox, but in colour more red or cloudy, ſeldome tranſparent as a ſmall Pock uſually is, but farre more painful; ſome have them big, and ſome have them little, with a ſmall head, of an angry blew or rediſh colour, ſometimes of a lead colour, hard, or fleſhy, growing upon a large root or ſtool; this Diſeaſe is found in every part of the body, but this Blain ſeldome killeth or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the cure of the diſeaſe.

By the way, ſome Doctors will give this advice, to fly from the place viſited, and that quickly, and that farre, and tarry long from the danger the infected are in, where it reigneth, I
