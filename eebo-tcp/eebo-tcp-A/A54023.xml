            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>IT is commonly Objected againſt us, That we condemn all but our ſelves, all the Proteſtant Churches, Martyrs, and Worthies formerly</hi> (many of whom were valiant Champions againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> and divers of them ſealed their Teſtimony with their blood) <hi>and all ſorts of Chriſtians and Profeſſors at preſent, who are not juſt of our ſtamp and way, though otherwiſe never ſo zealous and upright-hearted towards God.</hi>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>The Proteſtant Churches (as they are called in way of diſtinction from the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> the bleſſed Martyrs, who ſuffered for the Teſtimony of a pure Conſcience towards God, and all the Worthies of the Lord in their ſeveral Generations, who fought againſt that Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Whore, were accepted of God in their Teſtimony againſt Her, and are not diſowned by us, but dearly owned and honoured therein: And for agreeing with them in their teſtimony in ſeveral things, as againſt deriving of a Miniſtry from <hi>Rome</hi> (which <hi>Luther</hi> wrote againſt, and <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> propheſied of another Miniſtry to ariſe) and againſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Goſpel Miniſtry by Tythes, or any other way of forced Maintenance, which (till Popery grew very ſtrong and powerful) was known to have been free, and againſt ſwearing, <hi>&amp;c. (Walter Brute</hi> ſaid, <hi>the perfection of Chriſtian men is not to ſwear at all, becauſe they are ſo commanded of Chriſt, whoſe commandment muſt in no caſe be broken, although that the City of</hi> Rome <hi>is contrary to this Doctrine of Chriſt, Fox</hi> his Acts and Monuments, <hi>Page</hi> 460, 461. And ſee alſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96899:3"/>
                     <hi>Page</hi> 495. <hi>Thorp's</hi> teſtimony both about Tythes and Swearing.) For theſe very things and ſuch like (as for following of Chriſt, in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or giving that honour which is out of the faith, and for teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying againſt the hypocriſies and corruptions of our age) do we ſuffer in this our day, even as they did in their day, from the ſame Spirit that perſecuted them; which though it hath much changed its form and way of appearance, yet ſtill retaineth the ſame nature.</p>
                  <p>But all things were not diſcovered at once. The times were then dark, and the light ſmall: yet they being faithfull according to what was diſcovered, were pretious in the Lords eyes: and what through ignorance they erred in, the Lord winked at and overlooked, being pleaſed with that ſincerity and ſimplicity of heart, which he had ſtirred up in them towards himſelf. But if they were now alive in theſe our daies, and ſhould depart from the ſincerity which was then in them, and oppoſe the Light of this age; they would not then be accepted of the Lord, but their former ſincerity would be forgotten. For the Light ſhineth more and more towards the perfect day: and it is not the owning of the Light as it ſhone in the foregoing ages, which will now commend any man to God, but the knowing and ſubjecting to the Light of the preſent age. Even as in theſe our dayes, there was (ſome years ago) an honeſt zeal and true ſimplicity ſtirring in the <hi>Puritans</hi> (eſpecially among the Non-conformiſts of them) which was of the Lord, and was very dear to him: And had the generations of this age abode there, they would have been able to have followed the Lord in every further ſtep and leading of his Spirit. But departing from that into ſome form or other, the true ſimplicity withered, and another thing began to live in them; and ſo they ſetled upon their lees, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the form they had choſe to themſelves, till at length their hearts became hardned from the pure fear, even to the contracting of a ſpirit of prophaneneſs, inſomuch as they could mock at the next remove and diſcovery of the Spirit as ſome new Light: &amp; ſo by degrees have grown perſecutors of that Spirit in its out-goings in the people of the Lord, which they themſelves had once ſome taſt of, while they were reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Puritans. And the God of this world, who at firſt tempted them aſide into the form, hath at length prevailed ſo far to blind them therewith, that they can neither ſee what ſpirit they themſelves are of, nor what ſpirit it is they perſecute.</p>
                  <p>Let therefore people conſider the truth of the thing, as it is before the Lord: We do not caſt dirt upon any, in whom the truth of God hath ſtirred and appeared in any meaſure in former ages, or in this our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96899:3"/>
age: but this we teſtifie againſt, to wit, the ſetting up of any form without the life and power: for it is the erring ſpirit which ſtill cryeth up the form, to keep down the power by the form, and ſo by the help of it to bewitch from the Spirit, wherein is the life, and not in the form. This was the painted Jezabel of the Apoſtles age, falſe teachers finely dreſſed up themſelves with the form of godlineſs, and then under this cover they could deny the power, and make head againſt it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. how eaſie is it for them who appear in the form of the doctrines of the Goſpel, in the form of zeal, in the form of holineſs, to paſs in a Nation for the true Church, and then to aſperſe them for Heretickes, who (appearing in the power) cannot but deny that form which is without the power. This is the great Witch of this age (even that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of zeal and devotion, which is beſt clothed and decked with the form without the power) which though men (who judge of the things of God after the fleſh) juſtifie, admire, and much contend for in her ſeveral ſhapes and dreſſes (ſome being for one, ſome for another) yet the Lord is ſearching after her, and will find her out with his eternal flames, which will make her manifeſt, and all her lovers ſhall dread her burning and bed of torment. Now as all along the Apoſtacy, this bewitching ſpirit (this ſpirit which bewitcheth from the power) hath crept up under a form of Church worſhip and holineſs: ſo the other Spirit (the pure Spirit of life, the Spirit of true zeal, and fear of the Lord) hath ſtill appeared more and more out of the forms. Who were the beſt Preachers, and moſt eminent Chriſtians in the Puritan daies? Were they not thoſe who leaſt minded the form then, nay indeed, who were moſt againſt the form, and perſecuted for their conſcientious ſtumbling at it? &amp; who were the greateſt perſecutors then, but they who were moſt zealous for the form, both of the government and worſhip of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> And where is the perſecuting ſpirit next to be looked for, but in the forms which ſhould next appear? And where likewiſe is the appearance of the true ſpirit next to be looked for, but in thoſe whom the Lord ſhould raiſe up to teſtifie againſt thoſe forms, and to be the ſucceeding ſufferers for their teſtimony, as the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans had been foregoing ſufferers for their teſtimony?</p>
                  <p>Yet if there be any perſons left, among any of the forms which have appeared (whether former or later) that have not loſt their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and true zeal towards God, them we own and have unity with, ſo far as they keep, or rather are kept thereto. If there be any among the Epiſcopal ſort, that in truth of heart deſire to fear the Lord, and look upon the Common-Prayer-Book as an acceptable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96899:4"/>
way of worſhipping him; we pitty their blindneſs, yet are tender to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and would not have the ſimplicity perſecuted in them becauſe of this, but rather cheriſhed. If there be any among the Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts, Seekers, or any other ſort, that in truth of heart wait upon the Lord in thoſe wayes, and do not find a deadneſs overgrown them, but a pure, freſh, lively zeal towards God, with an unfeigned love to his people, our hearts are one with this; and we cannot fight againſt this good thing in any of them, though in love to them we teſtifie, that their form and way of worſhip is their preſent loſs and hinderance yet we doubt not, but that the Lord (in his time) will make manifeſt to ſuch the Light of this age, which is the very thing the People of God in many fore-going ages have been praying for. But this is our lamentation, that forms and wayes of worſhip abound, but the Puritan-Principle, the Puritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit is loſt and drowned in them all; and that men are hardened againſt our teſtimony, not from the remainders of the ſimplicity in them, but becauſe they are erred from the ſimplicity, and fallen in league with another ſpirit, which hath lain lurking in forms of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and worſhip (to tempt aſide from the ſimplicity, and to hide the ſight of the life and power from the panting ſoul) all this night of the Apoſtacy.</p>
                  <p>Now mark how eaſie and natural it is to that ſpirit to enter into a form, to cry up a form, to ſet up a form in a Nation, City, or Country, (doubtleſs it had been done in this Nation long ago, had not the mighty hand of the Lord withſtood it.) When the evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit is detected and driven out of one form, if it doth not get another ſuddenly to appear in and tempt with, it muſt needs loſe many of its Subjects. The ſtrumpet or falſe Church is forced (as God diſcovers her nakedneſs and lewdneſs) to change her dreſſes and appearances, to new-trick and adorn her bed: and then, as if ſhe alſo were changed, and were now no longer the ſame, ſhe comes forth again with boldneſs, and tempteth the young man again to come in unto her, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 16. And thus <hi>ſhe caſteth down many wounded, yea many ſtrong men have been ſlain by her,</hi> verſ. 26. who otherwiſe would have <hi>pondered the path of life,</hi> chap. 5. 6. had they not been enſnared by her flatteries, who <hi>forſaketh the guide of her youth, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Covenant of her God,</hi> Chap. 2. 17. There is no more certain and ready way to ſuppreſs truth, and to betray the honeſty which is ſingly ſearching after it, than to preſent a form of godlineſs or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as the proper way of meeting with it: for hereby the ſoul is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96899:4"/>
lulled aſleep with a falſe hope, until the freſhneſs of its deſire begins to die, and its life to wither; &amp; then the fleſhly part eaſily grows into unity with, and zeal for that form w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> indeed is of the fleſh, though it appeared and tempted as if it had been otherwiſe. And how many have gone a great way towards Hell, &amp; have bin deeply intangled and diſtreſſed in the Chambers of death, by entring into this ſtrumpets Church or houſe which they then (through the ſubtilty of her deceit) took for the houſe or Church of God? <hi>Pro.</hi> 7. 27. Conſider the thing a little ſeriouſly: When the evil ſpirit is driven out of his ſtrong hold of groſſe Popery, whither ſhould he run but into Epiſcopacy? When he is driven out of Epiſcopacy, whither ſhould he run but into Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery? When he is driven out of Presbytery, whither ſhould he run but into Independency? When he is driven but of Independency, whither ſhould he run but into Anabaptiſm? When he is driven out of Anabaptiſm, whither ſhould he run but into a way of Seeking? And what is his end of running into Epiſcopacy, but to ſave alive that ſpirit which was hunted out of Popery (and could abide no longer there) and ſo the better (and the ſafer from being diſcerned) to reproach and perſecute the other ſpirit (where ever it appeared) under nick-names of Puritans, Separatiſts, Browniſts, Round-heads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what is his end afterwards of running into Presbytery, but to ſave that alive which was hunted out of Epiſcopacy, and to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the former truly zealous Spirit (where it ſhould further appear afterwards) by means of that form? Thus the forms and appearances of things change, but the fight is ſtill the ſame, the evil ſpirit ſtill getting uppermoſt under a form of godlineſs, and from thence ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth its arrowes at thoſe that ſeek after purity of heart, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but teſtifie againſt thoſe forms where the impure one lodgeth.</p>
                  <p>This then is the ſum of our anſwer in this reſpect: we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true life and power of godlineſs; wherever it hath appeared, or yet appears under the vail of any form whatſoever. Nay all perſons who ſingly wait upon the Lord, in the ſimplicity and ſincerity of their hearts, whether under any form, or out of forms (that matters little to us) are very dear unto us in the Lord. But we are againſt all forms, Images, imitations, and appearances, which betray the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and ſincerity of the heart, keep the life in bondage, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the loſs of the ſoul. And too many ſuch now there are, which hold the immortal ſeed of life in captivity under death, over which we cannot but mourn, and wait for its breaking off the chains, and its riſing out of all its graves into its own pure life, power, and fulneſs of liberty in the Lord.</p>

               <p>Now it would fairly and honeſtly (with the ſpirit of meekneſs and in the fear of the Lord) be enquired into, <hi>whether the Popes Power and Authority in this Nation, was a true Church-Power and Authority?</hi> that is, whether it was ſuch a Church-Power and Authority as Chriſt had inſtituted, or of another nature, even of a nature contrary to Chriſt, and to his inward Government in the ſpirits of his people? For if the <hi>Popes</hi> power and Authority was a true Church power and Authority, then it may be lawful in another hand, though not in the <hi>Popes:</hi> but if it was an uſurped kind of Authority and Government in it ſelf, then it cannot be lawful in it ſelf, nor ſerviceable to Chriſt in any other hand, but will prove an inſtrument of War againſt him, in whoſe hands ſoever it be put. And let it be ſingly conſidered, whether the Church-power in this Nation, hath not been a curb to the riſing of the purity of Religion, even a ſharp check upon the tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but ſuch as the looſe (yea prophane ſpirit) would take pleaſure in and contend for?</p>
               <p>The true Church-power is onely the power of the ſpirit of Chriſt. That converts men to God, and that alone is able to govern them (in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96899:5"/>
the affairs of his kingdom; being converted. Man medling with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Church-Government in his wiſdom, is but a beaſt: and muſt govern like a beaſt; namely, with force and cruelty over the ſpirit and conſcience which is tender towards God. As the Lord God of heaven and earth, never gave the converting power to any, ſo neither did he ever give this governing power to any, further than as they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with his ſpirit: for that is the Scepter of his Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is a Scepter of Righteouſneſs, which leads on in the love and gentleneſs of the Spirit that which is to be dealt gently with, and ſpiritually cuts off by its ſeverity and ſharpneſs that which is to be cut off. And here are Chriſts limits of Government which that ſpirit and wiſdom which exceeds, errs and does hurt both to it ſelf and others.</p>
               <p>Now if in the miſt of darkneſs, wch hath long over-ſpread the earth, (for though there brake out a little Light to diſcover the thick black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Popery, and to cauſe ſome Reformation out of it, yet the miſt was not expelled) this Nation hath erred, her Princes, her teachers, her Parliaments, and all ſorts of perſons, in laying hold on and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a wrong Church-power, which power hath had a bad effect, namely, in ſuppreſſing the progreſs of the reforming ſpirit, and raiſing up a formal ſpirit (if not a ſpirit of looſeneſs and prophaneſs) which ran backwards towards Popery, and not forwards from it: yet let them not love error, and ſo ſtrive againſt the light which ſhineth forth to diſcover the error to them. But let them humble themſelves before Chriſt the Lord of all, and reſtore unto him that which is his due, leaſt they provoke him to wrath, and cauſe him to take from them what they look upon as their due: For is it not juſt with Chriſt to take that power from men, which they (ſo long as they have it) will not forbear mannaging and making uſe of to keep him from his power? Conſider theſe things, O <hi>England,</hi> for they belong to thy peace, and toward the mitigation of thy ſorrow and miſery in the day of thy calamity.</p>

               <head>An Explanatory POST-SCRIPT.</head>
               <p>WE read of the getting up of another Power than Chriſts in the Church, after the dayes of the Apoſtles. <hi>1 Theſ. 2. 4. Rev. 13. 2.</hi> which Power was to laſt <hi>42.</hi> Months, even all the time of Anti-Chriſts Reign; by which Power the Beaſt ſhould make war with, and overcome the Saints in all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations, <hi>verſ. 5, 6, 7.</hi> And all this wickedneſs and perſecution of the Saints ſhould be committed, under a pretence of Righteouſneſs, as if it were for Chriſt and the well-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church, from a true and rightly-derived, and well-ballanced Power, <hi>1 Theſ. 2. 8. 9.</hi> Now this Power will laſt in one Form or other, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven till the very coming of Chriſt: and then ſhall that wicked Spirit (in all his workings, in all his various appearings and transformings, as if he ſtill were for God, and for the right and orderly Government of his Church and Temple) be diſcovered, by degrees conſumed, and at laſt deſtroyed, <hi>verſ. 8.</hi> And then the Kings or Powers of the earth, which give their power and ſtrength to the Beaſt (helping him to cauſe men to worſhip, <hi>Rev. 13. 15, 16.)</hi> making war with the Lamb and his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saints by their Laws, whips, priſons, fines, &amp;c. ſhall be overcome by him, who fighteth againſt them with <hi>the ſpirit of his mouth,</hi> and by his <hi>truth, meekneſs, and righteouſneſs,</hi> which ſhines in the hearts and converſations of his <hi>called, faithful and choſen,</hi> Rev. <hi>17. 13, 14.</hi> Pſal. <hi>45. 4, 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The power of Chriſt cannot hurt any of his Lambs, (it never forced the weak ones, the tender conſcienced, but he carries the Lambs in his boſome, and gently leads thoſe that are with young, <hi>Iſa. 40. 11.)</hi> He had rather have many Hypocrites ſpared, than one Ear of Wheat pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, <hi>Mat. 13. 29.</hi> That Power therefore in the Church which ſpares the Hypocrites (who can eaſily comply with an outward conformity in Worſhip, without feeling an inward life or vertue) but lights heavy on that which is tender and ſhie in matters of Worſhip, (knowing that it muſt give an account thereof to Chriſt) that is not the true Church-Power, but at beſt but a counterfeit of the true.</p>
