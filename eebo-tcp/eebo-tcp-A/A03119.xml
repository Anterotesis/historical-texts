            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

done. For this were <hi>Solem in crimen vocare, cum lippien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

and darkening <hi>Prometheus</hi> sparks, the little candle or

sometimes we will not see the trueth. Books and opinions are
<hi>Mentis pignora &amp; quasi liberi,</hi> as it were the begotten, and

by tradition, without any great examination, do labour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
them in their writings, by shew and colour of reason. But
I must needs confesse, I cannot but greatly wonder at the strange,
vncoth, and vnreasonable Paradox, broched of late in this city,
That the Plague is not contagious. This fantasticke conceit
bringeth to mind that of the Oratour: <hi>Nescio quomodo fiat,
vt nihil tam sit absurdum quod non dicatur &amp; defendatur
ab aliquo Philosophorum.</hi> I know not how it commeth to
passe, that nothing can be spoken so absurdly, which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by some of the Philosophers.</p>
            <p>If any one of our coat, should maintaine this monstrous and
pernitious heresie, the Tribe of Physicians would be so farre
from disputing the matter with him, as they would straight
send him that Anticeras to purge his braine with Hellebore.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Plague is thus defined by Physicions <hi>Pestis est mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
<pb facs="tcp:17177:3"/>
acutus contagiosus plurimos inter fiens &amp;c.</hi> The pest is
a sharpe contagious disease.<note place="margin">Fracast. lib. 2. cap. 3. de morb. contag. Gal. 1. de diff. feb. cap. 2.</note> So that you see the Plague is placed
by Physicians in that ranke of sharpe diseases, which are conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
To this iudgement of <hi>Aescalapius</hi> schoole, the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
Orators, Poets, and wise men of all ages haue subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
How often doth <hi>Tully</hi> call <hi>Cataline,</hi> and other such like
factious firebrands, <hi>Pestes patriae,</hi> the plagues of their country:
because as the plague spreadeth his poison vpon the bodies of
men: so they infected the mindes of such Citizens as conuersed
with them, with poisonfull and seditious thoughts and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>Shall the ich, scab, measels, small poxe &amp;c. be acknowledged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
catching and infectious, by the experience of euery silly woman;
and shall the plague be esteemed <hi>Animal mansuetum,</hi> an
harmelesse and innocent creature. But they easily reiect the
authorities and reasons of Physicians as Naturians, for so they
call them, and reason thus from the Scriptures. The plague
is called the sword, the hand, the arrow of God, therefore it
commeth not by Contagion, since neither an hand, a sword, or
arrow doth wound by contagion.</p>
            <p>The French disease is called by a great learned man, <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellum
diuinum scortatorum,</hi> Gods whippes sent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
to scourge whoore-masters. But if any man would heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
conclude that it were not contagious, common experience
would put out his Eies. Therefore these two will well concurre
together, that the <hi>Lues Gallica,</hi> is a punishment inflicted by
God vpon the filthy and beastly sinne of whooredome (which in
this age is counted but a sport) and may be truely called the
hand, the sword, the arrow of God smiting whoore-masters, and
that withall it is catching and infectious, as appeareth euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that it commeth not onely by vncleane company, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by the breath or contrectation of the tainted parties, and is
sucked in, from the brest of impure women, by poore infants,
and the nurses themselues giuing sucke to a childe whose pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
were polluted, are oft-times infected. The like may be
said of the Leprosie, which may be also called the hand and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb facs="tcp:17177:4"/>
of God, &amp; neuerthelesse is so infectious, that in all well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
common-wealths, the parties tainted therewith, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni
consortio excludantur,</hi> are commanded to dwell apart,
<hi>Non est malum in ciuitate, quod non faciat Dominus.</hi>
There is no euill in the city, which the Lord doth not. It is
therefore a fond conceit, to thinke that to euery particular man
a seuerall plague or arrow is sent, and not rather a generall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
whereby one infecteth another. But they argue further.</p>
            <p>That which God inflicteth vpon men by the ministerie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
is not to be reckoned among naturall effects: But the plague
&amp;c. <hi>Psal. 88. 1. Paral. 21. Ezech.</hi> 4. therefore it is not to be
reckoned among naturall effects, and by consequent the plague
is no naturall disease.</p>
            <p>If they will reason firmly, they must adde this word (immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately)
vnto the proposition. And then we will chalenge the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
as faulty and insufficient. It must be confessed that the
angels themselues are not to be reckoned among naturall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
But what shall let that, by the appointment of God, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
causes should be mooued, and actuated by the angels. Doe
not angels both good and badde mooue and stirre vp the will of
man, though the maner of their workings be secret, and to vs
vnknowen, if not incomprehensible? This is euident by the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of <hi>Achab,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid. hist. Achab, Iudae.</note> and <hi>Iudas.</hi> But who will deny that the will of
man is in the number of naturall causes, and principles. And
if the will of man may be inclined and disposed by angels, why
should we thinke that they haue nothing to doe with other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
causes. <hi>Moses</hi> by lifting vp his rod, brought armies of
flies and lice vpon Egypt, raised a terrible haile, smot the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
with malignant vlcers. This was an extraordinary mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of <hi>Moses,</hi> aswell as of the angels. But shall we therefore
thinke, that the lice and flies came not of putrefaction, the haile
of vapors concret sodenly in the aire, the vlcers by the rotting
of humors. Satan hauing a commission signed from God, by a
mightie tempest of winde blew vp the roofe where <hi>Iobs</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were. Doth it therefore follow that he vsed no naturall
causes, or is not rather euident that those Princes of the aire, do
<pb facs="tcp:17177:4"/>
in a moment stirre vp those naturall impressions? The diuell
casteth the saints into prison, 2. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 10. But by Tyrants
and enemies of the church. In the 6. chap. The pale horse, on
whom death sitteth as the horseman, receiueth power to kill,
by sword, famine, wilde beasts. Why shall we suppose that he
vsed not naturall matter in bringing the plague and famine, as
well as in sending wilde beasts or the sword, which are naturall
instruments. Afterward in the 4. chap. The angels haue
charge to restraine the foure windes that they hurt not the
earth or sea. Whereupon it followeth that vpon the Lords
command they are likewise turned loose, and bring with them
diuers affections and mutations of the aire, and especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
seminaries. It is apparant that the diuell (who being a
spirit, and of long continuance and experience, must needs be a

diuers strong and vnknowne poysons: whereby those wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
creatures worke much mischiefe. Againe, if no naturall
causes did concurre in the pest, then could no naturall remedies
ease it, much lesse cure it. But experience leadeth vs that both
these are vntrue. We deny not but that the angels are vsed
as instruments &amp; ministers to inflict this iudgement and plague
of the plague for the sinnes of men, neither that this disease
hath in it <hi>Diuinum quid,</hi> a secret and hidden nature, so that
we may iustly with the inchanters of Egypt acknowledge it the
finger of God, yet we thinke it as absurd to affirme that there
commeth no plague, but by the stroke and ministery of angels,
as if a man should contend, that there was neuer any haile, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
thunder, proceeding from naturall causes, because we
read, that great hailes, stormes and windes haue beene raised
by the ministery of angels. Historians report, that an old
arke or monument being opened in Babylon, there exhaled out
of it, so pernitious and infectious a spirit or breath, that propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
the plague euen to the remote Parthians. And in the
time of <hi>Marcus</hi> the Emperour, the souldiers of <hi>Auidius
Cassius,</hi> digging into an ancient sepulchre in hope of golde,
which had not beene touched for many hundred yeeres, there
<pb facs="tcp:17177:5"/>
followed instantly a huge and fearefull mortalitie. <hi>Iulius Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequeus</hi>
reporteth, that <hi>Aetna</hi> casting smoke and fire in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
did exanimate and kill the fishes of the sea adioyning,
which the Liparenses certaine Ilanders feeding vpon greedily,
brought a greeuous pestilence among them. <hi>Orosius, Eutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,

men, 10. onely suruiued.</p>
            <p>This may be sufficient to shew that the plague is not alwaies
the immediat stroke of angels. <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth, that vpon a
dearth in his time, wherein the poorer sort of people were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to feed vpon roots, acornes, with other more vnhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and corrupted aliments, there insued a great mortalitie.
The vlcers &amp; botches which are thrust out by nature, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturall
heat, the drought, the restlesnesse, with many other
symptomes and accidents of feuers, doe proclaime this affliction
a naturall maladie. It hath beene obserued in this last morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
among vs (the wounds whereof are yet fresh and bleeding)
that women haue passed thorow the pikes more easily &amp; happily
than men. So that this hath bene called The womens yere; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is thought that for one woman, 6. or 10. men haue died.
We must not therefore thinke,<note place="margin">The like may be said of children who haue died in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being weak and not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the disease.</note> that either the Angell is partial
in sparing them, or their sins lesse hainous or notorious than the
sinnes of men. The reason hereof (as Physicians haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
is because they haue beene more tractable and easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to keepe themselues warme, to keepe house and bed:
and by these meanes (their bodies being likewise more soft, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and perspirable) haue spent by sweating and insensible
transpiration the venimous matter of the Plague; giuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
more speedy passage to that enemy of life, from the heart and
other noble parts: Whereas men for the most part being ill
house-doues, accustomed to stirring and motion, haue beene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vnruly and inobsequent to the counsell of their Physicians,
<pb facs="tcp:17177:5"/>
and by exposing themselues to the aire, haue loked in that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
guest, to whom they should rather haue made a golden
bridge. It hath beene likewise obserued, that this Epidemicall
disease hath had as his beginning, so his increment, state, and
declination, and that it is now (for it walketh still amongst vs
in corners) nothing so acute, violent and peremptory for the
most part, neither so contagious and pernitious, as it was in the
State and Strength. Some haue had the plague twise or thrise
this yeere: but if it came only by the Angell, he might vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
say with him, Let me strike once, and I will not strike the
second time. Secession and departing the city hath beene que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse
a meane to preserue many; as appeareth euidently in
that a small handfull among those great numbers who haue
stepped aside, haue fallen by this sicknesse in the Countrey, and
those carrying with them from hence the seminaries thereof, in
comparison of those huge multitudes which haue died in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And could not the Angell haue found them out, as well in
the Countreys as in <hi>London?</hi> Againe, diuers families vpon
their returne, being safe in the Countrey, haue beene presently
visited, &amp; emptied. Shall we imagine that the punishing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
stayed their retiring, and had no commission to deale with
them out of the City? and not rather thinke, that the aire of the
City being tainted, &amp; their bodies disposed to receiue infection,
this euill hath seized vpon them? If we looke into the city, we
shall finde that in Cheap-side and other open and large streets,<note place="margin">Remember the hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable crie in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues parish in South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke.</note>
and in faire, roomy, and spacious houses the Pest hath not set
in such sure footing, nor made such hauocke, as in narrow lanes,
allies, and other pestered and noisome corners, where families of
poore people are thronged together, as men vse to packe wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacks
one vpon another, so that one of them can scarse breathe
beside his fellowes face. Shall we imagine, that faire and ample
streets, that sweet and goodly houses are priuiledged from the
stroke of the Angell, or from the arrowes of the Almighty, more
than poore and smoakie Cottages? Are not such places as full
fraught and replenished with sinnes of all sorts crying to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
for vengeance, as those low and base Cabbins of simple and
<pb facs="tcp:17177:6"/>
miserable creatures? I am not ignorant how ignorant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
men argue (as they suppose) strongly against all these
things. If the Plague proceed from naturall causes, or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the aire, then all persons without exception, who liue and
and breathe in the corrupted aire, must needs be poisoned and
infected: which all men know to be vntrue. But Reason it selfe
will easily teach vs the inconsequence of this argument: for who
knoweth not, that one and the same cause doth not alwayes
worke alike, and that effects are varied according to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and diuersity of the suffering matters and obiects. The same
Sunne hardeneth the clay, and mollifieth the waxe: one and
the same Northern winde doth not pinch and pierce all bodies
with the like coldnesse. If we should grant that all mens bodies
were alike disposed to receiue the infected aire (which is most
false) yet there may be many causes why the like effect should
not follow in them all. As (to make it plaine) because one man
hath carefully vsed some soueraigne and apposit Preseruatiue,
another hath neglected or contemned all such courses; and as
bolde and blinde bayard rushed vpon all dangers: another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little touched or tainted, hath straightway sent for, or
consulted with a learned Physician, and taken a conuenient and
rationall medicine: another either scorneth and refuseth Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
and Physicke, or els sendeth to the Physician, when the
bell is ready to toll for him, and when the steed is stollen begins
to shut the stable doore.</p>
            <p>But beside and aboue all this, we must know that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
hath an ouerruling hand, whereby he doth guide and
direct naturall causes and effects, and heereupon it commeth to
passe, that Contagion though neuer so strong, cannot seaze on
all though neuer so much disposed and exposed thereunto. All
men are not poysoned that drinke poyson;<note place="margin">Psal. 91.</note> nor all killed with the
sword or shot, that goe to warre.<note place="margin">Marc. 18.</note> And yet poyson is lethall, and
the sword deuoureth as well one as another. Therefore to argue
that diuers Physicians, Nurs-keepers and Surgeons, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
about sicke persons, are not tainted at all, therefore there
is no contagion in the Pest, is all one as if a man should reason
<pb facs="tcp:17177:6"/>
thus, that the poyson of the viper were not deadly, because the
Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> being bitten by a viper, had no harme, or that
the sword is no deuourer,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 5.</note> because <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> being strongly
belaid, and crying to the Lord, was deliuered and passed with
his life. I haue cursorily runne ouer these things, because the
argument hath beene more largely handled of late by a iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Diuine, and the opinion hath beene since that time some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
minsed, and qualified; how substantially and clarke-like
I will not now stand to discusse. Onely I thought meet (because
this conceit is not onely erroneous, but dangerous and perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the weale-publicke, and being too grossely broched at the
first, hath left a deepe impression in the mindes of the vulgar
sort, who are as the Oratour saith, <hi>Pluma ipsa leuiores,</hi> as
light as feathers, tossed to and fro with euery blast of vaine,
ann idle heads, briefly to touch it by the way, <hi>Tanquam aliud
agens.</hi> It remaineth, that acknowledging the pests, contagion,
we notwithstanding (who are Christians) carefully auoid that
faithlesse and Paganish fearefulnesse, whereby we are made
to breake all the bonds of Religion, Consanguinitie, Alliance,
friendship and pollicie: the husband forsaking and abandoning
his deare wife, the parents leauing their children to sinke or
swimme, the Pastor exposing his flocke to euery deuouring
woolfe, and the Magistrate his people vnder his charge to all
confusion and disorder. We are apt to rush into extremities.
This were <hi>Incidere in Scyllam,</hi> whilest we would <hi>Charib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim
vitare,</hi> to auoid one euill, and commit as great, or greater
mischiefe. As he is to be esteemed a good subiect and citizen,
who though he will not intrude into euery fray made by despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Ruffians, with whom he hath nothing to doe, least he catch
a broken pate, or woorse turne, yet will boldly enter the battell
against the enimie of his Countrey when he is thereto called by
his Prince, though with euident hazard of his life: so he is to
be reputed a grounded &amp; discrete Christian, who as he will not
rush rashly into euery infected and visited house without iust
cause, warrant or calling, so when he is called, or tied by any
bond of Piety, Nature, or Policy, he will not forsake his station,
<pb facs="tcp:17177:7"/>
or detract and forslow any duty or office, though the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
thereof be with euident danger of health, goods or life it
selfe. For in these cases we may confidently expect a protection
from Heauen, and say with <hi>Hester,</hi> If I die, I die. If we fall,
we shall fall in, and not out of our way, wherein the Lord of
heauen guide vs by his good spirit of wisedome, till we come to
the end thereof, which is the saluation of our Souls.</p>
            <p>Now to returne to our Amulets, from whom by occasion we
haue made ouerlong a digression: as I gaue at the first a briefe
aduertisement concerning them, without any euill intention to
wound any particular man in his credit, (no not if I had beene
able, as I am not) so I haue reioyned not in any contentious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
but in a desire to be satisfied if I erre, and reformed in
my iudgement. I must needs acknowledge, that considering the
obiect of my Profession, which is that short Epitome of the
grand world, that wonder and Miracle of Nature, that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the holy Ghost, that Lord of the inferiour creatures,
Man, I haue bene very scrupulous (if not superstitious in) vsing
any doubtfull, suspitious, or dangerous Medicine whereof
I haue not beene well and thoroughly perswaded. If any sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

that it is made no base dredge, but a noble, catholike, &amp;
diuine Medicine, by the Authors and commenders thereof. He
may likewise call to minde, that the most precious Balmes, and
soueraigne Antidots, &amp; (which is more, Physicke herselfe, that
noble science, is esteemed no better by many than a meere tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle.
Besides this, if the greatest, learnedest, and complet
Prince of Europe, haue vouchsafed of late to stoope so low as
to take vp (though to throw away againe) that base, strange,
ill-sauouring weede, or rather intoxicating poison <hi>Tobacco,</hi>

he may seeme to haue beene brought vp all his life, at the feet of
<hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and not exercised from his birth, in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment

for me, who am <hi>infimus è plebe,</hi> to spend some

if I haue failed, and slipped now and then, (as I feare I haue too

I set foorth of late a

or Plague-cakes (as they are called) moued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
as by many other reasons, so especially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I greatly feared, that through an vnsound
and idle persuasion of their force, other more rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
and effectuall remedies were neglected. An
ancient and graue Physician, whom I reuerence for
diuers good respects, hath stood vp, and pleaded
their cause. I amno Pythagorean; <hi>Nullius addictus

my iudgement vpon any mans sleeue, be he neuer
so graue and learned, vnlesse I be drawen by good
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17177:9"/>
and sound reason. <hi>Humanum est errare.</hi> Therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
yet vnsatisfied, I haue thought good, not
in any contentious humor, but in desire the trueth
may be sifted out, and my selfe resolued and better
instructed (if I erre) to consider of them somewhat
more largely; That if they be found so noble and
Catholike a Medicine as some esteeme them, they
may be still retained, and imbraced in our bosoms;
and if vpon examination they prooue suspicious,
dangerous and hurtfull, they may be cashered and
abandoned. First therefore, because Opinion and
Name preuaile much to forestall the Market, and
wholly possesse mens mindes with preiudice, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no one roome for reason, I will be silent a
while, and you shall heare one of the most learned,
wise, and famous Physicians of <hi>Europe</hi> (I meane <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratius
Augenius</hi>) very learnedly, ingenuously, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially,
grauely and honestly (after his maner) vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
his mind of this point in Question. Whom
I produce the rather, because it is intimated, that
Italian Physicians (which Countrey without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
breedeth many excellent men in that faculty)
haue these Amulets in high and rare estimation.
Heare therefore what <hi>Augenius</hi> without exception
one of the greatest Masters in Physicke that <hi>Italie</hi>
nourisheth at this day (if he be yet aliue) speaketh
to this purpose <hi>Lib. 3. de Peste cap. 27. De sublimato,
Arsenico Cristallino, &amp; Puluere Bufonis.</hi> I haue read in
the writings of some Empericks, that the powder
of a Toad, Arsenicke, or Sublimat, if they be
worne vpon the region of the heart, so as they
touch the skin, do maruellously preserue men from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17177:9"/>
the Plague. And they esteeme this as a great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret;
and as I vnderstand haue drawen some rich
persons to be of their opinion. I who do not easily
beleeue euery thing which I reade or heare, doe
greatly doubt of the force and nature of those poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and do assuredly persuade my selfe, that they
can neuer produce any such effect. And that I may
lay open my opinion, we must know that Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(especially in such kinds) is perillous: for since
the action of the Physician is performed vpon so
noble a Subiect as the body of Man, the nature and
force of euery vnknowen medicine is with great
iudgement to be examined &amp; searched out: and the
Rule of Examination is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider whether Reason
approue and persuade it, or disclaime and reiect it.
If Reason allow and persuade it, thou maiest boldly
vse it without scruple; but if Reason gainsay it, no
medicine is to be vsed, vnlesse thou be assured of
the operation thereof, by the long experience of
men of singular iudgement. I say long experience;
for we must not trust one, two, or three experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
but very many are to be diligently conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and wisely gathered, that the right habit of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
may be attained, which may deserue the
commendation of all men, because it is one of the
instruments (as we haue sayd elsewhere) by whose
meanes and helpe, Remedies are inuented. We
must likewise marke well, that our experience take
her originall from a man worthy to be credited, of
great iudgement, wise, knowing well how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
from what cause the successe proceedeth,
whether from the medicine, the temperament of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17177:10"/>
the body, the time of the yeere, chance, or other
infinite respects. It falleth out dayly, that we see
many effects, which haue a farre different cause
from that the common people dreame of. Now to
applie those things that haue beene spoken, to our
purpose, I affirme confidently, that such a medicine
of poisons applied outwardly to the body, hath no
manifest, probable or demonstratiue reason, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may be persuaded that they haue so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
efficacie against the Plague. They will say,
that by similitude of substance there is attraction of
the venim from the heart, to the outward part, by
the attractiue vertue of the poison. But this can not
so much profit, as euidently hurt. Let vs grant, that
the venimous facultie of the poison penetrateth to
the heart, I pray you what effect will it produce
there? It can not draw the venom to it: for there is
none, because he whom we will preserue is yet
sound. If therefore, the heart be disposed to receiue
the venimous infection of the aire, what shall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the force of the outward poison, that it may not
infect the heart and other principall parts, and if it
be once entred into the heart, what shall let the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution
of it by the Arteries into all the bodie?
O great miracle, and neuer yet heard of, that a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
facultie should flow into the heart, wander
thorow the Arteries, &amp; not finding his looked for
friend, should go out againe without any offence
offered to the parts whereby he passed. Besides, if
the attractiue facultie be inuenimed, what reason
can be giuen, the heart should not be continually
offended by the poison thereof. It is euident, thar
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17177:10"/>
the heart is the principall obiect of poisons: how
then shall it be touched by a venimous qualitie, and
not endure wrong? Touching their experience, I
cannot yet giue credit to it. I desire to see these
things often tried, with good successe, to haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
testimonies of Physicians of great iudgement,
before I can beleeue them. But let vs come to those
that are infected, and haue the poison actually sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
on their heart. It may be they may doe them
good. None at all. For attraction proceedeth
from the stronger power, which draweth to it that
which is weaker. Let then some man tell me how
he can be sure, that the poison of the Plague shall
not draw to it the venim of the outward medecine;
and why the poison thereof may not be stronger
and greater than the other. Besides, the matter of
the Plague is not properly poison but by similitude,
and therefore cannot be drawen by another poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
But me thinke I heare one answer to all my
arguments, that the effect is performed, though the
cause be vnknowen because it is secret. This is the
miserable refuge of al empericks, wherby they may
easily wind out of any doubt, and absolue the most
intricate Question of our Art without much adoe.
But I abhorre this from my heart; not because I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
no secret causes, which I grant, but because I
thinke it a notorious fault, redounding greatly to
the reproch of our Art, if we run still to hidden cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
when manifest reason may easily end the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie.
How will they demonstrate that poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
haue this effect? By experience. But what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
can they shew worthy to receiue this cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17177:11"/>
And where are the Physicians of note and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which approue them? You haue heard my
opinion, reseruing to others their better iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now that I haue stayed your stomacks with this
honest, graue, and iudiciall speech of Father <hi>Auge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
that great and learned Italian Physician, who
(if I be thought too light) may well weigh in the
ballance with any one man whosoeuer he be, giue
me leaue briefly to examine the reasons that are
produced to proue, that these Amulets do no hurt:
secondly, that they do good.</p>
            <p>The first Argument, if it be not altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
must thus be reduced to forme:</p>
            <p>There is vse of poisons in Physicke: therefore
impoisoned Amulets of Arsenicke or such
like, may be safely vsed by men in health, to
preserue them from the Plague without hurt.</p>
            <p>The proposition is somewhat largely stood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was neuer to my knowledge called into
question by any man of iudgement, and the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
which should haue beene proued, left alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vntouched.</p>
            <p>Physicke consisteth of diuers parts. That may be
of vse in the Hygieine the preseruing part, which
hath no place in the Therapeuticall. And there be
many things of speciall vertue in the Therapeutice,
which if a man should practise vpon sound bodies
to preserue their health, he might well be sent to
<hi>Anticyrae</hi> to purge with Hellebore his vnsound
braine. A sturdie horse requires a rough rider. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro

them in health. There is therefore vtterly no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
in this, that because there may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in some diseases vse of Deleteries in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapentice,
therefore they may be safely vsed as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiues
to maintaine health. For in such cases
they are opposed against the disease to fight with it
as an Enemy, and so by their colluctation Nature
sometime saueth herselfe, as when by the fighting
of two dogges, a Man sometime escapeth without
hurt or wound.</p>
            <p>In the Curatime part of Physicke, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
vse of the Saw, and of both potentiall and
actuall fire. <hi>Secamus, vrimus.</hi> And yet by your
leaue a Man in health will hardly be persuaded to
such Preseruatiues.</p>
            <p>Before I leaue this argument, I will by your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
point at some defects in the proofe of the
proposition. Arsenicke, Orpiment, Toads and
Adders, are acknowledged ranke and deadly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the highest degree. This is true concerning
the Minerals which consist of similar parts. But
touching Toads and Adders, it cannot be verified,
that they be absolutely and generally poisons. For
these haue their venome, <hi>Incertis, &amp; determinatis
Partibus:</hi> in certaine and determinate parts, not vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally
diffused thorow the whole bodie. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17177:12"/>
Adders or Vipers it is euident that their Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
lodgeth onely in the head, (specially the teeth
and taile. Their flesh (which onely is receiued) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that noble Medicine (which thereof hath his
name, and is called Triacle) is so farre from being a
poison, that it is a present Antidote against the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the other parts. And this will not seeme
strange if we dare credit <hi>Iacobus Ferrarius,</hi> a learned
Physician of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who in his booke <hi>De Theria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
lately set foorth, reporteth that he hath seene
mens hands besprinkled with the blood of Vipers,
without any farther offence than a little itching for
a short time. And I haue beene informed by men
yet liuing in our owne Country, that they haue
seene of our adders after their teeth haue beene pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out, handled in mens hands, and caried in their
bare bosoms familiarly without hurt. The like is to
be verified of the Scorpion, who carieth his venom
in his taile. And therefore when they would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch
themselues, they turne vp their taile toward
their backe, and there shooting their stings kill
themselues. And this they doe when they are so
pursued as they see no way to escape, making by
that meanes a speedy riddance of themselues. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could they die so speedily of so small wound, if
the instrument inflicting the same were not vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
since they will endure farre greater wounds,
without danger of life. Therefore it is euident, that
there is in the taile of the Scorpion a poison contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the life and temperament of the Scorpion.
The poison of the Spanish flies called <hi>Cantharides,</hi>
is esteemed to reside in the head, wings, and legs,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17177:12"/>
and the body very medicinable. So the poison of
a madde dogge lodgeth onely in his fome. The
poison of Asps in their egges: of the Leopard in
the gall or choler onely: of the venemous Mouse
in the vrine: the Tortoise in the outward skinne.
But to returne to Adders or Vipers, incomparable,
<hi>Galen</hi> in his 11. booke of the faculty of simple me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
and in his booke <hi>De opt. Secta cap.</hi> 12. telleth
of certaine persons who being desperately disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
by the vse of wine, whereinto whole adders
had by chance fallen, not onely receaued no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of hurt, but happily thereby recouered their
health. There is therefore so great vertue in the
flesh of vipers to resist malignity, that the venome
of the externall parts seemeth by the force thereof
altogether drowned and subdued. It followeth not
therefore, because there is poison in the viper, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his whole subiect is a strong poison. For so a
man might conclude, that the whole body of some
men is poison, because there is in their spettle and
teeth a venemous quality, as I my selfe with others
haue seene euidently by a man in <hi>London,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bitten by another lightly in the hand, was so
impoisoned, that the whole hand rotted, and the
party thereof shortly died. I maruell therefore that
a man of note for experience &amp; iudgement, would
open such a gappe to the vulgar sort, to loath and
contemne Physicke and Physicians, (whereunto
they are prone inough of themselues) as to affirme
that one of their most noble and famous medicines
hath a strong poison, his Basis and principall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient.
<hi>Galen</hi> in his booke <hi>De Ther. ad Pis.</hi> saith,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17177:13"/>
that the fat of the Crocodill laid vpon the wound,
helpeth those that are bitten by the Crocodill.
The biting of the venemous Mouse, is healed by
the Mouse brused, and laid vpon the place. After
the same maner, they that are smitten by the Viper,
are helped if you bruise the Viper and apply her to
the wound. The body of the Scorpion laide vpon
the part, healeth hir poison. <hi>Dioscor. lib. 6. cap. 44.
E alia quam plurima animalia sua curant maleficia.</hi>
Yet the fatte of the Crocodill, the body of the
Scorpion, or venemous Mouse, are not receaued
into the composition of the Treacle, but doe onely
helpe their owne poisons. We must therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
that nature hath not onely giuen venemous
parts to these creatures, but others which are alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eterys
to their owne poison. <hi>Secus (ait quidam) omnia
illa, ad vnum maleficium edidisset, ac de venenis sollicita,
remediorum fuisset oblita</hi> Otherwise she should haue
framed them wholy to euill and hurt, and being
carefull of poisons, should haue beene forgetfull of
remedies. <hi>Natura autem vt in superfluis non abundat,
sic non deficit in necessarijs.</hi> Nature as she abounds
not in superfluities, so she is not defectiue in neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.
Now these alexetery parts (as I may call
them) are of two sorts: Some haue an ingenit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
of curing their owne poisons, without admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of other things, as the fatte of the Crocodill
and the Scorpion whereof our Marchants that
trauell to <hi>Constantinople</hi> haue good experience.
Other haue an ingenit and mixed faculty, as the
body of the Viper, which without other alexeterys
being laid on the wound, cureth hir owne poison:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17177:13"/>
and with commistion of other Antidots, extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
in a maner all poisons: <hi>Galen</hi> explicateth this
twofold faculty, <hi>Lib. de Ther. ad Pis. cap.</hi> 4. where
hauing said that the head and taile of the Vipers
are to be cut off, he addeth: And maruell not that
these parts being taken away, the rest of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
doe make the Antidot more effectuall, by the
ingenit and admixed faculty of helping, which is
in their flesh. After he calleth their faculty ingenit,
and admixed: For as by their ingenit faculty they
cure their owne poison, so by their admixed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
<hi>Potentissimum efficiunt Alexipharmacum.</hi> He
that would be farther satisfied, let him peruse the
booke of <hi>Galen,</hi> and he shall not thinke his labour
lost. Your sweet kernels in bitter shels, precious
Diamonds in course stones, and Pearles in base
oysters, might serue well to illustrate this which
hath beene already prooued, that there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
liuing Creatures which haue some parts very
hurtfull, or of no or little vse, and others very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
and beneficiall to the life and health of
mankind: but maketh nothing at all for your Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke,
who is a minerall and consisteth of similar
parts. The sweet kernell is of a different tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the bitter shell, the precious Diamond of
a more excellent substance then the course stone,
or Oyster wherein he is found. The flesh or sides
of Vipers is of a differing temperament from the
teeth and head, wherein onely resideth the poison.
But in your Arsenicke you can shew me no part, be
it neuer so small, which is not Arsenicke, and that
is a strong and ranke Poison, you may seeke a good
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17177:14"/>
while heere, before you finde either Kernell, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond or
Pearle. This is no newes to them who
haue any the least insight in Philosophy: who know
right well that in the body of man, there be Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
parts much differing in temperament and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and that euery least parcell or portion of a
similar part is of the same nature and substance.
Your cures wrought by the fume of Orpmint and
outward applying of Arsenicke, make nothing to
our purpose: for it hath beene shewed, that there is
vse of many things in the healing part of Physicke,
which haue no place in the preseruing part. And
yet Doctors will perhaps make doubt of them, and
be twise well aduised before they draw them into
practise in hope to worke such miracles as is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them. It is well knowen that your dried
Toad hath failed in that maruellous effect attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him.</p>
            <p>But of all other the words following sound very
strangely and harsh in my eares. <hi>I know not how
they can be perpetually opposite to mans nature, nay if
that be a true and sufficient definition of poison. At no
time to agree with nature, I see not how these things
may simply be called poisons, that at sometimes and in
some cases agree with nature aswell as a man would wish.</hi>
Here is strange doctrine and new learning indeed,
for our Philosophers and Physicians. You see not
how Arsenicke and such like poisons can be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
opposite to nature. Then giue me leaue since
I learned Logicke since your time, to shew how I
haue conceiued of these matters. The very name of
poison or venom implieth (in my conceit) an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17177:14"/>
contrariety and hostility vnto Nature. And
Warre is not more aduerse &amp; contrary to Peace,
vertue to vice, blacke to white, then poison is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
perpetually &amp; irreconcilably opposed vnto
nature. This wil more cleerly appeere if we peruse
the definitions of poisons set downe by the best &amp;
most acute and sound Philosophers &amp; Physicians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercurialis</hi> in his first booke of Poisons, <hi>cap.</hi> 5.
following <hi>Gallen</hi> and other Philosophers, defineth
poison according to the common notion and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of men, to be such a thing as killeth
men and beasts irrecouerably, the cause being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen.
<hi>Auicen</hi> (not so properly) calleth it a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine
contrary to mans nature. <hi>Galen lib. 3. de
Temp.</hi> calleth that an Aliment which is subdued
by Nature, and that Poison which subdueth and
vanquisheth Nature. Himselfe defineth it thus:
Poison is a mixed substance, enemy to the heart,
and corrupter of humane nature. <hi>Fernelius</hi> the
French <hi>Galen lib. de Abt. Rer. Caus.</hi> defineth poison
to be, not that which alwayes killeth or opposeth
the heart the fountaine of life, but whatsoeuer by
his whole substance and secret force doth either
extinguish or notably offend the substance of the
faculties or their functions.</p>
            <p>Physicians consider and contemplat a threefold
difference of Subiects in their reference and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to humane Nature: The first sort are called Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the second Medicaments, the third and last
Deleteries or Poisons. Aliments all are such things
as haue a substance like and familiar vnto ours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a certaine benigne and wholsome heat and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17177:15"/>
spirit, whereby the heat and spirits of our bodies
are cherished and supported, and a matter passing
by alteration into the matter of our bodies nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
and increasing the substance of them. Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
are such as in their whole substance, directly
and as it were <hi>ex Diametro,</hi> are opposed to Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For as they are in a neere familiaritie and
affinitie leagued and linked to our Nature; so these
are altogether enemies and pernitious vnto her,
which being vsed do not onely affect vs with their
first and second qualities, but in their whole kinde
do corrupt whatsoeuer they touch in our bodies,
and putrifying the substance thereof, turne it into
their owne kinde and Similitude. Therefore Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Deleteries are in their whole kinde and
substance extremely contrary one to the other. In
the middle ranke betwixt these two extremes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Medicines haue their place; which neither as
nutriments may be conuerted into our substance,
neither as Deleteries altogether corrupt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the same. These doe partly agree and partly
disagree with Nature, so as they neither ouercome
her nor can be ouercome by her. Therefore Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thrusteth them out of doores as seditious and
turbulent guests, suffering them onely to carry
with them bagge and baggage, I meane that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
which she may well spare, and hath most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
and affinitie with them. Now if Poison
be contrary to Nature, if it subdue and ouercome
Nature, if it be an enemy to the heart, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter
of Nature, if it be in his whole kind and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
opposed to Aliments, Natures food, as <hi>Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17177:15"/>
Galen Mercurial,</hi> and <hi>Fernelius,</hi> the Lights and
fathers of Physicke and Philosophy haue determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
I hope we shall salue <hi>Galens</hi> credit wel enough:
and <hi>Galens</hi> description of Poison will stand as true
and sufficient, That Poison is that which at no time
agreeth with Nature. How then shall we answer
this argument? If it it be a true definition of Poison
at no time to agree with nature, then you must put
out Arsenicke, Orpmint with others mo out of the
cense and order of Poisons, which sometimes and
in some cases agree with Nature as well as a man
would wish. How is this proued? Thus. <hi>All those
things which do cure any Disease, agree with Nature as
well as a man would wish. Arsenicke, Orpmint doe cure
some Diseases, as Vlcers and such like; therefore they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with Nature as well as may be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The lame legge of the proposition hath beene in
some sort already pointed at, and the extreme lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and halting thereof will easily appeare to him
that hath but halfe an eye in Philosophy or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
at the first glimpse. For many Philosophers
hold it as a Principle (though not so soundly) that
all Medicaments or Curers do <hi>Vim aliquam inferre
Naturae.</hi> They that are more sound and iudiciall
make three Orders &amp; Ranks of Medecines, which
(though some apply to purgers) may be verified of
all in generall. The first Order is of those which
they call Benigne and blessed medicines, because
they are very familiar and friendly to Nature, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
their operation without any the least of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of her. Others are called Indifferent or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
because they worke though somewhat
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17177:16"/>
more strongly, yet without offering any singular or
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> notable wrong vnto Nature. The third and last,
are termed Violent, churlish or rough-hewen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they in their operation doe forcibly vellicat,
offend and violat her.</p>
            <p>Now if you will haue Arsenicke a Medicament,
you must needs set him in one of these three ranks.
In the first or second I am well assured you will not
place him. It remaineth then that he must be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the last band of sturdy and boisterous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
who are ywis no great friends vnto Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
In this order are Scammony, Hellebore, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbium,
who though they haue their vse, and
the woorst of them be more tollerable then Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke,
yet was it neuer (as I suppose) pronounced of
them by any man of iudgement, that <hi>They agree
with nature as well as a man would wish.</hi> The saw, the
burning iron or actuall causticke do cure some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
yet how abhorrent these things are to nature,
all men doe know. We must not thinke that all
those things who by vanquishing and subduing
their enemie the disease, doe giue reliefe and ease to
nature, are therefore in themselues and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
essence agreeable and friendly vnto Nature.
Ellebor, Scammony &amp;c. (of whom before) who in
their owne essence being hot and fiery, are apt to
inflame the body, and to kindle a fire or feuer where
none was before, yet in a body stuffed with choler,
melancholy, and such ill humors, doe by carying
away with them the fuell which gaue nourishment
to the fire, do by accident relieue nature, put out
the fire, and cure the disease. Two or three Flemish
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17177:16"/>
draughts of cold water haue somtimes cured a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
feauer, by quenching the flame: And yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
the Grammarian was killed by <hi>Thessalus</hi> by
one onely draught: and cold water agreeth so well
with most mens Natures, that they had rather
powre it into their shooes then their stomacks.</p>
            <p>In the next place we are instructed how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
or cure the blisterings and vlcerations procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by these plague cakes. This is all one as if a
man should first breake his fellowes head, and then
giue him a plaister. Onely one means is mentioned
to preuent this inconuenience, which is, the taking
away of the cakes, or rather (as I would counsell)
the vtter reiecting thereof, which I cannot mislike.
Otherwise your lapping of him in thicker stuffe,
your putting linnen betwixt him &amp; the brest, your
annointing the place with oile, as they giue more
than suspition of his churlish and malignant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
aduerse and pernitious vnto nature, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be in best case when he is farthest from
her, and to delight nothing in his neighbourhood,
so they will be found poore helpes, and weake
meanes to encounter his strong poison, and maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</p>
            <p>As for the question which is moued; <hi>Whether to
haue such things appeare, be not rather a benefit than
an harme.</hi> I take it to be out of all question, that to
raise blisters and vlcerations, in so noble a place, so
neere to the heart the fountaine of life, by so vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
a subiect as Arsenicke, cannot be any way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall,
but euery way offensiue and noisome. For
first what learned Physician hath euer counselled
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17177:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Vesicatorys to be applied in that Region so neere
vnto the most principall Part. Next, what reason is
there of any such Euacuation, when we labour to
preserue them that are sound. And if they be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with any venemous matter, how shall we be
perswaded that Arsenicke will by blisters expell the
same, and not rather ioine hand in hand with it to
ouerthrow Nature, hauing by them entrance and
accesse: especially if we consider the old Maxime,
<hi>Simile simili additum fit magis simile.</hi> Besides the best
learned who haue receiued these Amulets, hold
that Arsenick by a similitude of substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth draw
the poison of the plague vnto it selfe, and not expell
it, which must be done by an Antipathy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety:
for that Arsenicke should strengthen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and helpe her to expell it, since it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
and deadly enemy to Nature, is improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
if not insensible.</p>
            <p>As no man doth affirme that all blisteres are poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
because of that effect, and therefore you might
haue spared labour in proouing that which is not
denied, so it is euident that diuers poisons doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that effect, and therefore are the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
applied neere any principall part, because
heereby they doe open as it were a doore or win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
to conuey into the body their infecting noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
spirits. The cause why Garlicke &amp; Mustarddo
blister the outward skinne, and yet taken inwardly,
haue no such operation, is (as I suppose) because
their heat is an agent being applied to the outmost
skinne, which is a cold and membranous part, and
so hauing no resistance doth rarifie and dissolue his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17177:17"/>
continuity. But taken inwardly, they are Patients,
the inward heat subduing them, and scattering
their spirits, so as they can not vnite to performe
that action. But Arsenicke is of a farre other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whose pestilent heat will not be commanded
by Nature, whether he be outwardly or inwardly
vsed, but doth subdue and extinguish naturall heat.
And this I take (vnder correction) to be the soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this your Proplem.</p>
            <p>Whereas in the words following you affirme
that it is manifest both by Experience and Reason,
that things outwardly applied, haue action, and
work into the Body by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating their spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
qualities, to the Spirits of our Bodies, by meanes
of the warmth that openeth our Pores, and ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the subtill parts of the medicine, is the cause of
a reciprocall action and passion; and hereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
that it may seeme strange that Arsenicke and
such like strong Poisons, hauing so strong poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirits, should not poison our Spirits whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they meet, you acknowledge that these are
strange works and woonders in Nature: First, that
such poisonfull spirits should mingle with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and not offend them: Secondly, that they
should strengthen them &amp; helpe them to expell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
These indeed are strange effects, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we be readier to wonder at them than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hastily, I hope you will pardon vs. But let
vs heare how you satisfie vs, &amp; vnlose this Gordian
knot. First therefore, you set downe this Maxime
or Principle: <hi>Arsenicke and Orpmint are no wayes
poisonfull or hurtfull to Nature, but by their corrosiuenes,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17177:18"/>
or fretting qualities: otherwise, they are as good both
Preseruatiues and Curers, as any other most in vse: and
therefore so long as they are kept from corroding or fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
they can do no harme, but may do much good in that
kinde which they do respect: that is to say, in all Arseni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Diseases, as the Plague, the Plurisie, Noli me tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,
Cankers, and Fistulas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Arsenicke be a strong Poison (as you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
and Poisons be (as hath beene shewed) <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Genere &amp; Substantia Naturae contraria.</hi> The
deadly Foes, and irreconcilable Enemies to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then your Principle and Ground must needs
shake, and will prooue no good Foundation to
build vpon, which maketh it onely hurtfull to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by his corrosiuenesse or fretting qualitie. If to
be offensiue to Nature by excesse in some qualitie
or other be sufficient to proue and make a Poison,
then are Scammony, Turbith, Colocynthis, &amp;c.
Poisons, and not Medicaments; for these all offend
Nature in qualitie. You must therefore either
make these Poisons with many moe, to consort
with Arsenicke: and then we shall haue good store
of Poisons. For all such things as are in the 4 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of cold or heat, must be put into this ranke; or
els bring backe Arsnicke from the cense of Poisons
into the Classe of Medicaments: for which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you will haue small warrant. These indeed by
reason of their excesse in qualitie, are sayd <hi>propè ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere

according to qualities, shall affect the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Body, but an Agent in the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

is manifest, that Arsenicke doth not onely worke
vpon the Qualities, but that he corrupteth the very
temperament and substance of the Body.</p>
            <p>If you meane by Arsenicall Diseases, such mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
whose Curer and specificall Antidot is Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke,
then are we beholding greatly to you, who
haue found out an appropriat Alexetery for the
Plague, whereunto the greatest and most profound
Philosophers and Physicians could neuer attaine.
For it is generally confessed by all, That the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
Antidot of the Pest is yet vnknowen. <hi>Thuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi>
sayth, That that Malady did <hi>Superare Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas
vires,</hi> or rather <hi>Humanam imbecilitatem.</hi> And
the learned Masters of our Profession with one
voice proclaime that forasmuch as the speciall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
to kill that Monster is not yet found out, we
must <hi>Pugnare contra illam Beluam communibus praesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dijs
&amp; remedijs aliorum Venenorum.</hi> But I rather sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you call those Diseases Arsenicall, because
they haue in them a malignant, poisonfull, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious
venim, resembling the poison of Arsenicke.
How then shall Arsenicke be their Curer, when all
Diseases are cured by their contraries? vnlesse you
will maintaine that dotage of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> (for so I
must needs call it) against <hi>Galen,</hi> That Diseases are
cured <hi>per similia,</hi> by their like. And then, if the Body
be emptie, exhaust and extenuat, we must exhaust
and emptie it more, and not restore and repaire it.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17177:19"/>
If it be too ful and plethoricke, we must fill it more,
and not euacuat, if it be stopped and obstructed,
then we must ramme and stuffe it vp more, and not
de obstruct and open: if it be too hoat, we must lay
on more wood, and not put out the Fire either by
taking away the fuell or quenching the flame. If
there be <hi>Solutio continui,</hi> we must not vnite, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne
the parts, <hi>&amp; sic in cateris.</hi> If I thought that
this vncouth and vnscholarlike Paradox would be
mainteined, it were easie for me to make the Point
as plaine as the Kings high-way. But I muse much
how the Plurisie commeth into the Tribe of these
Arsenicall Diseases, vnlesse you put an addition to
him, and call him a Pestilentiall Plurisie.</p>
            <p>The way whereby these Poisons are metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosed
into as good if not better Preseruatiues and
Curers as any most in vse, is to keepe them (as you
say) from fretting and corroding. And that this
may be done, you prooue by example of the
Quacksaluers in <hi>Germany,</hi> who first drinking sallet
oyle, and after taking great quantities of these poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
are preserued from harme and danger. That
Sallet oile, butter, or any other vnctuous things
are good against poisons, it will be readily granted.
But that they should be of such force and efficacy
as to secure a man that should take after them great
quantities of Arsenicke, you shall giue me leaue to
doubt. And I thinke I shal haue mo fellowes, then
there be Mountebanks in <hi>Germany,</hi> or Curtesans in
<hi>Venice.</hi> For why should we not thinke that there is
as much vertue in Treacle, Mithridate, and those
other Antidots which they take after those Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17177:19"/>
at the least, as in Sallet oile. And yet I hold
not them sufficient to match and master these Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Neither is it like that <hi>Mathiolus</hi> had any such
inward familiarity with Mountebanks,<note place="margin">Mathiolus telleth of another fraud or iug<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling tricke farre more probable. lib. 6. co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in Diosc. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat.</note> as that they
would acquant him with the secrets and mysteries
of their Art, which they conceale, <hi>Tanquam sacra
Eleusinia.</hi> But suppose he was tolde this by some
odde Quacksaluer or other, and that he was so cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
to beleeue it, shall we build the conclusions
of our Art vpon the credit of a iugling Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke,
or will any man be so madde that is <hi>compos
mentis,</hi> vpon the Mountebanks word to try the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
&amp; arming himselfe with a good draught
or two of Sallet oile, afterward deuour great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Arsenicke.</p>
            <p>That the corroding Qualitie of Arsenicke, may
be cleane taken away, you shall pardon me if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
not your Chynists, if they doe (as you say)
affirme it neuer so confidently. We haue an home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and true saying, The Diuell will be the Diuell
whether you bake roste, seeth, or broile him, or
howsoeuer you handle him. <hi>Naturam expellas &amp;c:</hi>
So Arsenicke so long as he remaineth Arsenicke,
(vnlesse you destroy his Nature, and then the case
is altered, He is no more He) will vndoubtedly
shew of what house he commeth by corrodings
and corrupting. Neither doe your instances of
Aron roots, or the gall of an oxe prooue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
For we must remember that there be two
kindes of Qualities, the one common or as some
call them accidentall; the other specificall and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall.
The Qualities which are common or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17177:20"/>
may be remooued from their Subiects. But
those that are specificall, cannot be separated, <hi>Sine
interitu subiecti.</hi> As in a man to be hoat, cold, moist,
dry, may be absent or present with him: but to be
<hi>risibilis</hi> or <hi>irascibilis,</hi> can in no wise be separated
from him so long as he is a man. The burning Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of Aron roots is accidentall and common, and
therefore remooueable. But the corroding or poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
Quality of Arsenicke (for these you make al
one) is by all learned Physicions held specifical and
essentiall. For else how should it be <hi>Toto genere, &amp;
substantia Deleterium.</hi> Concerning your Oxe Gall,
whose bitternesse you say you haue remooued, I
say onely this: If it be Gall, then it is bitter, if it be
not bitter, then it is not Gall. If a man put three gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
of water to three spoonefull of wine, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out a glasse full, make his friend drinke thereof,
affirming it to be wine, he will be ready to say, that
were it not for the name of wine, he had as leaue
drinke water. Such mixture must haue their name
of the Praedominant. And I suppose that hee that
should taste your sweetned Gall, would call it gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
sugar, and not sugred gall, as one did a cuppe of
drinke mixed by his friend, yet not to the liking of
his stomacke, wined water, and not watred wine.</p>
            <p>Whereas you thinke it absurd, that there should
not be as sure away to correct the poisoning quality
of Arsenicke by minerall meanes, as there is means
to correct the offending qualities, of Scammony,
Agaricke, Hellebor, &amp;c. by vegetables, me thinkes
your speech is very harsh and vncouth, both for the
phrase &amp; sense. For mine own part I neuer heard or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17177:20"/>
read of the correcting of poisons, but onely of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
offending in quality, of which sort are those
which you haue reckoned, whose offensiue quality
being retunded, they are vsed without danger, and
to the benefit and comfort of mankind. But as for
Arsenicke or such like poisons, being as hath beene
often prooued <hi>Toto genere deleteria,</hi> the infest and
mortall enemies of Nature, you may as soone make
an Aethiopian white with washing, as make them
friendly and comfortable to our bodies by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting,
vnlesse by correcting you meane destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Nature and substance altogether, by
reducing them to a <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> as you cal them,
and that is a strange kinde of correcting: or else
they produce such effect by accident, intending no
such matter any more, then <hi>Iasons</hi> enemy did, who
by his sword cured his Aposteme, which the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicions
could not heale.</p>
            <p>All this while you haue endeuored to prooue
that these Amulets may be worne without harme,
which how you haue performed, <hi>Aliorum sit Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium.</hi>
Now you will shew how they doe good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your opinion concerning the maner how they
doe good, you set downe in these words.</hi> I assure
my selfe that there is in these Minerals which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymists
call their spirits, good store of gold, or to speake a
little plainer, of the spirits of gold, and from thence in my
opinion it hath that incredible and admirable operation
in preseruing our spiritis from infection.</p>
            <p>This (as I suppose) will be an incredible and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
opinion vnto our Philosophers &amp; Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who may turne ouer a good number of books,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17177:21"/>
before they find any mention of such a far-fetched
and dearely bought conceit. There are three seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
opinions concerning this matter. The first is,
that by wearing these Amulets, the heart is inured
and accustomed vnto poison, and so by this famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
learneth to contemne it. Concerning this
conceit I will say nothing my selfe, but you shall
heare what <hi>Crato</hi> that most learned Germaine, and
Emperiall Physicion speaketh to it, <hi>Epist. ad Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the bagges of Arsenicke, I finde no
other reason for them woorth mentioning, saue
that thereby the heart is accustomed vnto poison.
But how weake and dangerous a reason this is, and
that a man carefull of a good conscience ought not
to trust to it, you easily discerne. Therefore though
you should produce sixe hundred Authors which
allow them, you shall not perswade me to vse or
approoue them. I can tell you, since you vrge me,
vpon my owne knowledge that <hi>Creckouius</hi> was so
weakened and exulcerated in the brest by them,
that he threw away the bagge with great indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the castle of <hi>Grauestem.</hi> I could say the like
of others. That which followeth in <hi>Crato</hi> is worth
the reading, but I must make haste.</p>
            <p>The second opinion is that of <hi>Antonius Firmanus,</hi>
who saith that Arsenicke by similitude of substance
draweth to it the venemous and contagious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries
of the Plague, and by that meanes preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
him that weareth it. This opinion the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser
at large would seeme to follow in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Treatise of the Pestilence, lately set foorth,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17177:21"/>
wherin he alloweth &amp; commendeth the vse of these
Amulets because by <hi>a similitude one venome draweth
another as Arsenicke doth, who voideth the poison of the
Plague insensibly. Quod venenum &amp; corpore attrahat,
&amp; tota forma &amp; ratione caliditatis. This Antipathy
in Arsenicke experience doth allow, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Marke how Clarke-like he reasoneth. First he
saith that Arsenicke draweth the venome by simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of forme, <hi>&amp; ratione caliditatis.</hi> Then in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
next words, either forgetting what he had saide
before, or notvnderstanding, what he was about
to say, he attributeth this effect to an Antipathy or
contrariety. But I will stand no longer about him,
but leaue him to his wandring Muses: <hi>Ne quem non
inuenio vsquam esse putem nusquam.</hi> Yet one thing
by the way would not be ouerpassed, that whereas
he would be reputed a great Linguist, he hath in
the Epistle to the Reader inserted onely two Greek
words, and the last seemeth not to be vnderstood,
and for the first a meane scholler in <hi>Mulcasters</hi>
schoole, will easily tell him that it is neither good
Greeke nor yet true Latine, but <hi>Caco ethen scribendi</hi>
indeed.</p>
            <p>Concerning the opinion it is not true, that
eueryvenome is like to Arsenicke, neither that
euery poison is like in substance and Nature with
another poison: neither can all contagious se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries
be like to Arsenicke, since they are not
of the same violence, Analogie, or similitude
one with another, as might be easily shewed
some infecting onely Cattle, others Fishes, others
men. What then if the poison of the Plague be not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17177:22"/>
like in Nature with Arsenicke: what if it be like in
Nature but stronger and hoater then Arsenicke.
Surely then it must draw the poison of Arsenicke,
vnto it into the body, and double the euill.</p>
            <p>The third and last opinion is, that Arsenicke doth
by a certaine secret Antipathy or contrariety op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne,
vanquish and expell the poison of the
Plague. This hath of all other the most probability
and ground of reason, but it hath place onely then
when the seminaries of the Pestilence are contrarie
to the poison of Arsenicke; for then the two poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may warre and skirmish one with the other in
such sort as they both spending their forces and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,
ech against the other, and so dying in that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctation
and combat, the party by accident may
escape with his life. And in this case peraduenture
there might be some trueth in that obseruation
which <hi>Philippus Ingrasias, Fallopius</hi> and <hi>Massa,</hi>
learned men, and woorthy of good credit, haue
made. And in this case some suppose that might
be true which <hi>Ausonius Gallus</hi> reporteth of a leud
huswife in these verses.</p>

            </q>
            <p>And yet the discreet and prudent Physician wil not
heereupon counsell the wearing of Arsenicke to
cure the Plague. For in poisons opposing Nature
in their whole substance, there is no Artificiall or
rationall method as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth <hi>Meth. 13. cap.</hi> 6.
and the Physician cannot discerne but by euent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
what poison, or Analogie of poison Arsenicke is
opposit. The sympathys or antipathys of poisons
together with the forces and secret insults of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
seminaries, are vnknowen to the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
The idiosygcrasye, or particular Natures (as
<hi>Galen</hi> calleth them, are vnknowen, &amp; (for ought we
can see) incomprehensible vnto humane imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<hi>Gal. 3. Meth. cap.</hi> 7. And if the Degree, Nature,
and facultie of that poison be not to be easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned,
which proceedeth of corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
in our bodies, much lesse is that hidden ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciousnesse
of these Minerals which is farre more
subtile, secret, and vnsearchable. First therefore
there must be a poison in the body: next that poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
must be contrary to Arsenicke: thirdly it must
be of equall force, else if he suruiue and be of force
after he hath subdued his enemie, he may doe a
shrewd turne when al is done. We conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that it is rash and temerarious counsell, to vse
a Medicine, which if it finde not an enemy to strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
with, will easily speed and kill the party. Better
it is to follow <hi>Galens</hi> aduise, who in his booke <hi>De
Simp.</hi> writing against <hi>Zenocrates,</hi> would haue a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
neuer to vse any Medicine which may be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17177:23"/>
preiudiciall or hurtfull to the health or life of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
            <p>As for the fourth opinion, your golden Conceit
that this maruellous operation should be wrought
by the spirits of Gold in Arsenicke, I suppose there
is farre lesse likelihood or probability therein, than
in the golden dreame of the Philosophers stone,
whereinto many haue fallen being rich, and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
out of the same starke beggars.</p>
            <p>First, how should we imagine, that the Gold or
golden spirits which are fancied to be in Arsenicke
should more preuaile in preseruing Nature, than
the Arsenicall spirits (whose Quantity must needs
be farre greater) in violating and corrupting her.
Secondly, if this woonderfull worke of preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
proceed from gold and his spirits, being in so
small quantitie (as they must needs be if they be at
all) in a little lumpe of Arsenicke; why doe you not
rather counsell men to weare about their necks, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Region of the heart a double Ducate or a
plate of Golde, seeing therein must needs be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quantity of spirits, more neerely and firmely
vnited then in Arsenicke? Beside this might be
done without all danger and great securitie, the
Arsenicall spirits (which are so ill neighbors) being
remoued. I know right well that gold is of great
vertue. <hi>Auri sacra fames quid non mortalia cogis
Pectora?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One saith truely, that there was no fort inexpug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,

It is a cunning locke which a golden key will not
open. But yet among all the vertues and effects of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17177:23"/>
Gold (which are manifold) I neuer heard that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned,
that it should preserue the wearerers thereof
from Plague and Poison.</p>
            <p>Whereas you send vs to the Refiners of Mettals
to be satisfied in this point, I can assure you that
one of the skilfullest workemen and best practised
in that kinde about <hi>London</hi> being demanded, What
Golde he thought to be in Arsenicke, made this
answere: That there was as much Golde in Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke
as in a Rat. And this he affirmed to be not
only his iudgement, but the conclusion of the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningest
workemasters in Minerals about the City.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Paracelsus</hi> to whom in the next place you
referre vs, I would be loath <hi>Bonas hor as tam malè
collocare,</hi> though I haue mispent some time in my
dayes, and it may be about him: of whose writings
I may say the cleane contrary, that <hi>Socrates</hi> did of
<hi>Heraclitus</hi> booke. Those things (sayd he, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
what he thought of it) which I vnderstand
are very excellent, and therefore I suppose the rest
which I vnderstand not to be answerable to them:
For I can say, that such things in <hi>Paracelsus</hi> which I
vnderstand, are exceeding friuolous, absurd and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
and therefore I suppose the greater part (if
not all the rest included in his barbarous Riddles) to
be sutable and agreeable with them. But because
you stile him <hi>absolutely the most learned Chynicall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

deemed partiall, you shall heare the iudgement of

follie, the ridiculous and childish crakings and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> should once commend him

            <p>Touching <hi>Pistorius</hi> whom you onely produce

I must needs say, That his speeches sauour of
too too much vanitie (if not follie and falsehood)
and come very neere the Mountbanks phrase, who
vse to set out their basest trash with el-long and
bombasted termes, and craking and lying vaunts.
First he affirmeth, <hi>That many Italian Physicians are of
opinion, That there was neuer a more excellent thing
granted to mortall men by God, to preserue them from
the Plague. Secondly, That they call it a diuine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
inuented by God. Thirdly, that they take it vpon
their oathes, That neuer any fell sicke that ware them.

            <p>You heard in the beginning,<note place="margin">These are Italian Physicians of great name.</note> what Father <hi>Auge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
that learned and graue Italian Physician con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
of them. And it is certaine, that <hi>Massaria</hi> a
learned Reader of <hi>Padua</hi> hath learnedly and largely
disputed against them. And sure I am that <hi>Gerar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Columba</hi> the great Physician of <hi>Messana</hi> disclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17177:25"/>
them vtterly. But it is woorth noting, First
that these Physicians who so highly commend
these Amulets, are namelesse. Secondly, that they
offer oath vpon the matter, fearing belike that their
words would not be taken: whereas (if their credit
were good) their bare words would passe as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
as their oaths. Lastly, their hyperbolicall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
of a poore poisoned cake, seemeth to
me the language of vaunting Quack-saluers, rather
than of learned Physicians. As for his experiment
in <hi>Zuricke Ann.</hi> 64. and in <hi>Basill,</hi> that he knew none
die who wore them; who will beleeue him, since
we haue more than sufficient experience, both
heretofore and of late in <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the contrary.</note> and you your selfe
acknowledge the same, but holde it pitie to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
from the credit of so noble and generall a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
for a few particular Instances. How noble a
Medicine it is, I hope hath appeared by this time.
Sure I am that it is no rationall Medicine, and
that the most learned Physicians, who haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Argument of the Plague, do either directly
oppugne it, as <hi>Augenius, Columba, Massaria, &amp;c.</hi> or
els passe it ouer in silence, as not woorthy to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
or mentioned with rationall and noble Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dots
and Alexeteries (as <hi>Palmarius</hi> or rather <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
that worthy Light of Physicke (for that learned
booke of the plague being the most Scholarlike,
iudiciall and absolute in that kind, that I euer met
with) is thought to be written by him, and set out
by <hi>Palmarius</hi> his Scholar) or els if they mention it
in the Tale after a great ranke of other rationall
Medicines, they set this or the like brand in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17177:25"/>
forhead of it. <hi>Quidam Emperici,</hi> or <hi>Quidam</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
naming them) <hi>Consulunt tabellam ex Arsenico.</hi>
Certaine Empericks, or certaine (not woorthy to
be named) counsell a table of Arsenicke, as <hi>Platerus
Heurnius, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude since Physicke is the Art of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
healing, curing, I see not what we haue to
doe with Poisons, vnlesse it be to giue councell of
Precaution, and Preuention, or to relieue them,
who by errour or malice haue medled with them.
Me thinks it is wholesome and Fatherly counsell
that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> giueth to all his Scholars, That
they should alwayes propound vnto themselues
these two ends: First, <hi>Ne noceant.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Vt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse
possint.</hi> First, That they be sure to do no hurt
to their Patients. Secondly, That they endeuour
to doe some good. As for those who leauing so
great varietie of safe, wholesome and salutiferous
Medecins, as God of his infinite bountie hath sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vs withall, will needs be still tampering with
Poisons, and Deleteries, they seeme to me like the
foolish flies, who forsake the sweet herbs and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to buzze about the candle, so long till their
wings be singed, and themselues oft times burned
with the Flame. I might giue instances heereof,
but that I hasten to an end. It is not good medling
with edge-tooles. <hi>Qui amat Periculum peribit in eo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I haue presumed to inquire somewhat
more at large, concerning these Amulets <hi>non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionis
amore, sed veritatis indagandae studio:</hi> and
that it may appeare that I am not of a seruile dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17177:26"/>
to relie vpon the opinion of any, be he neuer
so learned, vnlesse it be vnderpropped with Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Reason: the rather because I vnderstand
that this Taske was expected at my hands. As for
that learned &amp; ancient Physitian (who hath taken
vpon him their Defence and Patronage) I confesse
that as I aimed not directly and particularly at him
in my first writing against them (they being ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
dispensed by many Chirurgians and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
in <hi>London,</hi> some of them being my kinde
friends, so I doe now beare him no more grudge,
malice, or enuie, then my selfe: though I haue
beene of late discourteously and hardly intreated,
reiected and shut out from conference. Which
kinde of dealing, how it agreeth with the Rules of
Christianity or liberall Profession, let indifferent
men iudge. Who knoweth not that our greatest
Diuines and best Lawyers do dissent one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
in some one point or other of their Arts. Do
they therfore breake off all societie, and proclaime
open hostilitie one against another? God forbid. I
haue read that <hi>Aristides</hi> and <hi>Pericles</hi> though they
were at oddes, and iarred often in the Senate of
<hi>Athens</hi> by reason of secret emulation, yet when
they were to vndertake any publicke affaire or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage,
they did <hi>Simulates in finibus Patria deponere,
eas<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> redeuntes resumere.</hi> So I could wish that Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
should leaue their priuate grudges and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentments
at home in their owne houses, and
not carie them abroad in their bosomes among
their Patients, to the disgrace of their fellowes and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and slander of their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
As for me, I am neither too skilfull to learne,
nor too old to erre: But desire to follow that
councell of the Oratour. <hi>In sententia
