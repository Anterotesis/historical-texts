         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

my Father, who hath made himſelf known to me, and
hath ſhined by his eternal Light in my heart, do I ſee
him and all ſuch to be Antichriſt, and no Miniſter

hear the Word of the Lord, Thy Prophets are light

and thy Prieſts preach for hire, and thy Officers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſons
the juſt, and thy Rulers are evening wolves,
which ſeeks for the prey, and the Lord of Heaven and

tremble at the preſence of the Lord God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> for
<hi>Eſau</hi> ſhall become a place for Dragons, and ſhall be

Officers, and Rulers will the Lord cut off utterlie from

Judges as at the firſt, and Counſellers as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:

and he will avenge the Cauſe of the Poor and

by Lawyers in their Fees, and by Officers in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous

Officers, Judges, and Rulers, and this Light ſhall ſhine
through the Nation, and ſhall be ſpread over King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and the fire is to be kindled which the Lord hath
promiſed, which ſhall burn as an Oven, and the proud
and all that do wickedlie, ſhall be as ſtubble: This fire
ſhall proceed out of the mouth of the two Witneſſes,
as it did before they were ſlain, and ſhall devour the
enemies of the Lord: the ſword of the Lord is drawn
in thee, O Nation, and put into the hands of them
which is hated and deſpiſed by the Rulers and Officers,
which is ſcornfullie called <hi>Quakers,</hi> but they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer

O Nation, the Lord is with them, and thy unjuſt Rulers

ſhame and reproach, and ſome of them impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

wherein the Lord ſpeaks to thee by the mouth of his

Lord thy God from whence thou art fallen: Now will

the Lord gather his Jewels and Choſen ones out of

Witchcraft, by which he deceiveth the ſimple; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<hi>Jer. 31. 33.</hi> The Lord is about his great and wonderful
Work in thee, and all the Wars and Contentions in

Work of the Lord, and hath not been the Work which
the Lord hath purpoſed: This Work is made known to
them that feareth the Lord, and abideth in his Counſel:
The Lord will overturn, overturn the Nation, and will
create new Heavens and new Earth, wherein ſhall dwell
righteouſneſs, in which all the Choſen of the Lord ſhall
rejoice for evermore; And all the Kings and Nobles
ſhall caſt down their Crowns before this Glorie: And
all the men of War ſhall lay down their Armour and
Weapons of War: And Nation ſhall not lift up a
Sword againſt Nation any more: For the Lord will
eſtabliſh Righteouſneſs and Peace; this will the Lord
bring to paſs in thee, O <hi>England,</hi> through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

the Reſurrection of that to Life which now lieth
in Death: Hear, O Land, give eare, O People,
for the Lord of Heaven and Earth is now turning the
World up-ſide down, all old things ſhall paſs away, all
things ſhall become new by fire, and by his ſword will
the Lord plead with all fleſh, and the ſlain of him ſhall
be manie; corrupt Judges and Officers will the Lord
ſweep away, and their name ſhall no more be found in
the Nation, the fire is kindled and the ſword is drawn,
happie is he that keepeth himſelf from fighting againſt
the Lord in this his Work, &amp; happie are ye, O Brethren,

            <head>A true Declaration, and a diſcovery to all the World of my
manner of Life; what I have been, and what
now I am at preſent.</head>
            <p>I Was brought up by my natural Parents in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Religion, according to the generalitie of
this Nation, going one day in ſeven to hear a man
Preach the Word, as they ſaid to me, and to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the formal worſhip w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was then upheld, to reade
and ſing, and to rabble over a Praier; but I was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
and light, and lived in pleaſure, without the fear of
God, not knowing of God but by hear-ſay, and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but when I grew up toward twelve years of age,
ſomthing ſtirred in me, and ſhewed me, that there was
a higher religion than that I was exerciſed in; and then
I inquired where the chiefeſt of the Presbyterian Prieſts
Preached, and would have gone ſome miles of a firſt
day to have heard one of the beſt of them, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
liker truth than the other, and ſo I got up to be a
Presbyterian, and followed the higheſt of the Prieſts
and Profeſſors of that form, and grew in favor with
them, then ſome ſmall of my vanity and lightneſs I left,
and Pride grew up in me, for wiſdom grew up in me,
then ſome of my former acquaintance began to ſcorn
me, calling me a Round-head, and the like; and by my
laboring here, I gathered knowledge in things without,
but yet was ignorant of the living truth: Then when I
was about ſeventeen years of age, it pleaſed God to
ſhew himſelf a little to me, and ſomthing ſtruck me with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118252:18"/>
terror, and when I had been praying, I heard the voice
often, <hi>Thou art ignorant of God, thou knoweſt not where he
is, nor what he is; to what purpoſe is thy Prayer?</hi> And ſo
much fear and dread came upon me, and broke me off
from praying manie times, and trouble came thick into
my mind, and fearfulneſs fell many times upon me,
and I was ſtruck off my delights that I formerly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and what I had gathered in as of a god, died; and
I left off reading in the Scripture, for ſomthing ſhewed
me that I was very ignorant, and knew not the true God,
and the beauty of all things vaniſhed; And I went to
ſome, asking, What God was, which was profeſſed? for
I ſaid, I knew him not: but got no ſatisfaction from
any. And I was much ſeparated from the vain waies
of the world, and from vain worldlie people, and was
made to reprove manie, often, for wickedneſs, in words
and actions, and was much derided, and looked upon
ſcornfully by manie; and then the Preaching of them
whom I had formerly much delighted in, was as wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and decayed, yet then it pleaſed the Lord to ſnew
himſelf a little in love to me, and I had ſweet refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
coming in from him to my ſoul, and had joy and
peace in abundance, and openings of the living truth
in me, which the world knew not of, and the myſterie
of the Scripture was ſomthing opened, which before I
knew nothing of, and I ſaw manie glorious things in it,
which lie hid under the letter; and I was in much rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
manie times, and ſang praiſe, for I was brought out
of the land of darkneſs, &amp; could ſay, I was in the Light,
&amp; I grew up to know high things; but not knowing the
Croſs of Chriſt, I ran forth in my wiſdom comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the myſteries of God, having a Light ſhined in me,
and I grew up into Notion, to talk of high things, for
it was my delight to comprehend in my buſie mind thus
being ignorant of the Croſs to keep low in it, I ran be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my guide up into comprehenſion, and then was I
above manie of the Prieſts and Profeſſors, and followed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118252:18"/>
only to hear the higheſt Notioniſts, that Preached high
things, but the fleſhlie man was at libertie, and ſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
one of them in their diſcourſings, and was looked
upon by them to know much; the former terror was
gone, and I had got up from under the judgement, and
now pride grew more than ever, and ſelf-conceitedneſs
and preſumption, and fleſhly liberty to the carnal mind,
and my delight was much in diſcourſing, where I played
the harlot, and the prodigal, and gave holy things unto
dogs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and caſt pearls before ſwine (for wiſdom was hid
from me) and here I lived pleaſantlie, for I had the true
God, and the true Truth in my comprehenſion, which
by my wiſdom in the light I had comprehended, and I
had the world in my heart, Pride, Coverouſneſs, and the
earthly ſpirit ruled, and my delight was grown up to
that, which once I had no delight in, and the beauty of
things grew up, which ſeemed to be vaniſhed, here I was
run from my Husband after other Lovers, and had left
the Lord my maker, who had ſo graciouſly made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
himſelf unto me, and had ſpended my portion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
harlots; but I became to be darkned, and had
loſt that which once I had, and had but in memory that
which before I had injoyed, could tell of Experiences,
but they were dead to me; and ſomthing within me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to queſtion how it was with me; for I ſaw my ſelf
to be ignorant more than formerly, and I ſaw I knew
nothing; ſomthing deſiring in me to be from whence
I was come, but I grew to be much given to the world
to ſeek after riches, and glorie in it; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fed my ſelf
with what I had formerlie enjoyed, and ſaid, <hi>Whom God
loves once, he loves for ever:</hi> (but that was then head, and
ruled in me, which he loved never) I was wanton, and
lived in the luſtful nature, among heathens, crucifying
the Lord of Life, but the blood of that which I had
ſlain, cried continually, and the witneſs which laid ſlain,
would give me no reſt, which the earthly made merrie
over; and I grew to be weary of hearing any of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118252:19"/>
Prieſts, though never ſo high, for ſomthing, which
ſhined deep in me, ſhewed me ignorance in all profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and I was put to a ſtand many times in my ſelf at
thoſe things, which were come to paſs; then it pleaſed
the Lord to ſend his true and faithful Servant and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
who is called according to the fleſh, <hi>Geo. Fax.</hi>
be ſpoke the language which I knew not, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all my high talking, for it was higher, and yet
lower: And it pleaſed the Lord to ſpeak to me by him,
that I was in the prodigal ſtate, and above the Croſs of
Chriſt, and not in the pure fear of the Lord, but full
of corruption and the old nature, though I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
freedom, yet it was but ſuch as the Jewes profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
for I ſaw my ſelf to be in bondage to my own
Will, and to my own Luſt; and through the word of
the Lord ſpoken to me by him, I began to ſee my ſelf
(the witneſs being raiſed) where I was, and what I had
been doing, and ſaw I had been making an image to the
firſt Beaſt, which had the Wound by a Sword and did
live, whoſe deadly Wound was healed, and was full of
Airie Notions and imaginations, and was worſhipping
the image which I had made, and then I ſaw my ſelf to
be a Child of Wrath, and that the Son of the Bond-Woman
lived, and that harlots had been my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and was no more worthie to be called a Son: Then
trouble and diſtreſs came upon me, ſuch as was not
ſince the beginning of the world, and I was at my wits
end, and a day of thick darkneſs and trouble, a day of
weeping, and mourning, and miſerie, and a day of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
and recompence, came upon me, ſuch as I had
never known; one vial of Wrath after another, the
great Whore was to be Judged, and to drink of the
Wine of the wrath of God, which had made me once
drunk with the Wine of her Fornication, and then I
ſeparated from all the glory of the World, and from all
my acquaintance, and kindred, and betook my ſelf to
the company of a poor deſpiſed and contemned people
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118252:19"/>
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and now am I one in that Generation,
which is, and ever was, hated of the world, by the

and hath choſen rather to ſuffer Affliction with a poor
deſpiſed People, than to injoy the pleaſures of Sin with
the great multitude (though the worldly pleaſures was
not wanting to me) and now do I bear witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Forms of Religion, and falſe Hirelings, and
chief Prieſts, who walks in the ſteps of the Scribes and

never ſent of God to declare his Word: And do free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Declare againſt all out-ſide Profeſſion, and Notion,
And do witneſs <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> to be a true Miniſter of God,
one that ſpeaks the Word of the Lord from his mouth,
one who was ſent of God, and who is the Servant and
Meſſenger of the living God, he is the friend of God,
and wo unto his perſecutors, they are the Seed of evil
doers; and now I am deſpiſed of my neighbors and
carnal acquaintance, and is not greater than my Lord
who was called a Blaſphemer and a Deceiver as now I
am, but praiſed, praiſed be the Lord for evermore, who
hath ſeparated me from the World and Worldly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and hath made me a partaker of his Love, in whom
my Soul hath full ſatisfaction, joy, and content: Thus
have I travelled through the World, even unto the end,

            <p>I Am a Priſoner for the Truth ſake, and for Declaring
to man of his Wickedneſs, and of his Tranſgreſſion,
of the ſpiritual Law of God which is ſpiritual, and for
writing of a Letter which was written from God, to
ſhew to man of his wicked waies, and how he ſtood in
the preſence of God, as by the ſpiritual light of God
(which ſhines in the hearts of his ſervants) was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and made manifeſt unto me, for who Speaks,
Writes, or Declares, from the light of God (which
doth diſcover all the dark paths of fallen man, and all
his ſpiritual Wickedneſs) Speaks, Writes, and Declares
not as from man, whoſe light is only natural and carnal,
(which is darkneſs in the pure light which is eternal)
but as from God, whoſe light is ſpiritual, and doth make
manifeſt the ſecret Whordom of fallen man; and from
this light did the Prophets and Miniſters of God, who
were ſent by him to reprove Sin and Tranſgreſſion,
Speak, Write, and Declare, and in this light did the
true Prophets <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Hoſea,</hi> diſcover Iſrael to
be Adulterous, and in the preſence of God to be guilty
of Whordom, from whoſe preſence they declared:
And all now who are ſent of God, to reprove for Sin
and Iniquity, declares from the ſame light of God, and
by the ſame Spirit which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Hoſea</hi> did, For
the pure light of God is but one, from generation to
generation, in all generations which diſcovers Sin and
Iniquity, the ſame light now, as in the time of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles: and from this light (which is not
carnal, but eternal) did all the holy men of God Write,
and Declare; And all who are ſent of God now, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

now, as they did then; for, who cannot witneſs this

of God, to Declare the Truth from God, but are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
and blind Guides, and ſpeaks from the natural
and carnal light, the imagined and ſuppoſed light,
which hath not ſeen the living and ſpiritual God; for
Declaring by Writing to a man that he is guilty of all
manner of wickedneſs, naming, Pride, Drunkenneſs,
and Whordom, I am impriſoned; I wrote not as from
man, whoſe light is only natural and carnal, and doth
only make manifeſt carnal Tranſgreſſions, of a carnal
Law, but as from the eternal and ſpiritual light, which
doth make manifeſt ſpiritual Tranſgreſſions of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Law; And in this light, is he to whom I wrote,
guilty of all manner of Wickedneſs: Now this which
I Declared from God who is ſpiritual, is above the
reach and comprehenſion of the carnal and earthly law,
for by the natural light through the earthly Law, is no
natural man able to Judge, of that which is ſpoken or
declared from that which is eternal, and ſpiritual, (for
darkneſs cannot comprehend the light) which light all
the Servants and Miniſters of God are guided by, to
Act, Speak, or Write; and therefore do I deny to
have this Cauſe put into the Judgement of carnal
Lawyers, who Judges by the natural light, through the
earthly and carnal Law, yet willing I am before any
Authority to Anſwer for my ſelf, that whereof I am
Accuſed, but to the Judgement of earthly Magiſtrates
I do not ſtand, but to the Judgement of the living and
eternal Judge, who Judges not according to the ſight
of the eyes, and hearing of the eares, but who Judges
with Equity and Righteouſneſs, thus rather I Chuſe to
ſuffer impriſonment in the Body, yet free as to God in
the Truth, waiting to be Redeemed, not by the earthly
Powers, through the earthly law, but by him who is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
