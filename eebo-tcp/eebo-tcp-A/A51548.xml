            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>I See no more Reason, why the Sordidness of some Work-Men,
should be the Cause of Contempt upon <hi>Manual
Operations,</hi> than that the excellent Invention of a
<hi>Mill</hi> should be Despis'd, because a blind Horse
draws in it. And tho' the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> be, by some,
accounted Ignoble and Scandalous; yet it is very well
known, that many Gentlemen in this Nation, of good Rank
and high Quality, are conversant in <hi>Handy-Works:</hi> And
other Nations exceed us in numbers of such. How plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and healthy this their Divertion is, their Minds and
Bodies find; and how Harmless and Honest, all sober Men
may judge?</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Geometry, Astronomy, Perspective, Musick,
Navigation, Architecture, &amp;c.</hi> are excellent Sciences, all
that know but their very Names will confess: Yet to what
purpose would <hi>Geometry</hi> serve, were it not to contrive
Rules for <hi>Handy-Works?</hi> Or how could <hi>Astronomy</hi> be
known to any perfection, but by Instruments made by Hand?
What <hi>Perspective</hi> should we have to delight our Sight?
What <hi>Musick</hi> to ravish our Ears? What <hi>Navigation</hi> to
Guard and Enrich our Country? Or what <hi>Architecture</hi> to
defend us from the Inconveniencies of different Weather,
without <hi>Manual Operations?</hi> Or how waste and useless
would many of the Productions of this, and other Countries
be, were it not for <hi>Manufactures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To dive into the Original of the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> is impossible,
therefore I shall not offer at it; only I shall say, it is Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
to think, that the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> began with <hi>Man,</hi> he
being the only Creature that Nature has imposed most Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
upon to use it, endow'd with greatest Reason to
<pb facs="tcp:41812:4"/>
contrive it, and adapted with properest Members (as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments)
to perform it.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it easie to find by any Authority, what part of the
<hi>Mechanicks</hi> was first Practised by <hi>Man;</hi> therefore I shall
wave that too, and only consider, that if we our selves were
the first Men, what Branch of the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> we should
first <hi>NEED,</hi> and consequently have recourse to.</p>
                  <p>I have considered, and Answer, That without the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Smithing</hi> primarily, most other <hi>Mechanick</hi> Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
would be at a stand: The Instruments, or Tools, that are
used in them, being either made of Iron, or some other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
form'd by the help of Iron. But pray take Notice, that
by Iron, I also mean Steel, it being originally Iron.</p>
                  <p>Nor would I have you understand, that when I name the
<hi>Mechanicks;</hi> I mean that Rough and Barbarous sort of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
which is used by the Natives of <hi>America,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such Places; for, though they did indeed make Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Canoes, Earthen Pots, Bows, Arrows, &amp;c. without
the help of Iron, because they had then none amongst them;
Yet since Iron is now known to them, they leave off their old
way of working without it, and betake themselves to the use
of it. Nor are, at this day, (though now they have in part
the use of Iron) their <hi>Machines</hi> made by good and ready
Rules of <hi>Art;</hi> for they know neither of <hi>Rule, Square,</hi> or
<hi>Compass;</hi> and what they do, is done by Tedious Working,
and he that has the best Eye at Guessing, works best upon the
<hi>Straight, Square,</hi> or <hi>Circle,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> in his <hi>Natural History,</hi> reckons that
<hi>Philosophy</hi> would be improv'd, by having the Secrets of all
Trades lye open; not only because much <hi>Experimental Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi>
is Coutcht amongst them; but also that the <hi>Trades</hi>
themselves might, by a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> be improv'd. Besides,
I find, that one <hi>Trade</hi> may borrow many Eminent Helps
in <hi>Work</hi> of another <hi>Trade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto I cannot learn that any hath undertaken this Task,
though I could have wisht it had been performed by an abler
<pb facs="tcp:41812:4"/>
hand than mine; yet, since it is not, I have ventured upon
it: For having, for many Years, been conversant in <hi>Handy-Works,</hi>
and especially in those <hi>Trades</hi> wherein the chief know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all <hi>Handy-Works</hi> lie, <hi>viz. Smithing, Founding,
Drawing, Joynery, Turning, Engraving, Printing
Books</hi> and <hi>Pictures, Globe</hi> and <hi>Map-making, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Instruments, &amp;c.</hi> I am willing to communicate to the
Publick, the Knowledge I have attained to. But because the
<hi>Whole</hi> will be both a Work of Time, and great Charge, I
mean to try, by the Sale of some few <hi>Monthly Exercises,</hi>
what Encouragement I may have to run through All, if I
live so long, and accordingly to Continue, or Desist.</p>
                  <p>I thought to have given these <hi>Exercises,</hi> the Title of <hi>The
Doctrine of Handy-Crafts;</hi> but when I better considered
the true meaning of the Word <hi>Handy-Crafts,</hi> I found the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
would not bear it; because <hi>Hand-Craft</hi> signifies <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
or <hi>Sleight,</hi> or <hi>Craft</hi> of the Hand, which cannot be taught
by Words, but is only gained by <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Exercise;</hi>
therefore I shall not undertake, that with the bare reading of
these <hi>Exercises,</hi> any shall be able to perform these <hi>Handy-Works;</hi>
but I may safely tell you, that these are the <hi>Rules</hi>
that every one that will endeavour to perform them must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
and that by the true observing them, he may, according
to his stock of Ingenuity and Zeal in diligence, sooner or
later, inure his hand to the <hi>Cunning,</hi> or <hi>Craft</hi> of working
like a <hi>Handy-Craft,</hi> and consequently be able to perform them
in time.</p>
                  <p>For the Reason aforesaid I intend to begin with <hi>Smithing,</hi>
which comprehends not only the <hi>Black-Smith's Trade,</hi> but
takes in all <hi>Trades</hi> which use either <hi>Forge</hi> or <hi>File,</hi> from the
<hi>Anchor-Smith,</hi> to the <hi>Watch-maker;</hi> they all working by
the same <hi>Rules,</hi> though not with equal exactness, and all
using the same <hi>Tools,</hi> though of several Sizes from those the
common <hi>Black-Smith</hi> uses, and that according to the various
purposes they are applied to: And in order ot it, I shall first
shew you how to set up a <hi>Forge,</hi> and what <hi>Tools</hi> you must use
<pb facs="tcp:41812:5"/>
in the <hi>Black-Smith's</hi> work; then the <hi>Rules,</hi> and several <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi>
of <hi>Forging,</hi> till your Work come to the <hi>File:</hi>
Then of the several Sorts of Iron that are commonly used;
and what Sort is fittest for each Purpose. Afterwards of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
in general, and the <hi>Rules</hi> to be observed in it, in the
making of <hi>Jacks, Hindges, Screws, Clocks, Watches,
&amp;c.</hi> In which Examples, you will find all other Sorts of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi>
or <hi>Filing</hi> work whatsoever comprehended. And lastly,
as a Close to <hi>Smithing,</hi> I shall Exercise upon <hi>Steel,</hi> and its
several Sorts, and how to Order and Temper it for its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Uses; and what Sort is fittest for each particular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
as which is fittest for <hi>Edge-Tools,</hi> which for <hi>Springs,</hi>
which for <hi>Punches, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some perhaps would have thought it more Proper, to have
introduced these <hi>Exercises</hi> with a more Curious, and less Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Art, than that of <hi>Smithing;</hi> but I am not of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
for <hi>Smithing</hi> is, in all its parts, as curious a <hi>Handy-Craft,</hi>
as any is: Besides, it is a great Introduction to most
other <hi>Handy-Works,</hi> as <hi>Joynery, Turning, Founding,
Printing,</hi> &amp;c. they (all with the <hi>Smith)</hi> working upon the
<hi>Straight, Square,</hi> or <hi>Circle,</hi> though with different <hi>Tools,</hi>
upon different <hi>Matter;</hi> and they all having dependance upon
the <hi>Smith's Trade,</hi> and not the <hi>Smith</hi> upon them. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done with <hi>Smithing,</hi> I shall, God willing, proceed to
those, and all other <hi>Handy-Works</hi> whatsoever, that work
by <hi>Geometrical</hi> Principles.</p>

a thick Iron Plate, and a taper Pipe in it about five
Inches long, called a <hi>Tewel,</hi> or (as some call it) a <hi>Tewel-Iron</hi>
marked *, which Pipe comes through the Back of
the <hi>Forge,</hi> as at C. Into this taper Pipe or <hi>Tewel</hi> is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Nose, or Pipe of the <hi>Bellows.</hi> The Office of this
<hi>Tewel,</hi> is only to preserve the Pipe of the Bellows, and
the back of the <hi>Forge</hi> about the Fire-place from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Right against the Back is placed at about twenty
Inches, or two foot distance the <hi>Trough,</hi> and reaches
commonly through the whole breadth of the <hi>Forge,</hi> and
is as broad and deep as you think good, as at D. The
<hi>Bellows</hi> is placed behind the Back of the <hi>Forge,</hi> and hath,
as aforesaid, its Pipe fitted into the Pipe of the <hi>Tewel,</hi> and
hath one of its Boards fixed so that it move not upwards
or downwards. At the Ear of the upper Bellows Board
is fastened a <hi>Rope,</hi> or sometimes a <hi>Thong</hi> of Leather, or
an Iron <hi>Chain</hi> or <hi>Rod,</hi> as E; which reaches up to the
<hi>Rocker,</hi> and is fastened there to the farther end of the
Handle, as at F. This <hi>Handle</hi> is fastened a-cross a <hi>Rock-staff,</hi>
which moves between two Cheeks upon the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pins</hi>
in two Sockets, as at G. So that by drawing
down this Handle, the moving Board of the <hi>Bellows</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and by a considerable weight set on the top of its
upper Board sinks down again, and by this Agitation
performs the Office of a pair of <hi>Bellows.</hi>

                        <p>THere are several sorts of <hi>Hammers</hi> used by Black-Smiths;
as first the <hi>Hand-hammer,</hi> which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
bigger, or less, according to the Strength of the
Work-man; but it is a <hi>Hammer</hi> of such weight, that
it may be weilded, or governed, with one hand at the
<hi>Anvil.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>Up-hand Sledge,</hi> used by under-Workmen,
when the Work is not of the largest, yet
requires help to batter, or <hi>draw it out;</hi> they use it with
both their Hands before them, and seldom lift their
<hi>Hammer</hi> higher than their head. Thirdly, the <hi>About
Sledge</hi> is the biggest <hi>Hammer</hi> of all, and is also used by
under-Workmen, for the battering, or <hi>drawing out</hi> of
the largest Work; and then they hold the farther end
of the <hi>Handle</hi> in both their Hands, and swinging the
<hi>Sledge</hi> above their Heads, they at Arms end let fall as
heavy a Blow as they can upon the Work. There is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41812:7"/>
also another <hi>Hammer</hi> used by them, which they call a
<hi>Rivetting-hammer.</hi> This is the smallest <hi>Hammer</hi> of all,
and very rarely used at the <hi>Forge,</hi> unless your Work
prove very small; but upon cold Iron it is used for rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or setting straight; or crooking small work. In Fig.

                        <p>THE <hi>Vice</hi> must be set up very firmly that it shake
not, and stand upright with its <hi>Chaps,</hi> parallel or
range with your <hi>Work-bench;</hi> because square filing, is a
great piece of good Workmanship in a Smith; and should
the Vice not stand upright, and range with the Work-bench,
the <hi>Chaps</hi> pinching upon two square sides, would
make the top side of your work either lean towards
you; or from you; and consequently you filing (as a
good Workman ought to do) upon the flat, or Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Plain of your work, would take off more of that
Angle, or Edge, which rises higher than the Plain, and less
off that Edge that lies lower than the Plain; so that one
Angle being higher, or lower, than the other, your work
instead of being filed <hi>Square,</hi> would be filed <hi>Square-wise,</hi>
when you shall have filed all its flat sides, and that more
or less, according to the leaning of the <hi>Chaps</hi> of your <hi>Vice.</hi>
AA the <hi>Face,</hi> hath its two ends lie in a straight Line
with the middle of its <hi>Face,</hi> or <hi>Plain.</hi> B the <hi>Chaps</hi> must
be cut with a Bastard Cut, and very well tempered, C
the <hi>Screw Pin,</hi> cut with a square strong Worm. D the

into the round <hi>Box.</hi> E the <hi>Spring</hi> must be made of
good Steel, and very well temper'd: Where note, that
the wider the two ends of the <hi>Spring</hi> stand asunder, the
wider it throws the <hi>Chaps</hi> of the <hi>Vice</hi> open. F the <hi>Foot</hi>

and polish'd, never batters or stretches it, but cuts a ture
round Hole, just in the point you first place it. You

at least, several <hi>Drill-strings;</hi> the strongest Strings for the
largest <hi>Drills,</hi> and the smallest <hi>Strings</hi> for the smallest
<hi>Drills:</hi> But you must remember, that whether you
use a small or strong <hi>String,</hi> you keep your <hi>Drill-bow</hi>
straining your String pretty stiff, or lese your String
will not carry your Barrel briskly about. But your
String and Bow, must both be accommodated to the
Size of your <hi>Drill;</hi> and if both, or either, be too strong,
they will break, or bend your <hi>Drill;</hi> or if too weak, they

                        <p>The <hi>Drill-Plate,</hi> or <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> is only a piece of flat
Iron, fixt upon a flat Board, which Iron hath an hole
punched a little way into it, to set the blunt end of the
Shank of the <hi>Drill</hi> in, when you drill a hole: Workmen
instead of it, many times use the <hi>Hammer,</hi> into which
they prick a hole a little way on the side of it, and so

                        <p>I Think it needless to tell you how to make your Fire,
or blow it, because they are both but Labourer's
work; nor how little, or big, it need to be, for your
own Reason will, by the Size of your work, teach you
that; only let me tell you the Phrase Smith's use for
[Make the Fire] is, <hi>Blow up the Fire,</hi> or sometimes, <hi>Blow
up the Coals.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When it is burning with the Iron in it, you must, with
the <hi>Slice,</hi> clap the Coals upon the out-side close together,
to keep the heat in the body of the Fire; and as oft as
you find the Fire begin to break out, clap them close
again, and with the <hi>Washer</hi> dipt in Water, wet the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the Fire to damp the out-side, as well to save
Coals, as to strike the force of the Fire into the in-side,
that your work may heat the sooner. But you ought
oft to draw your work a little way out of the Fire, to see
how it <hi>takes its Heat,</hi> and quickly thrust it in again, if
it be not hot enough: For each purpose your work is
designed to, ought to have a proper <hi>Heat</hi> suitable to
that purpose, as I shall shew you in the several <hi>Heats</hi> of
Iron: For if it be too cold, it will not <hi>feel the weight of
the Hammer</hi> (as Smiths say, when it will not batter under
the <hi>Hammer)</hi> and if it be too hot, it will <hi>Red-sear,</hi> that

                        <p>THere are several degrees of <hi>Heats</hi> Smiths take
of their Iron, each according to the purpose of
their work. As first, a <hi>Blood-red Heat.</hi> Secondly, a <hi>White
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41812:9"/>
Flame Heat.</hi> Thirdly, a <hi>Sparkling,</hi> or <hi>Welding Heat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Blood-red Heat</hi> is used when Iron hath already its
form and size, as sometimes square Bars, and Iron Plates,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> have, but may want a little Hammering to smooth
it. Use then the Face of your <hi>Hand-hammer,</hi> and with
light flat Blows, hammer down the irregular Risings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Body of your Iron, till it be smooth enough for
the File. And note, that it behoves a good Workman,
to Hammer his Work as true as he can; for one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour spent at the <hi>Forge,</hi> may save him an hours
work at the <hi>Vice,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Flame,</hi> or <hi>White Heat,</hi> is used when your Iron hath
not its Form or Size, but must be forged into both; and
then you must take a piece of Iron thick enough, and with
the <hi>Pen</hi> of your <hi>Hammer,</hi> (or sometimes, according to the
size of your work, use two or three pair of hands with
<hi>Sledges</hi> to) batter it out; or, as Workmen call it, to <hi>draw
it out,</hi> till it comes to its breadth, and pretty near its
shape; and so by several <hi>Heats,</hi> if your Work require
them, frame it into Form and Size; then with the Face of
your <hi>Hand-hammer,</hi> smooth your work from the Dents
the <hi>Pen</hi> made, as you did with a <hi>Blood-red Heat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>Sparkling,</hi> or <hi>Welding Heat,</hi> is only used when you
<hi>double up</hi> your Iron (as Smiths call it) to make it thick
enough for your purpose, and so <hi>weld,</hi> or work in the
<hi>doubling</hi> into one another, and make it become one entire
lump; or it is used when you join several Bars of Iron
together to make them thick enough for your purpose,
and work them into one Bar; or else it is used when
you are to join, or <hi>weld,</hi> two pieces of Iron together end
to end, to make them long enough; but, in this case, you
must be very quick at the <hi>Forge;</hi> for when your two
ends are throught of a good <hi>Heat,</hi> and that the inside
of the Iron be almost ready to Run, as well as the outside,
you must very hastily snatch them both out of the Fire
together, and (after you have with the Edge of your
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41812:9"/>
                           <hi>Hammer</hi> scraped off such Scales or Dirt as may hinder
their incorporating) with your utmost diligence clap
your left hand-piece upon your right hand-piece, and
with all speed (least you lose some part of your good
Heat) fall to Hammering them together, and work
them soundly into one another; and this, if your
Bars be large, will require another, or sometimes
two or three pair of Hands besides your own to do;
but if it be not throughly <hi>welded</hi> at the first <hi>Heat,</hi> you
must reiterate your <hi>Heats</hi> so oft, till they be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>welded;</hi> then with a <hi>Flame Heat</hi> (as before) shape it,
and afterwards smooth it with a <hi>Blood-red Heat.</hi> To
make your Iron come the sooner to a <hi>Welding-heat,</hi> you
must now and then with your <hi>Hearth-staff</hi> stir up the
Fire, and throw up those Cinders the Iron may have
run upon; for they will never burn well, but spoil the
rest of the Coals, and take a little white Sand between
your Finger and your Thumb, and throw upon the
heating Iron, then with your Slice, quickly clap the
outside of your Fire down again; and with your <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher</hi>
dipt in Water, damp the outside of the Fire to keep
the Heat in.</p>
                        <p>But you must take special Care that your Iron <hi>burn</hi>
not in the Fire, that is, that it do not <hi>run</hi> or melt; for
then your Iron will be so brittle, that it will not endure
Forging without breaking, and so hard, that a <hi>File</hi> will
not touch it.</p>
                        <p>Some Smiths use to strew a little white Sand upon the
<hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Anvil</hi> also, when they are to hammer upon
a <hi>Welding-heat;</hi> for they say it makes the Iron <hi>weld,</hi> or
incorporate the better.</p>
                        <p>If through Mistake, or ill management, your Iron be
too thin, or too narrow towards one of the ends; then
if you have substance enough (and yet not too long) you
may <hi>up-set</hi> it, that is, take a <hi>Flame Heat,</hi> and set the
heated end upright upon the <hi>Anvil,</hi> and hammer upon the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41812:10"/>
cold end, till the heated end be beat, or <hi>up-set,</hi> into the
Body of your Work. But if it be a long piece of work,
and you fear its length may wrong the middle, you must
hold it in your left hand, and lay it flat on the <hi>Anvil;</hi> but
so as the heated end intended to be <hi>up-set,</hi> may lie a little
over the further side of the <hi>Anvil,</hi> and then with your
<hi>Hand-hammer</hi> in your right hand, beat upon the heated
end of your work, minding that every stroak you take,
you hold your work stiff against the <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
Afterwards smooth it again with a <hi>Blood-red Heat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you are to Forge a <hi>Sholder</hi> on one, or each side of
your work, lay the Shank of your Iron at the place where
your <hi>Sholder</hi> must be on the edge of your <hi>Anvil</hi> (that edge
which is most convenient to your hand) that if more <hi>Shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
be to be made, turn them all successively, and hammer
your Iron so, as that the Shank of the Iron that lies on
the flat of the <hi>Anvil,</hi> feel as well the weight of your
Blows, as the <hi>Sholder</hi> at the edge of the <hi>Anvil;</hi> for
should you lay your blows on the edge of the <hi>Anvil</hi>
only, it would instead of flatting the Shank to make
the <hi>Sholder,</hi> cut your work through.</p>
                        <p>Your Work will sometimes require to have holes
punched in it at the Forge, you must then make a Steel
<hi>Punch</hi> to the size and shape of the hole you are to strike,
and harden the point of it without tempering, because
the heat of the Iron will soften it fast enough, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
too fast; but then you must re-harden it; then
taking a <hi>Blood-heat</hi> of your Iron, or if it be very large,
almost a <hi>Flame-heat;</hi> lay it upon your <hi>Anvil,</hi> and with
your left hand, place the point of the <hi>Punch</hi> where the
hole must be, and with the <hi>Hand-hammer</hi> in your right
hand punch the hole; or if your work be heavy, you
may hold it in your left hand, and with your Punch
fixed at the end of a <hi>Hoop-stick,</hi> or some such Wood,
hold the stick in your right hand, and place the point
of your <hi>Punch</hi> on the work where the hole must be,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41812:10"/>
and let another Man strike, till your Punch come pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
near the bottom of your work; which when it does,
the sides of your work round about the hole, will rise
from the Face of the <hi>Anvil,</hi> and your Punch will print
a bunching mark upon the hole of a <hi>Bolster,</hi> that is, a
thick Iron with a hole in it, and placing your Punch,
as before, strike it through. But you must note, that
as oft as you see your Punch heat, or change Colour,
you take it out of the hole, and pop it into Water to
re-harden it, or else it will batter in the hole you intend
to strike, and not only spoil it self, but the Work too,
by running aside in the Work. Having punched it
through on the one side, turn the other side of your work,
and with your Hammer set it flat and straight, and with
a <hi>Blood-heat</hi> punch it through on the other side also; so
shall that hole be fit for the <hi>File,</hi> or square bore, if the
curiosity of your purposed Work cannot allow it to
pass without filing. When your Work is Forged, do
not quench it in water to cool it, but throw it down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Floor,</hi> or <hi>Hearth,</hi> to cool of it self; for the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in water will harden it; as I shall shortly shew
you, when I come to the Tempering of Steel.</p>

                        <p>YOU may have occasion sometimes to <hi>Braze</hi> or <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
a piece of work; but it is used by Smiths only,
when their work is so thin, or small, that it will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<hi>Welding.</hi> To do this, take small pieces of Brass, and
lay them on the place that must be brazed, and strew a
little Glass beaten to powder on it to make it run the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and give it a <hi>Heat</hi> in the <hi>Forge,</hi> till (by sometimes
drawing it a little way out of the Fire) you see the Brass
run. But if your work be so small, or thin, that you may
fear the Iron will run as soon as the Brass, and so you
lose your work in the Fire, then you must make a <hi>Loam</hi>
of three parts Clay, and one part Horse-dung, and after
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41812:11"/>
they are wrought and mingled very well together in your
hands, wrap your work with the Brass, and a little beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Glass upon the place to be brazed close in the <hi>Loam,</hi>
and laying it a while upon the Hearth of the <hi>Forge</hi> to
dry, put the Lump into the Fire, and blow the <hi>Bellows</hi> to
it, till you perceive it have a full <hi>Heat,</hi> that is, till the
Lump look like a well burnt Coal of Fire; then take
it out of the Fire, and let it cool: Afterwards break it
up, and take out your Work.</p>
                        <p>Thus much of Forging in general. It remains now,

Uses, you may have occasion to apply them.</p>

                        <head>Of several Sorts of Iron, and their proper Uses.</head>
                        <p>IT is not my purpose, in this place, to tell you how
Iron is made, I shall deferr that till I come to treat of
Mettals, and their Refinings. Let it at present satisfie
those that know it not, that Iron is, by a violent Fire,
melted out of hard Stones, called <hi>Iron-Stones;</hi> of these
<hi>Iron-Stones,</hi> many Countries have great plenty. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it wasts such great quantities of Wood to draw the
Iron from them, it will not, in many Places, quit cost to
use them. In most parts of <hi>England,</hi> we have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of these <hi>Iron-stones;</hi> but our <hi>English</hi> Iron, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
a course sort of Iron, hard and brittle, fit for Fire-bars,
and other such course Uses; unless it be about
the Forrest of <hi>Dean,</hi> and some few Places more, where
the Iron proves very good.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Swedish</hi> Iron is of all Sorts, the best we use in <hi>England.</hi>
It is a fine tough sort of Iron, will best endure the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and is softest to file; and therefore most coveted by
Workmen, to work upon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Spanish</hi> Iron, would be as good <hi>Swedish</hi> Iron, were it
not subject to <hi>Red-sear,</hi> (as Workmen phrase it) that is to
crack betwixt hot and cold. Therefore when it falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your hands, you must tend it more earnestly at the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41812:11"/>
Forge. But tho' it be a good, tough, soft Iron, yet for
many Uses, Workmen will refuse it, because it is so ill, and
un-evenly wrought in the Bars, that it costs them a great
deal of labour to smooth it; but it is good for all great
works that require <hi>welding,</hi> as the bodies of Anvils, Sledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
large Bell-clappers, large Pestles for Mortars, and all
thick, strong Bars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is particularly chosen by
<hi>Anchor-Smiths,</hi> because it abides the Heat better than
other Iron, and when it is well wrought, is toughest.</p>
                        <p>There is some Iron comes from <hi>Holland</hi> (though in
no great quantity) but is made in <hi>Germany.</hi> This Iron
is called <hi>Dort Squares,</hi> only because it comes to us ftom
thence, and is wrought into square Bars three quarters
of an Inch square. It is a bad, course Iron, and only fit
for sleight Uses, as Window-Bars, Brewers-Bars, Fire-Bars,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is another sort of Iron used for making of <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
which of all Sorts is the soughtest and toughest:
But this Sort is not peculiar to any Country, but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
made where any Iron is made, though of the
worst sort; for it is the first Iron that runs from the <hi>Stone</hi>
when it is melting, and is only preserved from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Wyer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By what hath been said, you may see that the softest
and toughest Iron is the best: Therefore when you chuse
Iron, chuse such as bows oftenest before it break, which
is an Argument of Toughness; and see it break sound
within, be gray of Colour like broked Lead, and free
from such glistering Specks you see in broken <hi>Antimony,</hi>
no flaws or divisions in it; for these are Arguments that
it is sound, and well wrought at the Mill.</p>

                        <head>Of Filing in general.</head>
                        <p>THE several sorts of Files that are in common use are
the <hi>Square,</hi> the <hi>Flat,</hi> the <hi>three Square,</hi> the <hi>half Round,</hi>
the <hi>Round,</hi> the <hi>Thin File, &amp;c.</hi> All these shapes you must
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41812:12"/>
have of several <hi>Sizes,</hi> and of several <hi>Cuts.</hi> You must have
them of several sizes, as well because you may have several
sizes of work, as for that it sometimes falls out that one
piece of work may have many parts in it joined and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to one another, some of them great, and others
small: And you must have them of several <hi>Cuts,</hi> because
the <hi>Rough-tooth'd File</hi> cuts faster than the <hi>Bastard-tooth'd
File,</hi> the <hi>Fine-tooth'd File</hi> faster than the <hi>Smooth-tooth'd
File.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Rough</hi> or <hi>Course-tooth'd File</hi> (which if it be large,
is called a <hi>Rubber)</hi> is to take off the unevenness of your
work which the <hi>Hammer</hi> made in the Forging; the <hi>Bast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard-tooth'd
File</hi> is to take out of your work, the deep
Cuts or file-stroaks the <hi>Rough-file</hi> made; the <hi>Fine-tooth'd
file</hi> is to take out the cuts, or file-stroaks, the <hi>Bastard-file</hi>
made; and the <hi>Smooth-file</hi> is to take out those cuts, or
file-stroaks, that the <hi>fine File</hi> made.</p>
                        <p>Thus you see how the <hi>Files</hi> of several <hi>Cuts</hi> succeed
one another, till your Work is so smooth as it can be
filed. You may make it yet smoother with <hi>Emerick,
Tripoli, &amp;c.</hi> But of that in its proper place, because it
suits not with this Section of <hi>Filing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You must take care when you use the <hi>Rough File,</hi> that
you go very lightly over those dents the <hi>Hammer</hi> made
in your work, unless your work be forged somewhat of the
strongest, for the dents being irregularities in your work,
if you should file away as much in them, as you do off the
Eminencies or Risings, your work (whether it be straight
or circular) would be as irregular, as it was before you
filed it: And when you file upon the Prominent, or
rising Parts of you Work, with your <hi>course cut File,</hi>
you must also take care that you file them not more
away than you need, for you may easily be deceived;
because the <hi>course File</hi> cuts deep, and makes deep scrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the Work; and before you can take out those
deep scratches with your finer cut Files, those places
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41812:12"/>
where the Risings were when your work was forged,
may become dents to your Hammer dents; therefore
file not those Risings quite so low, as the dents the
Hammer made, but only so low, as that the scratches
the <hi>Rough-file</hi> makes may lie as low, or deep in your
work, as your Hammer dents do; for then, when you
come with your smoother Cut Files, after your <hi>rough
File,</hi> the scratches of your <hi>rough File,</hi> and your Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
stroaks, or dents, may both come out together.
But to do this with greater certainty, hold your File
so, that you may keep so much of the length of your
File as you can to rub, range, (or, as near range as
you can) upon the length of your work; for so shall
the File enter upon the second Rising on your work,
before it goes off the first, and will slip over, and not
touch the dent or hollow between the two Risings, till
your Risings are brought into a straight line with your
hollow dent. But of this more shall be said when I
come to the Practice of Filing, upon several particular
sorts of work.</p>
                        <p>If it be a Square Bar, (or such like) you are to file
upon, all its Angles, or Edges, must be left very sharp
and straight. Therefore your <hi>Vice</hi> being well set up, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to fore-going Directions, you must in your fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
athwart over the <hi>Chaps</hi> of the <hi>Vice,</hi> be sure to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
both your hands you hold the <hi>file</hi> in, truly Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal,
or flat over the Work; for should you let ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of your hands mount, the other would dip, and
the edge of that Square it dips upon would be taken
off; and should you let your hand move never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
circularly, both the Edges you file upon would be
taken off, and the Middle of your intended Flat, would
be left with a Rising on it. But this Hand-craft, you
must attain to by Practice; for it is the great Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Filing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41812:13"/>
If it be a round Piece, or Rod of Iron, you are to file
upon, what you were forbid upon Square Work, you
must perform on the Round; for you must dip your
Handle-hand, and mount your end-hand a little, and
laying pritting near the end of your File to the Work,
file circularly upon the Work, by mounting your Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-hand
by degrees, and dipping your End-hand, in
such manner, as when the Middle of your File comes
about the top of your Work, your File may be flat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and as you continue your stroaks forwards, still
keep your hands moving circularly till you have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
your full Stroak, that is, a Stroak the whole
length of the File. By this manner of Circular filing,
you keep your Piece, or Rod round; but should you
file flat upon the top of your work, so many times as
you shall remove, or turn your work in the <hi>Vice,</hi> so
many Flats, or Squares, you would have in your work;
which is contrary to your purpose.</p>
                        <p>When you thrust your <hi>File</hi> forwards lean heavy upon
on it, because the <hi>Teeth</hi> of the <hi>File</hi> are made to cut
forwards; but when you draw your <hi>File</hi> back, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
an other thrust, lift, or bear the File lightly just
above the work; for it cuts not coming back.</p>

                           <hi>Hinges,</hi> if they be small (as for Cup-board doors;
<hi>Boxes, &amp;c.)</hi> are cut out of cold Plate Iron with the <hi>a
Cold-Chissel,</hi> but you must mark the out-lines of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Hinge,</hi> as <hi>Fig. 1.</hi> the <hi>Cross-Garnet,</hi> either with
Chalk, or else rase upon the Plate with the corner of the
<hi>Cold-Chissel,</hi> or any other hardned Steel that will scratch
a bright stroke upon the Plate; and then laying the Plate
flat upon the <hi>Anvil,</hi> if the Plate be large, or upon the <hi>b
Stake,</hi> if the Plate be small, take the <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi> in your
left hand, and set the edge of it upon that Mark, or Rase,
and with the <hi>Hand-hammer</hi> in your right hand, strike up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the head of the <hi>Cold-Chissel,</hi> till you cut, or rather
punch the edge of the <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi> almost thro' the Plate
in that Place, I say, almost through, because, should you
strike it quite through, the edge of the <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi> would
be in danger of battering, or else breaking; for the <hi>Face</hi>
of the <hi>Anvil</hi> is hardned Steel, and a light blow upon
its <hi>Face</hi> would wrong the edge of the <hi>Cold-Chissel;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41812:16"/>
it sometimes happens, that the <hi>Anvil,</hi> or <hi>Stake,</hi> is
not all over so hard as it should be, and then the <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi>
would cut the <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Anvil,</hi> or <hi>Stake,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
spoil it: Therefore when the edge of the <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi>
comes pretty near the bottom of the Plate, you
must lay but light blows upon the <hi>cold Chissel;</hi> and yet you
must strike the edge of the <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi> so near through
the bottom of the Plate, that you may break the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
substance asunder with your Fingers, or with a
pair of <hi>Plyers,</hi> or sometimes by pinching the Plate in the
<hi>Vice,</hi> with the Cut place close to the Superficies of the
<hi>Chaps</hi> of the <hi>Vice;</hi> and then with your Fingers and
Thumb, or your whole hand, wriggle it quite asunder,
But having cut one breadth of the <hi>Cold-Chissel,</hi> remove
the edge of it forward in the Rase, and cut another
breadth, and so move it successively, till your whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
shape be cut out of the Plate.</p>
                        <p>When you cut out an <hi>Hinge,</hi> you must leave on the
length of the Plate AB in this Figure, Plate enough to
lap over for the <hi>Joints,</hi> I mean, to <hi>Turn,</hi> or <hi>Double</hi> about a
round Pin, so big as you intend the Pin of your <hi>Hinge</hi>
shall be, and also Plate enough to <hi>Weld</hi> upon the inside
of the <hi>Hinge</hi> below the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> of the <hi>Joint,</hi> that the <hi>Joint</hi>
may be strong.</p>
                        <p>The size, or diameter of the <hi>Pin-hole,</hi> ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twice the thickness of the Plate you make the
<hi>Hinge</hi> of, therefore lay a wyre of such a diameter towards
<figure/>
the end B, in this
figure on the <hi>Tial
piece,</hi> a-thwart
the Plate as CD,
and <hi>Double</hi> the
end of the Plate
B, over the wyre to lap over it, and reach as far as it can
upon the end A; then <hi>hammer</hi> the Plate that is lap'd over
the wyre close to the wyre, to make the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> round;
but if your Plate be thick, it will require the taking of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41812:16"/>
an <hi>Heat,</hi> to make it <hi>hammer</hi> the closer to the wyre, and
consequently make the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> the rounder: Your
work may also sometimes require to be Screwed into the
<hi>Vice,</hi> with the doubled end upwards, and the bottom side
of the wyre close against the <hi>Chaps</hi> of the <hi>Vice,</hi> and then
to <hi>hammer</hi> upon the very top of the <hi>Pin-hole,</hi> to round it
at the end also. When you have made the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> round
in the inside, take the <hi>Pin</hi> CD out of the <hi>Pin-hole,</hi> and put
the <hi>Joint-end</hi> of the <hi>Hinge</hi> into the Fire to make a <hi>Welding-heat;</hi>
which when it hath, snatch it quickly out of the
Fire, and <hi>hammer,</hi> or <hi>weld,</hi> the end B upon the <hi>Tail-piece</hi> A
till they be incorporate together. But you must have a
care that you <hi>hammer</hi> not upon the Plate of the <hi>Pin-hole,</hi>
lest you stop it up, or batter it; when it is well Welded,
you must again put in the <hi>Pin</hi> CD, and if it will not well
go into the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> (because you may perhaps have <hi>ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd</hi>
either upon it, or too near it, and so have somewhat
closed it (you must force it in with your <hi>hammer;</hi> and if
it require, take a <hi>Blood-heat,</hi> or a <hi>Flame-heat,</hi> of the <hi>Joint</hi>
end) and then force the <hi>Pin</hi> into the <hi>Pin-hole,</hi> till you
find the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> is again round within, and that the <hi>Pin,</hi>
or Wyre, turn evenly about within it.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards with a <hi>Punch</hi> of hardned Steel (as you
were taught <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 11. 12.) Punch</hi> the <hi>Nail-holes</hi> in
the Plate; or if your Plate be very thin, you may <hi>Punch</hi>
them with a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to make the <hi>Joint,</hi> by cutting a notch in the middle
of the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> between DD in Plate 2. on the <hi>Cross,</hi> as at

evenly and smoothly without shaking on the <hi>Pin;</hi> which
if they do, the <hi>Joint</hi> is made; if they do not, you must
examine where the Fault is, and taking the <hi>Pin</hi> out,
mend the fault in the <hi>Joint.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then <hi>File</hi> down all the irregularities the <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi>
made on the edges of your Work, and (if the curiosity of
work require it) <hi>file</hi> also the outer flat of your work. But
<hi>Smiths</hi> that make quantities of <hi>Hinges,</hi> do <hi>brighten</hi> them,
(as they call it) yet they seldom <hi>file</hi> them, but <hi>Grinde</hi>
them on a Grind-stone till they become <hi>bright, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having finished the <hi>Joint,</hi> put the <hi>Pin</hi> in again; but
take care it be a little longer than the depth of the <hi>Joint,</hi>
because you must batter the ends of the <hi>Pin</hi> over the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
edges of the <hi>Pin-hole,</hi> that the <hi>Pin</hi> may not drop out
when either edge of the <hi>Cross</hi> is turned upwards.</p>
                        <p>The chiefest curiosity in the making these, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
all other <hi>Hinges</hi> is, 1. That the <hi>Pin-hole</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
round, and not too wide for the <hi>Pin. 2.</hi> That the
<hi>Joints</hi> are let exactly into one another, that they have
no play between them, lest they shake upwards
or downwards, nor yet are forced too hard into one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
lest when they are nailed on the door, the <hi>Joint</hi>
be in danger of breaking. 3. That the <hi>Cross,</hi> and the
<hi>Tail</hi> lie on the under-side exactly flat, for should they
wrap out of flat when they are nailed on, the Nails
would draw the <hi>Joint</hi> a-wry, and not only make it
move hard, and unevenly, but by oft Opening and
Shutting break the <hi>Joint. 4.</hi> If your Work be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be curious, the true <hi>Square-filing</hi> the upper-side,
as you were taught <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 14, 15, 16.</hi> is a great
Ornament.</p>

                        <p>First, Cut out of an Iron Plate with a <hi>Cold-Chissel,</hi> the
size and shape of the <hi>Main-Plate,</hi> as you were taught to
cut the <hi>Cross</hi> and <hi>Tail-piece</hi> of the <hi>Cross-Garnet;</hi> then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what depth you intend the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key</hi> shall have,
and set that depth off on the <hi>Main-Plate,</hi> by leaving about
half an Inch of Plate between the bottom of the <hi>Key-hole,</hi>
and the lower edge of the <hi>Main-Plate,</hi> as at C (or more
or less, according to the size of the <hi>Lock.)</hi> Then measure
with a pair of <hi>Compasses</hi> between the bottom of the <hi>Bit,</hi>
and the <hi>Centre</hi> of your <hi>Key</hi> (or your intended <hi>Key)</hi> and set
that distance off from C to B, near the middle between
the two ends of the <hi>Main-Plate,</hi> and with the <hi>a Prick-punch</hi>
make there a mark to set one <hi>foot</hi> of your <hi>Compasses</hi> in,
then opening your <hi>Compasses</hi> to the middle of the <hi>Bit</hi> of
your intended <hi>Key,</hi> as to D, describe the Arch EDE for
the true place the <hi>Top-hoop</hi> must stand on.</p>
                        <p>Then cut out another piece of Plate as AAAA in <hi>Fig. 3.</hi>
for a <hi>Cover-plate,</hi> with two pieces one on each side, long
enough to make <hi>Studs</hi> of to turn downwards, and then
outward again as FF, GG, that the <hi>Cover-plate</hi> may stand
off the <hi>Main-Plate,</hi> the breadth of the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key;</hi>
and at the two end of these <hi>Studs</hi> Punch holes, as GG,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41812:18"/>
to <hi>Rivet</hi> the <hi>Cover-Plate</hi> into the <hi>Main-Plate.</hi> In the
middle of this Plate make the <hi>Centre,</hi> as at B, then open
your <hi>Compasses</hi> to three quarters the length of the <hi>Bit,</hi>
and half the Diameter of the <hi>Shank</hi> of the <hi>Key,</hi> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
one <hi>foot</hi> in the Point B, describe with the other
<hi>foot</hi> the Arch DCD for the true place of the <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
then set your <hi>Compasses</hi> to a little more than
half the Diameter of the <hi>Shank,</hi> and place one <hi>foot</hi> (as
before) in the <hi>Centre</hi> B, and with the other <hi>foot</hi> describe
the small Arch E, for the true place the <hi>Step-ward,</hi> or (as
some call it) the <hi>Dap-ward</hi> must stand: So have you the
true places of the <hi>Wards,</hi> for an ordinary <hi>Spring-Lock;</hi>
you may (if the depth of your <hi>Bit</hi> will bear it) put more
<hi>Wards</hi> in your Plates. But you must note, that the more
<hi>Wards</hi> you put in, the weaker you make your <hi>Key;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that to every <hi>Ward</hi> on the Plates, you must make
a slit, or <hi>Ward</hi> in the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key;</hi> and the more
<hi>Wards</hi> you make, the weaker the Iron of the <hi>Bit</hi> will
be; and then if the <hi>Bolt</hi> shoot not easily backwards, or
forwards, the <hi>Bit</hi> may be in danger of breaking.</p>
                        <p>Having marked on your Plates the places of all your
<hi>Wards,</hi> you must take thin Plate, and with <hi>Hammering</hi>
and <hi>Filing</hi> make them both <hi>b Hammer-hard,</hi> and of equal
thickness all the way. Then <hi>file</hi> one edge very straight, by
laying a <hi>straight Ruler</hi> just within the edge of it, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or racing with a point of hardned Steel, a bright line
by the side of the <hi>Ruler; File</hi> away the edge of the Plate
to that line, then draw (as before) another straight line
parallel to the first straight line, or which is all one, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to the filed Edge, just of the breadth you intend
the <hi>Wards</hi> shall be, and File as before, only, you must
leave two, or sometimes three <hi>Studs</hi> upon this Plate, one
near each end, and the other in the middle, to <hi>Rivet</hi> into
the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> to keep the <hi>Ward</hi> fixt in its place. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you must take care when you elect this thin piece of
Plate, that it be broad enough for the <hi>Ward,</hi> and these
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41812:19"/>
Studs too. Then laying the Plate a-thwart the <hi>Pike</hi> of
the <hi>Bickern,</hi> hold your hand even with the <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>Bic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kern,</hi>
and <hi>hammer</hi> this Plate down somewhat by the side
of the <hi>Pike,</hi> and by degrees you may (with care taken)
bring it unto a circular form, just of the size of that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
you described on the <hi>Main-Plate;</hi> which when you
have done, you must apply this <hi>Ward</hi> to the Circle you
described on the <hi>Main-Plate,</hi> setting it in the position
you intend it shall be fixed, and marking with a steel
Point where the <hi>Studs</hi> stand upon that Circle, in those
marks <hi>punch</hi> holes to <hi>Rivet</hi> the <hi>Studs</hi> to. Work so by
all the other <hi>Wards.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you have a <hi>Pin</hi> to the <hi>Lock, Punch</hi> a hole through
the <hi>Centre</hi> on the <hi>Cover-Plate,</hi> somewhat smaller than
the Wyre you are to make your <hi>Pin</hi> of, because you
may then <hi>file</hi> one end of the <hi>Pin</hi> away to a <hi>Shank,</hi> which
must fit the smaller hole on the Plate, and the whole
thickness of the <hi>Pin</hi> will be a <hi>Sholder,</hi> which will keep
the <hi>Pin</hi> steddy in the <hi>Centre-hole</hi> of the Plate, when the
<hi>Pin</hi> is <hi>Rivetted</hi> into the Plate. But because there is some
Skill to be used in <hi>Rivetting,</hi> I shall, before I proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
farther, teach you.</p>

                        <head>The manner of Rivetting.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rivetting</hi> is to batter the Edges of a <hi>Shank</hi> over a
Plate, or other Iron, the <hi>Shank</hi> is let into, so as the
Plate, or other Iron, may be clinched close, and fixed
between the battering at the end of the Shank and the
Sholder. So that</p>
                        <p>When you <hi>Rivet</hi> a <hi>Pin</hi> into a hole, your <hi>Pin</hi> must have a
<hi>Sholder</hi> to it thicker than the hole is wide, that the <hi>Sholder</hi>
slip not through the hole, as well as the <hi>Shank;</hi> but the
<hi>Shank</hi> of the <hi>Pin</hi> must be exactly of the size of the hole
the Shank must be <hi>Rivetted</hi> into, and somewhat longer
than the Plate is thick; <hi>file</hi> the end of the Shank flat, so
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41812:19"/>
shall the Edges of the end, the easilier batter over the
Plate; then put your Shank into the hole wherein it is to
be <hi>Rivetted,</hi> but be sure you force the <hi>Shank</hi> close up to
the <hi>Sholder;</hi> then turn the top of this <hi>Sholder</hi> downwards
(Plate and all) upon your <hi>Stake,</hi> but lay it so, as that the
Sholder lie solid, and the Shank, at the same time, stand
directly upright, and with your left hand, keep your
work bearing hard upon the flat, or <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>Stake.</hi>
Then holding your <hi>hammer</hi> in your right hand, hold the
edge of the <hi>face</hi> of it dripping a-slope from the right
hand outwards, and lay pretty light blows upon the
edge of the end of the Shank, turning with your left
hand your work round to the <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>Hammer,</hi> till
you have battered the edges of the <hi>Shank</hi> quite round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
but this is seldom done, with once turning your
work about; therefore you may thus work it round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and again, till you find it is pretty well <hi>Rivetted;</hi>
then lay heavier blows upon it, sometimes with the <hi>face,</hi>
sometimes with the <hi>Pen</hi> of the <hi>hammer,</hi> till the end of the
Shank is battered effectually over the Plate.</p>
                        <p>One main consideration in <hi>Rivetting</hi> is, that the <hi>Pin</hi>
you <hi>rivet</hi> in, stand upright to the Plate, or other Iron you
<hi>rivet</hi> it upon; for if it do not stand upright, you will be
forced to set it upright after it is <hi>rivetted,</hi> either in the
<hi>Vice,</hi> or with your <hi>Plyers,</hi> or with your <hi>Hammer,</hi> and that
may, if your Plate be thin, bow it, or if it be thick, break
the Sank, or else the Sholder of your <hi>Rivet,</hi> and so you
lose your labour, and sometimes spoil your Work.</p>
                        <p>Another consideration is, that when you <hi>rivet</hi> a <hi>Pin</hi> to
any Plate, and you fear it may afterwards twist about by
some force that may be offered it, you must, to provide
against this danger, <hi>file</hi> the <hi>Shank</hi> you intend to <hi>Rivet,</hi>
either Square, or Triangular, and make the hole in the
Plate you <hi>rivet</hi> it into, of the same size and form, and
then <hi>rivet</hi> in the <hi>Shank,</hi> as before. There are two ways
to make your Hole, Square or Triangular, one is by <hi>filing</hi>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41812:20"/>
it into these forms, when it is first Punched round; the
other by making a <hi>Punch</hi> of Steel, of the size and shape
of the <hi>Shank</hi> you are to <hi>rivet,</hi> and <hi>punching</hi> that <hi>punch</hi>
into the Plate, make the same form.</p>
                        <p>Now to return where I left off. The <hi>Pins</hi> and <hi>Shanks</hi> of
these <hi>Wards</hi> must be made of a long square form, because,
(the Plates of the <hi>Wards</hi> being thin) should you make
them no broader than the Plate is thick, the <hi>Studs,</hi> or
<hi>Shanks</hi> would be too weak to hold the <hi>Wards,</hi> therefore
you must make the <hi>Rivetting-shank</hi> three or four times,
or sometimes more, as broad as the Plate is thick, and
then <hi>rivet</hi> them in, as you were taught just now.</p>
                        <p>Then place the <hi>Cover-plate</hi> upon the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> so as
the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Cover-plate,</hi> may stand directly over and
against the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> and make marks
through the hole GG, of the <hi>Studs</hi> of the <hi>Cover-plate</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> and on those marks Punch holes, and
fit two <hi>Pins</hi> into them, to fasten the <hi>Cover-plate</hi> on to
the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> but you must not yet <hi>rivet</hi> them down,
till the <hi>Key-hole</hi> be made, because this <hi>Cover-plate</hi> would
then stop the progress of the <hi>File</hi> through the <hi>Main-plate,</hi>
when you <hi>file</hi> the <hi>Key-hole.</hi> When you have placed the
<hi>Cover-plate</hi> upon the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> and fitted it on with
<hi>Pins,</hi> so, as you may take it off, and put it on again, as
your Work may require, you must <hi>Punch</hi> the <hi>key-hole,</hi> or
rather <hi>drill</hi> two holes close by one another, if the <hi>Key-hole</hi>
falls near the <hi>Wards,</hi> because <hi>Punching</hi> may be apt to
set the <hi>Wards</hi> out of form, and with small <hi>Files,</hi> file the
two holes into one another, to make the hole big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to come at it with bigger <hi>Files,</hi> and then file
your <hi>Key-hole</hi> to your intended size and shape.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Key-hole</hi> being finished, <hi>forge</hi> your <hi>Key,</hi> as you were
taught, <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 8.</hi> and if your <hi>Key</hi> is to have a <hi>Pin-hole,
drill</hi> the hole in the middle of the end of the <hi>shank,</hi> then
<hi>file</hi> the <hi>Wards,</hi> or Slits in the <hi>Bit</hi> with thin <hi>Files;</hi> yet
sometimes Smiths <hi>Punch,</hi> or <hi>Cut</hi> them with a <hi>Cold-Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi>
                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41812:20"/>
at the same distances from the middle of the <hi>Pin-hole</hi>
in the end of the Shank (which is the same <hi>Centre</hi>
which was made before, in the <hi>Main-plate</hi> on the <hi>Cover-plate)</hi>
which you placed the <hi>Wards</hi> at, from the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi>
of the <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Cover-plate.</hi> But before you <hi>file</hi>
these <hi>Wards</hi> too deep into the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key,</hi> make
trials, by putting the <hi>Bit</hi> into the <hi>Key-hole,</hi> whether the
<hi>Wards</hi> in the <hi>Bit,</hi> will agree with the <hi>Wards</hi> on the Plates,
which if they do, you may boldly cut them to the
depth of the <hi>Wards</hi> on the Plate; if not, you must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
your course till they do; but you must take great
care in cutting the <hi>Wards</hi> down straight, and square to
the sides of the <hi>Bit;</hi> for if they be not Cut down
straight, the <hi>Wards</hi> on the Plates, will not fall in with
the <hi>Wards</hi> in the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key;</hi> and if they be not
square to the sides of the <hi>Bit,</hi> the <hi>Bit</hi> will not only
be weaker than it need be, but it will shew unhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely,
and like a Botch to the Eye.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Cross</hi> and <hi>Hookwards</hi> is made, or, at least, entred
at the <hi>Forge,</hi> when the Iron hath a <hi>Blood,</hi> or almost a <hi>Flame
Heat,</hi> yet sometimes Smiths do it on cold Iron, with a
thin <hi>Chissel,</hi> as you was taught <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 11, 12.</hi> But
you must take care that your <hi>Chissel</hi> be neither too
thick, or too broad, for this Punching of <hi>Wards</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to give the thin <hi>Files</hi> entrance to the work; which
entrance when you have, you may easily <hi>file</hi> your <hi>Cross,</hi>
or <hi>Hook-wards,</hi> wider or deeper, as your Work may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
but if your <hi>Chissel</hi> be too broad, or too thick, it
will make the <hi>Wards</hi> in the <hi>Bit</hi> too long, or too wide,
and then (as I said before,) the <hi>Bit</hi> of your <hi>Key</hi> will
prove weaker than it needs to be.</p>
                        <p>Having made the <hi>Wards</hi> on the Plate, and in the <hi>Bit</hi> of

thick and square at the end that shoots into the

                           <hi>Bolt</hi> that lies between the two <hi>Staples</hi> on the <hi>Main-plate,</hi>
may be made very thin inwards, that is, the side that lies
towards the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> which because it cannot be seen
when the <hi>Bolt</hi> is fixed upon the Plate, I have made a
Figure of it, and turned the inside to view, as in <hi>Fig. 4.</hi>
where you may see, that the end A, hath a considerable
substance of Iron to guard the whole Door, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
and B is a square <hi>Stud,</hi> which doth as well keep the
outside flat of the <hi>Bolt</hi> on the Range, as serve for a <hi>Stud</hi>
for the <hi>Spring</hi> H in <hi>Fig. 2.</hi> to press hard against, and shoot
the <hi>Bolt</hi> forwards: This <hi>Bolt</hi> must be wrought straight
on all its sides, except the Topside, which must be
wrought straight only as far as the <hi>Sholder</hi> G, called the
<hi>Toe,</hi> or <hi>Nab</hi> of the <hi>Bolt,</hi> which rises, as you see in the
Figure, considerably high, above the straight on the Top
of the <hi>Bolt:</hi> The office of this <hi>Nab,</hi> is to receive the
bottom of the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Key,</hi> when in turning it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
it shoots the <hi>Bolt</hi> backwards, or forwards.</p>
                        <p>Having <hi>forged</hi> and <hi>filed</hi> the <hi>Bolt,</hi> you must fit the hollow
side of it towards the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> at that distance from the
<hi>Key-hole,</hi> that when the <hi>Key</hi> is put into the <hi>Key-hole,</hi> and
turned towards the <hi>Bolt,</hi> the bottom of the <hi>Bit</hi> may fall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to the bottom of the <hi>Nab,</hi> and shoot the <hi>Bolt</hi> back so
much, as it needs enter the <hi>Staple</hi> in the <hi>Door-frame.</hi> And
having found this true place for the <hi>Bolt,</hi> you must with
square <hi>Staples,</hi> just fit to contain the <hi>Bolt</hi> with an easie
play, fasten these <hi>Staples,</hi> by <hi>Rivetting</hi> them with the
<hi>Bolt</hi> within them, one near the <hi>Bolt</hi> end, the other near
the <hi>Nab</hi> end, as at LL to the <hi>Main-plate.</hi>

the <hi>Pin</hi> of the <hi>Tumbler</hi> into, that it may move upon it,

It is fixed at the bottom of the <hi>Main-plate,</hi> by two small
Shanks proceeding from that edge of the <hi>Spring</hi> that lies

                        <p>THE Shank of the <hi>Screw</hi> for Doors, and many other

because it must be let into a square hole, that it may not

as near the size of the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Screw-pin</hi> as you can,
and taking a <hi>Flame-heat</hi> of it, lay so much of this Bar as

do not strike your Iron on this side the edge of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi>
lest you cut the Iron, as I told you <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 11.</hi>
Thus, at once, you will have two sides of your Shank

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41812:22"/>

give it another <hi>Heat,</hi> and lay one of the unwrought sides
upon the hither-side of the <hi>Anvil,</hi> just to the <hi>Head,</hi> and
<hi>hammer</hi> that down, as before, so shall the two other
square sides be made; then <hi>hammer</hi> down the Corners of
so much of this Shank, as you intend for the <hi>Screw-pin,</hi>
and round it, as near as you can, with the <hi>Hammer;</hi> set
then the <hi>Chissel</hi> to the thickness you intend the <hi>Head</hi> shall

it be quite cut off. If the Sholder be not square enough,
hold it in your <hi>square-nos'd Tongs,</hi> and take another <hi>Heat,</hi>
and with speed (lest your Work cool) screw the Shank
into the <hi>Vice,</hi> so as the Sholder may fall flat upon the

your self with a <hi>hole</hi> in your <hi>Screw-plate</hi> (that is, such

indeed turn about the <hi>Screw-pin,</hi> but not cut any <hi>Grooves,</hi>

in the <hi>Vice,</hi> so as that the <hi>Screw-pin</hi> may stand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
upright, and take the <hi>handle</hi> of the <hi>Screw-plate</hi> in
your Right-hand, and lay that <hi>hole</hi> flat upon the <hi>Screw-pin,</hi>
and press it pretty hard down over it, and turn the
<hi>Screw-plate</hi> evenly about with its <hi>handle</hi> towards you,
from the Right towards the Left-hand, so shall the outer
<hi>Threds</hi> of the <hi>Srew-plate</hi> cut <hi>Grooves</hi> into the <hi>Screw-pin,</hi>
and the substance of the Iron on the <hi>Screw-pin,</hi> will fill up
the <hi>Grooves</hi> of the <hi>Screw-plate,</hi> and be a <hi>Thred</hi> upon the
<hi>Screw-pin.</hi> But take this for Caution, that, as I told you,
you must not make your <hi>Screw-pin</hi> too small, because the
<hi>Screw-plate</hi> will not then cut it, so if you make it too
big (if it do enter the <hi>Screw-plate</hi> where it is Taper) it
will endanger the breaking it, or, if it do not break it,
yet the <hi>Screw-plate</hi> will, after it gets a little below the
Tapering, go no farther, but work and wear off the
<hi>Thred</hi> again it made about the tapering.</p>
                        <p>To fit the <hi>Pin</hi> therefore to a true size, I, in my Practise,
use to try into what <hi>hole</hi> of the <hi>Screw-plate,</hi> the <hi>Tap</hi> or
place of the <hi>Tap,</hi> (if it be a tapering <hi>Tap,)</hi> I make the <hi>Nut</hi>
with, will just slide through; <hi>(Threds</hi> and all;) (which
generally in most <hi>Screw-plates</hi> is the <hi>hole</hi> next above that
to be used) for then turning my <hi>Pin</hi> about in that <hi>hole,</hi> if
the <hi>Pin</hi> be irregularly <hi>filed,</hi> or but a little too big on any
part of it, the <hi>Threds</hi> of that <hi>Hole</hi> will cut small marks
upon the <hi>Pin,</hi> on the irregular places, or where it is
too big; so that afterwards <hi>filing</hi> those marks just off,
I do, at once, <hi>file</hi> my <hi>Pin</hi> truly round, and small e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to fit the <hi>Hole</hi> I make my <hi>Screw-pin</hi> with.</p>
                        <p>As the <hi>Hole</hi> of the <hi>Screw-plate</hi> must be fitted to the
<hi>Screw-pin,</hi> so must the <hi>Screw-tap</hi> that makes the <hi>Screw</hi>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41812:23"/>
in the <hi>Nut,</hi> be fitted to the round <hi>hole</hi> of the <hi>Nut;</hi> but
that <hi>Tap</hi> must be of the same size of your <hi>Screw-pin</hi>
too, which you may try by the same <hi>hole</hi> of the <hi>Screw-plate</hi>
you made the <hi>Screw-pin</hi> with. <hi>Screw</hi> the <hi>Nut</hi> in
the <hi>Vice</hi> directly flat, that the <hi>hole</hi> may stand upright,
and put the <hi>Screw-tap</hi> upright into the <hi>hole;</hi> then if
your <hi>Screw-tap</hi> have an <hi>handle,</hi> turn it by the <hi>handle</hi>
hard round in the <hi>Hole,</hi> so will the <hi>Screw-tap</hi> work it
self into the <hi>Hole,</hi> and make <hi>Grooves</hi> in it to fit the
<hi>Threds</hi> of the <hi>Screw-pin.</hi> But if the <hi>Screw-tap</hi> have no
<hi>handle,</hi> then it hath its upper end filed to a long square,
to fit into an hollow square, made near the <hi>handle</hi> of
the <hi>Screw-plate;</hi> put that long square hole, over the
long square on the top of the <hi>Tap,</hi> and then by turn-ing
about the <hi>Screw-plate,</hi> you will also turn about the
<hi>Tap</hi> in the <hi>hole,</hi> and make <hi>Grooves</hi> and <hi>Threds</hi> in the
<hi>Nut.</hi>

                        <p>THE <hi>Threds</hi> of <hi>Screws,</hi> when they are bigger than can
be made in <hi>Screw-plates,</hi> are called <hi>Worms.</hi> They
consist in length, breadth and depth; the length of a
<hi>Worm</hi> begins at the one end of the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and ends at
the other; the breadth of the <hi>Worm,</hi> is contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
any two <hi>Grooves</hi> on the <hi>Spindle, viz.</hi> The upper
and under <hi>Groove</hi> of the <hi>Worm,</hi> in every part of the <hi>Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;</hi>
the depth of the <hi>Worm,</hi> is cut into the Diameter of
the <hi>Spindle, viz.</hi> The depth, between the outside of the

The depth ought to be about the one Seventh Part
of the Diameter, on each side the <hi>Spindle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You ought to make the <hi>Groove</hi> wider than the <hi>Worm</hi>
is broad, because the <hi>Worm</hi> being cut out of the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
piece with the <hi>Spindle,</hi> will be as strong as the <hi>Worm</hi>
in the <hi>Nut,</hi> tho' the <hi>Worm</hi> on the <hi>Spindle</hi> be smaller; for
you cannot come at the <hi>Worm</hi> in the <hi>Nut,</hi> to cut it with
<hi>Files,</hi> as you may the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and therefore you must
either <hi>Turn</hi> up a Rod of Iron, to twist round about the
<hi>Grooves</hi> on the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and then take it off, and <hi>Braze</hi> it
into the <hi>Nut,</hi> or else you must <hi>Cast</hi> a <hi>Nut</hi> of <hi>Brass</hi> upon
the <hi>Spindle,</hi> which will neither way be so strong as the
<hi>Worm</hi> cut out of the whole Iron, by so much as <hi>Brass</hi> is a
weaker Mettal than Iron, and therefore it is that you
ought to allow the <hi>Worm</hi> in the <hi>Nut,</hi> a greater
breadth than the <hi>Worm</hi> on the <hi>Spindle,</hi> that the strength
of both may, as near as you can, be equallized; for
both being put to equal force, ought to have equal
strength. The <hi>Worm</hi> may very well be the One Seventh
Part smaller than the <hi>Groove</hi> is wide, as aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>Having considered what breadth the <hi>Worm</hi> on the
<hi>Spindle</hi> shall have, take a small thin Plate of Brass, or
Iron, and <hi>file</hi> a square notch at the end of it, just so
wide, and so deep, as your <hi>Worm</hi> is to be broad and
deep, and <hi>file</hi> the sides of the Plate that this notch stands
between, just to the width of the <hi>Groove.</hi> This Plate,
must be a <hi>Gage</hi> to <hi>file</hi> your <hi>Worm</hi> and <hi>Groove</hi> to equal
breadth by; then draw a straight and upright line the
whole length of the <hi>Spindle;</hi> divide from this line the
Circumference of the whole <hi>Spindle</hi> into eight equal
parts, and through those Divisions, draw seven Lines
more parallel to the first Line; then open your <hi>Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
just to the breadth of one <hi>Worm,</hi> and one <hi>Groove,</hi> and
set off that distance so oft as you can, from the one end
of the Spindle to the other, (but I should first have told
you, that the end of your Spindle must be truly square
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41812:24"/>
to the outside) and with a <hi>Prick-Punch,</hi> make a mark
to every setting off on that line: Do the like to all the
other straight upright Lines. Note, that you may
chuse one of these eight upright lines for the first, and
make the next towards your left hand, the second (but
then the first must stand towards you) and the next
that, the third, and so on. And the top mark of every
one of these upright straight Lines, shall be called the
first Mark, the next under that the second Mark, the
third, the third Mark, and so downwards in Order
and Number.</p>
                        <p>Having marked one of these eight Lines at the top
of the <hi>Spindle,</hi> to begin the winding of the <hi>Worm</hi> at,
with a Black-lead Pencil, draw a line from that Mark
to the second Mark, on the next upright line towards
the left hand, from thence continue drawing on with
your Pencil to the third Mark, on the third upright
line, draw on still to the fourth Mark, on the fourth
upright line, and so onwards, till you have drawn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the eight straight lines, which when you have done,
you must still continue on, drawing downwards to each
lower Mark on each successive upright line, till you
have drawn your <hi>Worm</hi> from end to end: Then exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
as well as you can, by your Eye, whether the
<hi>Worm</hi> you have carried on from Mark to Mark with the
Black-lead Pencil, do not break into Angles, which if
it do any where, you must mend it in that place: Then
with the edge of an <hi>half-round File,</hi> file a small line in
that Black-lead line, and be sure that the line you are
<hi>filing,</hi> run exactly through all the Marks that the Black-lead
Pencil should have run through (if it did not, for
want of good guidance of the hand.) This small line is
only for a guide to cut the <hi>Groove</hi> down by; for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a <hi>Screw</hi> is, indeed nothing else, but the cutting
the <hi>Groove</hi> down, for then the <hi>Worm</hi> remains: But you
must not <hi>file</hi> in this small line, but leave it as a guide
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41812:24"/>
to lie on the middle of the <hi>Worm</hi> (as I said before):
Therefore to cut down the <hi>Groove,</hi> take a <hi>Cold-Chissel,</hi>
somewhat thinner than you intend the <hi>Groove</hi> shall be
wide, <hi>viz.</hi> about the thickness of the breadth of the
<hi>Worm,</hi> and, with heavy blows, cut out the <hi>Groove</hi> pretty
near. The reason why you should not offer to cut the
<hi>Grooves</hi> to their full width at the first, is, because your
Hand may carry the <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi> somewhat awry, and
should your <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi> be as thick as the <hi>Groove</hi> is wide,
you could not smooth the Irregularities out, without
making the <hi>Worm</hi> narrower than you intended it: Then
with a <hi>Flat-file</hi> open and smooth the <hi>Groves, filing</hi> in the
middle between the two next fine lines cut by the <hi>Half-round
File,</hi> till you have wrought the <hi>Spindle</hi> from end
to end, so shall the <hi>Worm</hi> remain. But you must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that though the <hi>Groove</hi> be cut, it is therefore fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
for now you must begin to use the thin <hi>Plate-Gage,</hi>
and try First, whether the <hi>Worm</hi> have equal breadth all
the way. Secondly, whether rhe <hi>Groove</hi> have equal
breadth all the way. And Thirdly, whether the <hi>Groove</hi>
have equal depth all the way; and whereever you find
the <hi>Worm</hi> too broad, you must <hi>file</hi> it thinner, and where
the <hi>Groove</hi> is not deep enough, <hi>file</hi> it deeper; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in cutting down the <hi>Groove</hi> you may observe, that
if, at first, you <hi>file</hi> the <hi>Worm</hi> ne'er so little too narrow,
or the <hi>Groove</hi> ne'er so little too deep, you shall have all
the rest of the <hi>Worm,</hi> or <hi>Groove,</hi> to <hi>file</hi> over again; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the whole <hi>Worm</hi> must be wrought to the breadth
of the smallest part of it, and the whole <hi>Groove</hi> to the
depth of the deepest place all the way, especially if the
<hi>Nut</hi> be to be <hi>Cast</hi> in <hi>Brass</hi> upon the <hi>Spindle;</hi> because the
Mettal running close to the <hi>Spindle</hi> will bind on that
place, and not come off it; but if the <hi>Nut</hi> be not to be
<hi>Cast</hi> in <hi>Brass,</hi> but only hath a <hi>Worm</hi> brazed into it, this
niceness is not so absolutely necessary, because that
<hi>Worm</hi> is first <hi>Turned up,</hi> and bowed into the <hi>Grooves</hi> of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41812:25"/>
the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and you may try that before it is <hi>Braz'd</hi>
into the <hi>Nut,</hi> and if it go not well about, you may
mend, or botch it, either by <hi>Hammering,</hi> or <hi>Filing,</hi> or
both.</p>

about it, as <hi>Coining-Presses,</hi> and <hi>Printing-Presses</hi>
have, that they may not wear out too fast, you must
divide the Circumference into three or four equal parts;
and each of these equal parts, into two equal parts,
and having straight upright lines, drawn as before, begin
a <hi>Worm</hi> at each of those three, or four Divisions, on the
Circumference, and considering the breadth of your
<hi>Worm,</hi> and width of your <hi>Groove,</hi> measure that width
so oft as you can on all the upright lines, and making
Marks on those, at each Setting off, draw, as before, a
line from the end of the <hi>Spindle,</hi> on the first upright
line to the Mark below it, which is the second Mark
on the second upright line, from thence to the third
Mark, on the third upright line, and so on to the other
end of the <hi>Spindle.</hi> Having drawn the first <hi>Worm,</hi>
work the other <hi>Worms</hi> as this.</p>

as you were taught, <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</hi> and
then file it, as you were taught, <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 14, 15, 16.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>top</hi> and <hi>bottom Pieces</hi> are let into square holes at the

and <hi>bottom Pieces</hi> with two small Squares towards the ends
of them, and two round ends for <hi>Screw-pins,</hi> beyond those
squares. The small squares are to be fitted into square
holes into the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides,</hi> and the round <hi>Screw-pins</hi>
are to make <hi>Screws</hi> of, to which a square <hi>Nut</hi> is to be fitted
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41812:28"/>
to draw the <hi>top</hi> and <hi>bottom Pieces</hi> close and tight up to the
insides of the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides.</hi> The manner of filing of
these square Ends you were, in part, taught, <hi>Numb.</hi> II.
<hi>fol. 15, 16.</hi> and <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 29.</hi> but another way is by
trying your Work with an Instrument, called, by Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
a <hi>Square,</hi> as you see described in this Figure.</p>

                        <head>Of the Square, and its Use.</head>
                        <p>The sides ABC are called the <hi>Outer-Square;</hi>
                           <figure/>
the sides DEF the <hi>Inner-Square.</hi>
Its use is thus. If your work, as in this case,
be an <hi>Outer-square,</hi> you must use the <hi>Inner-square,</hi>
DEF to try it by; applying either
the side ED, or DF (but suppose the side
ED) to one of the sides of your work, chuse
the flattest and truest wrought) if neither of the sides be
flat, make one of them flat, as you were taught, <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol.
15, 16.</hi> if then you find the side DF of your <hi>Square</hi> lie all
the way even upon the adjoining side of your work, you
may conclude those sides are Square; but if the adjoining
side of your work comply not all the way with the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
side of the <hi>Square,</hi> you must file away your work where
the <hi>Square</hi> rides upon it, till the whole side be wrought
to comply with the adjoining side of the <hi>Square,</hi> that is,
till both the sides of your work agree with both the sides
of the <hi>Squares,</hi> when they are applied to one another. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
tried two sides square, make a third side of your
work square, by applying one of the sides of the <hi>Square</hi> to
one of those sides of your work, that are already made
square, and, as before, try the third untried side, and
make that Square; and by the same Rule make the
the fourth side square.</p>
                        <p>If the work you are to file be an hollow square, you
must apply the outer square ABC to it, and try how,
when one side of the <hi>Square,</hi> is applied to one side of
your work, the other side of your work agrees with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41812:28"/>
the other side of the <hi>Square;</hi> which if it do, all is well:
But if the <hi>Square</hi> and the Work comply not with one
another, you must file your Work where it bears the
<hi>Square</hi> off. But to return where I left.</p>
                        <p>Having made these two ends square, you must fit the
length of them to the thickness of the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi>
into which they are to enter, but so, as the squares be not
full so long, as to come quite thro' the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides,</hi>
lest when the <hi>Nuts</hi> are screwed on the <hi>Screw-pins</hi> that are at
the ends of these Squares, they screw full up to the Squares,
and bear against the corners of them; which if they do,
the <hi>Nuts</hi> will not draw the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi> close against
the shoulder of the squares, on the <hi>top</hi> and <hi>bottom Pieces,</hi>
and then the whole <hi>Jack Frame</hi> will not stand fast and
firm together.</p>
                        <p>But before you fit this <hi>Frame</hi> thus together, you must
consider the Diameter of the <hi>Main Wheel,</hi> that you may
Punch round Holes in the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi> to enter the
<hi>Main-spindle.</hi> Therefore open your Compass to half the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Diameter of the <hi>main Wheel,</hi> and half a quarter, or an
whole quarter of an Inch more for play, between the Semi-Diameter
of the <hi>main Wheel,</hi> and the upper flat of the <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-piece,</hi>
and set that distance off from the upper flat of the
<hi>Bottom-Piece,</hi> on the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides,</hi> and with a round
Punch, somewhat smaller than the intended size of the <hi>Main-spindle,</hi>
punch holes at that setting off. Your Punch must
be smaller than the <hi>Main-spindle,</hi> because the holes may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not be so exactly round, or punched so truly upright, or
perfectly smooth as they ought to be; and should you make
the holes so wide, at first, as they need to be, you could not
mend them, without making them wider. These holes must
be punched at the <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Forge,</hi> (as Smiths say, when they
take an <hi>Heat</hi> of their work to punch it) because the <hi>Fore</hi> and
<hi>Backsides</hi> are <hi>too strong</hi> (as Smiths say) that is, too thick to
punch with the <hi>Cold Punch.</hi> The way of punching them
you were taught <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 11, 12.</hi> Besides, a <hi>Cold Punch</hi>
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:41812:29"/>
is commonly made flat at the bottom, and therefore does
not prick an Hole, but cut an Hole (if the Iron be not too
strong) for that flat bottom, and the round upright side a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, meet in an Angle, or Edge, at the bottom, which
edge, by the force of an Hammer, cuts the Iron (if it be
not too strong) when it is laid upon a <hi>Bolster,</hi> as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
<hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 12.</hi> and should you cut out so much
Iron in the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides,</hi> as would entertain the <hi>main
Spindle</hi> (it being thick) you would make the <hi>Fore</hi> and
<hi>Backsides</hi> too wide; therefore, as I said, the Holes must
be prickt in the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi> at the <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Forge,</hi>
which with a sharp pointed <hi>Punch</hi> is sooner done; nor does
pricking diminish the substance or strength of the Iron, but
makes it swell out at the sides, and retain both substance and
strength. The irregularity, or swellings out that this punch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
makes on the flats of the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides,</hi> you must
hammer down again with almost a <hi>Blood-red-heat,</hi> I
say, almost a <hi>Blood-red-heat;</hi> because, should you take too
great an <hi>Heat,</hi> you may make the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi>
stretch, and so put the whole <hi>Jack-Frame</hi> out of order.</p>
                        <p>Having puncht the holes for the <hi>main Spindle,</hi> you
must punch the holes in the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi> for the
<hi>Worm-wheel Spindle,</hi> as you puncht the holes for the <hi>main
Spindle;</hi> but these must be small holes, to entertain the
small Ends, or Pins of the <hi>Worm-wheel Spindle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These holes thus puncht, may perhaps not be exactly
round, or fit your size, nor will they be smooth enough
within; therefore, with a <hi rend="sup">a</hi> 
                           <hi>Square-bore,</hi> you must <hi rend="sup">b</hi> open
them wider to your size, and that opening them in the
inside, will both round and smoothen them.</p>
                        <p>You must also punch a square hole towards the top of
the <hi>Foreside,</hi> for the <hi>Shank</hi> of the <hi>Worm-Loop.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then Forge and fit in your <hi>Main-wheel Spindle,</hi> and your
<hi>Worm-wheel Spindle,</hi> which Spindles must both be exactly
straight between the centers of their two ends (unless you
like to have Moldings for Ornaments on them) and forge a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41812:29"/>
square towards the ends of both the Spindles, to fit into a
square hole in the middle of the <hi>Cross</hi> of their <hi>Wheels,</hi> and
leave substance enough for a shoulder beyond the square, to
stop the square hole in the <hi>Cross</hi> of the <hi>Wheels</hi> from sliding
farther on the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and you must leave substance of
Iron enough to forge the <hi>Nut</hi> of the <hi>Worm-wheel</hi> near the
other end. But in this, and indeed, in all other forging,
remember, (as I told you <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 9.)</hi> that it behoves
you to <hi>Hammer,</hi> or <hi>Forge</hi> your Work as true as you can,
lest it cost you great pains at the <hi>Vice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then forge the <hi>Worm-spindle,</hi> which is all the way round
and straight, unless you will have Moldings for Ornaments
(as aforesaid) upon the <hi>shank</hi> of it: But you must be sure to
forge substance enough for the <hi>Worm</hi> to be cut out of it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Worm-wheels</hi> are forged round and flat.</p>
                        <p>The manner of forging these Wheels (which in Smith's
Language is, <hi>Turning up the Wheels)</hi> is, first, to draw out a
square Rod (as you were taught, <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 9.</hi> among the
several <hi>Heats of Iron)</hi> somewhat thicker than you intend
your <hi>Wheel</hi> shall be; but it must be almost as thin on one side,
as you intend the Inner edge of the <hi>Wheel</hi> shall be, and the
opposite to it above twice that thickness, for the outer edge
of the <hi>Wheel:</hi> (the reason you will find by and by.) Having
drawn forth your square Rod to a convenient length, <hi>viz.</hi>
almost three times the Diameter of your intended Wheel,
you must take almost a <hi>Flame-heat,</hi> and hammer all along
the whole length upon the thick edge, so will you find the
long Rod, by this hammering, turn by degrees rounder
and rounder in upon the thin edge, which you hammer'd
not upon, till it become a Circle, or pretty near a Circle.
But you must make it somewhat more than a Circle, for
the ends must lap over one another, that they may be
<hi>welded</hi> upon one another.</p>
                        <p>Thus you may see the Reason for making the outer
edge of the Rod thick, and the opposite edge thin; for
your hammering upon the outer edge only, and not on
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41812:30"/>
the inner, makes the outer edge a great deal thinner, and
at the same time makes the Wheel broader.</p>
                        <p>The reason why I told you, you should draw forth the
Rod to almost three times the Diameter of the Wheel,
and not to the Geometrical proportion, is, because that in
hammering upon it to make it round, the Rod will stretch
so considerably, that it will be long enough to make a
<hi>Wheel</hi> of your intended Diameter, and, most commonly,
somewhat to spare. But to return.</p>
                        <p>Before you take a <hi>welding Heat,</hi> as by <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 9. 10.</hi>
you must flatten the two ends that are to be <hi>welded</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to a little more than half their thickness, that when
they are lapt over one another, and <hi>welded</hi> together, they
may be no thicker than the other part of the <hi>Wheel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Wheels</hi> be not <hi>turned up</hi> so round, that with a little
labour you may mend them at the <hi>Vice,</hi> you must with
<hi>Blood-red-heats</hi> hammer them round upon the <hi>Pike,</hi> or <hi>Bick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi>
of the <hi>Anvil,</hi> holding with your <hi>Tongs</hi> the inner edge of
the <hi>Wheel</hi> upon it, and hammering upon the outer edge of
the <hi>Wheel,</hi> till the <hi>Wheel</hi> be fit for the <hi>Vice:</hi> Their insides
must be divided into four equal parts, or four <hi rend="sup">c</hi> 
                           <hi>Dufftail</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to be filed into them. The <hi>Dufftail</hi> notches are cut in
the inner edge of the <hi>Wheel</hi> towards the outer edge of the
<hi>Wheel,</hi> somewhat more than a quarter of an inch deep, and
spreading somewhat wider towards the outer edge. These
notches are to receive the four ends of a <hi>Cross</hi> forged some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
thicker towards the ends than the thickness of the
<hi>wheel,</hi> and must be filed outer <hi>Dufftails,</hi> to let exactly into
the inner <hi>Dufftail</hi> notches made in the inside of the <hi>wheel.</hi>
They must be forged thicker than the <hi>wheel,</hi> because they
must batter over both the flat sides of the <hi>wheel,</hi> to keep the
<hi>wheel</hi> strong and steddy upon the <hi>Cross;</hi> and sometimes (for
more security) they are <hi>brazed</hi> into the <hi>wheel</hi> (yet that is
but seldom;) the middle of this <hi>Cross</hi> is made broad, that
when the square hole is made in the middle of it to receive
the square of the <hi>Spindle,</hi> it may have strength enough to
bear the violence offered it, as well in winding up the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41812:30"/>
great weight, that keeps the <hi>wheels</hi> in motion, as in the
checking and turning the <hi>Jack-winder</hi> back, to set the <hi>Jack</hi>
a-going, when by the winding up, it may be subject to
stand still, or sometimes, for want of weight, or else for
want of oyling; or some other accident.</p>
                        <p>These <hi>wheels</hi> thus forged and filed flat, must be divided, the
<hi>Main wheel</hi> commonly into 64 equal parts, and the <hi>Worm-wheel</hi>
into about 32 equal parts; but these numbers are
not exactly observ'd by Smiths, for sometimes they make
them more, and sometimes less, either according to the size
of their <hi>wheels,</hi> or according as they intend their <hi>wheels</hi>
shall go, swifter, or slower about (for the fewer the <hi>Teeth</hi> on
a <hi>wheel</hi> are, the sooner a <hi>wheel</hi> goes about, and the more
<hi>Teeth</hi> on a <hi>wheel,</hi> the slower the <hi>wheel</hi> goes about) or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as they have opened their Compasses to divide them:
For if, by luck, they at first open their Compasses to such a
width, as will just measure out on a Circle, (which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
on the center of the <hi>wheel</hi> for that purpose) their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
number, then the <hi>wheel</hi> shall have the intended num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Teeth;</hi> if not, let it somewhat fall short, or exceed
that number, they matter not, but make that number of
<hi>Teeth</hi> on the <hi>wheel.</hi> And having thus divided the <hi>wheel,</hi>
they, by the side of a straight Ruler laid to the Center,
and every division markt on the <hi>wheel,</hi> draw or scratch a
straight line from the outer limb of the <hi>wheel,</hi> to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
which Circle (I should have told you before) is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
at that distance from the outer Verge, they intend
the <hi>Teeth</hi> shall be cut down to. This is indeed a rough
way of working, but the Office of a <hi>Jack</hi> is well enough
performed by this rough work; and the usual prizes such,
as will scarce pay Workmen for better, as they say.</p>
                        <p>These <hi>wheels</hi> thus divided, must be cut down into these
divisions with a <hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                           <hi>Jack-file,</hi> the <hi>Main-wheel</hi> straight athwart
the outer Verge, (which to speak Mathematically, makes
an Angle of 90 degrees with the flat sides of the <hi>wheel,)</hi> and
the <hi>Worm-wheel</hi> aslope, making an Angle of about 115 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41812:31"/>
with its sides, that is, an Angle of 25 degrees, with a
line drawn straight athwart the outer Edge of the <hi>Wheel,</hi>
that the <hi>teeth</hi> of the <hi>Worm-wheel</hi> may gather themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Grooves</hi> of the <hi>Worm</hi> in the <hi>Worm-spindle;</hi> the <hi>Worm</hi>
on the <hi>Worm-spindle</hi> running about 65 degrees aslope from
the Axis, or perpendicular of the <hi>Worm-spindle;</hi> the not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
you make with the File must be so wide, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
about twice the thickness of each <hi>tooth:</hi> Therefore
you may observe, that the number of <hi>Teeth</hi> cannot be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd,
because the Sizes of all <hi>Jack-wheels</hi> are not of equal
Diameters, and the Sizes of the <hi>Teeth</hi> must be filed very
square and smooth, and the corners taken off, and rounded
on both sides towards the middle of the top, or end of the
<hi>Tooth,</hi> which much helps the <hi>Teeth</hi> to gather in upon the
<hi>Teeth</hi> of the <hi>Nut,</hi> and the <hi>Worm</hi> on the <hi>Worm-spindle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Teeth</hi> of the <hi>wheels</hi> being cut down, and the whole
<hi>wheel</hi> finished, they must be forced stiff and hard upon the
square of the <hi>Spindle,</hi> close up to the Shoulder; which Square
being made somewhat longer than the <hi>Cross</hi> of the <hi>wheel</hi> is
thick, must with a <hi>Cold-Chissel</hi> be cut on the top of that
Square, to make the Iron that comes through the square hole
of the <hi>wheel,</hi> spread over the <hi>Cross</hi> of the <hi>wheel,</hi> and then that
spreading must be battered with the <hi>Pen</hi> of the Hammer;
that it may stand up stiff against the shoulder of the Square,
on the other side of the <hi>wheel;</hi> but in doing this, you must
be very careful that the <hi>Spindle</hi> stand exactly perpendicular
to the flat sides of your <hi>wheels;</hi> for should the <hi>Spindle</hi> lean
never so little to one, or the other side of the <hi>wheel,</hi> the
<hi>wheel</hi> when it is moving in the <hi>Jack-frame</hi> would not move
perpendicular, but wabble towards the <hi>Fore</hi> or <hi>Backsides</hi>
of the <hi>Jack-frame,</hi> and perhaps by this irregular motion,
before a revolution of the <hi>wheel</hi> be performed, it would
go off from the length of the <hi>Teeth</hi> of the <hi>Nut.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then file the <hi>Spindle-pins</hi> (which are the ends of the <hi>Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,</hi>
that go into the center-holes of the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides</hi> of
the <hi>Jack-frame)</hi> exactly round and fit to their center-holes,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41812:31"/>
and place them into their proper center-holes. Then try if
the <hi>wheels</hi> are exactly round on their outer edges, and that
in turning about, their flat sides wabble not, but in a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
keep parallel to the <hi>Fore</hi> and <hi>Backsides.</hi> The way <hi>Smiths</hi>
use to try them by is, to turn them about by the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and
holding a piece of Chalk steddy to the outer Limb of the
<hi>wheel,</hi> not leting the point of the Chalk slip forwards or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
or towards the right or left hand, for then if the Chalk
make a white stroke round the whole <hi>wheel,</hi> and that white
stroke lie exactly parallel to the two outer edges of the
<hi>wheel,</hi> the <hi>Wheel</hi> is not only round, but stands also true upon
its <hi>Spindle,</hi> that is, perpendicular to the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and the <hi>Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi>
perpendicular to the flat of it: But if the Chalk does not
touch round the whole <hi>wheel,</hi> you must file down so much of
the outer Verge of the <hi>wheel,</hi> where the Chalk does touch,
as will bring down, or equalize the Diameter of the <hi>wheel</hi>
in that place, to the Diameter of the <hi>wheel</hi> in the place
where it does not touch; so may you conclude the <hi>wheel</hi>
is round. If the mark of the Chalk lie not exactly in the
middle between the two edges of the <hi>wheel,</hi> then it is not
perpendicular to the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and you must with the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
set it right, that is, perpendicular, by forcing the <hi>wheel</hi>
over from the side it leans too much to, or else by forcing
the <hi>Spindle,</hi> which is all one; yet this is an help you ought
not to rely upon to use, but in case of necessity, but rather
be sure your <hi>Wheel</hi> and <hi>Spindle</hi> stand perpendicular to one
another, before you fasten the <hi>Wheel</hi> upon the square of the
<hi>Spindle,</hi> for by this help the square on the <hi>Spindle,</hi> will be
apt to loosen in the square of the <hi>Wheel,</hi> and you will have
your <hi>wheel</hi> to new fasten upon the square of the <hi>Spindle</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                        <p>As you tried the <hi>Wheels</hi> with Chalk, so you must try
the <hi>Nut,</hi> the <hi>Worm,</hi> and the <hi>Spindles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The upper part of the <hi>Worm-spindle,</hi> must be filed truly
round to fit into the <hi>Worm-Loop,</hi> that it shake not in it, and
yet go very easily about, without the least stopping. At the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41812:32"/>
very upper end of this round on the <hi>Worm-spindle,</hi> you must
file a square to fit the square hole of the <hi>Fly</hi> upon.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Shank</hi> of the <hi>Worm-Loop,</hi> and the <hi>Stud</hi> of the <hi>Worm
Spindle,</hi> must stand so far off the left side of the <hi>Fore-side,</hi>
that the <hi>Teeth</hi> of the <hi>Worm-wheel,</hi> may fall full into the <hi>Grooves</hi>
of the <hi>Worm;</hi> for so, both being cut with the same slope,
the slope <hi>Teeth</hi> of the <hi>Worm-wheel</hi> will gather into the slope
<hi>Grooves</hi> of the <hi>Spindle,</hi> and pressing upon the <hi>Worm,</hi> drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Worm-spindle</hi> and the <hi>Fly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Fly</hi> is made sometimes with two, sometimes with
four Arms from the center; and sometimes the Arms are
made longer, sometimes shorter: The more Arms, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the longer Arms, are to make the <hi>Jack</hi> go slower.</p>
                        <p>There is yet a small matter more of Iron work about the
<hi>Jack,</hi> which is the <hi>Tumbler;</hi> but it lies in the farther end of
the <hi>Barrel,</hi> and cannot well be described without a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
figure, which therefore I have inserted. As in <hi>Fig. 2.</hi> A

                           <hi rend="sup">a</hi> the center of the <hi>Tumbler</hi> moving upon the <hi>Center-pin,</hi>

which passes through a pretty wide hole at <hi rend="sup">c</hi> in the <hi>Tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
as far as <hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                           <hi rend="sup">d</hi> the <hi>Catch of the Tumbler.</hi> The <hi>Tumbler</hi>
moves, as aforesaid, upon the center hole <hi rend="sup">a</hi>, but receives
the <hi>Tongue</hi> through it at <hi rend="sup">c</hi>, and passes as far as <hi rend="sup">e</hi>. This <hi>Tongue</hi>
serves as a <hi>Check</hi> to the <hi>Tumbler,</hi> that it cannot tumble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
an Angle of 20 degrees, from the Iron plate it is
fastened to; and that the width of its center-hole, and the
width of the hole the <hi>Tongue</hi> passes through, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Coller</hi> about the <hi>Main-spindle</hi> allows it, but were
the center hole <hi rend="sup">a</hi>, and its <hi>Center-pin</hi> fit, and the hole <hi rend="sup">c</hi>, and
the <hi>Tongue</hi> that also passes through it also fit, and the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
fixt, it could not move at all. But this play is enough
for it, to do the purpose it is designed for. The <hi>Tumbler</hi> is
so placed behind the <hi>Barrel,</hi> that while the <hi>Jack-line</hi> is win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
up upon the <hi>Barrel,</hi> its round britch passes forwards
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41812:32"/>
by all the <hi>Crosses</hi> of the <hi>Main-wheel,</hi> and the <hi>Point</hi> or <hi>Catch</hi> 
                           <hi rend="sup">d</hi>,
as then claps it self snug or close to the Iron plate of the
<hi>Barrel:</hi> But when the <hi>Barrel</hi> is turned on the contrary
way, the weight of the <hi>Catch</hi> in half a revolution of the
<hi>Barrel</hi> (let the <hi>Tumbler</hi> be posited where it will) makes it
open and fall from the Iron plate, and but against one or
other of the <hi>Crosses</hi> on the <hi>Main-wheel,</hi> and so thrusts the
<hi>Main-wheel</hi> about with the <hi>Barrel.</hi>

you were directly to lay a small round piece of Iron,

lap the other end of your work over it; but this is to be a

of Iron of your size, where the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Jack-Winch</hi> shall
be, and lap or double the other end over it, and <hi>Weld</hi> and
Work as you were there directed. The rest of the <hi>Winch</hi>

                        <p>The manner of making Molds to Cast Leaden Bullets in.</p>
                        <p>I insert the making of <hi>Bullet-Molds,</hi> because there is some
sort of Work in them different from what hath yet been
taught. The Handles, and the Heads are forged as other
Work, but the two concave Hemispheres, are first punched
with a round-ended <hi>Punch,</hi> of the shape, and almost of the
size you intend the <hi>Bullet</hi> shall be. They must be punch'd
deep enough at the <hi>Forge</hi> with a <hi>Blood-red-heat;</hi> then are
the Edges of the Chaps filed flat, first with a Common-file,
the Common-way, but afterwards with an <hi>Using-file,</hi> as
Workmen call it. The <hi>Using-file,</hi> is a long and broad File,
exactly flat on both its cut sides, having a square Iron
handle drawn out at one end, with an hole in it; but the
handle is not to hold it by when you use it, but the hole
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41812:33"/>
in it to go over a pin you hang it upon, when you do not
use it. When you use it, you must lay it flat upon the
Work-bench, with its handle from you, and you must take
care that it lie solid and steddy, lest when you work upon
it, it slip from you; therefore you may strike a Nail in at
the hole in the handle, a little way into the Work-Bench,
that you may draw it again, when you have done with the
<hi>Using-file,</hi> and you may drive in a small Tack on each side
the <hi>Using-file,</hi> to keep it steddy, or you may tack down
two small thin boards on either side the <hi>Using-file,</hi> to keep
it steddy, and rip them off again when you have done. Your
<hi>Using-file</hi> lying thus straight, and steddy before you, lay
the Chaps of one half of the <hi>Mold</hi> flat upon the hither end
of the <hi>Using-file,</hi> and holding your two Thumbs, and your
two Fore-fingers upon the head of the <hi>Mold,</hi> thrust your
work hard down from you the whole length of the <hi>Using-file,</hi>
then draw your work lightly back, and thrust it again
hard from you; reiterate these thrusts thus, till upon the
Chaps of the <hi>Mold,</hi> you can see no irregularities, or the
File-stroaks of the common File left, so may you be sure
that the Chaps of the <hi>Mold</hi> is truly flat. Do the like by
the other half of the <hi>Mold.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now you must try whether each of these concaves be an
exact half-round; thus, you may describe an Arch a little
more than a Semi-Circle, just of the Diameter of your <hi>Bullet,</hi>
upon the end of a thin piece of Brass-latin, draw a straight line
through the center, and the Arch on both sides it, for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of a Semi-circle; file very curiously all the Brass away
on the end, just to this Semi-circle, and just to the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
line on either side of the Semi-circle, so have you a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex
Semi-circle: Put this convex Semi-circle into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
<hi>Molds,</hi> if it fits them so as the convex reaches just the
bottom of the <hi>Molds,</hi> when its shoulder touches just the chaps
of the <hi>Mold,</hi> they are each a true concave Hemisphere. But
if the shoulder of the convex (that is, a Diametral Line pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd)
rides upon the chaps of the Concave, and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41812:34"/>
of the Convex touch not the bottom of the Concave,
the Concave is punched too deep, and must have its chaps
rubb'd upon the <hi>Using-file</hi> again, till it comply with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex.
Then put into the two Concaves a round <hi>Bullet,</hi> that
will just fill them both, and pinching the Heads of the <hi>Mold</hi>
close together in a <hi>Vice,</hi> with the <hi>Bullet</hi> in it, drill an hole
through both the handles for the <hi>Joint.</hi> The reason why
the <hi>Bullet</hi> is put into the <hi>Mold</hi> is, because the Chaps of
the two Halves should lie exactly upon one another,
whilst the hole for the <hi>Joint</hi> is drilling. Then fit a Rivet-pin
for this hole, and rivet them together, but not so hard,
but that the <hi>Mold</hi> may open and shut pretty easy, and yet
go true. Then take the <hi>Bullet</hi> out, and file in each half
of the head, half a round hole directly against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the <hi rend="sub">a</hi> 
                           <hi>Geat,</hi> which two half holes, when the <hi>Mold</hi>
is shut, will make one round hole.</p>
                        <p>You may now try with Clay, or by casting a leaden <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>
in it, whether it be exactly round or no; for making
a true round hole in a thin piece of Brass, just of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of the chaps, you may try if the <hi>cast Bullet</hi>
will just pass thro', and also fill that hole when the <hi>Bullet</hi>
it turned every way; which if it do, you may conclude
the <hi>Mold</hi> is true. This thin piece of Brass, with a round
hole in it, is called a <hi>Sizer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the inside wants cleansing, for hitherto it is only
punched. Therefore you must provide a <hi rend="sup">b</hi> 
                           <hi>Bullet-bore,</hi>
with which you may bore the inside of each half to clear it.
Or if they be not quite deep enough punch'd, you may
bore them deeper. You may bore them severally, or toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by putting the <hi>Bullet-bore</hi> into the <hi>Mold,</hi> so as the
<hi>Shank</hi> may come through the <hi>Geat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this Section you see, first the use of a <hi>Using-file,</hi> an
Instrument of great use for flat Filing; for by it you may
make two pieces of Iron of somewhat considerable breadth,
so true, that by laying the two flat sides upon each other,
they shall draw up one another. It is much used by <hi>Clock-makers,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41812:34"/>
Watch-makers, Letter-Mold-makers,</hi> and indeed, all
others that frame Square-Work on Iron, Steel, or Brass.
Secondly, the use of a <hi>Bullet-bore,</hi> which, tho' it be seldom
used, yet it may serve, not only for <hi>Bullet-Molds,</hi> but for
other purposes; and by altering its shape into an Oblong,
a Cone, or a Cilinder, you may <hi>Bore</hi> these hollow Figures
either for <hi>Molds,</hi> or some other accidental Uses.</p>

or <hi>Bullet</hi> at one end, just of your intended <hi>Bullet's</hi> size.
This Globular end must be hatched with a fine cut, by a
<hi>File-cutter,</hi> and Hardned and Tempered. The end of the
<hi>Shank,</hi> this Globular <hi>Bore</hi> is fastned to, must be round and
so small, that when the <hi>Bullet-bore</hi> is in the <hi>Mold,</hi> the <hi>Geat</hi>
will easily receive it. The other end of the <hi>Shank</hi> must be
fitted into the square Socket of the <hi>Wimble,</hi> and have a
Shoulder to it to stop the Socket from sliding too far up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Shank.</hi> From this Shoulder, the rest of the <hi>Shank</hi>
must run tapering down, to the small end the <hi>Bullet-bore</hi>
is fastned to. You must work with it, as you were
taught to work with the <hi>Square Bore.</hi>

because it makes the outside of them hard. It is used also by

hardned, takes a better Pollish, and keeps the Pollish much
longer and better, than if the Iron were not <hi>Case-hardned.</hi>
The manner of <hi>Case-hardning</hi> is thus, Take <hi>Cow-Horn,</hi> or
<hi>Hoof,</hi> dry it throughly in an Oven, and then beat it to
Powder, put about the same quantity of Bay-Salt to it,
and mingle them together with stale Chamberley, or else
with White-Wine-Vineger. Lay some of this mixture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Loam, made, as you were taught <hi>Numb.</hi> I. <hi>fol. 13.</hi> And
cover your Iron all over with it; then wrap the Loam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
all, and lay it upon the Hearth of the Forge to dry
and harden: When it is dry and hard, put it into the
Fire, and blow up the Coals to it, till the whole Lump
have just a <hi>Blood-red-heat,</hi> but no higher, lest the quality
of your mixture burn away, and leave the Iron as soft as
at first. Then take it out, and quench it. Or, instead of
Loam, you may wrap it up in Plate Iron, so as the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Coals to it, as aforesaid.</p>

good and bad; yet each Country doth not equally
produce such Steel, as is fit for every particular purpose,
as I shall shew you by and by. But the several Sorts of
Steel, that are in general use here in <hi>England,</hi> are the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-Steel,</hi>
the <hi>Flemish,</hi> the <hi>Swedish,</hi> the <hi>Spanish,</hi> and the
<hi>Venice-Steel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="55" facs="tcp:41812:35"/>
The <hi>English-Steel</hi> is made in several places in <hi>England,</hi> as
in <hi>Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, Sussex,</hi> the <hi>Wild of Kent,</hi> &amp;c. But
the best is made about the <hi>Forrest of Dean,</hi> it breaks Fiery,
with somewhat a course Grain. But if it be well wrought,
and proves sound, it makes good Edge-Tools, Files and Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
It will work well at the Forge, and take a good Heat.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Flemish-Steel</hi> is made in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the Country of
<hi>Stiermark,</hi> and in the <hi>Land of Luyck:</hi> From thence brought
to <hi>Colen,</hi> and is therefore sometimes called <hi>Colen-Steel;</hi>
from <hi>Colen</hi> it is brought down the River <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Dort,</hi> and
other parts of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> some in <hi>Bars,</hi> and some
in <hi>Gads,</hi> and is therefore, by us, called <hi>Flemish-Steel,</hi> and
sometimes <hi>Gad-Steel.</hi> It is a tough sort of Steel, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Steel used for Watch Springs. It is also good for Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
File-cutters also use it to make their Chissels of, with
which they cut their Files. It breaks with a fine Grain,
works well at the Forge, and will take a <hi>welding</hi> Heat.</p>
                        <p>I cannot learn that any Steel comes from <hi>Sweden,</hi> but
from <hi>Dantzick</hi> comes some which is called <hi>Swedish-Steel:</hi> It is
much of the same quality and fineness with <hi>Flemish-Steel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spanish-Steel</hi> is made about <hi>Biscany.</hi> It is a fine sort of
Steel, but some of it very difficult to work at the Forge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it will not take a good Heat; and it sometimes proves
very unsound, as not being well <hi>curried,</hi> that is, well wrought.
It is too quick (as Workmen call it) that is, too brittle for
Springs, or Punches, but makes good fine Edged Tools.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Venice-Steel</hi> is much like <hi>Spanish-Steel,</hi> but more fine,
and works somewhat better at the Forge. It is used for
Razors, Chirurgion's Instruments, Gravers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Because
it will come to a fine and thin Edge. Razor-makers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
clap a small Bar of <hi>Venice-Steel</hi> between two small Bars
of <hi>Flemish-Steel,</hi> and so work, or weld them together, to
strengthen the back of the Razor, and keep it from cracking.</p>
                        <p>There is another sort of Steel of higher commendations,
than any of the foregoing sorts. It is called <hi>Damascus-Steel;</hi>
'tis very rare, that any comes into <hi>England</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41812:36"/>
but the <hi>Turkish</hi>-Symeters are generally made of
it. It is most difficult, of any Steel, to work at the Forge,
for you shall scarce be able to strike upon a Blood-heat, but
it will <hi>Red-Sear;</hi> insomuch that these Symeters are, by
many Workmen, thought to be cast Steel. But when it is
wrought, it takes the finest, and keeps the strongest Edge
of any other Steel. Workmen set almost an inestimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
upon it, to make Punches, Cold Punches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of. We
cannot learn where it is made, and yet, as I am informed,
the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> hath been very careful and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
in that inquiry; giving it in particular charge to
some Travellers to <hi>Damascus,</hi> to bring home an account of
it: But when they came thither they heard of none made
there, but were sent about fifty Miles farther into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and then they were told of about fifty Miles farther
than that: So that no certain account could be gained,
where it is made. <hi>Kirman</hi> towards the Ocean affords ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fine Steel, of which they make Weapons highly prized;
for a Symeter of that Steel, will cut through an <hi>Helmet</hi>
with an easy blow. <hi>Geog. Rect. fol. 279.</hi>

                        <p>Break a little piece of the end of the Rod, and observe
how it breaks; for good Steel breaks short off, all gray, like
frost work Silver. But in the breaking of the bad, you will
find some veins of Iron shining and doubling in the Steel.</p>

                        <p>Having chose your Steel, and forged it to your intended
shape, if you are either to file upon it, or engrave upon it,
or to Punch upon it, you ought to Neal it first, because it
will make it fofter, and consequently work easier. The
common way is to give it a <hi>Blood-red-heat</hi> in the Fire, then
take it out, and let it cool of it self.</p>
                        <p>There are some pretenders to know how to make Steel
as soft as Lead; but so oft as my Curiosity has prompted
me to try their pretended Processes, so oft have they fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me; and not only me, but some others, careful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41812:36"/>
But the Way they most boast of, is the often hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Iron, or Steel in red-hot Lead, and letting it cool
of it self, with the Lead. I have many times tried this
without any other success, than that it does indeed make
Iron or Steel as soft, as if it were well Neal'd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
way, but no softer: And could it be otherwise, the
small Iron Ladles, that Letter-Founders use to the casting
of Printing-Letters, would be very soft indeed; for their
Iron Ladles are kept constantly Month after Month in mel-Mettal,
whereof the main Body is Lead, and when they
Cast small Letters, they keep their Mettal red hot; and I
have known them many times left in the Mettal, and cool
with it, as the Fire has gone out of it self; but yet the Iron
Ladles have been no softer, than if they had been well
Neal'd the common way. But perhaps these Pretenders
mean the Iron or Steel shall be as soft as Lead, when the Iron
or Steel is red-hot: If so, we may thank'um for nothing.</p>
                        <p>But that which makes Steel a very small matter softer
than the common way of Nealing is, by covering Steel
with a course Powder of Cow-Horns, or Hooves, or Rams-Horns,
and so inclosing it in a Loam; then put the whole
lump into a wooden Fire to hear red-hot, and let it lie in
the Fire till the Fire go out of it self, and the Steel cool
with the Fire.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>English, Flemish</hi> and <hi>Swedish</hi>-Steel, must have a pretty
high heat given them, and then suddenly quench'd in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to make them very hard; but <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi>
Steel, will need but a Blood-red-heat, and then when they
are quenched in Water, will be very hard. If your Steel
be too hard, that is, too brittle, and it be an Edged, or
Pointed Instrument you make, the edge, or point, will be
very subject to break; or if it be a Spring, it will not bow,
but with the least bending it will snap assunder: Therefore
you must <hi>let it down,</hi> (as Smiths say) that is, make it softer,
by <hi>tempering</hi> it. The manner is thus, take a piece of Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41812:37"/>
or Whetstone, and rub hard upon your work to take
the black scurff off it. and brighten it; then let it heat in the
Fire, and as it grows hotter, you will see the Colour
change by degrees, coming first to a light Goldish colour,
then to a darker Goldish colour, and at last to a Blew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
elect which of these Colours your Work requires,
and then quench it suddenly in Water. The <hi>Light Goldish
Colour</hi> is for <hi>Files, Cold-Chissels</hi> and <hi>Punches,</hi> that Punch
into Iron and Steel: The <hi>Dark Goldish Colour</hi> for Punches
to use on Brass, and generally for most <hi>Edge-Tools:</hi> The
<hi>Blew-Colour</hi> gives the Temper to <hi>Springs</hi> in general, and is
also used to beautifie both Iron and Steel; but then
Workmen sometimes grind <hi>Indico</hi> and <hi>Sallad-Oyl</hi> together,
and rub that mixture upon it, with a woollen Rag, while
it is heating, and let it cool of it self.</p>
                        <p>There is another sort of <hi>Hardning,</hi> called <hi>Hammer-hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
It is most used on Iron, or Steel Plates, for <hi>Dripping-Pans,
Saws, Straight-Rulers, &amp;c.</hi> It is performed only,
with well Hammering of the Plates, which both smooths
them, and beats the Mettal firmer into its own Body, and
somewhat hardens it.</p>
                        <p>The manner of Forging Steel, either for <hi>Edge-Tools,

                           <hi>JOynery,</hi> is an Art Manual, whereby several Pieces of
Wood are so fitted and joined together <hi>by straight
Lines, Squares, Miters,</hi> or any <hi>Bevel,</hi> that they
shall seem one intire Piece.</p>
                        <p>Explanation.</p>
                        <p>By <hi>straight Lines,</hi> I mean, that which, in Joyner's
Language, is called a <hi>Joint,</hi> That is, Two Pieces of
Wood are <hi>Shot</hi> (that is Plained,) or else they are
Pared, that is, the irregularities that hinder the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the two Pieces are cut off with a <hi>Paring Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</hi>
They are <hi>Shot,</hi> or <hi>Pared,</hi> (as I said) so exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
straight, that when they are set upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
light shall not be discerned betwixt them.
This they call <hi>Shooting of a Joynt,</hi> or <hi>Paring to a
Joint,</hi> because these two Pieces are with Glew com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
joined together, either to make a Board
broad enough for their purpose, or to (<hi rend="sup">a</hi>) <hi>Clamp</hi> one
piece of wood to the end of another piece of wood
to keep it from <hi>casting,</hi> or <hi>warping.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By <hi>Squares,</hi> I mean the making of <hi>Frames,</hi> either
for <hi>Door-cases,</hi> or such like, which is the Framing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41812:42"/>
of two pieces of wood athwart two other pieces of

with the <hi>Square,</hi> marked D.</p>
                        <p>By <hi>Miters</hi> are meant the joining of two pieces of
wood, so as the Joint makes half a Square, and does
comply with the <hi>Miter Square,</hi> marked E.</p>
                        <p>By a <hi>Bevil</hi> is meant any other Angle: As Frames that

keeps the Board close to the edge of the <hi>Bench,</hi> and the
<hi>Pins</hi> in the <hi>Legs</hi> keep it to its height, that it may stand
steddy whilst the other edge is working upon: For in

straight down, and wide enough to let the <hi>Hold-fast</hi>
play a little, the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Hold-fast</hi> being knockt,
the point of the <hi>Beak</hi> throws the <hi>Shank</hi> a-slope in the

the edge of the <hi>Hole</hi> on the upper Superficies of the

                        <p>You must note, that as I told you in <hi>Smithing, Numb.</hi>
I. <hi>fol. 14, 15, 16,</hi> it was the office of the <hi>course tooth'd

not to <hi>file</hi> them more away than you need, so the same
Caution is to be given you in the using of this <hi>Fore Plane</hi>
in <hi>Joynery,</hi> for the reason there alledged in <hi>Smithing,</hi>
whether, to avoid repetition, I referr you; only with
this consideration, that there <hi>Iron,</hi> or <hi>Steel,</hi> was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                        <head>§ 3. Of setting the Iron.</head>
                        <p>When you <hi>set</hi> the <hi>Iron</hi> of the <hi>Fore-Plane,</hi> consider
the <hi>Stuff</hi> you are to work upon, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it
be <hi>hard,</hi> or <hi>soft,</hi> or <hi>Curling,</hi> as <hi>Joyners</hi> call <hi>Crose-grain'd
Stuff:</hi> If it be <hi>hard,</hi> or <hi>curling,</hi> you must not <hi>set</hi> the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41812:43"/>
                           <hi>Iron</hi> very <hi>rank,</hi> because a Man's strength will not cut
deep into <hi>hard wood;</hi> and if it be not <hi>hard wood,</hi> but
<hi>curling,</hi> or <hi>knotty,</hi> and the <hi>Iron Rank-set,</hi> you may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
work with it till you come to some <hi>Knot,</hi> or
<hi>Curl,</hi> but then you may either tear your <hi>Stuff,</hi> or break
the edge of your <hi>Iron;</hi> therefore you may preceive
a reason to <hi>set</hi> the <hi>Iron fine</hi> for <hi>curling,</hi> and <hi>knotty
Stuff.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if you ask me how <hi>rank</hi> your <hi>Iron</hi> ought to be
set? I answer, If your Wood be <hi>soft,</hi> and your <hi>Stuff free,</hi>
and <hi>frowy,</hi> that is, evenly temper'd all the way, you
may <hi>set</hi> the <hi>Iron</hi> to take a shaving off the thickness of
an old coined Shilling, but scarce thicker; whereas, if
your <hi>Stuff</hi> be <hi>hard,</hi> or <hi>curling,</hi> or <hi>knotty,</hi> you shall
scarce be able to take a shaving off the thickness of
and old Groat. Therefore you must examine the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of your <hi>Stuff,</hi> by easy trials, how the <hi>Plane</hi> will
work upon it, and <hi>set</hi> your Iron accordingly. And
observe this as a General Rule, that the <hi>Iron</hi> a of the
<hi>fore-Plain</hi> is, for the first working with it, to be <hi>set</hi>
as <hi>rank</hi> as you can make good work with; and that
for speed sake.</p>
                        <p>If your <hi>Iron</hi> be <hi>set</hi> too <hi>rank,</hi> knock with an <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
upon the <hi>Britch</hi> of the <hi>Stock,</hi> and afterwards upon
the <hi>Wedge;</hi> for this knocking upon the <hi>Britch,</hi> if you
knock hard enough, 'twill raise the <hi>Iron</hi> little, and
<hi>set</hi> it <hi>fine;</hi> if you knock not hard enough, you
must knock again, till the <hi>Iron</hi> do rise; but if you
knock too hard, it will raise the <hi>Iron</hi> so much, that
its edge will rise above the <hi>Sole</hi> into the <hi>Mouth</hi> of
the <hi>Stock,</hi> and consequently not touch the <hi>Stuff:</hi>
therefore you must knock softly at first, till, by try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
you find the <hi>Iron</hi> rises to a convenient <hi>fineness.</hi>
But as this knocking on the <hi>Britch</hi> raises the <hi>Iron,</hi> so it
also raises and loosens the <hi>wedge;</hi> therefore (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said)
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41812:44"/>
whenever you knock upon the <hi>Britch,</hi> you must
also knock upon the <hi>wedge,</hi> to fasten the <hi>Iron</hi> again.</p>
                        <p>If you have raised the edge of the <hi>Iron</hi> too <hi>fine,</hi>
you must knock softly upon the head of the <hi>Iron,</hi>
and then again upon the <hi>wedge,</hi> and this you may
sometimes do several times, till you sit your <hi>Iron</hi> to
a convenient <hi>fineness.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When you have occasion to take your <hi>Iron</hi> out
of the <hi>Stock</hi> to <hi>rub</hi> it, that is, to <hi>whet</hi> it, you may
knock pretty smart blows upon the <hi>Stock,</hi> between
the <hi>Mouth</hi> and the <hi>Fore-end,</hi> to loosen the <hi>wedge,</hi> and
consequently the <hi>Iron.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These ways of <hi>setting,</hi> are used to all other <hi>Plains,</hi>
as well as <hi>Fore-planes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the using of this, and indeed, all other <hi>Planes,</hi>
you must begin at the hinder end of the <hi>Stuff,</hi> the
Grain of the wood laying along the length of the
<hi>Bench,</hi> and Plain forward, till you come to the
fore-end, unless the <hi>Stuff</hi> proves <hi>Cross-grain'd,</hi> in any
part of its length; for then you must turn your
<hi>Stuff,</hi> to Plain it the contrary way, so far as it runs
<hi>Cross-grain'd,</hi> And in Plaining, you must, at once, lean
pretty hard upon the <hi>Plane,</hi> and also thrust it very
hard forwards, not letting the <hi>Plane</hi> totter to, or from
you-wards, till you have made a Stroak the whole
length of the <hi>Stuff.</hi> And this sometimes, if your
<hi>Stuff</hi> be long, will require your making two or three
steps forwards, e'er you come to the fore-end of the
<hi>Stuff:</hi> But if it do, you must come back, and begin
again at the farther end, by the side of the last
plain'd Stroak, and so continue your several lays of
Plaining, till the whole upside of the <hi>Stuff</hi> be
plained.</p>
                        <p>And if the <hi>Stuff</hi> be broad you are to Plain upon,
and it <hi>warp</hi> a little with the <hi>Grain,</hi> or be any ways
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41812:44"/>
crooked in the breadth, you must then turn the <hi>Grain</hi>
athwart the <hi>Work-Bench,</hi> and Plane upon the <hi>Cross-Grain.</hi>
For, if your work be hollow in the middle,
you must Plain both the Bearing sides thinner, till
they come to a <hi>Try</hi> with the middle. Then turn the
other side of your work, and working still <hi>Cross-grain'd,</hi>
work away the middle, till it come <hi>Try</hi> with
the two sides.</p>
                        <p>This way of <hi>Cross-Grain'd</hi> working, is, by Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
called <hi>Traversing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus have you, in general, the use of all the other
<hi>Planes:</hi> But the use of those Planes, that are design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for other particular purposes, I shall shew, as
they come in Order.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Joynter</hi> is made somewhat longer than the
<hi>Fore-plane,</hi> and hath its <hi>Sole</hi> perfectly straight,
from end to end. Its office is to follow the <hi>Fore-plane,</hi>
and to <hi>shoot</hi> an edge perfectly straight, and not
only an edge, but also a Board of any thickness;
especially when a <hi>Joynt</hi> is to be <hi>shot.</hi> Therefore the
Hand must be carried all along the whole length,
with an epual bearing weight, and so exactly even,
and upright to the edges of the Board, that neither
side of the <hi>Plane</hi> encline either inward or outwards,
but that the whole breadth be exactly square on
both its sides; supposing its sides straight: so will
two edges of two boards, when thus <hi>shot,</hi> lie so
exactly flat and square upon one another, that light
will not be discerned betwixt them. But yet it is
counted a piece of good workmanship in a <hi>Joyner,</hi>
to have the craft of bearing his hand so curiously
even, the whole length of a long Board; and yet it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41812:45"/>
is but a sleight to those, Practice hath inur'd the
Hand to. The <hi>Joynter</hi> is also used to <hi>Try</hi> Tables
with, (large or small) or other such broad work; and
then <hi>Joyners</hi> work, as well upon the <hi>Traverse</hi> with it,
as with the Grain of the Wood, and also Angular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or Corner-wise, that they may be the more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
of the flatness of their work.</p>
                        <p>Its <hi>Iron</hi> must be <hi>set</hi> very <hi>fine,</hi> so fine, that when
you wink with one Eye, and set that end the straight
side of the <hi>Iron</hi> is next to the other Eye, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
a little above an hairs breadth of the edge
above the superficies of the <hi>sole</hi> of the <hi>Plane,</hi> and the
length of the <hi>edge</hi> must lie perfectly straight with
the flat breadth of the <hi>sole</hi> of the <hi>Plane:</hi> For the <hi>Iron</hi>
being then well wedg'd up, and you working with
the <hi>Plane</hi> thus <hi>set,</hi> have the greater assurance that the
<hi>Iron</hi> cannot run too deep into the <hi>Stuff,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
you have the less danger that the <hi>Joynt</hi> is
wrought out of straight.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Strike-Block</hi> marked B 3. is a <hi>Plane</hi> shorter
than the <hi>Joynter,</hi> having its <hi>sole</hi> made exactly flat,
and straight, and is used for the <hi>shooting</hi> of a short
<hi>Joynt;</hi> because it is more handy than the long <hi>Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
It is also used for the framing, and fitting the
Joints of <hi>Miters</hi> and <hi>Bevels;</hi> but then it is used in
a different manner from other <hi>Planes:</hi> For if the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Bevel</hi> you are to fit be small, you must hold
it very steddy in your left hand, with the <hi>Sole</hi> of it
upwards, and its fore-end towards your right hand:
and you must hold your work in your right hand
very steddy: Then apply the sawn <hi>Miter,</hi> or sawn
<hi>Bevel</hi> end of your <hi>Stuff,</hi> to the fore-end of the <hi>Strike-Block,</hi>
                           <pb n="67" facs="tcp:41812:45"/>
and so thrust it hard and upright forwards, till
it pass over the edge of the <hi>Iron,</hi> so shall the edge of
the <hi>Iron,</hi> with several of these thrusts continued,
cut, or plain off your <hi>stuff</hi> the roughness that the
<hi>Teeth</hi> of your <hi>Saw</hi> made: But if your work be so big
that you cannot well weild it in your right hand,
you must set the end of your work in the <hi>Bench-screw,</hi>
and Plain upon it with a <hi>smoothing Plane.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Plow</hi> marked B 6. is a narrow <hi>Rabbet-Plane,</hi>
with some additions to it: <hi>viz.</hi> two square <hi>Staves,</hi>
marked <hi>aa</hi> (yet some of them have the upper ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of them rounded off for the better compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the Hand.) The <hi>Staves</hi> are let stiff through
two square Mortesses in the <hi>stock,</hi> marked <hi>bb.</hi> They
are about seven or eight Inches long, and stand straight
and square on the farther side of the <hi>stock;</hi> and these
two <hi>staves</hi> have sholders on the higher side of the <hi>stock,</hi>
reaching down to the wooden <hi>sole</hi> of the <hi>Plane,</hi> (for there
is also an <hi>Iron sole</hi> belonging to the <hi>Plow.)</hi> To the bottom
of these two Sholders is, Rivetted with Iron Rivets, a
<hi>Fence</hi> (as workmen call it) which comes close under the
<hi>Wooden sole,</hi> and its depth reaches below the <hi>Iron sole</hi>
about half an Inch: Because the <hi>Iron</hi> of the Plow is
very narrow, and the sides of it towards the bottom
are not to be inclosed in the <hi>stock,</hi> for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that was given in the <hi>Rabbet-Plane;</hi> therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>stock</hi> is let in, and strongly nailed, an Iron Plate
of the thickness of the Plow-Iron, for Wood of
that breadth will not be strong enough to endure the
force the lower end of the Plow-Iron is put to: This
Iron-Plate is almost of the same thickness that the
breadth of a Plow-Iron is. Joyners have several <hi>Plows,</hi>
for several widths of <hi>Grooves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Office of the <hi>Plow</hi> is, to plow a narrow square
<hi>Groove</hi> on the edge of a Board; which is thus perform'd.
The Board is set an edge with one end in the <hi>Bench-screw,</hi>
                           <pb n="69" facs="tcp:41812:46"/>
and its other edge upon a Pin, or Pins, put into
a Hole, or Holes, in the Leg, or Legs, of the Bench,
such an Hole, or Holes, as will, most conveniently for
height, fit the breadth of the Board: Then the <hi>Fence</hi> of
of the <hi>Plow</hi> is set to that distance off the Iron-Plate of
the Plow, that you intend the <hi>Groove</hi> shall lie off the
edge of the Board: As if you would have the <hi>Groove</hi>
lie half an Inch off the Board, then the two <hi>staves</hi> must,
with the <hi>Mallet,</hi> be knocked through the Mortesses in
the <hi>stock,</hi> till the <hi>Fence</hi> stands half an Inch off the Iron
Plate; and if the <hi>staves</hi> are fitted stiff enough in the
Mortess of the <hi>stock,</hi> it will keep at that distance whilst
you plow the <hi>Groove:</hi> For the <hi>Fence</hi> (lying lower than
the <hi>Iron</hi> of the <hi>Plane)</hi> when you set the <hi>Iron</hi> of the <hi>Plow</hi>
upon the edge of the Board, will lie flat against the
farther edge of the Board, and so keep the <hi>Iron</hi> of the
<hi>Plow</hi> all the length of the Board at the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
from the edge of the Board that the <hi>Iron</hi> of the
<hi>Plow</hi> hath from the <hi>Fence.</hi> Therefore your <hi>Plow</hi> being
thus fitted, plow the <hi>Groove</hi> as you work with other
<hi>Planes,</hi> only as you laid hold on the <hi>stock</hi> of other <hi>Planes</hi>
when you use them, now you must lay hold of the
two <hi>staves</hi> and their <hi>sholders,</hi> and so thrust your Plow
forwards, till your Groove be made to your depth.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Staves</hi> go not stiff enough in the Mortess
of the Stock, you must stiffen them, by knocking a
little wooden wedge between the Staves and their
Mortesses.</p>

                        <p>There are several other <hi>Planes</hi> in use amongst

<hi>Hollow, the Ogee,</hi> the <hi>Snipes-Bill,</hi> the <hi>Rabbet-plane,</hi> the
<hi>Grooving-plane,</hi> &amp;c. And of these they have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> from Half a quarter of an Inch, to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41812:47"/>
an Inch and a Half. They are used as other <hi>Planes</hi>
are. In the Planeing of Stuff, you must use <hi>Planes</hi>
whose <hi>Irons</hi> have different Mountings; and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the hardness, or softness of the Wood, you are
to work upon: For if the wood be hard, the <hi>Iron</hi> must
stand more upright than it need do, if the wood
be soft: For soft Wood, as <hi>Deal, Pear-tree, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
&amp;c. The <hi>Iron</hi> is set to make an Angle of 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
with the <hi>Sole</hi> of the <hi>Plane:</hi> But if it be very
hard wood you are to Plain upon, as <hi>Box, Ebony,
Lignum Vitae,</hi> &amp;c. It is set to 80 degrees, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
quite upright: so that these hard Woods, are,
indeed, more properly said to be Scraped, than
Plained.</p>
                        <p>But before you come to use your <hi>Planes,</hi> you must
know how to grind, and whet them, for they are not
so fitted when they are bought, but every Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
accommodates them to his purpose, as if it be
an hard wood he is to work on, he grinds his <hi>Basil</hi>
to a more obtuse Angle, than he would do for soft
Wood.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Basil,</hi> or Angle, an Iron is ground to, to work
on soft Wood is about 12 Degrees, and for hard wood
about 18, or 20 Degrees. Where note, That the more

the <hi>Iron</hi> cuts, and the more obtuse and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

                        <p>When you grind your <hi>Iron,</hi> place your two Thumbs
under the <hi>Iron,</hi> and your Fingers of both hands upon
the <hi>Iron,</hi> and so clap down your <hi>Iron</hi> to the stone, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

it to that Angle with the <hi>Stone</hi> you intend the
<hi>Basil</hi> shall have: keep the <hi>Iron</hi> in this posture, without
either mounting, or sinking, its ends all the while the
the <hi>Stone</hi> is turning about; And when you lift the
<hi>Iron</hi> off the <hi>Stone,</hi> to see if it be ground to your mind;
if it be not, you must be sure you place the <hi>Iron</hi> again
in the same position on the <hi>Stone</hi> it had before; for else
you will make a double <hi>Basil</hi> on your <hi>Iron:</hi> But if it be
true set on the <hi>Stone,</hi> and steddily kept to that Position,
your <hi>Basil</hi> will be <hi>Hollow,</hi> and the smaller your <hi>Grind-stone</hi>
is, the hollower it will be. You may know when
it is well Ground, by the evenness, and entireness of the
edge all the way.</p>
                        <p>Having ground your <hi>Iron,</hi> you must smoothen the
edge finer with a good fine <hi>Whet-stone.</hi> Thus, hold
the edge of your <hi>Iron</hi> upwards in your left hand, and
your <hi>Whet-stone</hi> in your right, and having first spit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Stone to wet it, apply it to the <hi>Basil</hi> of your
<hi>Iron,</hi> in such a Position, that it may bear upon the
whole breadth of the <hi>Basil;</hi> and so working the
<hi>Stone</hi> over the <hi>Basil,</hi> you will quickly wear the courser
grating of the <hi>Grind-stone</hi> off the edge on that
side: Then turn the flat side of the <hi>Iron,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the <hi>Stone</hi> flat to it, till you have worn off the
course gratings of the <hi>Grind-stone,</hi> on that side
too.</p>
                        <p>Joyners often grind their <hi>Irons</hi> upon a flat <hi>Grind-stone</hi>
also: And then they hold the <hi>Iron</hi> also in their
hands, in the same posture as if it were to be ground
on the <hi>Round Grind-stone:</hi> yet then instead of keeping
the <hi>Iron</hi> on one place of the <hi>Stone,</hi> they thrust it
hard straight forwards, almost the length of the
<hi>Stone,</hi> and draw it lightlier straight back again,
keeping it all the while at the same Angle with the
superficies of the <hi>Stone;</hi> and then smoothen its edge
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41812:48"/>
with the <hi>Whet-stone,</hi> as if it had been ground upon the
round <hi>Grind-stone.</hi> And this they do so often, till they
have rubbed the hollowness of the <hi>Basil</hi> to a flat,
and then they grind it again upon the round <hi>Grind-stone.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Formers</hi> marked C1, C3, are of several sizes.
They are called <hi>Formers,</hi> because they are used be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Paring-Chissel,</hi> even as the <hi>Fore-Plane</hi> is used
before the <hi>Smoothing-Plane.</hi> The <hi>Stuff</hi> you are to
work upon being first scribed, (as I shall shew in its
proper place) you must set the edge of the <hi>Former,</hi>
a little without the scribed stroak, with its <hi>Basil</hi>
outwards, that it may break, and sholder off the
Chips from your Work, as the Edge cuts it. And
you must bear the <hi>Helve</hi> of the <hi>Former</hi> a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
over the <hi>Stuff,</hi> that the <hi>Former</hi> do not at first
cut straight down, but a little outwards: For,
should you venter to cut straight down at the first,
you might with a negligent or unluckly knock with
the <hi>Mallet,</hi> drive the edge of the <hi>Former</hi> under
the work, and so cut, before you are aware, more
off the under side than the upper side of your
work, and so (perchance) spoil it. Therefore you
may make several cuttings, to cut it straight down
by little and little, till your work is made ready for
the <hi>Paring-Chissel.</hi> When it is used, the <hi>Helve</hi> of it
is knockt upon with a <hi>Mallet,</hi> to drive the edge into
the <hi>Stuff.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Paring-Chissel</hi> marked C2. must have a very
fine and smooth edge: Its office is to follow the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
and to <hi>pare</hi> off, and <hi>smoothen,</hi> the irregularities
the <hi>Former</hi> made.</p>
                        <p>It is not knockt upon with the <hi>Mallet,</hi> but the
Blade is clasped upon the out side of the hindermost
joints of the fore and little fingers, by the clutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
inside of the middle and third fingers of the right
hand, and so its edge being set upon the <hi>scribed line,</hi>
and the top of the <hi>Helve</hi> placed against the hollow
of the inside of the right sholder, with pressing the
sholder hard upon the <hi>Helve,</hi> the edge cuts and pares
away the irregularities.</p>
                        <p>This way of handling, may seem a preposterous
posture to mannage an Iron Tool in, and yet the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Original contriver of this Posture is to be
approved; For, should Workmen hold the <hi>Blade</hi> of
the <hi>Paring-Chissel</hi> in their whole hand, they must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hold their hand pretty near the <hi>Helve,</hi> where
they cannot well mannage the <hi>Tool,</hi> or they must
hold it pretty near the edge, where the outside of the
fingers will hide the <hi>scribed line</hi> they are to <hi>Pare</hi>
in. But this posture, all Workmen are at first taught,
and Practice doth so inure them to it, that if they
would, they could not well leave it.</p>

                        <head>§ 15. Of the Square, and its Use.</head>
                        <p>THE <hi>Square,</hi> marked D, is two adjunct Sides
of a Geometrical Square. <hi>a</hi> The <hi>Handle.
b</hi> The <hi>Tongue. c</hi> The <hi>Outer Square. d</hi> The
<hi>Inner Square.</hi> For Joyner's use, it is made
of two pieces of wood, the one about an Inch thick,
and the other about a quarter of an Inch thick:
These two pieces are severally shot exactly straight,
and have each of their Sides parallel to each of
there own Sides. The thick Piece (called the Handle)
hath a Mortess in it, as long within a quarter of an
Inch, as the thin piece (called the Tongue) is broad,
and stifly so wide, as to contain the thickness of the
Tongue. The Tongue is fastned into the Mortess
of the Handle with Glew and wooden pins, so as the
two outer sides (and then consequently the two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
sides) may stand at right Angles with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                        <p>The Reason why the Handle is so much thicker
than the Tongue, is, because the Handle should on
either side become a Fence to the Tongue. And
the reason why the Tongue hath not its whole
breadth let into the end of the Handle is, because
they may with less care strike a line by the side of a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41812:52"/>
a thin than a thick piece: For if instead of holding
the hand upright when they strike a line, they
should hold it never so little inwards, the shank of
a Pricker falling against the top edge of the Handle,
would throw the Point of a Pricker farther out than
a thin piece would: to avoid which Inconvenience,
the Tongue is left about half an Inch out of the end
of the Handle.</p>
                        <p>Another Reason is, That if with often striking the
Pricker against the Tongue it becomes ragged, or
uneven, they can with less trouble plane it again when
the stuff is all the way of an equal strength, than they
can, if cross-grain'd Sholders be added to any part
of it.</p>
                        <p>Its use is for the striking of Lines square either to
other Lines, or to straight sides, and to try the square<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Work by; As if they would strike a
Line square to a side they have already shot: They
apply the inside of the Handle close to the side shot,
and lay the Tongue flat upon the work, then by the
outerside of the Tongue, they draw with a Pricker
a straight line: this is called <hi>Striking, or drawing of
a Square.</hi> Or, if they would Try the squareness of
a Piece of stuff shot on two adjoining sides, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the insides of the Handle and Tongue to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
of the stuff, and if the outsides of the stuff do
all the way agree in Line with the insides of the
Square, it is true Square. Or if they would try the
inward squareness of work, they apply the two out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
of the Square to the insides of the work.</p>

                        <head>§ 16. The manner of Plaining and Trying a piece of
Stuff square.</head>
                        <p>We will take, for Example, a Piece of Stuff cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Quarter, which is commonly two Inches
thick, four Inches broad, and seven Foot long. To
plane this Square, lay one of its broad sides upon
the Bench, with one of its ends shov'd pretty hard
into the Teeth of the Bench-hook, that it may lie the
steddier. Then with the Fore-Plane, as you were
taught § 2. <hi>Number.</hi> 2. Plane off the roughness the Saw
made at the Pit, and work that side of the Quarter
as straight in its length and breadth as you can with
the Fore-Plane; which you may give a pretty good
guess at, if the edge of the Iron have born all the
way upon the work, yet you may try by taking up
your work, and applying one end of it to one Eye,
whilst you wink with the other, and observe if any
Hollow, or Dawks be in the length; if not,
you may conclude it pretty true: For the work thus
held, the Eye will discern pretty nearly. Or, for
more certainty, you may apply the edge of the two-foot
Rule, or rather a Rule shot the full length of
the Quarter to your work, and if it agree all the
way with the Rule, you may conclude it is straight
in length. But if you find it not straight, you must
still with the Fore-Plane work off those Risings that
bear the edge of the Rule off any part of the Stuff:
Then try if the Breadth be pretty straight, if it be,
(the Dawks the roughness the Fore Plane made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
the first office of the Fore Plane is perform'd:
If it be not, you must straighten the Breadth as you
did the Length.</p>
                        <p>But though this Quarter be thus plained straight
in length and breadth, yet because the Iron of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41812:53"/>
Fore Plane for its first working the stuff is set Rank,
and therefore makes great Dawks in the Stuff, you
must set the Iron of your Fore Plane finer, as you were
taught § 3. <hi>Number. 2.</hi> and with it then work down e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
almost to the bottom of those Dawks: then try
it again, as before, and if you find it Try all the way,
you may, with the Joynter, or Smoothing Plane, but
rather with the Joynter, go over it again, to work
out the irregularities of the fine Fore-Plane: For
the Iron of the Fore-Plane being ground to a Rising
in the middle, as has been shewed § 2. <hi>Numb. 2.</hi> though
it be very fine set, will yet leave some dawks in the
Stuff for the Joynter, or smoothing Plane, to work
out. Thus the first side of the Quarter will be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
                        <p>Having thus Tryed one side of the Quarter
straight and flat, apply the inside of the Handle
to it, and if one of the adjoining sides of the
Quarter, comply also with the inside of the Tongue
all the way, you need only smooth that adjoining
side: But if it do not so comply, that is, if it be
not square to the first side, which you will know by
the riding of the inside of the Tongue upon one
of the edges, or some other part between the edges,
you must, with the Fore-Plane Rank-set, plane away
that stuff which bears off the inside of the Tongue
from complying all the way with it. But if the
Risings be great, you may, for quickness, hew away
the Risings with the Hatchet: but then you must
have a care you let not the edge of your Hatchet cut
too deep into the stuff, lest you either spoil your
Stuff, by making it unsizeable, if it be already small
enough; or if it have substance enough, make your
self more labour to get out those Hatchet stroaks
with the Plane than you need. Then take off the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41812:53"/>
roughness the Hatchet made with the Fore-Plane
Rank-set, then fine set, and last of all with the Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or smoothing Plane: So is the second side also
finished.</p>
                        <p>To work the third side, set the Oval of the
Gage exactly to that width from the Gage, that
you intend the Breadth of the Quarter (when
wrought) shall have, which, in this our Example,
is four Inches, but will be somewhat less, because
working it true will diminish the Stuff: Therefore
sliding the Oval on the Staff, measure on your Inch
Rule so much less than four Inches, as you think
your stuff diminishes in working: Measure, I say,
between the Oval and the Tooth, your size: If, at
the first proffer, your Oval stand too far from the
Tooth, hold the Oval in your hand, and knock the
Tooth end of your Staff upon the Work-Bench, till
it stand near enough: If the Oval stand too near,
knock the other end of the Staff upon the Work-Bench
till it be fit. Then apply the flat of the Oval
to the second wrought side of your Stuff, so as the
Tooth may reach athwart the breadth of the Stuff
upon the first side, and keeping the Oval close
against the second side, press the Tooth so hard
down, that by drawing the Gage in this posture all
along the length of the Quarter, the Tooth may
strike a Line. In like manner upon the side oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the first, viz. the Fourth side, Gage another
line opposite to the first gaged line, and work your
Stuff down to those two Gaged lines on the third side,
either with Plaining along, or with Hewing, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Plaining, as you were taught to work the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
side.</p>
                        <p>To Work the fourth side, set the Tooth of the Gage
to its exact distance from the Oval, viz. two Inches
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41812:54"/>
wanting so much as you think the stuff diminish'd in
working, and apply the flat of the Oval to each side
of the first side, and Gage as before two lines, one
on the second, the other on the third wrought side.
Work your stuff then down on the fourth side to those
two Gage lines, either with Plaining alone, or with
Hewing, and afterwards Plaining, as you were taught
to work the second side.</p>

                        <head>§ 17. To Frame two Quarters Square into one
another.</head>
                        <p>You must take care in Mortessing and Tennanting,
that as near as you can you equallize the strength of
the sides of the Mortess to the strength of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
I do not mean that the stuff should be of an equal
Substance, for that is not equallizing strength: But
the equallizing strength must be considered with
respect to the Quality, Position and Substance of the
Stuff: As if you were to make a Tennant upon a piece
of Fur, and a Mortess to receive it in a piece of Oak,
and the Fur and Oak have both the same size; The
Tennant therefore made upon this piece of Fur, must be
considerably bigger than a Tennant need be made of
Oak, because Fur is much a weaker wood then Oak,
and therefore ought to have a greater Substance to
equallize the strength of Oak. And for Position, the
shorter the stuff that the Tennant is made on, the less
Violence the Tennant is subject to. Besides, it is easier
to split wood with the grain, than to brake wood cross
the grain; and therefore the same wood when posited
as a Tennant, is stronger than the same wood of the
same size when posited as a Mortess: for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a Mortess is subject to is, splitting with the grain
of the wood, which, without good care, it will often
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41812:54"/>
do in working; but the force that must injure a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
must offend it cross the grain of the wood, in
which position it will best indure violence.</p>
                        <p>When two pieces of Wood, of the same quality and
substance (as in this our Example) are elected to
make on the one a Tennant, and in the other a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess.
If you make the Mortess too wide, the sides of
the Mortess will be weaker than the Tennant; or,
if too narrow, the Tennant that must fit the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess,
will be weaker than the sides that contain the
Mortess: And if one be weaker then the other, the
weakest will give way to the strongest, when an
equal violence is offer'd to both. Therefore you
may see a necessity of equallizing the strength of
one to the other, as near as you can. But because no
Rule is extant to do it by, nor can (for many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
I think,) be made, therefore this equalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of strength, must be referred to the Judgment of
the Operator. Now to the work.</p>
                        <p>The Mortess to be made is in a Quarter four Inches
broad. In this case Workmen make the Mortess an
Inch wide, so that an Inch and an half Stuff remains
on either side it. Therefore your Stuff being squar'd,
as was taught in the last Section, set the Oval of the
Gage an Inch and an half off the Tooth, and gage
with it, on either side your Stuff, a straight line at
that distance from the end you intend the Mortess
shall be, then open your Compasses to two Inches,
and prick off that distance in one of the lines, for the
length of the Mortess: then lay the inside of the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Square to one side of the Stuff, and upon
both the pricks successively, and with your Pricker
draw straight lines through them by the side of the
Tongue, so shall the bounds of your Mortess be
struck out on the Quarter. If your Mortess go
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41812:55"/>
through the Quarter, draw the same lines on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
side of the Quarter, thus, Turn the Quarter,
or its edge, and apply the inside of the Handle of the
Square, to the ends of the former drawn lines, and by
the side of the Tongue draw two lines on the edge
of the Quarter; then turn the Quarter again with
its other broad side upwards, and apply the inside
of the Handle of the Square to the ends of the last
lines drawn on the edge, and by the side of the
Tongue, draw two lines on this broad side also.
These two lines (if your quarter was truly squar'd)
shall be exactly opposite to the two lines drawn on
the first broad side of the quarter for the length of
the Mortess: And for the width of the Mortess
Gage this side also, as you did the first; then for the
Tennant, Gage on that end of the Quarter you intend
the Tennant shall be made, the same lines you did for
the Mortess. And because the Quarter is two Inches
thick, prick from the end two Inches, and applying
the inside of the Handle of the Square to the side of
the Quarter, and the Tongue to that Prick, draw by
the side of the Tongue a line through that side the
Quarter; then turn the other sides of the Quarter suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively,
and draw lines athwart each side the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as you were taught to draw the opposite lines for
the Mortess.</p>
                        <p>Then place the edge of the Inch-Mortess-Chissel
with its Basil from you, and the Helve bearing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
towards you, within one half quarter of an Inch
of one end of the struck Mortess, and with your
Mallet knock hard upon it, till you find the Basil of
the Chissel will no longer force the chips out of the
Mortess; then remove the Chissel to the other end
of the Mortess, and work, as with the first end, till
the Chips will void no longer: Then work away
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41812:55"/>
the Stuff betwen the two Ends, and begin again
at one of the ends, and then at the other, and work
deeper into the Mortess, then again between
both; and so work deeper by degrees, till you have
wrought the Mortess through, or (if not through)
to the intended depht; then with the Mortess-Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
work nearer the drawn lines at the ends of the
Mortess, (for before you were directed to work but
within half a quarter of an Inch of the drawn
lines,) by laying light blows on it, till you have
made it fit to pare smooth with a narrow Paring
Chissel, and then pare the ends, as you were taught
to work with the Paring-Chissel: then with the
broad Paring-Chissel, pare the sides of the Mortess
just to the Struck lines; so is the Mortess fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
                        <p>To work the Tennant, lay the other Quarter on
edge upon your Work-Bench, and fasten it with the
<hi>Holdfast,</hi> as you were taught Sect. I. Then with the
Tennant, Saw a little without the Struck-line
towards the end: you must not Saw just upon the
Struck-line, because the Saw cuts rough: Besides,
you must leave some Stuff to pare away smooth to
the Struck-line, that the <hi>Stile</hi> (that is, the upright
Quarter) may make a close Joint with the <hi>Rail</hi> (that
is) the lower Quarter: Saw therefore right down
with the Tennant-Saw, just almost to the gaged lines
for the thickness of the Tennant, and have a care
to keep the Blade of the Saw exactly upright.
Then turn the opposite side of the Quarter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and work as you were taught to work the
first side.</p>
                        <p>Then with the Paring-Chissel, pare the Work
close to the gaged lines for the Tennant. Then try
how it fits the Mortess: If it be not pared enough
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41812:56"/>
away, you must Pare it where it Bears, that is, sticks.
But if you should chance to have made it too little,
you have spoiled your work: Therefore you may see
how necessary it is, not to make the Mortess too wide
at first, or the Tennant too narrow.</p>
                        <p>Then with the Piercer pierce two holes through
the sides, or cheeks of the Mortess, about half an
Inch off either end one. Then knock the Tennant
stiff into the Mortess, and set it upright, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Angle of the outer Square, to the Angle the
two Quarters make, and with your Pricker, prick
round about the insides of the Pierced holes upon
the Tennant. Then take the Tennant out again,
and Pierce two holes with the same Bit, about the
thickness of a shilling above the Pricked holes on
the Tennant, that is, nearer the sholder of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that the Pins you are to drive in, may draw
the sholder of the Tennant the closer to the flat side
of the Quarter the Mortess is made in. Then with
the Paring-Chissel make two Pins somewhat Taper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
full big enough, and setting the two Quarters
again square, as before, Drive the Pins stiff into the
Pierced holes.</p>
                        <p>If you make another Square, as you did this; and
make also a Tennant on each un-Tennanted end of
the Stiles, and another Mortess on the top and bottom
Rails, you may put them together, and make square
Frame of them.</p>

                        <p>The Miter square marked E, hath (as the Square)
an Handle marked <hi>a,</hi> one Inch thick, and three Inches
broad, and a Tongue marked <hi>b,</hi> of about the same
breadth: the Handle and the Tongue (as the Square)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41812:56"/>
have both their sides parallel to their own sides. The
Handle (as the square) hath in the middle of its narrowest
Side a Mortess in it, of an equal depht, the whole length
of the Handle: Into this Mortess is fitted one end of
the Tongue, but the end of the Handle is first Bereld
off to make an Angle of 45 Degrees with its inside. This
Tongue is (as the square) Pin'd and Glewed into the
Mortess of the Handle.</p>
                        <p>It is used for striking a Miter-line, as the Square
is to strike a Square-line, by applying the Inside of
the Handle to the outside of the Quarter, or Batten,
you are to work upon; and then by striking a line
by the side of the Tongue: For that line shall be a
Miter line. And if upon two Battens you strike two
such lines, and Saw and Pare them just off in the
lines, when the flats of those two sawn ends are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to one another, the out and inside of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens,
will form themselves into the Figure of a
Square.</p>
                        <p>Thus Picture Frames, and looking Glass-frames, are
commonly made, as by a more full Example you may
see in the next Section.</p>

                        <head>§ 19. Of the Bevil.</head>
                        <p>As the Square is made to strike an Angle of 90
Degrees, and the Miter an Angle of 45 degrees, so
the Bevil (marked F) having its Tongue movable
upon a Center, may be set to strike Angles of any
greater, or lesser, numbers of Degrees, according as
you open the Tongue wider from, or shut it closer to
the Handle. It is used as the Square, and the Miter,
and will perform the Offices of them both, though it
be not purposely made for either; but for the striking
such Bevil lines, as one part of your work must be cut
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41812:57"/>
away to, to make it join with another part of your work:
For Example,</p>
                        <p>We will propose to make a Frame for a Picture,
Looking-Glass, &amp;c. containing eight straight Sides;
You may quickly perceive that all the ends of these
eight sides must be cut to Bevils, and what Bevils
they must be, you will, find if you describe upon a
smooth flat Board, a Circle of any bigness, but the
larger the better: Divide this Circle into eight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
parts, and from every point draw a Line to the
Center: Draw also straight lines from every point
to its next point: Then lay the inside of the Handle
of your Bevil exactly upon any one of these straight
lines, so as the Angle made by the inside of the
Handle, and the inside of the Tongue, lie exactly at
the very Angle made by this straight line, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-Diametral
line proceeding from the Center, and
move the Tongue nearer, or farther off the Handle,
till the inside of the Tongue and the inside of the
Handle, lie exactly upon those two lines, so shall your
Bevil be set.</p>
                        <p>Then having fitted your Pieces to your Seant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
Stick your Pricker as near the outward Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of your Pieces as your stuff will bear, and apply
the inside of your handle also to the outer sides of
your Pieces, and so as the inside of the Tongue may
be drawn home to the Pricker. For then lines drawn
on those Pieces by the inside of the Tongue, shall be
the lines the Pieces must be cut in, to make these
eight Pieces join evenly together by the sides of
each other's Bevil: Then with the Strike-block
smooth the ends of the Bevils, as you were taught
in the Section of the Strike-Block.</p>
                        <p>If you have a Board on the Back-side of this
Frame, you may Glew the backsides of these Pieces,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41812:57"/>
piece by piece to the Board; but first you must fit
them to an exact compliance of every Bevil with
its Match, and when they are so fitted, drive two
Nails close to the outside of every piece, but drive
not the Nails deep into the Board, because when
the Frame is set, and Glewed, or otherwise fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
you must draw the Nails out again, For these
Nails are only intended to serve for Fences to set,
and sit each piece into its proper place, before the
whole Frame is fastned together. And should you
not thus Fence them, though by your Eye you
might judge you fitted the Bevils exactly, yet one
piece being never so little out of its due position,
would drive the next piece more out, and that the
next, till at the last, the last piece would not join,
but either be too short, or too long, or stand too
much out, or in, or else too open, or too close on the
out, or inside.</p>
                        <p>But if you have no Board on the backside, you
must, when you Saw the Bevilling Angles upon the
square ends of pieces, not sawn quite through the
depth of one end of every piece, but about half way
through the depth, or thickness, and then with your
Chissel either split, or else pare, the upper side of the
square end flat away to the Bevil, and so leave part of
of the square end of your piece, to lap under the piece is
joined to. For Example,</p>
                        <p>In Fig. 3. Plate <hi>5. ab</hi> is the square end of the
piece, and <hi>bc</hi> is the Bevil you work the piece to.
Therefore you must work away so much of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the square end, as is comprehended between
<hi>a</hi> and <hi>c,</hi> so that you will see the Triangle <hi>abc,</hi> is to be
wrought away half way down the thickness of the
Stuff, and so will the Triangle <hi>abc</hi> be left for the
other half thickness of the Stuff. But that end of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41812:58"/>
piece mark'd 1, which joins to the piece mark'd 2,
must, upon its Bevil-stroak, be sawn quite off, and its
underside must have the same Triangle wrought into
it, just so fit as to receive the Triangle in piece 2,
and just so deep, as that when the Triangle on piece 2,
is fitted into the Triangle in piece 1, the Superficies
of both the pieces may be even with one another. And
thus you may lap the ends of every piece into one
another.</p>
                        <p>These Triangles at the ends of the pieces you may
Glew into one another, but if you think Glewing
alone not strong enough, you may Pierce an hole
near the inner edge of the Frame, because the Triangle
hath there most substance of stuff; and afterwards Pin
it, as you are taught to Pin the Rail and Stile together
in Sect. 17.</p>
                        <p>This way of Lapping over, is sometimes used also
for square Miters, or other Angular Frames.</p>

                        <p>There is another way used by Joyners that make
many Frames, to save themselves the labour of Drawing,
or striking out of Squares, Miters, and several Bevils
upon their Stuff: And this is with a Tool called a
<hi>Mitter-Box,</hi> described in Plate 5. Fig. 2. It is composed
of two pieces of Wood, of an Inch thick each, as A
the upright piece, B the Bottom piece. The Upright
piece is nailed upright, fast upon the Bottom-Piece.
And this Upright-piece hath on its upper side the Miter
Lines struck with the Miter square, as <hi>de,</hi> on the left
hand, and <hi>gh</hi> on the right hand: on these two Miter
lines the edge of the Saw is set, and a kerf made straight
down the upright piece, as from <hi>d e</hi> on the left hand to
<hi>f,</hi> and from <hi>gh</hi> on the right hand to <hi>i.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41812:58"/>
any other Bevil is struck upon the upper side
of the upright piece with the Bevil, as <hi>kl</hi> on the
left hand, and <hi>no</hi> on the right. On these two Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
lines the edge of the Saw is set, and a kerf made
straight down the upright piece, as from <hi>k</hi> to <hi>lm,</hi>
and from <hi>g h</hi> to <hi>i.</hi> You may make as many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
as you please on the upright piece, of the Miter
Box; Bevils to join Frames of either five, six, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
eight sides, &amp;c. and the manner to make them
to any number of sides, was in part taught in the
last Section. For as there you were directed to divide
the Circle into eight equal parts, because eight was
the number of sides, we proposed to make that Frame
consist of; So, if for any number of sides you divide
the Circle into the same equal parts, and work as you
were there directed, you may find what Bevil the Pieces
must have that make a Frame that consists of any number
of sides.</p>
                        <p>So also for Sawing of any Batten, or other small pieces
square: Strike at the point <hi>a,</hi> on the upper side of the
upright piece a line straight athwart it, to <hi>b,</hi> and Saw
straight down the upper piece, to <hi>c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The manner how these Kerfs are sawn straight
down with greatest certainty is, thus, Apply the
inside of the Handle of the square to the upperside
of the upright piece, so as the Tongue lie close to
that end of the Miter, Bevil, or square line struck
through the upper side of the Miter-Box, and with
the Pricker strike a line close by the side of the
Tongue, through that side of the upright piece;
Turn the Tongue to the other side of the upright
piece, and apply the inside of the Handle of the
square to the other end of the Miter, Bevil, or Square
line, and with the Pricker strike also a line close
by the side of the Tongue through that side the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41812:59"/>
upright piece. These two lines struck on either side
of the upright piece, shall be a line on each side in
which the edge of the Saw must run, to saw it straight
down.</p>

chuse the Tools a Smith was to use; Because it is
a Smith's office to make them: And because in those

work in general, and the making and excellency
of some Tools in particular, which might serve
as a general Notion for the knowledge of all Smith's
Workmanship, especially to those that should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
themselves with Smithing: But to those
that shall concern themselves with Joinery, and not
with Smithing; It will be necessary that I teach them
how to chuse their Tools that are made by Smiths,
that they may use them with more ease and delight,
and make both quicker and neater work with them.</p>
                        <p>All sorts of Saws, for Joyner's use, are to be sold
in most Iron-monger's shops, but especially in <hi>Foster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,
London:</hi> chuse those that are made of Steel,
(for some are made of Iron) for Steel of it self is
harder and stronger than Iron: You may know the
Steel-<hi>Saws</hi> from Iron-<hi>Saws</hi> thus, The Steel-<hi>Saws</hi> are
generally ground bright and smooth, and are (the
thickness of the Blade considered) stronger than Iron
<hi>Saws:</hi> But the Iron-<hi>Saws</hi> are only Hammer-hardned,
and therefore if they could be so hard, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be so smooth, as if the irregularities of the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
were well taken off with the Grindstone: See it be
free from flaws, and very well Hammered, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41812:60"/>
smoothly Ground, (that is, evenly Ground,) you may
know if it be well Hammered by the stiff bending of
it, and if it be well Ground, (that is, evenly Ground,)
it will not bend in one part of it more than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for if it do, it is a sign that part where it bends
most is, either too much Ground a-way, or too thin
Forged in that place: But if it bend into a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
bow all the way, and be stiff, the Blade is
good: It cannot be too stiff, because they are but
Hammer-hardned, and therefore often bow when
they fall under unskilful hands, but never break,
unless they have been often bowed in that place.
The edge whereon the Teeth are, is always made
thicker than the back, because the back follows the
Edge, and if the Edge should not make a pretty wide
Kerf, if the back do not strike in the Kerf, yet by
never so little irregular bearing, or twisting of the
hand awry, it might so stop, as to bow the <hi>Saw;</hi>
and (as I said before) with often bowing it will break
at last. When Workmen light of a good Blade thus
qualified, they matter not much whether rhe Teeth
be sharp or deep, or set to their mind: for to make
them so, is a Task they take to themselves: And
thus they perform it: They wedge the blade of
the <hi>Saw</hi> hard into the <hi>Whetting-Block,</hi> marked P. in
<hi>Plate 4.</hi> with the handle towards their left hand,
and the end of the <hi>Saw</hi> to the right, then with a
three-square File they begin at the left hand end,
leaning harder upon the side of the file on the right
hand, than on that side to the left hand; so that they
file the upperside of the Tooth of the Saw a-slope to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the right hand, and the underside of the Tooth
a little a-slope towards the left, or, almost down-right.
Having filed one Tooth thus, all the rest must be so
filed. Then with the <hi>Saw-wrest,</hi> marked O. in <hi>Plate</hi> 4.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41812:61"/>
they <hi>set</hi> the Teeth of the Saw: that is, they put one
of the Notches marked <hi>a a a</hi> of the <hi>Wrest</hi> between the
first two Teeth on the Blade of the <hi>Saw,</hi> and then
turn the Handle Horizontally a little about upon
the Notch towards the end of the <hi>Saw;</hi> and that at
once turns the first Tooth somewhat towards you,
and the second Tooth from you: Then skipping
two Tooth, they again put one of the notches of the
<hi>Wrest</hi> between the third and fourth Teeth on the
Blade of the <hi>Saw,</hi> and then (as before) turn the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
a little about upon the notch towards the end of
the <hi>Saw,</hi> and that turns the third Tooth somewhat
towards you, and the Fourth somewhat from you:
Thus you must skip two Teeth at a time, and turn
the <hi>Wrest</hi> till all the Teeth of the <hi>Saw</hi> are <hi>set.</hi> This
<hi>Setting</hi> of the Teeth of the <hi>Saw</hi> (as Workmen call
it) is to make the Kerf wide enough for the Back to
follow the edge: and is Set <hi>Ranker</hi> for soft, course,
cheap Stuff, than for hard, fine, and costly Stuff: for
the <hi>Ranker</hi> the Tooth is set, the more Stuff is wasted
in the Kerf: and besides, if the Stuff be hard it will
require greater labour to tear away a great deal of hard
Stuff, than it will do to tear away but a little of the same
Stuff</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Pit-Saw,</hi> is Set so Rank for course stuff,
as to make a Kerf of almost a quarter of an Inch, but
for fine and costly stuff they set it finer to save Stuff.
The <hi>Whip-Saw</hi> is set somewhat finer than the <hi>Pit-Saw;</hi>
the <hi>Hand-Saw,</hi> and the <hi>Compass-Saw,</hi> finer than the
<hi>Whip-Saw;</hi> But the <hi>Tennant-Saw, Frame-saw,</hi> and the
<hi>Bow-Saw,</hi> &amp;c. are set fine, and have their Teeth but
very little turned over the sides of their Blades: So
that a Kerf made by them, is seldom above half a half
quarter of an Inch.</p>
                        <p>The reason why the Teeth are filed to an Angle,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41812:61"/>
pointing towards the end of the <hi>Saw,</hi> and not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the handle of the <hi>Saw,</hi> or directly straight
between the handle and end of the <hi>Saw,</hi> is, Because
the <hi>Saw</hi> is designed to cut only in its progess for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
Man having in that activity more strength
to rid, and Command of his hands to guide his
Work, than he can have in drawing back his <hi>Saw,</hi>
and therefore when he draws back his <hi>Saw,</hi> the
Work-men bears it lightly off the unsawn <hi>Stuff;</hi>
which is an case to is labour, and enables him the
longer to continue his several Progressions of the
<hi>Saw.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Master-Workmen, when they direct any of their
Underlins to saw such a piece of Stuff, have several
Phrases for the sawing of it: They seldom say <hi>Saw
that piece of Stuff;</hi> But <hi>Draw the Saw through it; Give
that piece of Stuff a kerf; Lay a kerf in that piece of
Stuff;</hi> and sometimes, (but most unproperly,) <hi>Cut,</hi> or
<hi>Slit that piece of stuff:</hi> For the Saw cannot properly
be said to cut, or slit the Stuff; but it rather breaks,
or tears away such parts of the Stuff from the
whole, as the points of the Teeth prick into, and
these parts it so tears away are proportionable to
the fineness, or rankness of the Setting of the Teeth.</p>
                        <p>The Excellency of Sawing is, to keep the kerf
exactly in the line marked out to be Sawn, without
wriggling on either, or both sides; And straight
through the Stuff, as Work-men call it; that is, in a
Geometrical Term, perpendicularly through the
upper and underside, if your Work require it, as
most work does: But if your work be to be Sawn
upon a Bevil, as some work sometimes is, then you
are to observe that Bevil all the length of the
Stuff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <head>§ 27. The Use of the Pit-Taw, marked M. in Plate 4.</head>
                        <p>The <hi>Pit-Saw</hi> is not only used by those Work-men
that make Sawing Timber and Boards their whole
business, but is also for small matters used by Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
when what they have to do, may perhaps be
as soon done at home, as they can carry or send it
to the Sawyers. The manner of their working is
both alike, for if it be a Board they would slit off a
piece of Timber, or if they would take any square,
Quarter, or Batten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> off, they first set off their
Scantlin: For Example, If it be an Inch (or more,
or less) they would take off a piece of Stuff, they
open the points of their Compasses to an Inch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
on their Rule, and so much more as they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
the kerf of the <hi>Saw</hi> will make, and from on side
of their Stuff they set off at either end of the Stuff,
the Distance of the points of their Compasses; at
this Distance therefore they make with the points
of their Compasses a prick at either end of the
Stuff; Then with Chaulk they whiten a line, by
rubbing the Chaulk pretty hard upon it; Then
one holds the line at one end upon the prick made
there, and the other strains the line pretty stiff up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the prick at the other end; then whilst the
line is thus strain'd, one of them between his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and Thumb draws the middle of the line di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
upright, to a convenient height (that it
may spring hard enough down) and then lets it
go again, so that it swiftly applies to its first posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and strikes so strongly against the Stuff, that
the dust, or attoms of the Chaulk that were rubbed
into the Line, shake out of it, and remain upon the
Stuff. And thus also they mark the under-side of
their Stuff: This is called <hi>Lining of the Stuff:</hi> And the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41812:62"/>
Stuff cut into those lines shall be called <hi>Inch-Stuff,</hi>
because the Compasses that prickt the Stuff, were
opened wider by the width of the kerf than an Inch
measure upon the Rule: But had the Compasses
been opened but an Inch exactly, that piece
Sawn off should, in Workmen's Language, have been
called <hi>Inch-prickt,</hi> thereby giving to understand that
it is half the breadth of the kerf thinner than an Inch:
And thus they call all other Scantlins <hi>2 Inches, 2 ½ In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
3 Inches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sawn,</hi> or <hi>Prickt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When two Work-men are not at hand to hold the
line at both ends, he that lines it, strikes one point of
his Compass, or sometimes a Pricker, or a Nale aslope
towards that end into the prick set off, and putting
the noose at the end of his line over his Compasses,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> goes to the other end, and strains his line on that
prick, and strikes it as before.</p>
                        <p>The Stuff being thus lined is fastned with wedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
over the <hi>Pit,</hi> (if the Joyner be accommodated
with a <hi>Pit)</hi> if he have none, he makes shift with
two high frames a little more than Man high in its
stead, (called <hi>great Trussels)</hi> with four Legs, these
Legs stand spreading outwards, that they may stand
the firmer: Over these two <hi>Trussels</hi> the Stuff is laid,
and firmly fastned that it shake not. Its outer
side from whence the Pricks were set off must be
Perpendicular, which you must try by a Plumb-line,
for should the top edge of that side, hang never so
little over the bottom edge, or the bottom edge
not lie so far out as the top edge, the Scantlin you
Saw off would not be of an equal thickness on the
Top or Bottom: Because the Saw is to work exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perpendicular. Then with the <hi>Pit-Saw</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the one end of the Stuff, the <hi>Top-man</hi> at the
Top, and the <hi>Pit-man</hi> under him: the <hi>Top-man</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41812:63"/>
to guide the <hi>Saw</hi> exactly in the line: and
withall drawing the Saw somewhat towards him
when the <hi>Saw</hi> goes down; and the <hi>Pit-man</hi> drawing
it with all his strength perpendicularly down; but
not so low that the upper and lower handles of the
<hi>Saw</hi> sink below both their managements: Then
bearing the Teeth of the <hi>Saw</hi> a little off the Stuff,
the <hi>Top-man</hi> draws the <hi>Saw</hi> up again, and the
<hi>Pit-man</hi> assists, or eases him in it, and thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
sawing on till the <hi>Saw</hi> has run through the
whole length upon the Stuff. But when the kerf
is made so long, that by the working of the <hi>Saw</hi>
the Pieces of Stuff on either side will shake against
one another, and so more, or less, hinder the easie
progress of the <hi>Saw,</hi> they drive a Wedge so far in
the kerf as they dare do for fear of splitting the
Stuff, and so provide the Saw freer and easier pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
through the Stuff: This Wedging they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
so oft as they find occasion.

                        <p>The clearest, driest, and most transparent Glew
is the best: when you boil it, break it with your
Hammer into small pieces, and put it into a clean
Skillet, or Pipkin, by no means greasie, for that
will spoil the clamminess of the Glew, put to it so
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41812:68"/>
much Water as is convenient to dissolve the Glew,
and to make it, when it is hot, about the thickness
of the White of an Egg: the quantity of water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be assigned, because of the different quality there is
in Glew: keep it stirring whilst it is melting, and let
it not stick to the sides or bottom of the Vessel:
When it is well boiled, pour it into your Glew-pot
to use, but let your Glew-pot be very clean. When it
is cold, and you would heat it again in your Glew-pot,
you must take great care that it burn not to
the sides or bottom of the Glew-pot, for that burning
either turns to a thick hard skin, or else to a burnt
Cinder-like Substance, which if it mingle with the
Glew, will spoil it all; because by its Substance it will
bear the two Joints you are to Glew together, off
each other.</p>
                        <p>When (with often heating) the Glew grows too thick,
you may put more water to it; but then you must
make it very hot, lest the Glew and Water do not
wholly incorporate.</p>
                        <p>Some Joyners will (when their Glew is too thick)
put Small Beer into it, thinking it strengthens it:
I have tried it, and could never find it so, but think
it rather makes the Glew weaker, especially if the
Small Beer chance to be new, and its Yest not well
settled from it, or so stale, that it be either Dreggy,
or any whit mingled with the Settlings of the Cask.</p>

                        <p>Your Glew must be very warm, for then it is
thinnest, and as it chills, it thickens: with a small Brush
you must smear the Glew well upon the Joint
of each piece you are to Glew together; And before
you set them as they are to stand, you must jostle them
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41812:68"/>
one upon the other, that the Glew may very well
touch and take hold of the Wood; and that the Glew
on each Joints may well incorporate. Then fit the two
Joints as they must stand; And when you set them
by to dry, let the one stand upright upon the other;
For if they stand a-slope, the weight of the Stuff when
it leans upon two extream edges, may make one end of
the Joint <hi>Open.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Waving Engine</hi> discribed in <hi>Plate 5. Fig. 7.</hi>
Hath AB a long square Plank, of about seven Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
broad, five Foot long, and an Inch and half
thick: All along the length of this Plank, on the
middle between the two sides, runs a <hi>Rabbet,</hi> as part
of it is seen at C: upon this Rabbet rides a <hi>Block,</hi>
with a <hi>Groove</hi> in its under side: This Block is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three Inches square, and ten Inches long, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
near the hinder end of it a wooden Handle going
through it, of about one Inch Diameter, as D E:
At the Fore-end of this Block is fastned a Vice,
somewhat larger than a great Hand-Vice, as at F: The
<hi>Groove</hi> in the Block is made fit to receive the Rabbet on
the Plank.</p>
                        <p>At the farther end of the Plank is erected a
square strong piece of wood, about six Inches high,
and five Inches square, as G. This Square Piece
hath a square wide Mortess in it on the Top, as at
H. Upon the top of this square piece is a strong
square flat Iron Coller, somewhat loosly fitted on,
having two Male Screws fitted into two Female
Screws, to screw against that part of the Wooden
Piece un-mortessed at the Top, marked L, that it
may draw the Iron Coller hard against the Iron
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41812:69"/>
marked Q, and keep it stiff against the fore-side of
the un-mortessed Piece, marked L, when the piece
Q, is set to its convenient heighth; and on the other
side the square wooden Piece is fitted another Iron
screw, having to the end of its shank fastned a round
Iron Plate which lies within the hollow of this wooden
piece, and therefore cannot in Draft be seen in its
proper place; But I have described it a part, as at M.
(Fig. 9.) Its Nut is placed at M, on the wooden
Piece. On the farther side of the wooden Piece is fitted
a Wooden Screw called a <hi>Knob,</hi> as at N. Through
the farther and hither side of the square Wooden Piece
is fitted a flat Piece of Iron, about three quarters of
an Inch Broad, and one quarter of an Inch thick,
standing on edge upon the Plank; but its upper edge
is filed round: (the reason you will find by and by:)
Its hither end comes through the wooden Piece, as at
O, and its farther end on the opposite side of the
wooden piece.</p>
                        <p>Upright in the hollow square of the wooden
piece stands an <hi>Iron,</hi> as at Q, whose lower end is cut
into the form of the Molding you intend your work
shall have.</p>
                        <p>In the fore side of this wooden Piece is a square hole,
as at R, called the <hi>Mouth,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this Engine belongs a thin flat piece of hard
Wood, about an Inch and a quarter broad, and as
long as the Rabbet: It is disjunct from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
and in Fig. 8. is marked SS, called the <hi>Rack:</hi>
It hath its under flat cut into those fashioned
waves you intend your work shall have: The hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of these waves are made to comply with the
round edge of flat Plate of Iron marken O (descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
before) for when one end of the Riglet you
wave, is, with the Vice, Screwed to the plain side of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41812:69"/>
the Rack, and the other end put through the
Mouth of the wooden Piece, as at TT, so as the
hollow of the wave on the under-side of the Rack
may lie upon the round edge of the flat Iron Plate
set on edge, as at O, and the Iron Q, is strong fitted
down upon the Riglet: Then if you lay hold of
the Handles of the Block D E, and strongly draw
by them, the Rack and the Riglet will both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
slide through the Mouth of the wooden Piece:
And as the Rounds of the Rack ride over the round
edge of the flat Iron, the Rack and Riglet will mount
up to the Iron Q, and as the Rounds of the Waves
on the under side of the Rack slides off the Iron on
edge, the Rack and Riglet will sink, and so in a
progression (or more) the Riglet will on its upper
side receive the form of the several waves on the under
side of the Rack, and also the form, or Molding, that is
on the edge of the bottom of the Iron, and so at once
the Riglet will be both molded and waved.</p>
                        <p>But before you draw the Rack through the Engine,
you must consider the office of the Knob N, and the
office of the Iron Screw M; For by them the Rack is
screwed evenly under the Iron Q. And you must be
careful that the Groove of the Block slip not off the
Rabbet on the Plank: For by these Screws, and the
Rabbet and Groove, your work will be evenly gaged
all the way (as I said before) under the edge of the
Iron Q, and keep it from sliding either to the right, or
left hand, as you draw it through the Engine.</p>

                        <p>In Wainscoting of Rooms there is, for the most
part, but two heights of Pannels used; unless the
Room to be Wainscoted be above ten foot high, as
some are eleven or twelve Foot high, and then three
Heighths of Pannels are used: As I The <hi>Lying Pannel,</hi>
above the <hi>Base.</hi> K The <hi>Large Pannel</hi> above the <hi>Middle
Rail:</hi> And L The <hi>Friese Pannel</hi> above the <hi>Friese Rail.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Friese Rail</hi> is to have the same breadth the <hi>Margent</hi>
of the <hi>Stile</hi> hath; The <hi>Middle Rail</hi> hath commonly two
breadths of the <hi>Margent</hi> of the <hi>Stile,</hi> viz. one breadth
above the <hi>Sur-base,</hi> and the other below the <hi>Sur-base.</hi>
And the <hi>Upper</hi> and <hi>Lower Rails</hi> have also each the same
breadth with the Margent of the <hi>Stile.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Those Moldings above the Prickt-line on the Top,

                        </p>
                        <p>Sometimes (and especially in Low Rooms) there is
no <hi>Base</hi> or <hi>Sur-base</hi> used, and then the <hi>Middle</hi> and <hi>Lower
Rail</hi> need not be so broad: For the <hi>Middle Rail</hi> need
not be above a third part more than the <hi>Margent</hi> of the
<hi>Rail:</hi> and the <hi>Lower-Rail</hi> you may make of what breadth
you see convenient: They are commonly about three
Inches and an half, or four Inches broad, yet this is no
Rule: For sometimes Workmen make only a flat Plinth
serve.</p>
                        <p>You may (if you will) adorn the outer edges of the
<hi>Stiles</hi> and <hi>Rails</hi> with a small <hi>Molding:</hi> And you may
(if you will) Bevil away the outer edges of the <hi>Pannels,</hi>
and leave a Table in the middle of the Pannel.</p>

                        <head>An Explanation of Terms used among Joyners.</head>
                        <p>When I first began to Print these Exercises, I marked
some Terms in <hi>Joinery</hi> with <hi>superiour Letters</hi> (as
Printers call them) thus <hi rend="sup">a</hi> 
                           <hi rend="sup">b</hi> 
                           <hi rend="sup">c</hi> &amp;c. intending, at the
latter end of these Exercises, to have explained the
Terms those Letters referr'd to: But upon consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
that those Terms might often be used in this
Discourse, when the Superiour Letter was out of sight,
and perhaps its position (where) forgotten; I have
changed my mind, and left out the Superiour Letters
beyond fol. 66. and instead of those References give
you this Alphabetical Table of Terms, by which you
may always more readily find the Explanation, though
you often meet with the Term.</p>

                              <hi>Cross-grained-stuff.</hi> Stuff is Cross-grained when a
Bough or some Branch shoots out on that part of the
Trunk of the Tree; For the Bough or branch shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forwards, the Grain of that branch shoots forwards
also, and so runs a-cross the Grain of the Trunk;
and if they be well grown together, it will scarce be
perceived in some stuff, but in working; yet in Deal
Boards, those Boughs, or Branches are Knots, and
easily perceiv'd, and if it grew up young with the
Trunk, then instead of a Knot you will find a Curling
in the Stuff when it is wrought.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Curling-stuff.</hi> If the Bough or Branch that shoots
out of the Trunk of a Tree be large, and the stuff in
that place sawn somewhat a-slope, when that stuff
comes under the Plane you will find a Turning about
or Curling on that place upon the Stuff; and in a
straight progress of the Plane the Iron will cut with,
and suddenly <hi>a-cross</hi> the Grain, and that more or less
as the Bough grew in the youth of the Tree, or grew
more or less upright, or else sloping to the Trunk,
or was sawn so. Such Stuff therefore is called <hi>Curling-stuff.</hi>

Scribe close against the other piece of Stuff they intend

distance, these two pieces of Stuff bear off each other:
Then (the Compasses moving stiff in ther Joint) they
bear the point of one of the shanks against the side
they intend to Scribe to, and with the point of the
other shank they draw a line upon the Stuff to be
Scribed; and then the points of the Compasses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining

OR,

                     <head>Applied to the ART of House-Carpentry.</head>
                     <p>BEing now come to exercise upon the <hi>Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
Trade, it may be expected, by some, that
I should insist upon <hi>Architecture,</hi> it being so
absolutely necessary for Builders to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with: But my Answer to them is,
that there are so many Books of Architecture extant,
and in them the Rules so well, so copiously, and so
compleatly, handled, that it is needless for me to say
any thing of that Science: Nor do I think any man
that should, can do more than collect out of their
Books, and perhaps deliver their Meanings in his own
Words. Besides, <hi>Architecture</hi> is a Mathematical Science,
and therefore different from my present undertakings,
which are (as by my Tittle) Mechanick Exercises:
yet because Books of Architecture are as necessary for a
Builder to understand as the use of Tools; and lest some
Builders should not know how to enquire for them,
I shall at the latter end of <hi>Carpentry</hi> give you the Names
of some Authors, especially such as are printed in the
English Tongue.</p>
                     <p>Some may perhaps also think it had been more
proper for me in these Exercises to have introduced
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41812:77"/>
                        <hi>Carpentry</hi> before <hi>Joynery,</hi> because Necessity (the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Invention) did doubtless compel our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the beginning to use the conveniency of the
first, rather than the extravagancy of the last. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
I considered it my self, and had in my own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
been persuaded to it, but that I also considered,
that the Rules they both work by are upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the same, in <hi>Sawing, Mortessing, Tenanting, Scribing,
Paring, Plaining, Moulding, &amp;c.</hi> and likewise the Tools
they work with the same, though some of them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
stronger for Carpenter's use than they need be
for Joyners; because Joyners work more curiously, and
observe the Rules more exactly than Carpenters need
do. And therefore I say it was, that I began with Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
before Carpentry; for he that knows how to work
curiously, may, when he lists, work slightly; when as
they that are taught to work more roughly, do with
greater difficulty perform more curious and nice work.
Thus we see Joyners work their Tables exactly flat and
smooth, and shoot their Joint so true, that the whole
Table shews all one piece: But the Floors Carpenters
lay are also by the Rule of Carpentry to be laid flat and
true, and shall yet be well enough laid, though not so
exactly flat and smooth as a Table.</p>
                     <p>Yet though the Rules Joyners and Carpenters work
by are so near the same, and the Tools they work
with, and Stuff they work upon, the same; yet there
are many Requisites proper to a Carpenter, (especially
a Master Carpenter) that a Joyner need take little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, which after I have described the Carpenters
Tools that are not exprest among the Joyners, I shall
speak to.</p>

                        <head>§ 1. Of several Tools used in Carpentry, that are
not used in Joynery. And first of the Ax</head>
                        <p>THe <hi>Ax</hi> marked <hi>A</hi> in <hi>Plate 8.</hi> is (as you see) differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from what the Joyners Hatchet is, both in size
and form; theirs being a light Hatchet, with a Basil edge
on its left side, because it is to be used with one hand,
and therefore hath a short Handle: But the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
<hi>Ax</hi> being to hew great Stuff, is made much deeper
and heavier, and its edge tapering into the middle of
its Blade. It hath a long Handle, because it is used
with both their hands, to square or bevel their Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                        <p>When they use the Ax, the Timber hath commonly
some Bauk or Log laid under it near each end, that the
edge of the Ax may be in less danger of striking into the
ground, when they hew near the bottom of the Timber.
And they commonly stand on that side the Timber they
hew upon.</p>

                     <div type="topic">
                        <head>§ 2. Of the Adz, and its use.</head>
                        <p>THe <hi>Adz</hi> marked <hi>B</hi> in <hi>Plate 8.</hi> hath its Blade made
thin, and somewhat arching. As the Ax hath its
edge parallel to its Handle, so the <hi>Adz</hi> hath its edge
athwart the Handle, and is ground to a Basil on its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
to its outer edge: wherefore when it is blunt they
cannot well grind it, unless they take its Helve out of
its Eye.</p>
                        <p>Its general use is to take thin Chips off Timber or
Boards, and to take off those irregularities that the Ax
by reason of its form cannot well come at; and that a
Plain (though rank set) will not make riddance enough
with.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="118" facs="tcp:41812:78"/>
It is most used for the taking off the irregularities on
the framed work of a Floor, when it is framed and pin'd
together, and laid on its place; for that lying flat under
them, the edge of the Ax being parallel to its Handle
(as aforesaid) cannot come at the irregularities to take
them off; but the <hi>Adz</hi> having its edge athwart the
Handle will. Again, upon some Posts framed upright,
and range with other framed work close to it, the edge
of the <hi>Ax</hi> cannot come at the irregularities (for the
reason aforesaid) but the <hi>Adz</hi> will. And the like for the
irregularities of framed work on a Ceiling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When they work upon the framed work of a Floor,
they take the end of the Handle in both their hands,
placing themselves directly before the irregularity, at a
small distance, stradling a little with both their Legs, to
prevent danger from the edge of the <hi>Adz,</hi> and so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
hew of the irregularity. But if they hew upon an
Upright, they stand directly before it.</p>
                        <p>They sometimes use the <hi>Adz</hi> upon small thin Stuff,
to make it thinner, (but this is many times when the
Ax, or some other properer Tool, lies not at hand)
and then they lay their Stuff upon the Floor, and hold
one end of it down with the Ball of the Foot, if the
Stuff be long enough; if not, with the ends of their
Toes, and so hew it lightly away to their size, or form,
or both.</p>

                        <head>§ 3. Of Carpenters Chissels in general.</head>
                        <p>THough Carpenters for their finer work use all
the sorts of <hi>Chissels</hi> described in <hi>Exercise 4.</hi> yet are
not those sorts of <hi>Chissels</hi> strong enough for their rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more common work, and therefore they also
use a stronger sort of <hi>Chissels;</hi> and distinguish them by
the name of <hi>Socket-Chissels:</hi> For whereas those <hi>Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi>
Joyners use have their wooden heads made hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to receive the Iron Sprig above the Shoulder of
the Shank, Carpenters have their Shank made with an
<hi>hollow Socket</hi> at its top, to receive a strong wooden Sprig
made to fit into that Socket, with a square Shoulder
above it, the thickness of the Iron of the Socket, or
somewhat more; which makes it much more strong,
and able to endure the heavy blows of the <hi>Mallet</hi> they
lay upon the head of the <hi>Chissel.</hi> And the Shanks and
Blades are made stronger for Carpenters use than they
are for Joyners.</p>
                        <p>Of these <hi>Socket Chissels</hi> they have of the several sorts
described in Joinery, though not all severally distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
by their names; for they call them <hi>Half-Inch,
Three-quarter-Inch Chissels, Inch and half, Two-Inch,</hi> to
<hi>Three-Inch Chissel,</hi> according to the breadth of the Blade.
But their Uses are the same mentioned in Joinery,
though the manner of using them be somewhat differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
too: For, as I told you in Joinery, the Joyners
press the edge of the Blade into the Stuff, with the
strength of their Shoulders, but the Carpenters with
the force of the blows of the Mallet. And the Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
guide their <hi>Chissels</hi> differently from what the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters
do their <hi>Socket Chissels;</hi> for the Joyners hold
the Shank and Blade of their <hi>Chissels,</hi> as I described in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41812:79"/>
                           <hi>Numb. 4. Sect. 11.</hi> but the Carpenters hold the Shank
of their <hi>Chissels</hi> in their clutched left hand, and beat upon
the Head with the <hi>Mallet</hi> in the right. See the Figure of
the <hi>Socket Chissel</hi> in <hi>Plate 8.</hi> C. with its Head <hi>a</hi> out of the
Socket.</p>

                        <head>§ 4. Of the Ripping Chissel, and its use.</head>
                        <p>THe <hi>Ripping Chissel</hi> described <hi>Plate 8.</hi> D. is a <hi>Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
Chissel,</hi> and is about an Inch broad, and
hath a blunt edge. Its edge hath not a <hi>Basil,</hi> as almost
all other <hi>Chissels</hi> have, and therefore would more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be called a <hi>Wedge</hi> than a <hi>Chissel.</hi> But most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Carpenters use an old cast off <hi>Chissel</hi> for a <hi>Ripping
Chissel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its office is not to cut Wood, as others do, but to <hi>rip</hi>
or <hi>tear</hi> two pieces of wood fastned together from one
another, by entering the blunt edge of it between
the two pieces, and then knocking hard with the Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
upon the head of the Handle, till you drive the
thicker part of it between the two pieces, and so
force the power that holds them together (be it Nails,
or otherwise) to let go their hold: For its blunt
edge should be made of Steel, and well tempered, so
that if you knock with strong blows of the Mallet
the <hi>Chissels</hi> edge upon a Nail (though of some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
substance) it may cut or brake it short asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
If you cannot, at once, placing the <hi>Ripping-Chiss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
part the two pieces, you must use two <hi>Ripping-Chiss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi>
placing the second at the remotest entrance in the
breach, and driving that home will both open the
breach wider, and loosen the first <hi>Ripping-Chissel,</hi> so
that you may take it out again, and place it farther
in the breach: And so you must continue edging far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41812:79"/>
and farther, till you have separated your intended
pieces.</p>
                        <p>It is sometimes used when Carpenters have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
error in their work, and must undo what they did,
to mend it. But it is generally used in all Alterations,
and old work.</p>

used about House-building, but for the making
of some sorts of Houshold-stuff; as the Legs of Crick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
the Rounds of Ladders, the Rails to lay Cheese or
Bacon on, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>When they use it, they set one end of their work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Breast, and the other end against their Work
bench, or some hollow angle that may keep it from slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and so pressing the work a little hard with their
Breast against the Bench, to keep it steddy in its position,
they with the Handles of the <hi>Draw-knife</hi> in both their
hands, enter the edge of the <hi>Draw-knife</hi> into the work,
and draw Chips almost the length of their work, and so
smoothen it quickly.</p>

They have many of these <hi>Hook-Pins</hi> to drive into the

the Pin-holes through the Mortesses and Tennants,
and being made taper, do with a Hammer striking on

the bottom of it knock it out again; or they most
commonly strike under the Hook, and so knock it out.
Then if the Frame lie in its place, they pin it up with
wooden Pins.</p>

the <hi>Claw, c c</hi> the <hi>Pen</hi> at the return sides of the <hi>Claw.</hi>
This Tool was forgot to be described in <hi>Joynery,</hi> though
they use <hi>Hammers</hi> too, and therefore I bring it in here.
Its chief use is for driving Nails into work, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nails out of work.</p>
                        <p>There is required a pretty skill in driving a Nail;
sor if (when you set the point of a Nail) you be
not curious in observing to strike the flat face of the
<hi>Hammer</hi> perpendiculary down upon the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
of the Shank, the Nail (unless it have good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance)
will start aside, or bow, or break; and then
you will be forced to draw it out again with the
<hi>Claw</hi> of the <hi>Hammer.</hi> Therefore you may see a reason
when you buy a <hi>Hammer,</hi> to chuse one with a true flat
<hi>Face.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A little trick is sometimes used among some (that
would be thought cunning Carpenters) privately to
touch the head of the Nail with a little Ear-wax, and
then lay a wager with a stranger to the Trick, that he
shall not drive that Nail up to the Head with so many
blows. The stranger thinks he shall assuredly win, but
does assuredly lose; for the <hi>Hammer</hi> no sooner touches
the Head of the Nail, but instead of entring the wood
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41812:82"/>
it flies away, notwithstanding his utmost care in strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it down-right.</p>

                        <head>§ 13. Of the Ten-foot Rod, and thereby to measure
and describe the Ground-plot.</head>
                        <p>WE shall begin therefore to measure the <hi>Ground-plot,</hi>
to which Carpenters use a <hi>Ten-Foot Rod</hi> for
expedition, which is a Rod about an Inch square, and
ten foot long; being divided into ten equal parts, each
part containing one foot, even as the <hi>Two-foot Rule</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in <hi>Exercise 6. § 13.</hi> is divided into 24 equal
parts, and their Sub-divisions.</p>
                        <p>With this <hi>Rod</hi> they measure the length and breadth
of the <hi>Ground-plot</hi> into Feet, and if there be odd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
they measure them with the <hi>Two-foot Rule.</hi> Their
measure they note down upon a piece of paper, and
having considered the situation of the Sides, <hi>East,
West, North,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> they draw on Paper their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sides accordingly, by a small Scale, either elected,
or else made for that purpose. They may elect their
<hi>Two-foot Rule</hi> for some plots; for an Inch and an
half may commodiously serve to set off one Foot on
some small <hi>Ground-plots,</hi> and then you have the Inches
to that Foot actually divided by the Marks for the half
quarters on the <hi>Two-foot Rule.</hi> But this large Scale
will scarce serve to describe a <hi>Ground-plot</hi> above ten
Foot in length, because a small sheet of Paper is not
above 15 or 16 Inches long, and therefore one sheet
of Paper will not contain it, if the <hi>Ground-plot</hi> be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
Therefore if you make every half quarter of an
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41812:84"/>
Inch to be a Scale for two Inches, a sheet of Paper will
contain 20 Foot in length: And if you make every half
quarter of an Inch to be a Scale for four Inches, a sheet
of Paper will contain 40 Foot. And thus by diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scale, the sheet of Paper will contain a grater
number of Feet.</p>
                        <p>But having either elected, or else made your Scale,
you are to open your Compasses to the number of
Feet on your Scale your <hi>Ground-plot</hi> hath in length,
and then transfer that distance to your Paper, and to
draw a straight Line between the two Points, and mark
that straight Line with <hi>East, West, North,</hi> or <hi>South,</hi>
according to the situation of that side of the <hi>Ground-plot</hi>
it represents. Then again open your Compasses to
the number of Feet on your Scale one of the adjoining
sides contains, and transfer that distance also to your
Paper, and draw a Line between the two points, and
note its situation of <hi>East, West, North,</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Do the like by the other sides; and if either a
Quirk, or any Addition, be added to the Building, on any
side of your <hi>Ground-plot,</hi> you must describe it also
proportionably.</p>
                        <p>Then you are to consider what Apartments, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
to make on your <hi>Ground-plot,</hi> or second, or
third Story, and to set them off from your Scale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at your intended Front. As for example,
Suppose your <hi>Ground-plot</hi> be a Long-square, 50 Foot
in length, and 20 Foot wide: This <hi>Ground-plot</hi> will
contain in its length two good Rooms, and a Yard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it 10 Foot long. If you will, you may divide
the 40 Foot into two equal parts, so will each Room
be 20 Foot square: Or you may make the Rooms
next the Front deeper, or shallower, and leave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
for the Back-Room: As here the Front
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41812:84"/>
Room is 25 Foot, and the Back-Room 15 Foot deep,
and a setting off of 8 Foot broad and 10 Foot long
taking out of the Yard, for a Buttery below stairs (if
you will) and Closets above stairs over it. But what
width and depth soever you intend your Rooms
shall have, you must open your Compasses to that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Feet on your Scale, and set off that Distance on
the <hi>East, West, North,</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> Line, according to the
Situation of that side it represents on your <hi>Ground-plot.</hi>
If you set it off the <hi>East</hi> Line, you must also set
it off on the <hi>West;</hi> if on the <hi>North</hi> Line, you must also
set it off on the <hi>South</hi> Line: Because between the two
Settings off on the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> Lines, or <hi>North</hi> or
<hi>South</hi> Lines, you must draw a straight Line of the
length of your intended Partition. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
you must from every Partition draw a Line in
its proper place on the Paper, by measuring the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
each Partition must have from the outside of
the <hi>Ground-plot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus you are also to describe by your Scale
your Front, and several sides of the Carcase; allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Principal Posts, Posts, Enterduces, Quarterings,
Braces, Gables, Doors, Windows,</hi> and <hi>Ornaments,</hi> their
several sizes, and true positions by the Scale: Each
side upon a Paper by it self: Unless we shall suppose
our Master-Workman to understand <hi>Perspective;</hi> for
for then he may, on a single piece of Paper, describe the
whole Building, as it shall appear to the Eye at any as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed

                        <p>HAving drawn the <hi>Draft,</hi> the Master-Workman is
first to cause the Cellars to be dug, if the House
shall have Cellars. And then to try the Ground, that it
be all over of an equal firmness, that when the weight
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41812:85"/>
of the Building is set upon it, it may not sink in any
part. But if the Ground be hollow or weaker in any
place, he strengthens it, sometimes by well ramming
it down, and levelling it again with good dry Earth,
Lime-Core, Rubbish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or sometimes with ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in Stones, or sometimes with well Planking it;
or most securely by driving in Piles. But driving in of
Piles is seldom used for Timber Houses, but for Stone,
or Brick Houses, and that but in few places of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
neither, but where the Ground proves <hi>fenny,</hi> or
<hi>moorish.</hi> Therefore a farther account shall be given
of Foundations, when I come to exercise upon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonry,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Then are the Celler-Walls to be brought up by a <hi>Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layer</hi>
with <hi>Brick;</hi> for small Houses two Bricks thick, for
bigger two and an half Bricks thick, or three or four
Bricks thick, according to the bigness of the House, and
quality of the Ground, as I shall shew when I come to
Exercise on <hi>Bricklaying.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if the House be designed to have no Cellars (as
many Country-Houses have not) yet for the better
securing the Foundation, and preserving the Timber
from rotting, Master-Workmen will cause three, or four,
or five course of Bricks to be laid, to lay their <hi>Ground-plates</hi>
upon that Foundation.</p>
                        <p>The Foundation being made good, the Master-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
appoints his under-workmen their several <hi>Scantlins,</hi>
for <hi>Ground-plates, Principal Posts, Posts, Bressummers,

The Draft of a Foundation I have described in <hi>Plate
10,</hi> according to a Scale of eight Foot in an Inch; where
you have the Front AB 20 Foot long, the sides AC
and BD 50 Foot long. The Shop, or first Room, EE 25
Foot (as aforesaid) deep. I make the first Room a
Shop, because I intend to describe <hi>Shop-windows, Stalls,</hi>
&amp;c. though you may Build according to any other
purpose: the <hi>Kitching,</hi> or <hi>Back Room</hi> FF 15 Foot deep.
A <hi>Buttry,</hi> or <hi>Closet,</hi> taken out of the <hi>Yard,</hi> marked G,
10 Foot deep, and 8 foot wide. H a <hi>Setting off</hi> in the
<hi>Yard,</hi> 4 Foot square for the <hi>House of Office.</hi> I <hi>Leaving
way</hi> in the Shop for a <hi>Stair-Case</hi> 6 foot, and 11 foot. K
the <hi>Yard.</hi> L the <hi>Sink-hole</hi> 1 foot square. M <hi>Leaving
way</hi> in the <hi>Kitching</hi> 6 foot deep, and 4 foot wide for the
<hi>Chimneys.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I do not deliver this Draft of Partitions for the
most commodious for this Ground-plot, nor is the
House set out designed for any particular Inhabitant;
which is one main purpose to be considered of the
Master-Workman, before he make his Draft; for a
Gentleman's house must not be divided as a Shop-keeper's,
nor all Shop-keepers House a-like; for some
Trades require a deeper, others may despence with a
shallower Shop, and so an inconvenience may arise
in both. For if the Shop be shallow, the Front
Rooms upwards ought to be shallow also: because
by the strict Rules of <hi>Architecture,</hi> all Partitions of
Rooms ought to stand directly over one another:
for if your Shop stands in an eminent Street, the Front
Rooms are commonly more Airy than the Back
Rooms; and always more commodious for obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
publick Passages in the Street, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it will be inconvenient to make the Front
Rooms shallow: But if you have a fair Prospect
backwards of Gardens, Fields, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which seldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41812:86"/>
in Cities) then it may be convenient to make your
Back-Rooms the larger for Entertainment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I
shall run no farther into this Argument: for I shall
leave the Master-workman to consult Books of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture,</hi>
and more particularly the Builder, which, in this
case, they all ought to do.

                     <p>THe four Plates, AB, AN, NO and BO, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Foundation, are called <hi>Ground-plates.</hi>
They are to be of good Oak, and for this size
of Building about 8 Inches broad, and 6 Inches
deep. They are to be framed into one another with
Tennants and Mortesses. The longer Ground-plates
AN and BO are commonly tennanted into the Front
and Rear Ground-plates AB and NO, and into these
two sides-Ground-plates are Mortesses made for the
Tennants at the ends of the Joysts, to be fitted somewhat
loosly in, at about 10 Inches distance from one another,
as in the Draft. These Ground plates are to be bor'd with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41812:89"/>
an Inch and half <hi>Augur,</hi> and well pinned into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with round Oaken Pins, made tapering towards
the point, and so strong, that with the hard blows
of a Mallet, they may drive stiff into the <hi>Augre-hole,</hi>
and keep the Tennant firmly in the Mortess. The
manner of making a Tennant and Mortess is taught
in <hi>Exercise 5. § 17.</hi> But because the Stuff <hi>Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
work upon, is generally heavy Timber, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
not so easily mannaged as the light Stuff
Joyners work upon; therefore they do not at first
pin their Tennants into their Mortesses with wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
pins, lest they should lie out of square, or any
other intended Position: but laying a <hi>Block,</hi> or some
other piece of Timber, under the corner of the Frame-work
to bear it hollow off the Foundation, or what
ever else it lies upon, they drive <hi>Hook Pins</hi> (describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Plate 8. § 6.)</hi> into the four <hi>Augre-holes</hi> in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Ground-plates, and one by one fit the
Plates either to a square, or any other intended Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
and when it is so fitted, they draw out their
<hi>Hook Pins,</hi> and drive in the Wooden Pins (as aforesaid)
and taking away the wooden <hi>Blocks</hi> one by one from
under the corners of the Frame, they let it fall into its
place.</p>
                     <p>But before they pin up the Frame of Ground-plates,
they must fit in the <hi>Summer</hi> marked PP, and the <hi>Gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
QQ, and all the <hi>Joysts</hi> marked <hi>aaaa,</hi> &amp;c. and the
<hi>Trimmers</hi> for the <hi>Stair-case,</hi> and <hi>Chilmney way</hi> marked
<hi>bb,</hi> and the binding <hi>Joysts</hi> marked <hi>cc,</hi> for else you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get their Tennants into their respective Mortess
holes. But they do I say fit all these in while the frame
of Ground-plates lies loose, and may, corner by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
be opened to let the respective Tennants into their
respective Mortesses, which when all is done, they
frame the <hi>Raising-plates</hi> just as the <hi>Ground-plates</hi> are
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41812:89"/>
framed; and then frame the Roof into the <hi>Raising-plates</hi>
with <hi>Beams, Joysts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Summer</hi> is in this Ground-plate placed at 25 foot
distance from the Front, and is to be of the same Scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin
the principal Plates are of, for Reasons as shall be
shewn hereafter: and the <hi>Girders</hi> are also to be of the
same Scantlins the <hi>Summers</hi> and <hi>Ground-Plates</hi> are of,
though according to the nice Rules of <hi>Architecture,</hi> the
<hi>Back-Girder</hi> need not be so strong as the <hi>Front-Girder,</hi>
because it Bears but at 14 foot length, and the <hi>Front-Girder</hi>
Bears at 24 foot length: yet Carpenters (for
uniformity) generally make them so, unless they build
an House by the great, and are agreed for the Sum of
Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Joysts</hi> Bearing at 8 Foot (as here they do) are to
be 7 Inches deep, and 3 Inches Broad.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Trimmers</hi> and <hi>Trimming Joysts</hi> are 5 Inches broad

                     <head>§ 16. Of setting up the Carcass.</head>
                     <p>Though the <hi>Ground-plates, Girders,</hi> &amp;c. be part
of the <hi>Carcass,</hi> yet I thought fit in the last Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
they should be laid, before I treated of the
superstructure, which I shall now handle. The four
<hi>Corner Posts</hi> called the <hi>Principal Posts</hi> marked AA,
should be each of one piece, so long as to reach
up to the <hi>Beam</hi> of the <hi>Roof,</hi> or <hi>Raising-Plate,</hi> and of
the same Scantlin the <hi>Ground Plates</hi> are of, <hi>viz. 8</hi>
Inches broad, and 6 Inches thick, and set with one
of its narrowest sides towards the Front. Its lower
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41812:90"/>
end is to be Tennanted, and let it into a Mortess
made near the corner of the <hi>Ground-Plate</hi> Frame;
and its upper end hath also a Tennant on it, to fit
into a Mortess made in the Beam of the Roof, or <hi>Raising-piece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the heighth of the first Story in this Principal
Post, must be made two Mortesses, one to receive
the Tennant at the end of the Bressummer that lies
in the Front, and the other to entertain the Tennant
at the end of the Bressummer that lies in the Return-side.</p>
                     <p>Two such Mortesses must also be made in this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Post at the height of the second Story, to receive
the Tennant at the ends of the Bressummers for that
Story.</p>
                     <p>Though I have spoken singularly of one <hi>Principal
Post,</hi> yet as you work this, you must work all four
<hi>Principal Posts;</hi> and then set them plumb upright,
which you must try with a Plumb-line described in
<hi>Plate 8 §.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having erected the <hi>Principal Posts</hi> upright, you
must enter the Tennants of the Bressummers into
their proper Mortesses, and with a Nail or two (about
a single Ten or adouble Ten) tack one end of a deal
Board, or some other like piece of stuff to the Bressum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and the other end to the fram'd work of the Floor,
to keep the <hi>Principal Posts</hi> upright, and in their places.
Then set up the several Posts between the <hi>Principal
Posts;</hi> but these Posts must be Tennanted at each end,
because they are to be no longer than to reach from
Story to Story, or from Entertise to Entertise, and
are to be framed into the upper and under Bressum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
If the Entertises be not long enough, they
set up a Principal Post between two or three lengths,
to reach from the Ground-plate up to the Raising-plates.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:41812:90"/>
It is to be remembred, that the Bressummers and
Girders are laid flat upon one of their broadest sides,
with their two narrowest sides perpendicular to the
Ground-Plot; but the Joysts are to be laid contrary:
for they are framed so as to lie with one of their nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowest
sides upwards, with there two broadest sides
perpendicular to the Ground-Plot. The reason is,
because the Stuff of the Bressummers and Girders are
less weakned by cutting the Mortesses in them in this
position, than in the other position; for as the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
for those Mortesses are cut between the top and
bottom sides, and the flat of the Tennants are no
broader than the flat of the narrowest side of the
Joysts; so the Mortesses they are to fit into, need
be no broader than the breadth of the Tennant, and
the Tennants are not to be above an inch thick, and
consequently the Mortesses are to be made with an Inch
Mortess-Chissel, as was shewn Numb. <hi>5. § 17.</hi> for great
care must be taken that the Bressummers and Girders
be not weakned more than needs, lest the whole Floor
dance.</p>
                     <p>These Tennants are cut through the two narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sides, rather than between the two broadest sides,
because the stuff of the Girders retains more strength
when least of the Grain of the stuff is cut: And the
Tennants being made between the narrowest sides
of the Joyces, requires their Mortess-holes no longer
than the breadth of that Tennant: And that Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
being but an Inch thick, requires its Mortess but
an Inch wide to receive it; so that you Mortess into
the Girder no more than three Inches wide with the
Grain of the Stuff, and one Inch broad contrary to the
Grain of the Stuff. But should the Tennant be cut
between the two broad sides of the Joysts, the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess
would be three Inches long, and but one Inch
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41812:91"/>
broad, and consequently, you must cut into the Girder
three Inches cross the Gram of the Stuff, which would
weaken it more than cutting six Inches with the Grain
and one Inch cross.</p>
                     <p>But it may be objected that the Tennants of the Joysts
being so small, and bearing at an inch thickness must
needs be too weak.</p>
                     <p>Answer, first though the Tennants be indeed but
an Inch thick, and three Inches broad; yet the whole
Bearing of the Joyces do not solely depend upon
their Tennants; because the Girders they are fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into, prove commonly somewhat Wainny upon
their upper sides, and the Joysts are always scribed
to project over that Waynniness, and so strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
their Bearing by so much as they project over
the roundness or waynniness of the upper side of the
Girder.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Floor is boared with the length of
the Boards athwart the Joysts, and these Boards firmly
railed down to the Joysts, which also adds a great
strength to them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Joysts are seldom made to Bear as
at above ten foot in length, and should by, the Rule
of good workmanship, not lie above ten Inches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder
at the most: so that this short Bearing and
close discharging of one another, renders the whole
floor firm enough for all common Occupation. But
if the Joyces do bear at above ten foot in length,
it ought to be the care of the Master Workman to
provide stronger stuff for them, <hi>viz.</hi> Thicker and Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
If not, they cut a Tusk on the upper side of the
Tennant, and let that Tusk into the upper side of the
Girders.</p>
                     <p>Having erected the Principal Post, and other Posts,
and fitted in the Bressummers, Girders, Joysts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:41812:91"/>
upon the first Floor, they pin up all the Frame of
Carcass-work. But though the Girders and Joysts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
for this first floor, lie proper enough for it;
yet for the second Story, and in this particular case,
the Joysts lie not proper for the second Story; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in the second Story we have described a <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore in this case you must frame the Front-Bressummer
about seven Inches lower into the Principal
Posts: Because the Joysts for the second Floor are
not to be Mortessed into the Bressummer to lie even
at the top with it, but must lie upon the Bressummer,
and project over it so far as you design the <hi>Balcony</hi> to
project beyond the Upright of the Front: And thus
laying the Joysts upon the Bressummer renders them
much stronger to bear the <hi>Balcony,</hi> than if Joysts were
Tennanted into the Front of the Bressummer, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
out into the Street from it.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, Though I have given you a Draft
of the Joysts lying athwart the Front and Rear for the
first Floor, you may as well lay them Range with the
two sides on the first Floor. But then the Bressum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that reaches from Front to Rear in the middle
of the Floor must be stronger: And Girders must
then be Tennanted into the Bressummer, and the
Ground-plates at such a distance, that the Joysts may
not Bear at above ten Foot in length. And the
Tennants of the Joysts must be Tennanted into the Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
so that they will then lye Range with the two
Sides.</p>
                     <p>But, a word more of the Bressummer: I say (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
the Bressummer to Bear at so great length must
be stronger, though it should be discharged at the
length of the Shop, <hi>(viz.</hi> at 25 Foot) with a Brick
Wall, or a Foundation brought up of Brick. But if
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41812:92"/>
it shall have no Discharge of Brick-work, but Bear at
the whole 40 Foot in length, your Bressummer must
be yet considerably stronger than it need be, were it
to Bear but 25 Foot in length; because the shorter
all the Bearings of Timbers are, the firmer they Bear.
But then the Fraiming work will take up more labour:
And in many cases it is cheaper to put in stronger stuff
for long Bearings, than to put a Girder between to
Discharge the length of the Joysts to be framed into the
Girders.</p>
                     <p>But to make short of this Argument, I shall give you
the Scheme of Scantlins of Timbers at several Bearings
for <hi>Summers, Girders, Joysts, Rafters, &amp;c.</hi> as they are set
down in the Act of Parliament for the rebuilding the
City of <hi>London,</hi> after the late dreadful Fire: which
Scantlins were well consulted by able Workmen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were reduced into an Act.</p>

                        <head>§ 16. Of Window Frames.</head>
                        <p>IN Brick Buildings the <hi>Window Frames</hi> are so fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that the Tennants of the Head-sell, Ground-sell,
and Transum, run though the outer <hi>Jaums</hi>
about four Inches beyond them: And so they are
set in a Lay of Morter upon the Brick Wall before
the <hi>Peers</hi> on either side is brought up, at about three
Inches within the Front; So that the Brick work
over the Head and about the Jaums defend it from
the Weather. Then the <hi>Bricklayer</hi> brings up the <hi>Peers</hi>
on both sides, so that the four ends or Tennants that
project through the outer Jaums being buried and <hi>trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
into the Brick-work become a Fastning to the <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-Frame.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if the Window-Frame stands on a Timber-house,
the Head and Ground-sell are sometimes Tennanted into
<hi>Posts</hi> of the <hi>Carcass;</hi> and then the Posts do the office
of the outer Jaums of the <hi>Window-Frame;</hi> and the
Head and Ground-sell are then called <hi>Entertises,</hi> and
therefore both Head and Ground-sell, and <hi>Posts</hi> or
<hi>Jaums,</hi> are rabbetted about half an Inch on the outside
of the Front, to receive the Pane of Glass that is fitted to
it. And thus (as I said) the Posts become part of the
Window-Frame.</p>
                        <p>But the better way is to frame a Window as the Brick-work
Window, and to project it an Inch and an half be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the side of the Building, and to plaister against
its sides, for the better securing the rest of the Carcass
from the weather.</p>
                        <p>The Window-Frame hath every one of its Lights
<hi>rabbetted</hi> on its outside about half on Inch into the
Frame, and all these <hi>Rabbets,</hi> but that on the Ground-sell,
are grooved square, but the <hi>Rabbets</hi> on the Ground-sell
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41812:95"/>
is bevell'd downwards, that Rain or Snow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
may the freelier fall off it. Into these <hi>Rabbets</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Panes of Glass-work is set, and fastned by the
Glasier; as shall be shewed when I come to Exercise
upon <hi>Glasing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The square Corners of the Frame next the Glass is
Bevell'd away both on the out and inside of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Light may the freelier play upon the
Glass. And upon that Bevel is commonly Stuck a
Molding (for Ornament sake) according to the fancy
of the Workman, but more generally according to the
various Mode of the Times.</p>

                        <head>§ 17. Of Stairs, and Stair-Cases.</head>
                        <p>SEveral Writers of <hi>Architecture</hi> have delivered dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Rules for the Height and Breadth of <hi>Steps,</hi>
and that according to the several Capacities of the
<hi>Stair-Cases.</hi> They forbid more than six, and less than
four Inches for the Heighth of each Step, and more
than sixteen, and lest than twelve, for the Breadth of
each Step. But here we must understand they mean
these Measures should be observed in large and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
Buildings: But we have here proposed an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
private House, which will admit of no such
Measures, for want of room. Therefore to our present
purpose.</p>
                        <p>The first and second Pair of Stairs the Steps shall be
about 7⅓ Inches high, and 10 Inches broad. The third
Pair of Stairs each Step may be about 6 ½ Inches high,
aud 9 ½ Inches broad. And for the fourth Pair of
Stairs, each Step may be about 6 Inches high, and 9
Inches broad. But this Rule they do, or should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<hi>viz.</hi> to make all the Steps belonging to the
same pair of Stairs of an equal height; which to do,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41812:96"/>
they first consider the heighth of the Room in Feet
and odd Inches, if any odd be, and multiply the Feet
by 12, whose Product, with the number of odd Inches,
gives the summ of the whole Heighth in Inches; which
summ they divide by the number of Steps they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have in that Heighth, and the Quotient shall
be the number of Inches and parts that each Step shall
be high. Or, if they first design the Heighth of each
Step in Inches, they try by Arithmetick how many
times the Heighth of a Step they can have out of the
whole Heighth of the Story, and so know the number of
Steps.

                     <p>STairs are either made about a <hi>Solid Newel,</hi> or an
<hi>Open Newel,</hi> and sometimes mixt, <hi>viz.</hi> with a
Solid Newel for some few Steps; then a straight
or Foreright Ascent, whith <hi>Flyers</hi> upon the side
of the square Open Newel, and afterwards a
Solid Newel again. Than reiterate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mixt Newel'd Stairs,</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
made in our <hi>Party-walled Houses</hi> in <hi>London,</hi>
where now Light can be placed in the Stair-Case, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Party-walls; so that there is a necessity
to let in a <hi>Sky-light</hi> through the Hollow Newel: But
this sort of Stair Cases take up more room than those
with a single solid Newel; because the Stairs of a
solid Newel spread only upon one small Newel, as
the several Foulds of the Fans Woman use spread
about their Center: But these because they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wind, and sometimes fly off from that wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
take therefore the more room up in the Stair-Case.</p>
                     <p>The manner of projecting them, is copiously taught
in many Books of <hi>Architecture,</hi> whether I referr you:
yet not to leave you wholly in the dark, I shall give
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41812:99"/>
you a small light into it. And first of the <hi>Solid
Newel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Winding Stairs are projected on a round <hi>Profile,</hi>
whose Diameter is equal to the Base the Stair-Case is
to stand on, suppose six foot square. This <hi>Profile</hi> hath
its Circumference divided into 16 equal parts. The
Semi-diameter of the Profile is divided into four equal
parts, and one of them used for the Newel, and the rest
for the length of the Steps: if you draw Lines from the
Center through every one of the equal parts into the
Circumference, the space between every two Lines
will be the true Figure of a <hi>Winding-Step.</hi> And if they
were all cut out and placed one above another, over
the true place on the Profile round about the Newel,
whose Diameter is one quarter the length of a Step,
you would by supporting each Step with a <hi>Raiser</hi> have
the modle of a true pair of <hi>Winding-Stairs.</hi> See Plate
10. Fig. 2.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hollow Newel'd</hi> Stairs are made about a square
Hollow Newel. We will suppose the <hi>Well-hole</hi> to be
eleven foot long, and six foot wide; and we would
bring up a pair of Stairs from the first <hi>Floor</hi> eleven
foot high; it being intended that a Skie-light shall
fall through the Hollow Newel upon the Stairs:
we must therefore consider the width and breadth
of the Hollow Newel; and in this example admit
it to be two foot and a half wide, and two foot
broad: by the width I mean the sides that range
with the Front and Rear of the Building, and by the
breadth I mean the sides that range with the Party<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls.</p>
                     <p>I find (by the Rule aforesaid) that if I assign 18 Steps
up, each Step will be seven Inches and one third of an
Inch high.</p>
                     <p>You must note, that the flying off, or else wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41812:99"/>
of these Steps will vary their places according as you
design the first Ascent. For if you make the first
Ascent as you come straight out of the Street (as in Plate
10.) on the South side, you will first ascend upon a
Pitch of <hi>Flyers,</hi> which Pitch (making an Angle of 38
deg. with the Floor) with ten Steps raise you six Foot
high above the Floor, and bring you eight Foot towards
the <hi>North</hi> end of the <hi>Well-hole,</hi> by making each Step ten
Inches broad.</p>
                     <p>But now you must leave <hi>Flyers,</hi> and make four
Winding Steps. These Winding Steps are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a solid <hi>Newel</hi> (as hath been taught) and this
<hi>Newel</hi> serves also for a <hi>Post</hi> to <hi>Trim</hi> the <hi>Stair-Case</hi> too.
This Post stands upon the Floor, and is prolonged
upwards so high, that Mortesses made in it may
receive the Tennants of the <hi>Top</hi> and <hi>Bottom Rails</hi> of
the whole Stair-case for that Floor: these four Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
steps aforesaid, rounding one quarter about the
Newel, turns your Face in your Ascent now towards
the <hi>East;</hi> these four steps are raised 2 foot, 5 ⅓ Inches
above the Flyers, so that (in all) your Stairs are now rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
8 foot 6 ⅔ Inches. Here remains now only 2 foot
5 ½ Inches to the <hi>Landing place,</hi> and these take up just
four Flyers, which must be made as was taught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>But now in your second pair of Stairs, it will be
proper to begin your Ascent with your Face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>West:</hi> for landing by the first pair of Stairs
with your Face towards the <hi>East,</hi> you turn by the side
of the Rail on the second Floor from the <hi>East</hi> towards
the <hi>North,</hi> and at the further end of that Rail, you
turn your Face again from the <hi>North</hi> towards the
<hi>West,</hi> and begin your Ascent on the second pair of
Stairs.</p>
                     <p>Between the Skie-light and the Ascent is a Post
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41812:100"/>
set upright to fasten Rails into: (to bound the Stair-case)
from the bottom of which, <hi>viz.</hi> on the second
Floor you trim up three Flyers, and then turn off
a quarter of a Circle; with Winding steps: then
again, Flyers to your designed pitch: and then
again another quarter of a Circle with Winding
steps. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Rail these Steps are built upon, being at the
beginning or bottom of the Ascent framed or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
fastned to the first upright Post, must at its
higher end be framed into the next Post also, with
a Bevel Tennant, as you were taught to frame <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
into one another, <hi>Numb. 5. § 17.</hi> Only with
this difference, that there you were taught to frame
Square; but here you must frame upon the <hi>Bevel,</hi>
as you were taught, <hi>Numb. 5. § 19.</hi> This Post
aforesaid bears upon the Floor, to make its Bearing
the stronger; and this Post must be continued
to such an heighth, as it may also serve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Tennanted end of an upper and lower Rail
framed into it. And between these <hi>Bevelling
Rails, Bannisters</hi> make good the outside of the <hi>Stair-Case.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though I have here described this Contrivance of
a pair of Stairs, yet do I not deliver it as the best Patern
for this building, or for these sorts of Stairs, nor mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
it to our purpose whether it be or no; for (as I

                     <head>§ 18. Of Flooring of Rooms.</head>
                     <p>THough Carpenters never Floor the Rooms till
the Carcass is set up, and also inclosed by the
Plaisterer, lest weather should wrong the Flooring;
yet they generally <hi>Rough-plane</hi> their <hi>Boards</hi> for
Flooring before they begin any thing else about the
Building, that they may set them by to season:
which thus they do, They lean them one by one
on end aslant with the edge of the Board against a
Bauk, somewhat above the height of half the
length of the Board, and set another Board in the
same posture on the other side the Bauk, so that
above the Bauk they cross one another: then on
the first side they set another Board in that posture,
and on the second side another, till the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Boards are set an end: being set in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
there remains the thickness of a Board between
every Board all the length, but just where they
cross one another, for the Air to pass through to
dry and shrink them, against they have occasion to
use them: But they set them under some covered
Shed, that the Rain or Sun comes not at them: for
if the Rain wet them, instead of shrinking them,
it will smell them; or if the Sun shine fiercely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, it will dry them so fast, that the Boards
will <hi>Tear</hi> or <hi>Shake,</hi> which is in Vulgar English <hi>Split</hi> or
<hi>Crack.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They have another way to dry and season them,
by laying them flat upon three or four Bauks, each
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41812:101"/>
Board about the breadth of a Board asunder, the
whole length of the Bauks. Then they lay another
Lay of Boards athwart upon them, each board also
the breadth of a Board asunder; then another Lay
athwart the last, till all are thus laid: so that in this
position they also lie hollow for the Air to play between
them.</p>
                     <p>Thus then, The Boards being Rough-plain'd and
Season'd. They try one side slat, as by <hi>Numb. 6. § 31.</hi>
and both the edges straight, as if they were to shoot
a Joint; as by <hi>Numb. 4. § 4.</hi> and cut the Boards
to an exact length: because if the Boards are not
long enough to reach athwart the whole Room, the
ends may all lie in a straight Line, that the straight
ends of other Boards laid against them may make
the truer Joint, and this they call a <hi>Beaking Joint.</hi>
But before they lay them upon the Floor, they try
with the <hi>Level</hi> (described <hi>§ 7.</hi>) the flatness of the
whole Frame of Flooring again, lest any part of it
should be <hi>Cast</hi> since it was first framed together:
and if any part of the Floor lie too high, they with
the <hi>Adz</hi> (if the eminency be large) take it off, as
was shewed <hi>§ 2.</hi> Or if it be small, with the <hi>Jack-Plain,</hi>
in <hi>Numb. 4. § 2.</hi> till it lie level with the rest of the
Floor. But if any part of the Floor prove hollow,
they lay a Chip, or some such thing, upon that hollow
place, to bare up the Board, before they nail it down.</p>
                     <p>All this being done, they chuse a Board of the
commonest thickness of the whole Pile for the first
Board, and lay it close again one side of the Room
athwart the Joysts, and so nail it firmly down with
two Brads into every Joyst it crosses, each Brad about
an Inch, or an Inch and a half within the edge of the
Board.</p>
                     <p>If they should lay more a than ordinary thick or thin
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41812:101"/>
Board at the first, they would have a greater number
of Boards to work to a Level than they need, because
all the rest of the Boards must be equalized in thickness
to the first.</p>
                     <p>Then they lay a second Board close to the first.
But before they nail it down they again try how its
sides agrees with the side of the first, and also how its
thickness agrees with the first Board. If any part of
its edge lie hollow off the edge of the first Board, they
shoot off so much of the length of the Board from
that hollowness towards either end, till it comply and
make a close Joint with the first. But if the edge swell
in any place, they plane of that swelling till it comply
as aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>If the second Board prove thicker than the first,
then with the <hi>Adz</hi> (as aforesaid) they hew away the
under side of that Board (most commonly cross the
Grain, lest with the Grain the edge of the <hi>Adz</hi> should
slip too deep into the Board) in every part of it that
shall bare upon a Joyst, and so sink it to a flat super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
to comply with the first Board. If the Board be
too thin, they underlay that Board upon every Joyst
with a Chip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as this second Board is laid, so are the other
Boards laid, if they be well assured the Boards are
dry, and will not shrink: but if they doubt the
driness of the Boards, they (sometimes do, or should)
take a little more pains; for after they have nailed
down the first Board, they will measure the breadth
of two other Boards, laying them by the side of the
first. But yet they will not allow them their full
Room to lie in, but after there edges are true shot in
a straight line, they will pinch them off about half a
quarter of an Inch room more or less, according as
they guess at the well-seasonedness of the Boards;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41812:102"/>
by nailing down the fourth Board nearer to the first
Board by half a quarter of an Inch (more or less) then
the breadth of both Boards are. And though it be
afterwards somewhat hard to get these two Boards
into that narrow room, <hi>viz.</hi> between the first and
fourth Board, yet they help themselves thus; The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-edge
of these Boards that are to join to each
other they Bevel somewhat away, and then the first
and fourth Board being fast nailed down (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said)
they set the outer edges of these two Boards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the two nailed Boards, letting the inner edges
of the two loose Boards meet, and make an Angle
perpendicular to the Floor. Then with two or three
Men jumping all at once that Angle, these two
Boards with this force and reiterated jumbs by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
press flat down into the superficies of the
Floor; or else with Forcing Pins and Wedges force
them together: and then with Brads they nail them
down, as they did the first Board. Thus afterwards
they nail down a seventh Board, as they did the
fourth, and then fit in the fifth and sixth Boards, as
they did the second and third Boards. And so on, nailing
down every third Board, and forcing two others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
it and the last nailed Board, till the whole Floor
be boarded.</p>
                     <p>But if these Boards are not long enough (as I hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before) to reach through the whole Room, they
examine how true the ends lie in a straight line with
one another, by applying the edge of the Two-foot
Rule to the ends, and where the ends of any Boards
keep of the edge of the Two-foot Rule from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with the whole range of ends, they with the
<hi>Chissel</hi> and <hi>Mallet</hi> cut off that irregularity, holding and
guiding the Chissel so that it may rather cut away
more of the bottom than top of the Board, that so the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41812:102"/>
Boards joined to the ends of the first laid Boards,
may make on the Superficies of the Floor the finer and
truer Joint.</p>
                     <p>Having thus Boarded the whole Room, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they used their best diligence to do it exactly,
yet may the edges of some Boards lie somewhat higher
than the Board it lies next to: therefore they peruse the
whole Floor, and wherethey find any irregularities they
plane them off with the Plane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <head>§ 19. The Hanging of Doors, Windows, &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>THe Floors being Boarded, the next work is to
<hi>Hang</hi> the <hi>Doors,</hi> in which though there be little
difficulty, yet is there much care to be taking, that the
Door open and shut well.</p>
                     <p>If the Door have a <hi>Door-Case</hi> (as Chamber-Doors,
and Closet-Doors commonly have) the <hi>Jaums</hi> of the
Door-Case must stand exactly perpendicular, which
you must try by the Plumb-line, as by § 8. and the
Head of the Door-Case or Entertise must be fitted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
square to the <hi>Jaums,</hi> as you where taught <hi>Numb. 3.
§ 17, 18, 19.</hi> and the Angles of the Door must be
made exactly square, and the <hi>Rabbets</hi> of the Door
to fit exactly into the Rabbets of the Door-Case. But
yet they commonly make the Door about one quarter
of an Inch shorter than the insides of the Jaums of
the Door-Case, lest if the Boards of the Floor chance
to swell within the sweep of the Door, the bottom of the
Door should drag upon the Floor.</p>
                     <p>They consider what sort of Hindges are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
for the Door they are to <hi>Hang.</hi> When they have a
<hi>Street-door</hi> (which commonly is to take off and lift on)
they use <hi>Hooks</hi> and <hi>Hindges.</hi> In a Battend-door,
Back-door, or other Battend-door, or Shop-windows,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41812:103"/>
they use <hi>Cross-Garnets.</hi> If a <hi>Framed Door, Side Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:</hi>
And for <hi>Cup-board Doors,</hi> and such like, Duf-Tails.
(See the description of these Hindges in <hi>Numb.
1. Fig. 1. 5, 6.)</hi> But what sort of Hindges soever
they use, they have care to provide them of a strength
proportionable to the size and weight of the Door
they hang with them. Well-made Hindges I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<hi>Numb. 1. fol. 20.</hi> Whither to avoid repetition I
refer you.</p>
                     <p>If they hand a Street-door (which is commonly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
six foot high) they first drive the Hooks into the
<hi>Door-Post,</hi> by entering the Post first with an <hi>Augure:</hi>
But the <hi>Bit</hi> of the <hi>Augure,</hi> must be less than the
Shank of the Hook, and the hole boared not so
long, because the Shank of the Hook, must be strongly
forced into the Augure-hole, and should the Augure-hole
be too wide, the Shank would be loose in it, and
not stick strong enough in it. Therefore if the Shank
be an Inch square, an half-Inch-Augure is big enough
to bore that hole with, because it will then endure
the heavier blows of an Hammer, to drive it so far as
it must go; and the stronger it is forced in, the faster
the Hook sticks. But yet they are carful not to split the
Door-Post,</p>
                     <p>These Hooks are commonly drove in about Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Inches and an half above the <hi>Ground-sell,</hi> and as
much below the top of the Door. It is, or should
be, their care to chuse the Pin of the lower Hook
about a quarter of an Inch longer than that they use
for the upper Hook (or else to make it so) because
these Doors are commonly un-weildy to lift off and
on, especially to lift both the Hindges on both the
Hooks at once. Therefore when the lower Hindge
is lifted on the lower Hook, if the Door be then lift-perpendicularly
upright, so high as the under side
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41812:103"/>
of the upper Hindge may just reach the top of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Hook, you may the easier slip the Eye of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Hindge upon the Hook; whereas, if the lower
Hook be either shorter, or just no longer than the other:
instead of lifting it readily upon the upper Hook, you
may lift it off the lower Hook, and so begin the labour
again.</p>
                     <p>Having drove in the Hooks, they set the <hi>Rabbits</hi>
of the Door within the <hi>Rabbits</hi> of the Door-Post,
and underlay the bottom of the Door, with a Chip
or two about half a quarter of an Inch thick, to
raise the Door that it drag not. Then they put
the Eyes of the Hindges over the Pins of the Hooks,
and placing the Tail piece of the Hindges parallel to
the bottom and top of the Door, they so nail them
upon.</p>
                     <p>This is the Rule they generally observe for Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Doors, Shop-windows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Only, sometimes
instead of Nailing the Hindges upon the Door,
they <hi>Rivet</hi> them on, for more strength. And then,
after they have fitted the Door, or Window, into
its Rabbits, and laid the Hindges in there proper
place and position (as aforesaid) they make marks
in the Nail-holes of the Hindge with the point of
their Compasses upon the Door, and at those marks
they Pierce holes, with a <hi>Piercer-Bit,</hi> that fits the
shank of the <hi>Rivet;</hi> then they put the shank of the
<hi>Rivet</hi> through the holes made in the Door: yet so
that the Head of the Rivet be on the outside of the
Door: and they also put the end of the Shank into
the Nail-hole of the Hindge, and so whilst another man
holds the head of the Hatchet against the Head of the
Rivet, they with the <hi>Pen</hi> of their <hi>Hammer</hi> batter and
spread the flat end of the Shank over the Hole, as was
shewn Numb. 2. fol. 24. 25.</p>

                           <p>THE <hi>Legs,</hi> or <hi>Stiles,</hi> are commonly about two
Foot and ten Inches high, and are set per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly
upright; having each of them a Tennant
on its upperend, of the thickness the two <hi>Ceeks</hi> are
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41812:115"/>
to stand assunder: And on either side the Shoulder
of these two <hi>Tennants,</hi> is laid one of the <hi>Cheeks</hi> close
to the sides of the <hi>Tennants,</hi> and so pinned close to
the <hi>Tennant,</hi> as was taught <hi>Numb. 5. §. 17.</hi> But a
steddier and more secure way, is to have a strong Iron
Screw made with a square Shank near the Head,
that when it enters into a square hole made fit to it
in the hithermost <hi>Cheek,</hi> it may not twist about, but
by the Turning about of an Iron Nut, upon the
fore-end of the Screw, the Nut shall draw the two
Cheeks close to the two sides of the <hi>Tennants,</hi> or the
upper ends of the <hi>Legs.</hi>

                           <p>AS I told you, the Legs are to be set up direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perpendicular, so the <hi>Cheeks</hi> are to be fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
directly Horizontally upon them: And the <hi>Legs</hi>
and <hi>Cheeks</hi> are to be fastned with <hi>Braces</hi> to the Floor,
and other parts of the Room the <hi>Lathe</hi> stands in, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the convenience of the Room for fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that the whole <hi>Lathe</hi> may stand as steddy and
solid as may be. For if with <hi>Turning</hi> large Work
the strength of the Tread should make the <hi>Lathe</hi>
tremble, you will not be able to make true and neat
Work; but the Tool will job into softer parts of
the Stuff, and fly off where a Knot or other harder
parts of the Stuff comes to the Tool.</p>

                           <head>¶ 3. Of the Puppets.</head>
                           <p>THe <hi>Puppets</hi> are square pieces of Wood, of a
Substance convenient to the light or heavy
work they intend to <hi>Turn:</hi> And <hi>Turnners</hi> will rather
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41812:116"/>
have their <hi>Puppets</hi> too strong than too weak; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
though the <hi>Puppets</hi> be very strong, yet they
can turn light work with them; whereas if they be
weak they cannot turn Heavy work with them: For
the weight of heavy unequal tempered Stuff running
about, will be apt both to shake the <hi>Puppets,</hi> and loosen
the small hole of the <hi>Wedge</hi> in the <hi>Tennant;</hi> by either
of which Inconveniencies the Work in the <hi>Lathe</hi> may
tremble, as aforesaid.</p>
                           <p>And though no size for the height of the <hi>Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi>
can be well asserted, because of the several Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameters
of Work to be <hi>Turned,</hi> yet Workmen ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
covet to have their <hi>Puppets</hi> as short as they
well can, to bear their Work off the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of the
<hi>Lathe,</hi> because these <hi>Puppets</hi> stand in the firmer, and
are less subject to loosen. But then, if the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the work be large, the <hi>Puppets</hi> may be too
short to <hi>Turn</hi> that work in: For the <hi>Pikes</hi> of the
<hi>Puppets</hi> must stand somewhat more than half the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter
of the Work above the superficies of the <hi>Cheeks.</hi>
Therefore <hi>Turners</hi> have commonly two or three pair
of <hi>Puppets</hi> to fit one <hi>Lathe,</hi> and always strive to use
the shortest they can to serve their Work, unless the
shortness of the <hi>Leggs</hi> of the <hi>Lathe,</hi> makes the workfall
too low for the pitch of the Workman that is to work
at the <hi>Lathe.</hi> Therefore in the making of the <hi>Lathe</hi>
the height of the <hi>Legs</hi> with relation to the intended
work, and height of the Workman, are to be well
considered.</p>
                           <p>At the lower end of these <hi>Puppets</hi> are made two
<hi>Tennants,</hi> of such a thickness, that they may easily
slide in the <hi>Groove</hi> between the two <hi>Cheeks,</hi> and so
long, that a <hi>Mortess</hi> through it of the length of the
<hi>Cheeps</hi> depth, and a sufficient strength of Wood below
it may be contained. Into this <hi>Mortess</hi> is fitted a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41812:116"/>
Tapering-<hi>Wedge,</hi> somewhat less at the fore end, and
bigger at the hinder end than the <hi>Mortess,</hi> that as it is
forced into the <hi>Mortess</hi> with a <hi>Mallet,</hi> or a <hi>Maul,</hi> it may
draw the bottom Shoulder of the <hi>Puppet</hi> close and firmly
down upon the <hi>Cheeks,</hi> that they may neither joggle or
tremble in working.</p>

called the <hi>Side-Rest.</hi> This they use when they
<hi>Turn</hi> the flats sides of Boards; because the flat sides
of Boards standing athwart the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and this <hi>Rest</hi>
standing also athwart the <hi>Pikes,</hi> they can the more
conveniently rest their Tool upon it. It is marked
<hi>e</hi> in plate 13, and is in the <hi>Plate</hi> disjunct from the
<hi>Lathe;</hi> as well because it and the Common <hi>Rest</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
both together be exprest in Picture, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is made to take off and put on as occasion
requires.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Rest</hi> is marked <hi>a,</hi> and is a piece of an Oaken
plank, or Elm plank, about two Inches thick, and
stands so high above the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of the <hi>Lathe</hi> as the
<hi>points</hi> of the <hi>Pikes</hi> do, or sometimes a little higher:
Its Breadth is about a Foot, or more, or less, as the
Work requires, or the Workman fancies. The Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of it is firmly nailed to one side of a Quarter of
Oak, or Elm, of about three Inches square, and two
Foot, or two Foot and an half long, close to one
end, as you see in the Figure at <hi>b,</hi> so as the <hi>Rest</hi>
stand upright to the piece of Quartet. This piece
of Quarter is as a <hi>Tennant</hi> to slide into a square Iron
Collar marked <hi>e;</hi> This square Iron Collar is made so
long as to reach through the depth of the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of
the <hi>Lathe,</hi> and to receive the Quarter or Tennant

                           <p>Some <hi>Turners</hi> for some Work, instead of a plank
for this <hi>Rest,</hi> fasten to one end of the Quarter or <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
a long Iron with a round Cilindrick <hi>Socket</hi>
in it, as at the Figure marked <hi>f</hi> in <hi>Plate 13, a</hi> is the
<hi>Socket</hi> of about an Inch, or an Inch and an half Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter,
to reach within two or three Inches as high
as the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and into this <hi>Socket</hi> they put a long
round Iron <hi>Shank,</hi> as in Figure <hi>g</hi> of the same <hi>Plate,
a</hi> is the <hi>Shank,</hi> and at the top of this <hi>Shank</hi> is made
the <hi>Rest,</hi> marked <hi>b.</hi> This <hi>Shank</hi> (I say) slips easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the <hi>Socket,</hi> that it may be raised, or let down,
as occasion requires, and by the help of a <hi>Screw</hi>
through the <hi>Socket</hi> at <hi>e,</hi> may be fastned at that
length.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Rest,</hi> (by reason of its Round <hi>Shank)</hi> may be
also turned with its upper edge more or less oblique or
athwart the Work, or else parallel to the Work, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the purpose may require.</p>
                           <p>Near one end of the <hi>Rest</hi> is fitted and fastned a piece
of Wood about an Inch square, and ten or twelve
Inches long: This piece of wood is fitted stiff into a
square Hole or Mortess made in the <hi>Puppet,</hi> a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the <hi>Shoulder</hi> for the <hi>Rest,</hi> to set the <hi>Rest</hi> to any

                           <p>ABout the middle between the ends, is placed a
wooden <hi>Treddle</hi> about two Inches and an half
broad, an Inch thick, and three Foot long, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
three and an half, to four Foot long. The
hinder end of it is fastned to the Floor, with a piece
of Leather (sometimes a piece of the Upper-leather of
an old Shoe, which piece of Leather is nailed to the
under-side of the hinder end of the <hi>Treddle,</hi> so as to leave
Leather enough beyond the end of the <hi>Treddle</hi> to nail
down upon the Floor; which <hi>Treddle</hi> being thus nailed
down, will move upwards, as the Spring of the <hi>Pole</hi>
draws up the <hi>String;</hi> the <hi>String</hi> being also fastned to the
fore-end of the <hi>Treddle.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The hinder end of the <hi>Treddle</hi> is nailed down about
a Foot, or a Foot and an half behind the <hi>Lathe,</hi> and
about the middle between both the <hi>Legs,</hi> so that the
fore-end of the <hi>Treddle</hi> reaches beyond the fore-side
of the <hi>Lathe,</hi> about a Foot and an half, or two Foot.
And note, that the farther the Fore-end of the <hi>Tred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi>
reaches out beyond the Fore-side of the <hi>Lathe,</hi> the
greater will the sweep of the Fore-end of the <hi>Treddle</hi>
be, and consequently it will draw the more <hi>String</hi>
down; and the more <hi>String</hi> comes down at one <hi>Tread,</hi>
the more Revolutions of the Work is made at one <hi>Tread,</hi>
and therefore it makes the greater riddance of the
Work.</p>
                           <p>But then again, if the Fore-end of the <hi>Treddle</hi>
reach too far before the Fore-side of the <hi>Lathe,</hi> it
may draw the end of the <hi>Pole</hi> so low as to break it:
and it will also be the harder to <hi>Tread</hi> down, because
the power commanding (which is the weight of the
<hi>Tread)</hi> lies so far from the weight to be commanded,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41812:119"/>
which is the strength of the <hi>Pole,</hi> augmented by the
distance that the end of the <hi>Treddle</hi> hath from the
Work in the <hi>Lathe;</hi> so that you may see, that the
nearer the Fore-end of the <hi>Treddle</hi> lies to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
of the Work in the <hi>Lathe,</hi> the easier the
<hi>Tread</hi> will be: And some <hi>Turners</hi> that <hi>Turn</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Small Work, have the Fore-end of the <hi>Treddle</hi>
placed just under their work; so that their <hi>String</hi>
works between the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of the <hi>Lathe;</hi> But then
the Sweep of the <hi>Treddle</hi> being so small, the <hi>Pole</hi>
draws up but a small length of <hi>String,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
makes the fewer Revolutions of the Work in one
<hi>Tread,</hi> which hinders the riddance of the Work: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
with every Spring of the <hi>Pole,</hi> they should lift
their Treading Leg so high, as to tire it quickly with
binging it down again, after it is raised to so uncommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
a position.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>Tredle</hi> hath a square Notch in the middle of the
further end, about an Inch and an half wide, and two
Inches long, that the end of the <hi>String</hi> may be wound ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off or on the Wood on either side the Notch, to
lengthen or shorten the <hi>String,</hi> as the different Diameters
of the Work shall require.</p>
                           <p>About the middle of the <hi>Treddle</hi> is fixed a round
Iron <hi>Pin</hi> about half an Inch in Diameter; so as to
stand upright about an Inch and an half, or two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

is also fixed down the <hi>Cross-Treddle,</hi> which is such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
piece of Wood as the <hi>Treddle</hi> is, but longer or

in the middle of the Breadth of the <hi>Cross-Treddle,</hi> is
made several holes all a-row to receive the Iron <hi>Pin</hi>
set upright in the <hi>Treddle.</hi> These holes are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Work. But before it is laid upon both, one part of
the <hi>String</hi> is lapt over and crosses the other, and the
<hi>String</hi> receives the Form of a Figure of 8 (only one of
its Bows or Circles becomes no bigger than the <hi>Groove</hi>
in the Work, and the other as big as the <hi>Groove</hi> in the
<hi>Wheel.)</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Then the whole Frame wherein the <hi>Wheel</hi> is fixed is
removed farther off the <hi>Lathe,</hi> that the <hi>String</hi> may draw
tight upon the Work.</p>
                           <p>The reason why the <hi>String</hi> thus crosses it self, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it will touch and gird more upon the <hi>Groove</hi> of the
Work, and consequently (as was said before ¶ 14.)
will the better command the Work about.</p>
                           <p>The manner of Turning this <hi>Wheel,</hi> is as the manner
of Turning other <hi>Wheels</hi> with <hi>Handles.</hi>

                           <p>Besides the commanding Heavy Work about, the
Wheel rids Work faster off than the <hi>Pole</hi> can do: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the springing up of the <hi>Pole</hi> makes an intermission
in the running about of the Work, but with the <hi>Wheel</hi>
the Work runs always the same way; so that the Tool
need never be off it, unless it be to examine the Work
as it is doing.</p>
                           <p>When the Wheel is used, its Edge stands athwart the

                        <head>¶ 13. Of the Treddle-Wheel.</head>
                        <p>THis is a <hi>Wheel</hi> made of a round Board of about
two Foot and an half Diameter, conveniently to
stand under the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of the <hi>Lathe.</hi> It also hath a
<hi>Groove</hi> on its Edge for the <hi>String</hi> to run in; it hath an
Iron <hi>Axis</hi> with a <hi>Crook</hi> or <hi>Cranck</hi> at one end: And on
this <hi>Crook</hi> is slipt the Noose of a <hi>Leather T·hong,</hi> which
having its other end fastned to a <hi>Treddle,</hi> does, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exact time in <hi>Treads,</hi> carry it swiftly about without
intermission.</p>
                        <p>But the length of the <hi>Thong</hi> must be so fitted, that
when the <hi>Wheel</hi> stands still, and the <hi>Crook</hi> at the end
of the <hi>Axis</hi> hangs downwards, the end of the <hi>Treddle</hi>
to which the <hi>Thong</hi> is fastned may hang about two or
three Inches off the Ground: For then, giving the
<hi>Wheel</hi> a small turn with the Hand, till the <hi>Crook</hi> rises
to the highest, and passes a little beyond it; if just then
(I say) the Workman gives a quick <hi>Tread</hi> tpon the
<hi>Treddle</hi> to bring the <hi>Crook</hi> down again with a jerk, that
Tread will set it in a motion for several revolutions;
and then if he observes to make his next <hi>Tread</hi> just when
the <hi>Crook</hi> comes about again to the same position, it
will continue the motion, and cause of the motion, and
and keep the <hi>Wheel</hi> always running the same way, if he
punctually times his <hi>Treads.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Treddle Wheel</hi> is used for small work only, as
not having strength enough to carry heavy Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
such as <hi>Cane-Heads, Small Boxes,</hi> &amp;c. and it is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
below the <hi>Cheeks</hi> between the <hi>Puppets,</hi> as the <hi>Bow</hi> is
above.</p>
                        <p>Besides these Inventions to carry about the Work
in the <hi>Lathe,</hi> there are many more; as with a great
<hi>Iron Wheel,</hi> having Teeth on its edge, which Teeth
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41812:121"/>
are to fall into an Iron <hi>Nut</hi> upon an Iron <hi>Axis,</hi> pitcht
upon the <hi>Pikes</hi> of the <hi>Puppets</hi> of the <hi>Lathe,</hi> or fitted into
<hi>Collars,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Also, for very Heavy Work, as Guns, Great Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
<hi>&amp;c. Wheels</hi> turn'd with <hi>Wind, Water,</hi> or <hi>Horses,</hi> to
carry the Work about. Of which more in their proper

                        <p>UPon the thin end of the <hi>Pole</hi> is wound a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Bundle of <hi>String,</hi> That as a <hi>Mandrel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
to be bigger than ordinary, or the Work heavier,
they may unwind so much of the <hi>String</hi> as will compass
the <hi>Mandrel</hi> twice, or (if the Work be heavy) thrice;
the easier to carry it about.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>String</hi> is made of the Guts of Beasts (most
commonly of Sheep, and spun round of several thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
of which the Workman chuses such sizes as
are aptest for is Work; for large and heavy Work,
very thick, but for small and light work, thin: And
there are several reasons for his Choice; for a thin <hi>String</hi>
will be too weak for heavy Work; but if it were not too
weak for heavy work, it would be apt to mark soft wood
more than a thick <hi>String</hi> would, when they are forc'd
to shift the <hi>String,</hi> and let it run upon the Work. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
a thin <hi>String</hi> (though it were strong enough)
would not so well bring heavy Work about; because
being small, but little of the <hi>String</hi> touches the wood
to command it, unless they wind it the oftner about
the Work, which both takes up time, and hazards the
breaking of the <hi>String,</hi> by the fretting of the several
twists against one another.</p>
                        <p>Now a thick <hi>String</hi> is uncommodious for small work;
because having a strength and stubbornness proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41812:122"/>
to its size, it will not comply closely to a piece of
Work of small Diameter, but will be apt to slip about
it, unless both <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Tread</hi> be very strong; and
then, if the Center-holes be not very deep, and the
<hi>Pikes</hi> fill them not very tight, and the <hi>Puppets</hi> also not
very well fixt, the Strength of the <hi>String</hi> will alter the
Center holes; especially, when the work is upon soft
Wood, or else it will endanger the breaking the Work
in its weakest place.</p>

                        <p>It is not called a <hi>Seat</hi> because it is so; but because

                        <hi>GOuges</hi> are marked BB in <hi>Plate 15.</hi> They do the
Office of <hi>Fore-Plains</hi> in <hi>Joynery,</hi> and the <hi>Jack-plains</hi>
in <hi>Carpentry,</hi> and serve only to take off the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities
the <hi>Hatchet,</hi> or sometimes the <hi>Draw-knife</hi>
leaves, after the work is hewed or drawn pretty near a
Round with either of them: And therefore as the <hi>Fore-plain</hi>
is made with a Corner-edge, only to take off the
Irregularities of a Board, so the <hi>Gouge</hi> that it may also
take off the Irregularities or Extuberancies that lie far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
from the <hi>Axis</hi> of the Work, and also frame pretty
near the hollow Moldings required in the Work, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
the <hi>Smoothing-Chissels.</hi> And that the <hi>Gouge</hi> may
the more commodiously and effectually do it, the Blade
of this Tool is formed about half round to an edge,
and the two extream ends of this half round a little
sloped off towards the middle of it, that a small part
about the middle may the easier cut off the prominen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that are not concentrick to the <hi>Axis,</hi> and so bring
the Work into a Method of Formation.</p>
                     <p>The hollow edge is ground upon the Corner of a
<hi>Grind-stone,</hi> which in short time wears the out-side of
that Corner to comply and form with the hollow of the
<hi>Gouge.</hi> It is afterwards Set upon a round <hi>Whet-stone,</hi>
that fits the hollow of the edge, or is somewhat less.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41812:123"/>
But they do not Set their <hi>Gouges</hi> or <hi>Chissels</hi> as (I told
you in <hi>Numb. 4. § 10.)</hi> the Joyners do; for <hi>Turners</hi>
Tools being somewhat unweldy, by reason of their size,
and long Handles, they lay the <hi>Blade</hi> of the <hi>Gouge</hi> with
its convex side upon the <hi>Rest</hi> of the <hi>Lathe;</hi> and so
with the <hi>Whet-stone</hi> in their right hand they rub upon
the <hi>Basil</hi> the <hi>Grind-stone</hi> made, and as they rub, they
often turn another part of the hollow of the edge to
bear upon the round of the <hi>Whet-stone,</hi> till they have
with the <hi>Whet-stone</hi> taken off the roughness of the <hi>Grind-stone.</hi>
                     </p>

These do the Office of <hi>Smoothing Plains</hi> in <hi>Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Carpentry:</hi> for coming after the <hi>Gouges</hi> they
cut off the prominent Risings that the <hi>Gouges</hi> leave above

                     <p>The edges of these <hi>Flat Chissels</hi> are not ground to
such a <hi>Basil</hi> as the <hi>Joyners Chissels</hi> are, which are made
on one of the Flat sides of the <hi>Chissels;</hi> But are <hi>Basil'd</hi>
away on both the flat sides; so that the edge lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both the sides in the middle of the <hi>Tool:</hi> And
therefore either sides of the <hi>Tool</hi> may indifferently be
applied to the Work; which could not well be, should
the edge lie on one of the sides of the <hi>Tool:</hi> Because,
if they should apply the <hi>Basil</hi> side of the <hi>Tool</hi> to the
Work, the thickness of the <hi>Basil</hi> would bear the edge
of the <hi>Tool</hi> off: And should they apply that side of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41812:124"/>
the <hi>Tool</hi> the edge lies one to the Work, the swift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about of the Work would (where a small irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of Stuff should happen) draw or job the suddain
edge into the Stuff, and so dawk it; which if the Stuff
be already small enough, would now be too small;
because in <hi>Turnings,</hi> all Irregularities must be wrought
smooth down.</p>
                     <p>Of those <hi>Flat Chissels</hi> there are several sizes, <hi>viz.</hi>
from a quarter of an Inch, one Inch, two Inches, to

only they often turn the <hi>Gouges</hi> upon the round side,
because they would smoothen all the hollow edge;
but these are laid flat upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> and with a flat
<hi>Whet-stone</hi> rubbed on the <hi>Basil,</hi> as the <hi>Gouge</hi> was with
the Round.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Hook</hi> is marked D in <hi>Plate 15.</hi> As the <hi>Gouge</hi>
is used when the Work lies before the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>viz.</hi> parallel to its <hi>Axis,</hi> and cuts right forwards,
so the <hi>Hook</hi> is used when the Work stands on the
right or left side the Workman, as the flat sides of
Boards to be <hi>Turned</hi> do; and therefore this work
may be said to lie athwart its <hi>Axis:</hi> and the <hi>Hook</hi>
is made so as to cut on the right or left side a Board,
and to take off the extuberances from the plain of the
Board. But though this <hi>Tool</hi> does the Office of a
<hi>Gouge,</hi> yet it is more difficult for a Workman to use
than a <hi>Gouge;</hi> because it is made thinner and slender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than a <hi>Gouge,</hi> that its Edge cutting at a greater
Bearing from the <hi>Rest,</hi> may the easier come at the
Stuff it works upon, and the farther the Edge that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41812:124"/>
cuts lies from the <hi>Rest,</hi> the more difficult it is for a
Workman to guide it; because it is then more subject
to tremble; especially since (as aforesaid) the Edge
of the <hi>Hook</hi> is and must be thinner than the Edge of the
<hi>Gouge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These <hi>Tools,</hi> as also the <hi>Gouges,</hi> and <hi>Flat-Chissels,</hi>
are all about ten or twelve Inches long without the
Handles.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hooks</hi> when they want sharpening cannot be
<hi>ground</hi> as the <hi>Gouges</hi> and <hi>Chissels</hi> are; but they must be
first softned in the Fire and turned straight, and
then brought to an Edge, and by heating again red
hot turned into its form: Then must it be hardned
and tempered as you were taught <hi>Numb. 3. fol. 57,
58.</hi> Yet do not Workman proceed thus with their
<hi>Hook</hi> every time it grows bluntish, but only when
the Edge is either by long use, or bad Temper, grown
so thick, that this following way will not help them:
For they <hi>Whet</hi> the outer Edge with a <hi>Whetstone</hi> as they
do other <hi>Tools.</hi> But because they cannot come at
the inner Edge of the <hi>Hook</hi> with a <hi>Whetstone,</hi> unless
the <hi>Hook</hi> be very wide, and the <hi>Whetstone</hi> very thin,
they make use of a piece of Temper'd Steel, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the thin side of a <hi>Chissel,</hi> or the back of a Knife,
and so with the Edge of the Square, scrape along the
hollow Edge of the <hi>Hook,</hi> and force the Edge as
much to the outside of the <hi>Hook</hi> as they can. Thus
<hi>Butchers</hi> wear at their Girdles small round Rods of
Steel well Tempered and polisht, that they may with
quick dispatch whet their Knives upon it, by forcing
the Edge forwards upon the Blade, or pressing down
the Shoulder that hinders the Edge Entrance: For their
Steels being so well polisht, cannot properly be said to
to wear away any part of the Shoulder that should hinder
the Edge from doing its Office.</p>

                        <p>4. ANother sort of <hi>Mandrel</hi> is called the <hi>Screw-Mandrel,</hi>
and is marked F 4. in <hi>Plate 15. a</hi>
the <hi>Rowler</hi> of the <hi>Mandrel, b</hi> the <hi>Shank,</hi> or <hi>Screw,</hi> is
made of Iron, having its two ends Round, and
in the middle between the Round ends a Square
the length of the <hi>Rowler,</hi> and this Square is fitted stiff
into a Square Hole made through the middle of
the <hi>Rowler</hi> that it turn not about in the Square Hole.
In each Flat-end of this Iron <hi>Shank,</hi> or <hi>Spindle,</hi> is made
a Center-Hole, whereinto the <hi>Pikes</hi> of the <hi>Puppets</hi> are
pitcht when this <hi>Mandrel</hi> is used. This Iron <hi>Shank,</hi>
or <hi>Axis,</hi> must be made very straight, and ought to be
turned upon the two Center-Holes, for exactness;
Because on one of the Round ends, or sometimes on
both, a <hi>Screw,</hi> or indeed several <hi>Screws</hi> of several Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameters
is made. That <hi>Screw</hi> next the end of the
<hi>Shank</hi> is the smallest, <hi>viz.</hi> about three quarters of an
Inch over, and takes up in length towards the middle
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41812:127"/>
of the <hi>Shank,</hi> about an Inch, or an Inch and an half; and
so far from the end of the <hi>Shank</hi> it is of an equal Diameter
all the way: And on this portion of the <hi>Shank</hi> is made
a <hi>Male-screw</hi> of the finest Thread. The next Inch and
half (wrought as before) hath another <hi>Male-screw;</hi> but
about half a quarter of an Inch more in Diameter than
the former, and hath its Threads courser. Another
Inch and half hath its Diameter still greater, and its
Threads yet courser. And thus you may make the
<hi>Shank</hi> as long as you will, that you may have the more
variety of Sizes for <hi>Screws.</hi>

to do the Office of a <hi>Tap</hi> into each respective
<hi>Socket;</hi> which <hi>Sockets</hi> being only made of Hard Wood,
it will easily perform, though the <hi>Shank,</hi> or <hi>Axis,</hi> be but
Iron.</p>
                        <p>Therefore (as aforesaid) to each of the <hi>Male-screws</hi>

may be set close together, or else opened as the two
insides of the <hi>Joynt-Rule Carpenters</hi> use to do. On the
the Inner Edge of each <hi>Cheek</hi> is formed as many half-round
Holes or Semi-cirles as you please, or the length
of the <hi>Cheeks</hi> will conveniently admit: These Semi-circles
are made of different Diameters, that they may

                     <p>The First Pattern we purpose, shall be a <hi>Cilinder</hi> two
Inches over, and eight Inches long: Therefore you
must chuse a piece of Wood at lest two Inches and a
quarter over, lest you want Stuff to work upon: Nay,
if your Stuff prove shaken, or otherwise unsound, or
your Center be not very exactly pitcht, you may want
yet more Stuff; and that according as it proves more or
less faulty, or as the Centers are more unequally pitcht.
But supposing the Stuff good, you may take a piece of
two Inches and a quarter over, as I said before, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ten or eleven Inches long, For though the length
of the <hi>Cilinder</hi> be but eight Inches, yet you must cut
your Stuff long enough to make a Groove at one end
of it besides, for the <hi>String</hi> to run in. If your Stuff be
somewhat too big for your Scantlin, and not round
enough to go into the <hi>Lathe,</hi> you must <hi>Hew</hi> it pretty
near with the <hi>Hatchet</hi> to make it sizable, and afterwards
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41812:132"/>
smoothen it nearer with a <hi>Draw-knife,</hi> as you were
taught, <hi>Numb. 7. § 5.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if you have not Stuff at hand near your size, then
you must Saw off your length from a Billet, or some
other piece of Stuff, and with the <hi>Cleaving-knife</hi> and the
<hi>Mawl,</hi> split it into a square piece near the size, and
with the <hi>Draw-knife</hi> round off the Edges to maks it fit
for the <hi>Lathe,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then set your <hi>Puppets,</hi> and wedge them tight up, so
as the <hi>Points</hi> of your <hi>Spikes</hi> stand pretty near the length
of your Work assunder, and move the <hi>Pole,</hi> so as the
end of it may hang over between the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and also fit
the Iron <hi>Pin</hi> in the <hi>Treddle</hi> into a proper <hi>Hole</hi> in the
<hi>Cross-Treddle,</hi> so as the end of the <hi>Treddle</hi> may draw
the <hi>String</hi> below the Work into pretty near a straight
Line with the string above the Work: And take the
Work in your Right hand, and put it beyond the <hi>String</hi>
before you, and with your left hand wind the <hi>String</hi>
below the Work, but once about the Work, lest it should
be too strong for your shallow Centers, as you shall
understand by and by, and then with a pretty strength
press the middle of one end of your Work over the Point
of one of the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and so make a hole in your Work
for one of the Center holes: Then screw your Pike
wider or closer, according as the length of your Work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and pitch the other end of your Work upon the
other Pike also, and screw your Work a little lightly
up: Then try how the Centers are pitcht, by Treading
the <hi>Treddle</hi> lightly down; and if you find the Centers
are well pitcht, you may without more ado screw up
your Work tight: But if your Centers, or either of them
be not well pitcht, you must alter them. You may
know when they are well pitcht, by treading softly
upon your <hi>Treddle,</hi> and holding your Finger steddy
on the <hi>Rest,</hi> direct the point of it pretty close to the
Work: For if in a Revolution of your Work, its Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41812:133"/>
keeps it an equal distance from the end of your
Finger, you may conclude your Work is well pitcht.
But if you find one side of your Work comes nearer
your Finger than the other side, you must with your
<hi>Flat Chissel,</hi> or <hi>Gouge,</hi> (or what is nearest at hand) knock
softly, or hard, upon that side that comes nearest to
your Finger, till you have forc'd the <hi>Pikes</hi> into the true
Centers at the end of your Work; and then you may
boldly screw it hard up: But you must be sure to screw
it hard up; because it is Soft Wood you purpose to
work upon, and the strength of the <hi>Pole</hi> may endanger
the drawing or removing the Centers, if the <hi>Pikes</hi> have
not good hold of them.</p>
                     <p>Having found your Centers, take your Work again
off the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and wind the <hi>String</hi> once or twice more
about your Work, that your <hi>String</hi> (as I said in <hi>Numb.
10. § 1.</hi> when I wrote of the <hi>String)</hi> may the better
command it, and then wind off or on more <hi>String</hi> at the
end of your <hi>Pole,</hi> or end of your <hi>Treddle,</hi> or both, if
your Work require it, till the <hi>Pole</hi> draws the <hi>Treddle</hi> up
a little above half the length of the <hi>Legs</hi> of the <hi>Lathe:</hi>
For about the height your Leg may without sudden
trying, command the <hi>Pole</hi> down again.</p>
                     <p>But before you begin to work upon the Stuff, I shall
inform you how to <hi>Tread</hi> the <hi>Treddle;</hi> In which you
may observe this General Rule; That the nearer the
Fore-end of the <hi>Treddle</hi> you <hi>Tread,</hi> the easier you bring
down the <hi>Pole;</hi> But then the <hi>Pole</hi> in its Spring rases
your Leg the higher, and may draw the upper side of
your Thigh against the underside of the <hi>Cheek</hi> of the
<hi>Lathe,</hi> and with reiterated Risings Gawl, and also
tire your Thigh.</p>
                     <p>Place therefore your Foot steddy upon the <hi>Treddle,</hi>
so far forward as you can, to avoid the <hi>Poles</hi> Rising from
drawing your Thigh against the underside of the <hi>Lathe;</hi>
and Tread the <hi>Treddle</hi> nimbly down, but not quite so
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41812:133"/>
low as to knock against the Floor: Then abate the
weight of your Tread, and let the <hi>Pole</hi> draw the <hi>Tred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi>
up; but still keep your Foot steddy, and lightly
Bearing upon the <hi>Treddle:</hi> For then your succeeding
<hi>Treads</hi> will prove easier to your Leg and Thigh, and
you will with your Foot the better and quicker com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the <hi>Treddle.</hi> Then <hi>Tread</hi> again nimbly down as
before, and keep this Train of Treading till your Work
be finish'd, or that you may have occasion to stop and
examine how rightly you proceed.</p>
                     <p>In all small Work the <hi>Tread</hi> is lightly and nimbly
performed; but in large and heavy Work the <hi>Tread</hi>
comes slow and heavily down.</p>
                     <p>This being premised, you may begin with your
<hi>Gouge;</hi> Lay the Round side of it upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> and take
the Handle of it in your Right hand, and lay the Fore
and Middle Fingers of your Left Hand upon the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of the <hi>Gouge</hi> near the Work, mounting the Edge
about a quarter of an Inch above the <hi>Axis</hi> of your
Work, and sinking your Right hand a little: for in
this position the <hi>Gouge</hi> cuts best: And thus cut down
on your Work near one end, a <hi>Groove</hi> for your <hi>String</hi>
to run in: The <hi>Groove</hi> may be about an Inch, or an
Inch and an half long: But it matters not much what
depth. Then slip your <hi>String</hi> into the <hi>Groove,</hi> and if
you find the <hi>String</hi> will not slip easily, you may put
your Foot under the <hi>Treddle</hi> and lift it a little up, that
the <hi>String</hi> when no weight is hanged to it, may slide
the easier into the <hi>Groove.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And by the way you may take notice, that the
deeper you cut down the <hi>Groove,</hi> the oftner will your
Work come about every Tread; because the <hi>String</hi> that
comes down every Tread, measure a small Circumference
oftner than it does a greater Circumference: But then
the Work is not so strongly carried about; because it
hath a less portion of the <hi>String</hi> to command it. This I
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41812:134"/>
hint, not that in this our small proposed Pattern it is very
considerable: For if you only cut the <hi>Groove</hi> down but
so low as there may be a Shoulder at the end, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
against the Work, to keep the <hi>String</hi> from slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
out of the Groove, it will be sufficient: But in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Work this <hi>Groove</hi> ought to be cut with discretion.</p>
                     <p>Now come to the Forming of your Work, and hold
your <hi>Gouge,</hi> as you were taught before, but somewhat
lightly against your Work, beginning at one end, and
sliding your <hi>Gouge</hi> gradually to the other, cutting with
its Edge all the way you go, and bearing somewhat stiff
against the Work every Tread you make on the <hi>Treddle:</hi>
And withdrawing it again a little lightly from the <hi>Work</hi>
every Spring of the Pole. And thus by Use you must
habituate your self to let the Edge of your <hi>Tool</hi> bear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Work when the Pole and <hi>Treddle</hi> comes down,
and to draw it back just off the Work, as the Pole and
<hi>Treddle</hi> goes up. And thus you must continue till you
have rough-wrought all your work from end to end.</p>
                     <p>If you have not at first brought your Work clean;
that is, if you have not gone deep enough with your
<hi>Gouge</hi> to take off all the Risings of the Stuff the <hi>Draw-knife</hi>
left, even with the smallest part of your Work,
you must in like manner (as before) work it over again.
But you must have a special Care you take not too
much Stuff away on any part of the whole Work: For
this proposed Pattern being a <hi>Cilinder;</hi> if you take but
a small matter too much away from any part, and make
it smaller than your given measure there, the whole Work
will be spoiled; as being smaller than the proposed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter:
which to know, you may by opening the Points
of your <hi>Callippers</hi> to two Inches on your <hi>Rule</hi> (the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Diameter of your <hi>Cilinder)</hi> try if the Points at
that distance will just slip over the deepest <hi>Grooves</hi> of
your Work (for we will not suppose that the <hi>Grooves</hi>
are of an equal depth with the Rough-working of the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41812:134"/>
                        <hi>Gouge)</hi> without straining the Joint, for then your Work
is just sizeable: If not, work over again as before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But we will now suppose you have not taken too
much away, but have made a due process with your
<hi>Gouge.</hi> Therefore now proceed, and use a <hi>Flat Chissel,</hi>
about an Inch and an half broad, to take off the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities
the <hi>Gouge</hi> left.</p>
                     <p>Take the Handle of it in your Right Hand, as you
did the <hi>Gouge,</hi> and clasping the <hi>Blade</hi> of it in your Left
Hand, lean it steddy upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> holding the Edge
a little assant over the Work, so as a Corner of the thin
side of the <hi>Chissel</hi> may bear upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> and that the
Flat side of the <hi>Chissel</hi> may make a small Angle with the
<hi>Rest,</hi> and consequently with the Work; (which is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to the <hi>Rest)</hi> for should you set the edge of the <hi>Chis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi>
parallel to the Work, it might run too fast into the
Work, and dawk it. Therefore you must set the <hi>Chissel</hi>
in such a position, that the lower Corner, or near the
lower Corner of the edge, may cut lightly upon the
Work: But this position is best described by a Figure,
which to that purpose I have inserted in <hi>Plate 14.</hi> at
O, where you may perceive in, or near, what position
the <hi>Chissel</hi> must be set to cut the Work; and how the
edge of the <hi>Chissel a b</hi> lying aslant the Work, and the
further Corner of the edge of the <hi>Chissel b</hi> being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
mounted, as the Work comes about, the Bottom,
or near the Bottom, of the edge of the <hi>Chissel</hi> is only
capable to cut a narrow Shaving off the Work: and
just in this manner you must keep the <hi>Chissel</hi> steddy
bearing upon the Work, as the <hi>Pole</hi> comes down,
and withdrawing it from the Work as the <hi>Pole</hi>
Springs up (as you were taught to use the <hi>Gouge)</hi> and
at the same time sliding it forwards from one end
of the Work to the other, till it be wrought down
all the way to its true Diameter between the points
of the <hi>Callippers:</hi> For then a straight <hi>Ruler</hi> applied to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41812:135"/>
your Work, the outside of your proposes <hi>Cilinder</hi> will
be formed.</p>
                     <p>Only the ends must be cut down square to the length:
Therefore open the points of your Compasses to the
distance of eight Inches on your <hi>Rule,</hi> and prick that
distance hard off upon your Work, that the points of
your <hi>Compasses</hi> may leave visible marks, by placing
one point as near one end as you can, to leave Stuff
enough to cut straight down all the way; that is, to
cut it square down at right Angles with the outside of
the Work. Which to do, you must hold the Handle
of the <hi>Flat Chissel</hi> in your Right hand (as before) and
clasp the Blade of it in your Left, and lay one of the
thin sides of it upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> so that the edge may
stand upright, or very near upright against the Work.
Then sink your Right hand somewhat below the Level
of the <hi>Rest,</hi> that the lower Corner of the edge of the
<hi>Chissel</hi> may mount, and being thrust steddy against the
Work, just in the mark one Point of the <hi>Compasses</hi> made,
Tread the <hi>Treddle,</hi> and cut a pretty deep Circle into
the Stuff. But you must have a care you do not direct
the cutting Corner of the <hi>Chissel</hi> inwards, but rather
outwards, left you make the end hollow instead of Flat:
For if you do take off too little at first, you may by
degrees cut it down to a Flat afterwards. As you cut
deeper into the Stuff, you must turn the Flat of the
<hi>Chissel,</hi> and with it cut down the Shoulder just at the
end on the outside the mark, for else that may hinder the
Corner of the Edge of the <hi>Chissel</hi> for coming at the Work.</p>
                     <p>Note, that if you hold not the edge of the <hi>Chissel</hi>
truly before the Work, but direct it inwards, and if you
hold it not very steddy, and have a good guidance of
it, the quick coming about of the Work, may draw the
edge of the <hi>Chissel</hi> into it inwards and run a dawk on
<hi>Cilinder,</hi> like the Grooves of a Screw; and so spoil
your Work: For being once wrought to the true size,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41812:135"/>
you cannot afterwards take any more off to cleanse it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other end must be cut down as this.</p>

                     <head>§ 14. Of Turning Flat Boards.</head>
                     <p>IF your Board be thick enough, you may boar a
round Hole in the middle of it; and Turn a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel</hi>
with a <hi>Pin</hi> a very little Tapering, to fit hard and
stiff into the round Hole: And if the <hi>Hole</hi> and <hi>Pin</hi>
be proportionable in size to the weight of the Board,
the <hi>Pin</hi> will carry it about. But you must be very
careful the <hi>Hole</hi> be boared exactly straight through the
middle, and not inclining on either side the Board,
more to any part of the Verge than to another; but
that the middle of the <hi>Hole</hi> be exactly the Center of
the Board the whole thickness through. This <hi>Pin-Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel</hi>
is described <hi>Numb. 11. § 6.</hi> and <hi>Plate. 13.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If your Board be not thick enough to be fastned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Pin-Mandrel,</hi> or that your Work will not admit
of an Hole to be bored through the middle of it, you
may use the <hi>Flat Mandrel</hi> described <hi>Plate 13.</hi> F 2. And
then you must with your <hi>Compasses</hi> find the Center on
the backside of the Round Board (with several proffers
if need require) till you have found it, and prick
there an Hole for a mark: Then open the points of
your <hi>Compasses</hi> to about the thickness of a Shilling wider
than the Semidiameter of the <hi>Flat Mandrel;</hi> and with
the points of your <hi>Compasses</hi> at that distance describe
a Circle on the backside of the Board to be Turned, by
placing one Foot in the prick mark, and turning about
the other Foot. By this Circle you may pitch the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Board exactly upon the Center of the <hi>Flat
Mandrel:</hi> For the points of the <hi>Compasses</hi> being opened
about the thickness of a Shilling wider than the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter
of the <hi>Flat Mandrel</hi> will (when you have
pitcht the Center of the Board on the Center of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41812:136"/>
                        <hi>Mandrel)</hi> place the outer Verge of the <hi>Mandrel</hi> the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Shilling round about within the Circle descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
on the backside of the Board: And when it is
thus pitcht, you may, by laying the Board flat down,
knock upon the <hi>Rowler</hi> end of the <hi>Mandrel,</hi> and drive
the <hi>Pegs</hi> in the flat of the <hi>Mandrel</hi> into the Board,
and so hold it steddy upon the <hi>Mandrel:</hi> Then find the
Center on the Foreside of the Board also, as you were
taught to find the Center on the backside, and put
your Board and <hi>Mandrel</hi> upon the <hi>Pikes</hi> of the <hi>Puppets,</hi>
and screw them hard up, as you have been taught
before.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes <hi>Turners</hi> use this <hi>Flat Mandrel</hi> without
<hi>Pegs,</hi> and then they chalk the Flat side of it very
well, and clap the backside of the Board to it, which
will (if the Board to be <hi>Turned</hi> be not too heavy, but
be well screwed up between the <hi>Pikes)</hi> keep the Board
steddy from slipping from its set-position, till you work
it.</p>
                     <p>If in going about of your Work you find it <hi>Wabble,</hi>
that is, that one side of the Flat incline either to the
Right or Left Hand, you must with soft Blows of an
Hammer, or other Tool at hand, set it to right, and then
again screw it hard up: For so often as you thus strike
upon the Verge to set the Board true, you force the
Steel point of the <hi>Pike</hi> more or less (according to the
softness of the Wood) towards that side of the Verge
you strike upon; and therefore you may perceive a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for screwing up the <hi>Pike</hi> so oft as you knock upon
the outer Verge of the Board.</p>
                     <p>But we will now suppose the Board well pitcht and
fastned on the <hi>Mandrel</hi> and Center; Therefore take
the <hi>Side-Rest</hi> described in <hi>§ 1. Numb. 10.</hi> ¶ 7. and <hi>Plate
83.</hi> at the Figure e, and f g, and fit it so into the <hi>Lathe,</hi>
as the upper edge of it may stand range, or parallel to
the side of the Board you are to work upon; and so
wedge it hard up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:41812:136"/>
Now you must come to use the <hi>Hook,</hi> described
<hi>Numb. 12. § 5.</hi> and <hi>Plate 15:</hi> For this Tool is most
commodious to serve you instead of the <hi>Gouge,</hi> when
the Work stands athwart the <hi>Pikes;</hi> because the end
of the Blade of this Tool being on its Flat side turned
into a Circular Figure, and that Circular Figure tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a little backwards, one of the Edges of this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Figure will conveniently (though the Tool be not
held straight before the Work) come at any part of the
Flat of the Board, and so by the Circulation of the
Board against the Edge of the <hi>Hook,</hi> cut off its irregular
Extuberances.</p>
                     <p>In the using of this Tool, you must place the end of
the <hi>Handle</hi> under your Arm-pit, and hold your left
hand on the upper side of the Blade of the Tool close
to the <hi>Rest,</hi> and your Right hand close besides your
Left Hand under the Tool, and with both your hands
clasp the Tool hard, and press it steddy upon the <hi>Rest,</hi>
and at the same time hold it also steddy, and yet lightly
bearing against the Work, that by the swift coming
about of the Work it draw not the Edge of the thin and
tender Blade of the <hi>Hook</hi> into it.</p>
                     <p>You must not hold the Blade of this Tool perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly
before the Work, <hi>viz.</hi> parallel to the <hi>Pikes,</hi>
but aslant, so as somewhat about the middle of the
Convex of the <hi>Hook</hi> may touch against the Work. You
may begin at the Verge, and so lay several Grooves
close by one another till you come to the Center: But
you must observe (as was said before in the <hi>Cilinder)</hi>
that you lay all your <hi>Grooves</hi> of an equal depth into
the Board: For if you lay one deeper than the rest, and
an Hollow may not properly be in that place, you must
again go over your work with your <hi>Hook,</hi> to work
that dawk out: And then perhaps your Board may be
made too thin for its intended purpose. But this Craft
of the Hand must be acquired with some continued
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41812:137"/>
Use and Practice, which will better inform your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
what Errours you may be subject to commit, than
many words (though significant) upon this Doctrine.
And this I'm sure I found, when I first practised upon
<hi>Turning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus with the <hi>Hook</hi> rough-plain'd the Board
(for this <hi>Hook</hi> does in <hi>Turning</hi> the Office of a <hi>Fore-plain</hi>
in <hi>Joynery)</hi> you must use the <hi>Triangular Grooving Tool,</hi>
described <hi>Numb. 11. § 5. Plate 15.</hi> and with one of
its Edges smoothen down the ridges the <hi>Hook</hi> left on
the Board.</p>
                     <p>But if your Work require any Molding near the
Verge, or any other part of it, you must work that
Molding as near as you can with the <hi>Hook,</hi> especially
where Hollows are required; for that cuts faster and
smoother than any other Tool, and most artificially
forms an Hollow.</p>
                     <p>If a Flat be to be laid in the Board, you must first
use the <hi>Triangular Point Tool,</hi> and with it strike so many
Threds as the breadth of the Flat requires, and lay
each Thred almost so deep into the Board as you intend
the Flat shall be: And afterwards to smoothen it down,
you must use the <hi>Flat Grooving Tool,</hi> or a <hi>Flat Chissel,</hi>
and with either of them finish the Flat to its intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Depth and Breadth. And where a fine Thred, or
Circle, is to be laid in the Board, you must use the <hi>Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Point Tool.</hi> And thus as you see occasion, you
must accommodate your self with a Tool apt and proper
for your purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> such a Tool as will most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
come at, and from the intended Work.

                     <head>Applied to the ART of TURNING.</head>
                     <head>§ XV. Of Turning Hard Wood, and Ivory.</head>
                     <p>IF the Wood be very hard, as <hi>Ebony, Lignum Vitae;</hi>
or if it be <hi>Ivory, Bone</hi> or <hi>Horn</hi> they are to Turn;
they neither use the same Tools they do for Soft Wood;
because their edge is too tender: nor do they use their
other Tools as they do soft Wood, For the Tools
made for Hard Wood are made with a stonger Point,
edge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than they are for Soft, as was said <hi>Numb.
11. § 5.</hi> And they use them differently; because for
Turning Soft Wood, they hold the Edge of the <hi>Gouge</hi>
and <hi>Flat Chissel,</hi> at some considerable Distance from the
<hi>Rest,</hi> mounting the Edge at such an Angle as will best
cut off from the Work, as great a Chip as they can, or
desire. And as they Turn the Work smaller, they
guide the <hi>Chissel</hi> to follow the Work: But for Hard
Wood, they raise the <hi>Rest</hi> near the Horizontal Plain of
the <hi>Axis</hi> of the Work, setting it as close as conveniently
they can to their Work, and lay their Tool flat and
steddy upon the <hi>Rest;</hi> which being hard held in this
position, does by the comming about of the Work, cut
or tear off all the Extuberances the Tool touches in
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41812:140"/>
the sweep of the Work. So that (as I said before)
as in <hi>Turning</hi> Soft Wood the Tool does somewhat fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Work; in <hi>Turning</hi> Hard Wood the Work comes
to the <hi>Tool:</hi> And therefore you may perceive a great
reason they have to keep the <hi>Tool</hi> steddy: For should
it in one sweep of the Work be thrust nearer the <hi>Axis</hi>
in any place, it would there take off more than it
should.</p>
                     <p>Having prepared the Work fit for the <hi>Lathe,</hi> either
with Hewing (as hath been shewn <hi>Numb. 5. § 7.</hi> and
<hi>Numb. 11. § 13.)</hi> or, as some Hard Woods and Ivory
may require, with Rasping, they pitch it between the
<hi>Pikes,</hi> as before has been shewn, or such Work as it
may be, as Boxes, and generally all Hollow Work,
they fit into <hi>Collers,</hi> either by screwing the <hi>Mandrel</hi>
on an Iron <hi>Axis;</hi> or fitting it with some other of the
<hi>Mandrels</hi> described <hi>Numb. 11. § 6.</hi> as is proper for it:
As sometimes they fit the Work tight into an <hi>Hollow
Mandrel,</hi> and the tight fitting in holds it whilst it is
working upon: And sometimes, if the Work be very
thin, they fix it on a <hi>Flat Mandrel</hi> with Cement; But
they are always either to chuse one of the <hi>Mandrels</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
already in <hi>Numb. 11. § 6.</hi> or else contrive (as
they often do) some other <hi>Mandrel</hi> convenient to the
opportunity that accidentally their Business may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
For the Work (whether it be pitcht on the <hi>Pikes,</hi>
or fitted into <hi>Hollow Mandrels,</hi> or otherwise) must run
very steddy and tight about.</p>
                     <p>But having thus fitted it into the <hi>Lathe,</hi> they begin
to work with the <hi>Sharp-pointed Grooving Tool,</hi> or else
with the <hi>Triangular Grooving Tool,</hi> and with the point
of either of these <hi>Tools</hi> break the Grain of the Wood,
by laying small Grooves upon its Surface, till they have
pretty well wrought away Extuberances, and brought
the Work tollerably near an intended shape, by streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
hollowing, and leaving Risings in their several
proper places.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:41812:140"/>
Afterwards with Edg'd <hi>Grooving Tools</hi> of a proper
Breadth, they cut down and smoothen away the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberances
left by the <hi>Sharp-pointed Grooving Tool,</hi> or
the <hi>Triangular Grooving Tool,</hi> and bring the Work into
a perfect shape. Which done, they smoothen the work
with the Edge of a piece of a Blade of a broken Knife,
basil'd away, by following the Work with it: That is,
holding the basil'd Edge of the Knife close against the
Work while it comes about: For then its sharp Edge
scrapes or shaves off the little roughness the grosser <hi>Tools</hi>
left upon the Work.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, they hold either a piece of Seal-Skin or <hi>Dutch</hi>
Reeds (whose outer Skin or Filme somewhat finely
cuts) pretty hard against the Work, and so make it
smooth enough to polish.</p>
                     <p>Hard Wood they polish with <hi>Bees-Wax, viz.</hi> by
holding <hi>Bees Wax</hi> against it, till it have sufficiently
toucht it all over; and press it hard into it by holding
hard the edge of a Flat piece of hard Wood made siza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and suitable to the Work they work upon, as the
Work is going about. Then they set a Gloss on it with
a very dry Woollen Rag, lightly smear'd with <hi>Sallad
Oyl.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Ivory</hi> they polish with Chalk and Water, and
afterwards dry it with a Woollen Rag, and a light touch
of <hi>Sallad Oyl;</hi> which at last they rub off again with a
dry Woollen Rag, and so set a Gloss on it.</p>
                     <p>If there be a Screw to be made upon the thin Edge
of an <hi>Ivory,</hi> or <hi>Hard Wood,</hi> or <hi>Brass Box,</hi> they use the
<hi>Screw Mandrel,</hi> and its <hi>Socket,</hi> described <hi>Numb. 11. §
6.</hi> ¶ 4. and 5. as is shewn at the latter end of that
Section.</p>

                     <head>§ XVI. Of Turning long and slender Work
of Ivory.</head>
                     <p>SOme <hi>Turners</hi> to shew their Dexterity in <hi>Turning,</hi> and
make others that know not the way how it is done
admire at their Skill, <hi>Turn</hi> long and slender Sprigs of
<hi>Ivory,</hi> as small as an Hay-stalk, and perhaps a Foot or
more long: which to perform they cut a piece of <hi>Ivory</hi>
to its intended length; but strong enough to bear work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till they bring it to as small a <hi>Cilinder</hi> as they can;
which being thus forwarded, they place a <hi>Joint Coller</hi>
(as is described <hi>Numb. 11. § 7.)</hi> made small and fit
for their purpose, just in the middle of their Work:
only that their Work may <hi>Bear</hi> at a smaller length, and
consequently be stronger for being thus supported while
it is <hi>Turned</hi> yet smaller. Then they place other <hi>Collers</hi>
between the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and the middle <hi>Coller,</hi> and <hi>Turn</hi> the
whole Cilinder slender yet. And thus by placing <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
where ever they find the Work buckle, they (as
aforesaid) with <hi>Sharp Tools,</hi> tender touches, somewhat
a loose and fine <hi>String,</hi> weak Bow, and great care and
diligence work the whole Cilinder down as small as
they list, either with Moldings, or other Work upon
it, as best likes them.</p>
                     <p>The properest <hi>Lathe</hi> to <hi>Turn</hi> this slender Work in, is

                     <head>§ XVII. Of the Brasiers Lathe and Turning
Tools; and their manner of using them.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>BRasiers</hi> that <hi>Turn</hi> Andirons, Pots, Kettles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
have their <hi>Lathe</hi> made different from the Common
<hi>Turners Lathe,</hi> as you may see in <hi>Plate 16.</hi> at A. where
the <hi>Cheeks, Puppets</hi> and <hi>Rest,</hi> &amp;c. are much stronger,
and the <hi>Pikes</hi> stronger and longer than those the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41812:141"/>
                        <hi>Turners</hi> use. Their <hi>Edge Tools</hi> which they call
<hi>Hooks,</hi> are also of a different shape, as the Figures of
them described at B1, B2, B3. in the said <hi>Plate</hi>
shew, as being bent backwards and forwards towards
the cutting end, somewhat like an z. And as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Turners</hi> work with a round <hi>String</hi> made of Gut,
as hath been described <hi>Numb. 10. § 1. ¶ 14.</hi> The <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers</hi>
work with a <hi>Flat Leather Thong,</hi> which wrapping
close and tight about the <hi>Rowler</hi> of their <hi>Mandrel,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
it the easier and more forciably about. Their
<hi>Thong</hi> runs between the <hi>Cheeks</hi> of the <hi>Lathe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The whole <hi>Lathe,</hi> and its parts, are made so strong,
because the Matter they <hi>Turn</hi> being Mettal, is much
heavier than Wood, and consequently with forciable
coming about, would (if the <hi>Lathe</hi> were sleight) make
it tremble, and so spoil the Work; as hath been said
before.</p>
                     <p>The reason why the <hi>Hook</hi> is so turned backwards,
and again forwards, towards the end, is, that they may
the better direct the Edge of it as much below the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal
Plain of the <hi>Pikes</hi> as they list, the better (in
many cases) to come at the Work: For contrary to
Soft Wood, Hard Wood and Ivory <hi>Turners,</hi> they
always dip the end of their <hi>Hook</hi> below the <hi>Rest,</hi> that
so the <hi>Hook</hi> resting very steddy upon the <hi>Rest,</hi> and also
against one of the Iron <hi>Pins</hi> standing upright in the <hi>Rest,</hi>
and held very steddy forwards to the Work, the strong
coming about of the Work against the strong Edge of
the <hi>Hook,</hi> scrapes off the extuberant Mettle lying in
that Sweep.</p>
                     <p>I need no further describe the <hi>Lathe,</hi> and other <hi>Tools</hi>
that belong to <hi>Brasiers</hi> Turning; or more of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of using them; because, by the whole preceding
Discourse, these Arguments are largely and sufficiently
handled: especially considering I have given you the
Figures of them in <hi>Plate 16.</hi> as aforesaid.</p>

Only, their way of <hi>Whetting</hi> their <hi>Tools</hi> being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the <hi>Whetting</hi> of other Turning <hi>Tools,</hi> I shall
say somewhat to: For they <hi>Whet</hi> their <hi>Hooks</hi> upon a
broad Flat Slate, holding the <hi>Hook</hi> almost perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
that the <hi>Basil</hi> of its Edge may comply with the
Flat of the <hi>Slate;</hi> with clasping the upper end of the
<hi>Handle</hi> in their left hand to lean the heavier on it, and
clutching the <hi>Shank</hi> of the <hi>Blade</hi> near the <hi>Hook</hi>-end in
the right hand, to guide it: And thus with Spittle, or
Water, rub forwards and backwards on the Slate, till
they have sharpned the Edge of the <hi>Hook.</hi> But if it be
a Round end <hi>Hook</hi> they whet, they chuse a <hi>Groove</hi> in
the <hi>Slate</hi> fit to comply with the round edge of the <hi>Hook</hi>
(for they have different sized Grooves in the Slate for
that purpose) and so in it rub forwards and backwards
as aforesaid.</p>

                     <head>§ XIX. Of laying Moldings either upon Mettal, or
Wood, without fitting the Work in a Lathe.</head>
                     <p>I Had, soon after the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> occasion to lay
Moldings upon the Verges of several round and
weighty flat pieces of <hi>Brass:</hi> And being at that time,
by reason of the said Fire, unaccommodated of a <hi>Lathe</hi>
of my own, I intended to put them out to be <hi>Turned:</hi>
But then <hi>Turners</hi> were all full of Employment, which
made them so unreasonable in their Prizes, that I was
forc'd to contrive this following way to lay Moldings
on their Verges.</p>
                     <p>I provided a strong Iron <hi>Bar</hi> for the <hi>Beam</hi> of a <hi>Sweep:</hi>
(for the whole <hi>Tool</hi> marked in <hi>Plate 16,</hi> is by Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
<hi>Instrument-makers</hi> called a <hi>Sweep.)</hi> To this <hi>Tool</hi>
is filed a <hi>Tooth</hi> of Steel with such <hi>Roundings</hi> and <hi>Hollows</hi>
in the bottom of it, as I intended to have <hi>Hollows</hi> and
<hi>Roundings</hi> upon my Work: For an Hollow on the <hi>Tooth,</hi>
makes a <hi>Round</hi> upon the Work; and a <hi>Round</hi> upon the
<hi>Tooth,</hi> makes an <hi>Hollow</hi> on the Work; even as they do
in the <hi>Molding-Plains Joyners</hi> use. Then I placed the
<hi>Center-point</hi> of the <hi>Sweep</hi> in a Center-hole made in a
square <hi>Stud</hi> of <hi>Mettal,</hi> and fixed in the <hi>Center</hi> of the
Plain of the Work: and removed the <hi>Socket</hi> that rides
on the <hi>Beam</hi> of the <hi>Sweep,</hi> till the <hi>Tooth</hi> stood just upon
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41812:143"/>
its intended place on the Verge of the Work, and there
screw'd the <hi>Socket</hi> fast to the <hi>Beam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To work it out, I employ'd a Labourer, directing
him in his left Hand to hold the Head of the <hi>Center-pin,</hi>
and with his right Hand to draw about the <hi>Beam</hi>
and <hi>Tooth,</hi> which (according to the strength) he us'd,
cut and tore away great Flakes of the <hi>Mettal,</hi> till it
receiv'd the whole and perfect Form the <hi>Tooth</hi> would
make; which was as compleat a Molding as any Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Turner</hi> could have laid upon it.</p>
                     <p>Having such good Success upon <hi>Brass,</hi> I improv'd
the invention so, as to make it serve for Wood also.
And made a <hi>Plain-Stock</hi> with my intended Molding on
the <hi>Sole</hi> of it, and fitted an <hi>Iron</hi> to that <hi>Stock</hi> with the
same Molding the <hi>Sole</hi> had.</p>
                     <p>Through the sides of this <hi>Stock</hi> I fitted an Iron <hi>Beam,</hi>
to do the Office of the <hi>Beam</hi> I used for the <hi>Sweep, viz.</hi>
to keep the Plain always at what position I listed from
the Center (for thus the Iron in the Plain wrought
about the Center, even as the Tooth in the <hi>Sweep</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rehearsed) and to that purpose I made a round
Hole of about half an Inch Diameter near the end of the
Iron: Then in the Center of the Work I fixed a round
Iron <hi>Pin,</hi> exactly to fit the said round Hole, putting
the round <hi>Hole</hi> over the <hi>Pin,</hi> and fitting the <hi>Iron</hi> into
the <hi>Stock</hi> commodious to work with. I used this Plain
with both Hands, even as <hi>Joyners</hi> do other <hi>Plains:</hi>
For the <hi>Iron Pin</hi> in the Hole of the <hi>Beam</hi> kept it to its
due distance from the Center; so that neither hand was
ingaged to guide it.</p>
                     <p>But note, The <hi>Stock</hi> of this <hi>Plain</hi> was not straight
(as the Stocks of other Plains are) but by Hand cut
Circular pretty near the size of the Diameter of the
intended Molding: And yet was made to slide upon
the <hi>Beam,</hi> farther from or nearer to the Center, as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Diameters of Verges might require.</p>

                     <head>§ XX. To Turn several Globes or Balls of Ivory
within one another, with a Solid Ball in
the middle.</head>
                     <p>YOU must first Turn your <hi>Ivory Ball</hi> or <hi>Globe</hi> truly
round, of your intended Diameter: Then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
a Circle exactly through the middle, or Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
of the <hi>Globe:</hi> Divide that Circle into four equal
parts, and pitch one point of a pair of Compasses in
one of those Divisions, and extend the other point to
either of the next Divisions, and describe with it a
Circle round about the <hi>Globe.</hi> Then remove the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
point of the Compasses to either of the next Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Equinoctial, and in like manner describe
another Circle round about the <hi>Globe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But note, that the moving Point of your Compasses
must be somewhat bended inwards; For else its point
will not describe a Circle on the greatest Extuberances
of the <hi>Globe,</hi> but will slide off it.</p>
                     <p>Thus shall the Ball or Globe be divided into eight
Spherical Quadrants: Describe as great a Circle as
you can in each of these Quadrants, and each two
Centers of every two opposite Circles shall have an
imaginary <hi>Axis</hi> pass between them: And if the <hi>Globe</hi>
be successively pitcht upon all the rest of the Centers,
so as the imagined <hi>Axis</hi> passing between it and its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Center, lie in a straight line with the <hi>Pike</hi> and
the Center of the <hi>Coller</hi> it is <hi>Turned</hi> in, the working out
of all the <hi>Hollows</hi> on the <hi>Ball</hi> will be but common <hi>Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
Work, as you will find hereafter. This is in brief
the Theory: But to the Practice.</p>
                     <p>You must use an <hi>Hollow Mandrel,</hi> made sit stifly to
receive the convexity of the <hi>Globe</hi> in its concavity, so
as it may stick firmly in the <hi>Mandrel,</hi> in its position:
And you must take care that in pitching the <hi>Globe</hi> into
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41812:144"/>
the <hi>Mandrel,</hi> that the imaginary <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>Globe</hi>
(which is the Line passing between the two Centers of
the two opposite Circles as aforesaid) lie in a straight
Line with the <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>Mandrel;</hi> which you may
know by examining whether the Circle described with
your <hi>Compasses</hi> (as aforesaid) on the Center (aforesaid)
wabble not in a whole Revolution of the <hi>Globe,</hi> from the
point of a Tool applied steddy to it.</p>
                     <p>Having thus pitcht the <hi>Globe</hi> true, and fixt it fast
into the <hi>Mandrel,</hi> you must begin to work with the
<hi>Triangular Grooving Point</hi> (described <hi>Numb. 11. § 5.</hi>
and <hi>Plate 15.)</hi> placing the point of it pretty near the
Center of the Circle, and work into the <hi>Ball</hi> with the
<hi>Grooving Point,</hi> and so by degrees make a Hollow in
the <hi>Ball</hi> so deep, and so wide, as you think convenient,
I mean so deep from the Superficies of the <hi>Globe</hi> towards
the Center of the <hi>Globe,</hi> and so wide from the Center
of the Circle described on the Superficies of the <hi>Globe</hi>
towards that Circle, as it may have a convenient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
between this Hole, and the next intended to be
<hi>Turned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus must every one of the eight Circles described
on the <hi>Globe,</hi> be successively by the same Rule, and
after the same manner be pitcht outwards, and fixt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Mandrel,</hi> and then Hollowed out as the first
was. Where note, that every Hollow is to be <hi>Turned</hi>
to the same depth and width exactly as the first was:
Which to do, you must use a <hi>Gage</hi> made of a thin Plate
of Iron or Brass, as is described in <hi>Plate 17. Fig.</hi> D.
whose two sides from <hi>a</hi> the Bottom of the <hi>Gage,</hi> to <hi>b</hi>
the <hi>Shoulder</hi> are the depth of the <hi>Hollow</hi> from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of the <hi>Globe</hi> towards the Center: <hi>b b</hi> is the
width of the <hi>Hollow</hi> at the Superficies of the <hi>Globe;</hi> and
<hi>a a</hi> is the bottom width of the <hi>Hollow;</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
Arch between <hi>a a</hi> is an Arch that the Convexity
of the little Solid <hi>Ball</hi> to be <hi>Turned</hi> within all the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41812:144"/>
                        <hi>Spheres</hi> must comply with. So that when each <hi>Hollow</hi>
is <hi>Turned,</hi> the <hi>Gage</hi> must be put into it to try how
the sides of the <hi>Hollow</hi> complies with the sides of the
<hi>Gage,</hi> and also how the Arch in the bottom of the
<hi>Gage,</hi> complies with the surface of the Solid <hi>Ball</hi> in the
middle.</p>
                     <p>Having thus <hi>Turned</hi> all the <hi>Hollows</hi> in the <hi>Globe,</hi> you
must provide several thin and narrow Arching <hi>Grooving
Tools,</hi> whose convex and concave Arches comply both
with the Convexity and Concavity of each <hi>Globe,</hi> or
<hi>Sphere,</hi> to be <hi>Turned</hi> within the outermost: So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
at the bottom of the Hollow, you Turn just half
way of the Solid <hi>Ball</hi> loose from the Sphere it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in, <hi>viz.</hi> as far as the Equinoctial of the <hi>Globe;</hi>
and in thus Turning it, you must take great care, that
the solid Ball on its Convexity and the Concavity of
the Sphere it is contained in, be both at the same time
Turned exactly Spherical.</p>
                     <p>Thus one half of the Solid <hi>Ball</hi> being <hi>Turned</hi> loose,
you may in like manner <hi>Turn</hi> the next Sphere it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in half loose also: And so successively as many
Sphereas as you list.</p>
                     <p>Having thus <hi>Turned</hi> one half of all the <hi>Spheres</hi> loose,
you must take the whole <hi>Globe</hi> out of the <hi>Hollow Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel,</hi>
and pitcht and fix the <hi>Globe</hi> again into the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel,</hi>
so as the imagined <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>Hollow</hi> opposite to
the last loosned Hollow lie in a straight line (as before
was taught) with the <hi>Pike</hi> and <hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>Coller</hi> the
<hi>Mandrel</hi> runs in, and then <hi>Turn</hi> the other half of the
Solid <hi>Ball</hi> and <hi>Spheres</hi> also loose, as the first half was
<hi>Turned.</hi>

                     <p>THis is <hi>Turned</hi> after the same manner the former
<hi>Ball</hi> was <hi>Turned;</hi> only instead of dividing the
Equinoctial of that <hi>Globe</hi> into four equal parts, the
Equinoctial of this must be divided but into three equal
parts, and their Semi-Circle draw through the divisions
into either Pole of the <hi>Globe:</hi> So shall the <hi>Globe</hi> be
divided into six equal parts, or Segments; in each of
which parts must be described a Circle, as was describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before in the <hi>Globes</hi> of eight equal parts; and in these
six Circles must be made six Hollows, as before there
was eight: But instead of working the Bottom of each
hollow Spherical, now the Bottom must be wrought
Flat: So shall the <hi>Cube</hi> when these six Hollows are thus
made, be formed: and the Hollows being exactly of
the same depth, and flat in the Bottom, the <hi>Cube</hi> or <hi>Dy</hi>
will loosen, and each of the six Flats in the Bottom will
become the six sides or Faces of the <hi>Cube.</hi>

                     <p>The manner of loosning all the other inward <hi>Spheres,</hi>
is as the Former: Only, that was loosned with twice
pitching the <hi>Ball</hi> in the <hi>Mandrel,</hi> because the Centers of
the <hi>Hollows</hi> lay opposite to one another; But to loosen
this <hi>Ball</hi> will require three Pitchings into the <hi>Mandrel;</hi>

                     <p>THis Work may be perform'd in the Common <hi>Lathe</hi>
that goes either with the <hi>Treddle-Wheel,</hi> or the
great Wheel; because the Work must run always one
way, if the <hi>Puppet</hi> be made to it with the Machination
described in <hi>Plate 17.</hi> and an Iron <hi>Axis</hi> be made to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Work about, and to its end be fitted and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a <hi>Brass Coller,</hi> with a Female Screw in it, to screw
on the <hi>Mandrel</hi> that the Work you intend to Turn is
fixt upon.</p>
                     <p>To the Foreside of this <hi>Puppet</hi> is fastned at <hi>b,</hi> as on
a Center-pin, a strong Iron <hi>Coller</hi> marked <hi>b h,</hi> and this
Coller is called the <hi>Moving Coller;</hi> because it moves
between the Iron <hi>Shackle c c,</hi> and the Fore side of the
<hi>Puppet.</hi> Into this <hi>Moving Coller</hi> is fitted the <hi>Hollow
Axis</hi> marked <hi>c,</hi> so as to turn round in it as if it were in
any of the other <hi>Collers</hi> formerly described; but the
<hi>Moving Coller</hi> moving between the <hi>Shackles,</hi> and the
Fore-side of the <hi>Puppet,</hi> carries the <hi>Hollow Axis</hi> with it
athwart the <hi>Puppet,</hi> even so far as is the width of the
<hi>Hollow</hi> between the <hi>Shackle,</hi> and the Fore-side of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41812:148"/>
                        <hi>Puppet.</hi> And thus by the moving of the <hi>Hollow Axis</hi>
backwards and forwards the Work screwed in it, having
an <hi>Edg'd,</hi> or a <hi>Pointed-Tool</hi> applied to it, receives that
<hi>Oval</hi> Form which is made upon the <hi>Guide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to make it move thus to and from you, there
are required several Machinal Helps: For there is a
strong <hi>Steel Bow</hi> as at <hi>a,</hi> fastned about its middle part
to the further side of the <hi>Puppet,</hi> which stands about
an Inch forwarder than the Foreside of the <hi>Puppet</hi> with
its hollow side to the Workman. And to the ends of
this <hi>Steel Bow</hi> is fastned a strong <hi>String</hi> of Gut, and
to the middle of that <hi>String</hi> in a Noos is fastned ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strong <hi>Gut-string,</hi> with a Noos at its end. This
last mentioned <hi>String</hi> is made exactly of that length
that when the nearest side of the <hi>Guide, viz.</hi> its least
Diameter is set into the <hi>Groove</hi> of the <hi>Guide-pulley,</hi>
and the <hi>Bow</hi> is strained, and this <hi>String</hi> laid in the
<hi>Groove</hi> of the <hi>String-pulley,</hi> the Noos at the end of it
may be put over the Iron <hi>Button</hi> fixed in the top of the
<hi>Moving-Coller.</hi> For then as the <hi>Treddle-Wheel</hi> carries
the <hi>Axis</hi> about, the <hi>Guide</hi> being firmly fastned upon the
<hi>Axis,</hi> comes also about; and having the <hi>Groove</hi> of the
<hi>Guide-pulley</hi> set against the outer edge of the <hi>Guide,</hi> as
the great Diameter of the <hi>Guide</hi> is turned against the
<hi>Guide-pulley,</hi> the <hi>Moving-Coller</hi> being drawn by the
strength of the <hi>Bow,</hi> draws the <hi>Hollow Axis</hi> along with
it, as also the Work screwed in the <hi>Hollow Axis:</hi> And
thus as the small Diameter of the <hi>Guide</hi> comes to the
<hi>Guide-pulley,</hi> the small Diameter of the Work is Formed;
and as the great Diameter of the <hi>Guide</hi> comes to the
<hi>Guide-pulley,</hi> the great Diameter of the Work is formed.</p>
                     <p>This is the Sum of <hi>Oval Turning.</hi>

move backwards; and then an Edge-Tool held to the
Work in the <hi>Mandrel</hi> screwed in the <hi>Hollow Axis,</hi> will
describe the same Figure on the Work, as is on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Edge of the <hi>Guide.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Note, that when you are at Work, you must keep
the Hole in the middle of the <hi>Guide-pulley</hi> well oyl'd, as
also the round Iron <hi>Pin</hi> it slides and turns round upon;
because this <hi>Guide-pulley</hi> ought to run round: For then
the <hi>Axis</hi> will have and easier and swifter motion, the'
it may indeed perform the Work if it run not round
upon the Iron Pin.</p>

                     <head>§ XXV. Of Turning Swash-Work.</head>
                     <p>TO the Turning of <hi>Swash-Work</hi> you must have two
such <hi>Puppets,</hi> as the <hi>Fore-puppet</hi> described in <hi>§


22.</hi> And also a Round <hi>Swash-board,</hi> about ten Inches
Diameter, and an Inch and an half thick, as is <hi>a</hi> in Fig.
B. <hi>Plate 18.</hi> Upon both the flat sides of this <hi>Swash
Board,</hi> in a diametrical Line, is fastned upright an Arch
of a Quardrant made of a Steel Plate, about half a
quarter of an Inch thick, and an Inch and a quarter
broad, as at <hi>b b, c c.</hi> The Convex edges of these Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants
are cut into Notches, like the Teeth of an Hand-Saw;
that accordins as you may have occasion to set
the <hi>Swash-Board</hi> more or less a-slope, you may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
with a Notch or Tooth to set it at. This
<hi>Swash-Board</hi> hath an Hole made about its Center, to
slip over the <hi>Iron Axis:</hi> And being thus slipt over the
<hi>Iron Axis,</hi> you set it to that Slope you intend the <hi>Swash</hi>
on your Work shall have. And to fix it fast in this
position, you must put the Blades of the Quadrants
into two <hi>Slits,</hi> made in the <hi>Iron Axis</hi> as at <hi>d d,</hi> and fit
the two opposite Teeth against the two outer Shoulders
of the <hi>Slits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You must moreover make two strong Steel <hi>Springs</hi>
as at <hi>c c,</hi> to reach from the bottom of the outer sides
of the <hi>Puppets,</hi> being strong nailed, or rather screwed
down there, which must reach up so high as the <hi>Axis.</hi>
And in the inner sides of these <hi>Springs</hi> must be made
two Center holes for the points of the <hi>Axis</hi> to be fitted
in: For the <hi>Oval-Guide</hi> being fitted to one end of the
<hi>Axis,</hi> and a Low-Puppet, as at <hi>f,</hi> wedged close to one
side of the <hi>Swash-Board,</hi> when the <hi>Swash-Board</hi> stands
in its greatest declirity; Then in a Revolution of the
<hi>Axis,</hi> as the farther part of the circumference of the
<hi>Swash-board</hi> comes to the <hi>Low-Puppet,</hi> one <hi>Spring</hi> will
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41812:151"/>
be forced backwards, and the other will spring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
and an Edg'd-Tool held against the Work fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the <hi>Axis,</hi> will make on the Work the Form of
a <hi>Swash,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>Oval-Engines, Swash-Engines,</hi> and all other <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,</hi>
are excellently well made by Mr. <hi>Thomas Oldfield,</hi>
at the sign of the <hi>Flower-de-luce,</hi> near the <hi>Savoy</hi> in the
<hi>Strand, London.</hi>

                  <p>BRicklayers-Work is an Art Manual, which Joins se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Bodies so together, that they adhere like one
entire Body.</p>
                  <p>Whether the <hi>White Mason,</hi> which is the Hewer of
Stone, or the <hi>Red Mason,</hi> which is the Hewer of Brick,
be the most Ancient, I know not; but in holy Writ,
we read of making of Bricks, before we read of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
or Hewing of Stone; therefore we may suppose
the <hi>Red Mason</hi> (or <hi>Bricklayer)</hi> to be the most ancient.</p>
                  <p>The method that I shall use in Treating of this Art
shall be this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> I will shew what Materials they use, and their

                        <head>Of Bricks.</head>
                        <p>THey are made of Earth, of which the whiteish
Chalky sort of Earth, and the Redish are the
best.</p>
                        <p>At <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> they make them of a fat
Earth full of <hi>Allom.</hi> Also there are good <hi>Bricks</hi> made at
<hi>Pitane</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> of a <hi>Pumice</hi> sort of Earth, which being
dryed, will swim in Water and not Sink.</p>
                        <p>Likewise the Antients made them of Earth which
was Sandy.</p>
                        <p>But here in <hi>England</hi> they are made for the most part
of a yellowish coloured fat Earth somewhat Redish.</p>
                        <p>And they are made of several sorts and sizes.</p>
                        <p>IN <hi>Holland</hi> they make small ones, being about Six
Inches long, Three Inches Broad, and One Inch
in thickness.</p>
                        <p>Which sort of <hi>Bricks,</hi> is commonly used here in
<hi>England,</hi> to Pave Yards or Stables withal; and they
make a good Pavement, and are very Durable, and
being laid edge ways looks handsomly, especially if
laid Herring-bone fashion.</p>
                        <p>They are also used in Soap-boilers Fats, and in making
of Cisterns.</p>
                        <p>THE Common <hi>Bricks</hi> that are made here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
are Nine Inches in Length, Four Inches and
1/4 in Breadth, and Two and an half in Thickness; and
sometimes Three Inches thick.</p>
                        <p>Most Counties in England afford Earth for the making of
Bricks.</p>
                        <p>BUT the best Earth that we have in <hi>England</hi> for
making of <hi>Bricks,</hi> is in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> from
whence we have most of the <hi>Bricks</hi> which are Rubbed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41812:161"/>
and Hewed for the Ornaments of the chief Fronts in
the City of <hi>London:</hi> The Ornamental part of which
Fronts, are done with the Reddest Bricks they can
pick from among them; and the Rough or Plain Work,
is done with the <hi>Grey Kentish Bricks;</hi> also those <hi>Grey
Kentish Bricks</hi> are used in making of Cisterns to hold
Water, and Horse-Ponds, and also Fats for Soap-Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;
and I am of the Opinion, that no time will Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
or decay those <hi>Grey Kentish Bricks:</hi> But, as <hi>Pliny</hi>
says, (speaking of <hi>Bricks,)</hi> that they will last to
Eternity.</p>
                        <p>There are also in most Counties of <hi>England,</hi> Bricks
made for the Paving of <hi>Floors</hi> of <hi>Rooms, Cellars, Dary-houses,
&amp;c.</hi> which are made of a stonger sort of Earth,
than the Common <hi>Bricks</hi> for Building, the <hi>Earth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a kind of <hi>Clay,</hi> and in some Countries are called
<hi>Clay Bricks,</hi> which are dearer than the <hi>Ordinary Bricks</hi>
by about Six Shillings in a Thousand.</p>
                        <p>Likewise in several Counties, but chiefly in <hi>Surrey,</hi>
are made Paving <hi>Tiles</hi> of Three several Magnitudes;
the largest sort being Twelve Inches long, and Twelve
broad, and one Inch and an half in Thickness.</p>
                        <p>The Second sort are Ten Inches long, and Ten In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Broad, and one Inch and a Quarter thick.</p>
                        <p>The Third sort are Eight Inches long, Eight Broad,
and one Inch thick.</p>
                        <p>Either of which sorts being Pollished or rubbed with
sharp Sand on the Surface, and the joints made exactly
square, and the sides equal, by hewing them with a
<hi>Brick Ax,</hi> and rubbing them on a rubbing Stone with
sharp Sand, makes an Excellent Pavement and pleasing
to the Eye, especially when laid <hi>Arris ways.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having thus described the several sorts of <hi>Bricks,</hi>
and also Paving Tiles, we come in the next place to
Treat of <hi>Tiles,</hi> made and used in the Covering of <hi>Roofs</hi>
of <hi>Houses,</hi> both Publick and Particular, of which are
Four sorts or Kinds.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="topic">
                        <p>
                           <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41812:162"/>
The First sort are called <hi>Plain Tiles,</hi> being made of a
strong sort of Earth like <hi>Clay;</hi> and are, or should be
Ten Inches and an half in Length, in Breadth Six In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and a Quarter, and in Thickness Three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of an Inch.</p>
                        <p>The second sort are <hi>Gutter</hi> or <hi>Hip Tiles,</hi> which are
used sometimes for <hi>Vallies</hi> and <hi>Hips</hi> of <hi>Rooffs,</hi> altho'
here at <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Vallies</hi> are commonly Tiled with
<hi>Plain Tiles,</hi> and the <hi>Hips</hi> with <hi>Ridge,</hi> or (as some call
them) <hi>Roof Tiles:</hi> These <hi>Gutter Tiles</hi> are in Length
Ten Inches and an half, with convenient Breadth and
Thickness accordingly, and are made Circular or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and wider at one end than at the other.</p>
                        <p>The third sort are <hi>Ridge</hi> or <hi>Roof Tiles,</hi> being in length
Thirteen Inches, and made Circular breadthways like
an half Cylinder, whose Diameter is about ten Inches,
or more, and about half an Inch and half a quarter in
thickness: These are laid upon the upper part, or ridge
of the Roof, and also on the Hips.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth sort are <hi>Pan-Tiles,</hi> being about thirteen
Inches long, with a Nob or Button to hang on the
Laths, and are made hollow or circular breadthways,
being eight Inches in breadth, and about half an Inch
in thickness, or somewhat more. The best sort of these
are brought from <hi>Holland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Flemmish Pan-Tiles,</hi> we having such Tiles made
here in <hi>England,</hi> but not so good: Which <hi>Flemmish
Tiles</hi> are sometimes glazed, and are of a Lead, or blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
colour, and being glazed they are very durable and
handsom.</p>
                        <p>Having done with the Description of <hi>Tiles,</hi> for the
Covering of Roofs, we come in the next place to treat
of <hi>Morter,</hi> and first of <hi>Lime,</hi> being the chief Material
of which the <hi>Morter</hi> is made, for the Cementing
or Joining of <hi>Tiles,</hi> as well as <hi>Bricks</hi> together, we will
Treat of it in the first place.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="topic">
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41812:162"/>
                        <head>Of Lime.</head>
                        <p>THere are two sorts, one made of Stone, which is
the strongest, and the other of Chalk, both
sorts being burnt in a <hi>Kilne.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Lime that is made of soft Stone or Chalk is use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for Plastering of Seelings and Walls within Doors,
or on the insides of Houses; and that made of hard Stone,
is fit for Structures or Buildings, and Plastering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Doors, or on the out side of Buildings that lies in
the Weather; and that which is made of greasy
clammy Stone, is stronger than that made of lean poor
stone; and that which is made of spongy stone, is
lighter than that made of firm and close stone; that is
again more Commodious for Plastering, this for Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                        <p>Also very good <hi>Lime</hi> may be made of <hi>Mill-stone,</hi>
not course and Sandy, but fine and Greasy.</p>
                        <p>Likewise of all kinds of Flints (but they are hard
to burn except in a <hi>Reverbratory Kiln)</hi> except those that
are roled in the Water, because a great part of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
goes away by a kind of Glass.</p>
                        <p>But the Shells of Fish, as of Cockles, Oysters, &amp;c.
are good to burn for <hi>Lime.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the Fire in <hi>Lime</hi> burnt, Asswages not, but lies
hid, so that it appears to be cold, but Water excites it
again, whereby it Slacks and crumbles into fine powder.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lime</hi> also is useful in divers things, for 'tis useful in
Oyles and Wines, and good to Manure Land with;
some season new Wine with it, mittigating the unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness
of the Wine therewith.</p>
                        <p>Moreover <hi>quick Lime</hi> being cast into an Arched
Vault, and Water thrown upon it, consumes dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
put therein.</p>
                        <p>Also <hi>Diers</hi> and <hi>Tanners,</hi> and likewise <hi>Physicians,</hi> use
it, but they choose the newest, to wit, that which is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41812:163"/>
is newly drawn out of the <hi>Kiln,</hi> and not slack'd with
Water or Air.</p>
                        <p>It will burn so Vehemently, that it makes crusts,
and will fire Boards or Timber against which it lies;
but being slackt for sometime, it burns no more, yet
it warms and dries, and dissolves Flesh; and being
washed three or Four times, it Bites or Eats not, but
dries quickly.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lime</hi> mixt with Sand is much used in Buildings,
and <hi>Vitruvius</hi> says, that you may put three parts of
Sand that is digged (or pit Sand) and one part of <hi>Lime</hi>
to make <hi>Morter;</hi> but if the Sand be taken out of a
<hi>River,</hi> or out of the Sea, then two parts thereof, and
one of <hi>Lime;</hi> as also to <hi>River</hi> or <hi>Sea</hi> Sand, if you put
a third part of Powder of <hi>Tiles</hi> or <hi>Bricks,</hi> (to wit,
<hi>Tile,</hi> or <hi>Brick</hi> dust) it works the better.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Vitruvius</hi> his Proportion of Sand seems too much,
altho' he should mean the <hi>Lime</hi> before it is slacked,
for one Bushel of <hi>Lime</hi> before it is slack'd, will be Five
Pecks after 'tis slack'd.</p>
                        <p>Here at <hi>London,</hi> where for the most part our <hi>Lime</hi> is
made of <hi>Chalk,</hi> we put about Thirty Six Bushels of
Pit Sand, to Twenty Five Bushels of <hi>Quick-Lime,</hi> that
is about one Bushel and half of Sand, to one Bushel of
<hi>Lime.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And <hi>Lime</hi> mixt with <hi>Sand,</hi> and made into <hi>Morter,</hi>
if it lie in an heap two or Three Years before 'tis
used, it will be the stronger and better, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of so many insufficient Buildings, is the using of the
<hi>Morter,</hi> as soon as 'tis made, as <hi>Agricola</hi> saith.</p>
                        <p>Moreover there is other <hi>Morter</hi> used in making of
Water-courses, Cisterns, Fish-ponds, &amp;c. which is very
hard and durable, as may be seen at <hi>Rome,</hi> at this
day, which is called <hi>Maltha,</hi> from a kind of <hi>Bitumen</hi>
Dug there; for as they build most firm Walls thereof
naturally, so they use it in making of Cisterns to hold
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41812:163"/>
Water, and all manner of Water-works; and also in
finishing or Plastering of Fronts to represent Stone.</p>
                        <p>And I find two kinds of Artifices used by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
both of which is Compounded of <hi>Lime</hi> and
<hi>Hogs-grease,</hi> but to one is added the Juice of <hi>Figs,</hi> and
to the other <hi>Liquid Pitch;</hi> and the Lumps of <hi>Lime</hi>
are first wet or Slack'd with Wine, then Pounded or
beat with <hi>Hogs-grease,</hi> and Juice of <hi>Figs,</hi> or with the
same and <hi>Pitch;</hi> that which hath <hi>Pitch</hi> in it, is blacker
and easily Distinguished from the other by its Colour,
and that which is Plastered with this <hi>Tarrace,</hi> is done
over with <hi>Linseed</hi> Oil.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Metalists</hi> use a kind of <hi>Tarrace</hi> in their Vessels for
fining of <hi>Mettals,</hi> that the melted Mettle run not out;
for as the Moderns restrain <hi>Water,</hi> and contain it, so
the Antients, this liquid Mettal, and 'tis compounded
or made of <hi>Quick-Lime</hi> and <hi>Ox Blood,</hi> the <hi>Lime</hi> being
beat to Powder and sifted, and then mixt with the
<hi>Blood</hi> and beat with a <hi>Beater.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But their <hi>Cement</hi> differs from both the <hi>Malthas</hi> in
Composition and use, for 'tis made of Dust or Powder
of <hi>Marble,</hi> and <hi>Glew</hi> made of <hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Ox</hi> Leather, and
with this they glew pieces of Marble or Stones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                        <p>In later times, two kinds of <hi>Cement</hi> are in use, in
both which they use the Powder of <hi>Marble,</hi> or other
<hi>Stone,</hi> to one is added the Whites of Eggs, to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is added <hi>Pitch;</hi> to these some add other things,
as the Gravers of <hi>Gems,</hi> they make it of <hi>Tile Dust</hi> and
<hi>Pitch.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another Material which <hi>Bricklayers</hi> use are <hi>Laths,</hi>
which are made of heart of <hi>Oak,</hi> for out side Work, as
<hi>Tiling</hi> and <hi>Plastering;</hi> and of <hi>Fir</hi> for inside <hi>Plastering</hi>
and <hi>Pantile Lathing;</hi> their usual lengths being 5 Foot,
and 4 Foot, and sometimes longer or shorter; their
Breadth sometimes 2 Inches, and one Inch and an half,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41812:164"/>
the thickness about 1/4 of an Inch or thicker: But for
<hi>Pantiling,</hi> the <hi>Laths,</hi> are about Ten Foot long, one
Inch and half Broad, and half an Inch or more thick.</p>
                        <p>Another Material is <hi>Nails,</hi> of which they use three
sorts, one is called <hi>Reparation</hi> or <hi>Lath Nails,</hi> which
are used for plain <hi>Tile Lathing,</hi> and outside and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<hi>Lathing</hi> for Plastring; another sort are four Penny,
and Six Penny Nails, used for <hi>Pantile Lathing;</hi> and
a third sort are great Nails for Scaffolding.</p>
                        <p>Moreover they use <hi>Tile-Pins,</hi> which are sometimes
made of <hi>Oak,</hi> and sometimes of <hi>Fir,</hi> which they drive
into holes that are made in the <hi>Plain Tiles</hi> to hang
them upon their <hi>Lathing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They also put <hi>Ox</hi> or <hi>Cow</hi> Hair into the <hi>Mortar</hi> which
they use for <hi>Plastering,</hi> being called <hi>Lime</hi> and <hi>Hair,</hi>
which Hair keeps the <hi>Mortar</hi> from Cracking or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and makes it hold or bind together.</p>
                        <p>And whereas they make use of the sharpest Sand
they can get (that being best) for <hi>Morter,</hi> to lay
<hi>Bricks</hi> and <hi>Tiles</hi> in; so they choose a fat <hi>Loamy</hi> or
Greasy Sand for Inside Plastering, by reason it sticks
together, and is not so subject to fall assunder when
they lay it on Seelings or Walls.</p>
                        <p>Having given you an account of the several Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
that are used in <hi>Bricklayers</hi> Work, we shall in the
next place Treat of their Tools and their uses, which
are as follows.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="topic">
                        <head>Tools used in Brick Work.</head>
                        <p>1. A <hi>Brick Trowel</hi> to take up the Morter with, and
to spread it on the <hi>Bricks,</hi> with which also
they cut the <hi>Bricks</hi> to such lengths as they have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and also stop the joints.</p>
                        <p>2. A <hi>Brick Ax,</hi> with which they cut <hi>Bricks</hi> to what
shape they please, as some for Arches both streight
and Circular, others for the mouldings of Architecture,
as Archytrave Friez and Cornice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41812:164"/>
3. A <hi>Sawe</hi> made of Tinn, to sawe the Bricks which
they cut.</p>
                        <p>4. A <hi>Rub-stone,</hi> which is round, and is about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Inches diameter, and sometimes more or less at
pleasure, on which they rub the Bricks which they cut
into several shapes, and also others which they cut not,
being call'd <hi>Rubbed Returns,</hi> and <hi>Rubbed Headers</hi> and
<hi>Stretchers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>Square,</hi> to try the bed of the Brick, <hi>(viz.</hi> that side
which lies in the Morter) with the superficies or face
of the Brick, to make the Brick square, or at Rect-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
one side with the other, which is done by rubing
it on the Rub-stone till it exactly answers, or fits to
the Square.</p>
                        <p>6. A <hi>Bevel,</hi> by which they cut the undersides of
the Bricks, of Arches streight or circular, to such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Angles as the Arches require, and also for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Uses.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi>A Small Trannel of Iron,</hi> or a large Nail ground'd
to a sharp point, with which they mark the Brick, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from a Square or Bevel, or a Mould made of thin
Wainscot, or Pastboard, to direct them in the cutting
thereof.</p>
                        <p>8. Some use a <hi>float Stone,</hi> with which they rub the
moulding of the Brick, after they have cut it with the
<hi>Ax,</hi> pretty near to the Pattern described on the Brick,
by the <hi>Trannel</hi> from the Wainscot, or Pastboard Mould,
that so they may make the Brick exactly to answer
to the Pattern or Mould. Others use no Stone at all,
but cut the Brick exactly to the Pattern with their
Brick-Ax, leaving the Ax stroaks to be seen on the
Brick, which, if they be streight and parallel one to
another, look very prettily, and is the truest way of
Working; but then they must take care, to Ax the
Brick off, with an Ax that is exactly streight on the
edge, that the moulding in the Brick be neither round
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41812:165"/>
nor hollow, from side to side of a Header, or from end
to end of a Stretcher.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi>A Little Ruler,</hi> about 12 Inches in length, and 1
Inch and 1/2 broad, which they lay on the Brick to draw
streight Lines by, with the <hi>Trannel</hi> or <hi>Nail.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. A <hi>Banker,</hi> to cut the Bricks upon, which is a
piece of Timber about six foot long, or more, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the number of those who are to work at it,
and 9 or 10 Inches square, which must be laid on two
Piers of Brick, or fixt on Bearers of Timber about three
foot high from the Floor, on which they stand to work.</p>
                        <p>11. They work up a Pier of Brick-work, about the
same height to lay their <hi>Rubbing-Stone</hi> upon, which
must be laid in Morter that it may lye fast.</p>
                        <p>12. A <hi>Grinding-Stone,</hi> to sharpen their Axes, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
Trowels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon.</p>
                        <p>13. A <hi>Pair of Line Pins of Iron,</hi> with a length of
Line on them about sixty feet in length, to lay each
Row, or Course of Bricks, level on the Bed, and streight
on the Surface by, a Line seldom holding to strein, or
draw streight in length, above 50 or 60 feet.</p>
                        <p>14. A <hi>Plumb Rule</hi> about 4 foot long, with a Line
and Plummet of Lead, to carry their Work upright, or
perpendicular withal.</p>
                        <p>15. A <hi>Level,</hi> about 10 or 12 foot long, to set out
their Foundations level, or parallel to the Horizon, and
also to try whether the Walls of the Building, or Jambs
of Chimneys, be carried level, as they raise the Work,
that so they may bring up all their Brick-work to an
exact horizontal height, at the laying on of ever floor
of Carpentry.</p>
                        <p>16. A <hi>Large Square,</hi> to set their Walls at rectangles,
which may also be done without a <hi>Square,</hi> by setting
6 foot from the angle one way, and 8 foot the other
way, then if the Diagonal line, or Hypotenuse, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
10 feet, the angle is a rectangle: If not, you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41812:165"/>
must set the Wall that is to be at rectangles to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
either this or that way, till the two measures of
6 and 8 feet answer exactly to 10 feet.</p>
                        <p>17. A <hi>Ten Foot</hi> and a <hi>Five Foot Rod,</hi> as also a <hi>Two
Foot Rule,</hi> to take and lay down Lengths, and Breadths,
and Heights.</p>
                        <p>18. A <hi>Jointing Rule,</hi> about 10 foot long, and about
4 Inches broad, whereby to run the long Joints of the
Brick-work.</p>
                        <p>19. A <hi>Jointer of Iron,</hi> with which, and the foresaid,
Rule, they joint the long <hi>Joints,</hi> and also the <hi>Cross
Joints,</hi> these being done with the <hi>Jointer</hi> without the
<hi>Rule.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>20. <hi>Compasses,</hi> to describe the several Mouldings on
Wainscot or Pastboard.</p>
                        <p>21. A <hi>Hammer,</hi> to cut Holes in Brick-work, and drive
Nails for Scarfolding.</p>
                        <p>22. A <hi>Rammer,</hi> to Ramm the Foundations.</p>
                        <p>23. A <hi>Crow of Iron,</hi> to dig through a Wall, and also
a <hi>Pick-Ax.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Shapes</hi> of the foresaid <hi>Tools,</hi> you may
see in <hi>Plate 1.</hi> and the Name of each <hi>Tool</hi> in the Page

                        <p>1. A <hi>Lathing Hammer,</hi> to nail on the Laths withal,
with two <hi>Gauge Stroaks</hi> (for Lathing for <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)</hi>
cut upon the handle of it, one at 7 Inches from
the head, and the other at 7 Inches and an half; some
indeed Lath at 8 Inches, but that is too wide, occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rainings in.</p>
                        <p>2. A <hi>Lathing Staff of Iron,</hi> in the form of a Cross, to
stay the cross Laths while they are nailed to the long
Laths, and also to clinch the Nails.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41812:166"/>
3. A <hi>Tyling Trowel,</hi> to take up the Morter and lay it
on the Tiles, it being longer and narrower than a <hi>Brick-Trowel,</hi>
altho' for a shift many times they use a <hi>Brick-Trowel</hi>
to Tyle withal, when they have not a <hi>Tyling-Trowel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. A <hi>Bosse,</hi> made of Wood, with an Iron Hook, to
hang on the Laths, or on a Ladder, in which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer
puts the Morter which the Tyler uses.</p>
                        <p>5. A <hi>Striker,</hi> which is only a piece of Lath about
10 Inches long, with which they strike, or cut off the
Morter at the britches of the Tiles.</p>
                        <p>6. A <hi>Broome,</hi> to sweep the Tyling after 'tis strooke.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="topic">
                        <head>Of the Names and Uses of Tools relating
to Plastering.</head>
                        <p>1. A <hi>Lathing Hammer,</hi> being the same as before in
Tyling, with which the Laths are nailed on
with its head, and with its Edge they cut them to any
length, and likewise cut off any part of a Quarter, or
Joyst, that sticks further out than the rest.</p>
                        <p>2. A <hi>Laying Trowel,</hi> to lay the Lime and Hair with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
upon the Laths, it being larger than a <hi>Brick Trowel,</hi>
and fastned to its handle in a different manner from the
<hi>Brick Trowel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. A <hi>Hawke,</hi> made of Wood about the bigness of a
square Trencher, with a handle to hold it by, whereon
the Lime and Hair being put, they take from it more
or less as they please.</p>
                        <p>4. A <hi>Setting Trowel,</hi> being less than the <hi>Laying
Trowel,</hi> with which they finish the Plastering when it
is almost dry, either by Trowelling and brishing it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with fair Water, or else by laying a thin Coat of
fine Stuff made of clean Lime, and mixt with Hair with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Sand, and setting it, that is to say, Trowelling
and brishing it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41812:166"/>
5. A small <hi>Pointing Trowel,</hi> to go into sharp Angles.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi>Brishes,</hi> of three sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ck Brish,</hi> a <hi>Round
Brish,</hi> and a <hi>Pencil.</hi> With these <hi>Brishes,</hi> they wet old
Walls before they mend them, and also brish over their
new Plastering when they set, or finish it, and moreover
white and size their Plastering with them. The <hi>Pencil,</hi>
or <hi>Drawing Tool,</hi> is used in blacking the bottoms, or
lower parts of Rooms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. <hi>Floats,</hi> made of Wood, with handles to them,
which they sometimes use to float Seelings or Walls
with, when they are minded to make their Plastering
very streight and even, these <hi>Floats</hi> being some larger,
and some lesser, than the <hi>Laying Trowels:</hi> Likewise
they use <hi>Floats</hi> made to fit to Mouldings, for the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishing
of several sorts of Mouldings with finishing Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to represent Stone, such as <hi>Cornices, Facias, Archy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traves,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The finishing Morter to represent Stone, should be
made of the strongest Lime, and the sharpest Sand you
can get, which Sand must be washed in a large Tub,
very well, till no Scum or Filth arise in the Water,
when you stir it about, which sometimes will require
to have clean Water 5 or 6 times, when the Sand is
somewhat foul; and it requires a greater Proportion
of Sand than the ordinary Morter, because it must be
extreamly beaten, which will break all the Knots of
<hi>Lime,</hi> and by that means it will require more Sand.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi>Streight Rules,</hi> of several lengths, to lay Quines
streight by, and also to try whether the Plastering be
laid true and streight, by applying the Rules to their
Work.</p>
                        <p>9. A <hi>Pale,</hi> to hold <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Whitewash,</hi> or <hi>White</hi> and
<hi>Size.</hi>

Having given you a Description of the several <hi>Tools</hi>

                        <head>And First of Foundations.</head>
                        <p>'TIS usual, and also very convenient, for any
person before he begins to Erect a Building, to
have Designs or Draughts drawn upon Paper or Vellum,
and also if it be a large Building, to have a Model of it
made in Wainscot; in which Designs and Model, the
Ground Plat or Ichnography of each Floor or Story,
is Delineated and represented: As also the fashion and
form of each Front, together with the Windows, Doors,
and Ornaments, if they intend any, to wit, <hi>Facias,
Rustick Quines, Architraves, Friezes</hi> and <hi>Cornices,</hi> are
to be shewn in the Draughts or Designs of the Uprights
or <hi>Orthographyes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If more Fronts than one be shewn <hi>Perspectively</hi> in
one Draught, then 'tis called <hi>Scenography,</hi> which is not
easily understood, except by those who understand the
Rules of <hi>Perspective.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore it will be more Intelligible to the several
Workmen, to have a Draught of each Front in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41812:168"/>
by it self, and also to have a Draught of the Ground-Plat
or <hi>Ichnography</hi> of every story, in a Paper by it self;
because many times the Conveniences, or Contrivances
in one Story, differs from those in another, either in
bigness of Chimneys, or division of the Rooms, some
being larger in one Story than another, and sometimes
having more Chimnies in one Story than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All which things being well considered, and drawn
on Papers, or a Model made thereof, before the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is begun, there will be no need of Alterations, or
Tearing and pulling the Building to pieces after it is
begun; for besides the hindrance of the Procedure of
the Work, it makes the Building lame and Deficient,
nothing being so well done, when 'tis put up, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
down, and set up again, as if it were well done at
first.</p>
                        <p>Besides it makes the Workmen uneasy, to see their
Work, in which they have taken a great deal of pains,
and used a great deal of Art, to be pull'd to pieces.</p>
                        <p>The drawing of Draughts is most commonly the
work of a Surveyor, although there be many Master
Workmen that will contrive a Building, and draw the
Designs thereof, as well, and as curiously, as most Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors:
Yea, some of them will do it better than
some Surveyors; especially those Workmen who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Theorick part of Building, as well as the
Practick.</p>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>And now Concerning the Foundations.</head>
                     <p>AFter the Cellars are dug, if there are to be any,
or, if none, after the Trenches are dug, in which
the Walls are to stand; the Master-Bricklayer,
or else his Foreman (which ought to be an ingenious
Workman) must in the first place try all the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in several places, with an Iron Croe, and Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
or, indeed, with a Borer (such as Well-diggers
use, to try what Ground they have to produce Water)
to see whether the <hi>Foundations</hi> are all sound, and fit to
bear the Weight which is to be set upon them. If he
find any part of the <hi>Foundations</hi> defective, he ought
to dig it deeper till he comes to firm ground; or if it
proves to be loose, or made Ground to a great depth,
then he must take care to make it good and sufficient
to carry its Weight by Art, which may be done seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ways.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> If the <hi>Foundation</hi> be not very loose, and insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
it may be made good, by ramming in great
Stones with a heavy Rammer, the Stones being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
close together, and about a foot wider on each
side of the Trench than the width of the Wall is to be;
because all Walls ought to have a Basis, or footing, at
least 4 Inches on a side broader than the thickness of
the Wall; which Stones being well rammed, and the
Basis being 8 Inches more in breadth than the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41812:169"/>
of the Wall, and this 8 Inches being set off, about
one Inch, or one Inch and an half at a time on both
sides (that so the middle of the Wall may stand on
the middle of the Basis) may make the Foundation
good, and able to bear its Burden.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Foundation</hi> be somewhat worse than as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
then he must get good pieces of Oak, whose
length must be the breadth of the Trench, or about
two foot longer than the breadth of the Wall, which
must be laid cross the <hi>Foundation</hi> about two foot asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and being well rammed down, lay long Planks
upon them, which planking need not be the length
of the cross pieces, but only 4 Inches of a side wider
than the Basis, or footing of the Wall is to be, and
pin'd or spiked down to the pieces of Oak on which
they lye.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Foundations</hi> be so bad that this will not
do, then he must provide good Piles made of Heart of
Oak, of such a length as will reach good ground, whose
Diameter must be about 1/12 part of their length, which
must be drove or forced down with a Commander, or
an Engin for that purpose, and then lay long Planks
upon them, and spike or pinn the Planks to them,
and the closer together that these Piles are drove the
better it will be.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, if the <hi>Foundation</hi> be faulty but in here
and there a place, and there be good Ground in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of it, you may turn Arches over those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
places, which will discharge and take off the
weight from the loose places.</p>
                     <p>And when you make these Arches to shun the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of the Earth, and to save the charge of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
they must be made of Bricks and Morter that
are very good, and be well wrought, that they do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
settle, nor give way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41812:169"/>
You may observe for the greater strength of these
Arches, or Discharges, to make them higher than a
Semicircle, or half round, if the Work will admit of
it, and to make the same, of Portions of Arches: As
in <hi>Plate 3. Fig. 4.</hi> you may see, they are described
from an Equilateral Triangle; that is to say, supposing
the breadth of the Arch between the Piers to be <hi>A B;</hi>
with this width, and from the points <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B,</hi> make
the two Portions of the Arches <hi>A C</hi> and <hi>B C;</hi> this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
so high, adds great strength to the Arches to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
or carry the Weight which they are to bear.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Architect <hi>Leon Baptista Albert</hi> advises,
when the Earth on which we would make Pillars or
Piers is of equal resistance, that is to say, not good,
to turn Arches inversed, or upside down, and says, by
this means one Pillar shall bear no more weight than
another, when the Earth that is underneath is not so
strong, or that it bears more than another part; which
he doth thus.</p>
                     <p>Having wrought up the Pillars, or Piers, as high as
is necessary from the <hi>Foundation,</hi> make from these Piers
inverse Arches, as <hi>A B C</hi> in <hi>Plate 3. Fig. 5.</hi> whose
Joints tend to the Center <hi>D.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this construction he pretends for Example, that
if the Pier <hi>F</hi> hath a worse <hi>Foundation,</hi> or hath a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Weight, that is to say, is more charged than the
other Piers, this charge, or weight, will be stopped, or
stayed by the Inverse Arches <hi>A B C, I H K,</hi> because
the Earth which is under these Arches keeps the Piers
in the same height, that is to say, that they shall not
sink.</p>
                     <p>But he must also suppose that this Earth is as firm
as that of the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Piers, or at least it
must be made so.</p>
                     <p>The Ingenious Surveyor Mr. <hi>Hooke,</hi> now living at
the Writing hereof, made use of this Artifice, as I am
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41812:170"/>
informed, in building the Lord <hi>Montague</hi>'s brave house
in <hi>Bloomsberry,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and where
he was then Surveyor.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Foundations</hi> being all made firm, and levelled,
the Master-Bricklayer, or his Foreman, must take care
to see all the <hi>Foundations</hi> set truly out, according to
the design of the Ground-Plat, or Cellar-floor, and that
all his Walls be made of the same thickness as they
are in the Design; which is very difficult to do, to
wit, to take the true thickness of the Walls from a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
that is drawn to a small Scale, because the breadth
of the Points of the Compasses will vary somewhat;
therefore 'tis advisable for him that draws the Draught,
to set the Dimensions in Figures to each Wall, Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Window, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then the Workman cannot so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
make a Mistake.</p>
                     <p>And because the well-working and bonding of Brick-Walls
conduces very much to their strength, I will
here add some necessary Rules to be observed in the
laying of Bricks, to make the Walls strong and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                     <p>1. That the Morter be made of well burnt good
Lime, and sharp Sand, and that it have a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sand, that is to say, if it be very sharp, a Load
of Land, being about 36 Bushels, is sufficient for an
Hundred of Lime, being 25 Bushels, or an hundred
Pecks, (for I imagine that the word <hi>Hundred of Lime</hi>
is used, because it contains an hundred Pecks, and that
in old Time they used to sell it by the Peck, but now
by the Bushel,) to wit, to one Bushel of Quick Lime,
a Bushel and half of Sand.</p>
                     <p>But if the Sand be not very sharp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then you may
put a greater quantity of Sand, for Morter which hath
its due proportion of Sand, is stronger than that which
hath less Sand in it, altho' some think otherwise.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41812:170"/>
                        <hi>2dly,</hi> When you slack the Lime, take care to wet
it every where a little, but do not over-wet it, and
cover with Sand every laying, or bed of Lime, being
about a Bushel at a time as you slack it up, that so
the Steam, or Spirit of the Lime, may be kept in, and
not flee away, but mix it self with the Sand, which
will make the Morter much stronger, than if you slack
all your Lime first, and throw on your Sand altogether
at last, as some use to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>3dly,</hi> That you beat all your Morter with a Beater
three or four times over before you use it, for there
by you break all the Knots of Lime that go through
the Sieve, and incorporate the Sand and Lime well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and the Air which the Beater forces into the
Morter at every stroak, conduces very much to the
strength thereof.</p>
                     <p>If I might advise any one that is minded to build
well, or use strong Morter for Repairs, I would have
them beat the Morter well, and let it lie 2 or 3 Days,
and then beat it well again when 'tis to be used.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>4thly,</hi> If you lay bricks in hot dry Wheather, and
it be some small piece of Work that you would have
very strong, dip every Brick you lay, all over in a Pale
of Water, which will make the Wall much stronger
than if the Bricks were laid dry: The reason why I
mention a small piece of Work is, because 'tis a great
deal of trouble to wet them for much Work, or a whole
Building, and besides it makes the Workmen's Fingers
sore; to prevent which, they may throw Pales of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on the Wall after the Bricks are lay'd, as was done
at the Building of <hi>Physicians College</hi> in <hi>Warwick Lane,</hi>
by Order of the Surveyor, which was the aforesaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Mr. <hi>Hooke.</hi> If I mistake not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>5thly,</hi> Cover all your Walls in the Summer-time to
keep them from drying too hastily, for the Morter doth
not Cement so strongly to the Bricks when it dries ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily,
as when slowly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:41812:171"/>
                        <hi>6thly,</hi> Be sure to cover them very well in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-time,
to preserve them from Rain, Snow and Frost,
which last is a great Enemy to all kinds of Morter,
especially to that which hath taken wet just before
the Frost.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>7thly,</hi> In working up the Walls of a Building, do
not work any Wall above 3 foot high before you work
up the next adjoining Wall, that so you may join them
together, and make good Bond in the work: For 'tis
an ill Custom among some <hi>Bricklayers,</hi> to carry, or
work up a whole Story of the Party-walls, before
they work up the Fronts, or other Work adjoining,
that should be bonded or work'd up together with
them, which occasions Cracks and Settlings in the
Walls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>8thly,</hi> Take care that you do not lay Joint on Joint,
in the middle of the Walls as seldom as may be, but
make bond there as well as on the outsides; for I
have seen some, who in Working of a Brick and half
Wall, have laid the Header on one side of the Wall,
upright upon the Header on the other side of the Wall,
and so all along through the whole course, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
necessarily follows from the inconsiderate setting
up of the Quine at a Toothing; for 'tis common to
Tooth in the stretching course 2 Inches with the Stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
only, and the Header on the other side, to be set
upright upon the Header on this side, which causes
the Headers to lye Joint in Joint in the middle of the
Wall, as in <hi>Plate 3. Fig. 1.</hi> you may see.</p>
                     <p>Whereas if the Header of one side of the Wall, toothed
as much as the Stretcher on the other side, it would
be a stronger Toothing, and the Joints of the Headers
of one side, would be in the middle of the Headers of
the course they lye upon of the other side, as in <hi>Plate
3. Fig. 2.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41812:171"/>
All that can be said for this ill Custom of working,
is this, that the Header will not well hang 2 Inches
over the Bricks underneath it; I grant it will not, but
then it may be made, by having a piece of Fir, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Wood of the thickness of a Course of Bricks,
and two Inches broad, and lay it on the last Toothing
Course to bear it; or a Bat, put upon the last toothing,
will bear it till the next <hi>Quine</hi> is set upon it, and then
the Bat may be taken away:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>9thly,</hi> The same Inconveniency happens at an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<hi>Quine</hi> in a Brick and half Wall, where 'tis
usual to lay a Closier next the Header on both sides
of the Wall, and in so doing 'tis Joint in Joint all the
length of the Wall, except by chance a three quartern
Bat happen to be laid.</p>
                     <p>To prevent which Inconveniency, and to make the
Wall much stronger, lay a Closure on one side, and
none on the other side; but lay a three quarter Bat at
the Quine in the stretching course, and in the Heading
course adjoin an Header next to the Header at the Quine,
as you may see it done in Plate 3, <hi>Fig. 1</hi> and 2.</p>
                     <p>Where A and B in both Figures or Diagrams, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
a Brick and half Wall, having an upright Quine
at A, and a Toothing at B, and the Prick Lines repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
the Course of Bricks lay'd upon the other course:
So in <hi>Fig. 1.</hi> the black Lines next you are an heading
course, and the Prick-Lines next you, shew a Stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
course: And on the further side from you, the
black Lines shew a stretching course, and the Prick-Lines
an Heading course.</p>
                     <p>In which <hi>Fig. 1.</hi> is shewn the usual way of bad Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

wrought, to be made firm and strong.</p>
                     <p>Also in Working a two Brick Wall, I would advise
in the Stretching courses, wherein you lay stretching
on both sides the Wall next the Line, so also to lay
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41812:172"/>
stretching in the middle of the Wall, and Closiers next
to each stretching Course that lies next the Line, as in
<hi>Fig. 3.</hi> of <hi>Plate 3.</hi> you may see.</p>
                     <p>Where the Diagram or Fig. A B, signifies a two Brick
Wall; A being an upright Quine, and B the Toothing,
in which, the Black lines represent the stretching course,
and the Prickt Lines the Heading course, that lies upon
the stretching course: In a two Brick Wall if you lay
a closier next the upright Quine on both sides of the
Wall, it makes good Bond.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And,</hi> Be it further Enacted, That all Houses of the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Also,</hi> the same Act enjoins, that no Timber be laid
within 12 Inches of the foreside of the Chimny Jambs;
And that all Joysts on the back of any Chimny be
laid with a Trimmer, at 6 Inches distant from the
back: <hi>Also,</hi> That no Timber be laid within the Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel

as Torsels for Mantle-Trees to lye on, or Lintols over
Windows, or Templets under Girders, or any other
Timbers, lay them in Loam, which is a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
of Timber, for Morter eats and corrodes the
Timber: Likewise the Joyst ends, and Girders which
lye in the Walls, must be Loamed all over, to preserve
them from the corroding of the Morter. Some Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
pitch the ends of the Timber that lye in the
Walls to preserve them from the Morter.</p>

would make it to project more, then you must Cement
pieces to the ends of your bricks for tailing, or to make

I did Intend here to have added something about the
Arching of Vaults, but intending, God willing, to Treat
largely of the Description of all manner of Arches, and
making of Moulds, or Patterns, to cut them by, when
I come to exercise in <hi>Masonry,</hi> which will succeed this:
I shall therefore omit speaking of Vaults in this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.</p>
                     <p>I shall now in the next place shew how to describe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ellipsis Arch in Brick; and make the Moulds, as
also to describe streight Arches, and make the Moulds
for the same.</p>

                     <p>These <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> or <hi>Semi-Oval</hi> Arches, being neatly

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41812:177"/>
made over Gate-ways, and also over Kitchin-Chimnies,
instead of Mantle-trees.</p>
                     <p>We will suppose an Ellipsis Arch to be made over a
Chimny, whose Diameter between the Jambs is 8 feet,
and the under side of the Arch at the Key to rise in
height 18 Inches from the level of the place, whence
you begin to spring the Arch; the height or depth of
the Arch we will suppose to be made of the length of
two Bricks, which when they are cut to the sweep of
the Arch, will not contain above 14 Inches, and perhaps
you must Cement pieces to many of the Courses in
the Hanse to make them long enough to contain, or
hold 14 Inches, especially if you intend to make the
Courses of the Hanse, and the Courses of the Scheam to
seem alike in greatness, on the under side of the Arch:
For if you make the Hanse to come to a true Sommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Scheam, by that time that you have ended
the Hanse, and are ready to set the first Courses of the
Sheam: The Mould, and so likewise each Course in the
Hanse, will be much less at the lower part, or under side
of the Arch, than the Mould, or Courses of the Scheam,
as you may perceive by the Hanse B K, in the 3d. <hi>Fig.</hi>
which way of working these kind of Arches is stronger,
than to make the Courses seem alike in bigness in Hanse
and Scheam, altho' it be not so pleasing to the eye. In
the <hi>3. Fig.</hi> I will shew how to make one half of the
Arch this way, and in the other half shew how to make
the Courses in Hanse and Scheam of a bigness.</p>
                     <p>First, Describe the under side of the Arch, <hi>(viz.</hi> the
Ellipsis A D B, whose Diameter A B is 8 feet, and the
height C D 18 Inches) upon some smooth Floor, or
streight plaistered Wall, or such like; then continue
<hi>(viz</hi> draw longer) both the lines A B, C D, cutting
each other at right Angles, then from A to E, also from
B to F, likewise from D to G, set 14 Inches, the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41812:177"/>
height of your Arch. Then describe another Ellip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
to that length and height, after this manner; lay a
streight Ruler on the centre by I, and on the joining of
the Hanse, and the Scheam together, as at K, and draw
the line K L, then set one Point of your Compasses in
the centre of the Hanse at M, and open the other Point
of the Compasses to F, and describe the upper Hanse
F L, likewise setting one Point of the Compasses in the
centre by I, with the other extended to G, describe the
Scheam G L, (although I speak here of Compasses,
yet when you describe an Arch to its full bigness, you
must make use of centre Lines or Rules; the last are
best, because Lines are subject to stretch) then taking
between your Compasses the thickness of a Brick, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
some small matter which will be rub'd off from both
beds of the Brick; with the Compasses at this distance
divide the upper Hanse from L to F into equal parts,
and if they happen not to divide it into equal parts, then
open them a small matter wider, or Shut them a small
matter closer, till it doth divide it into equal parts, and
look how many equal parts you divide the upper Hanse
into, so many equal parts you must divide the lower
Hanse from K to B into likewise (or you may divide
the upper Hanse from the centre O, making a right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
from each sommering Line to the Ellipsis, as is shewn
in describing the streight Arches following; and from
the centre O, and the Divisions in the upper Hanse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus divided, you may draw the streight Lines to
the lower Hanse, and not divide it with the Compasses)
through each of which divisions with a Rule, and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
draw streight lines, then get a piece of thin Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scot,
and make it to fit between two of these Lines, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
what thickness for Morter you intend, this will
be the Sommering Mould for the Hanse; then divide
the upper Scheam likewise, with the Compasses at the
same distance into equal parts, and laying a Ruler on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41812:178"/>
the centre I, from each Division in the Scheam G L,
draw streight Lines to the lower Scheam D K, then make
another Sommering Mould to fit between two of these
Lines, abating so much as you intend the thickness of
your Joints of Morter to be, which if you set very
close Morters, the breadth of the Line will be enough
to allow; then laying the Inner edge of a Bevil
streigth on the line K L, bring the Tongue to touch
the under side of the first Course of the Scheam, then
take up the Bevil, and set that Bevil line upon the Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
Mould of the Scheam; which Bevil line serves
for each Course in the Scheam; but you must take the
Bevil of each Course in the Hanse, and set them upon
your Sommering Mould by themselves, and Number
them with 1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because each Course varies.</p>
                     <p>Thus having made your Sommering Moulds, in the
next place you must make the Moulds for the length
of your Stretchers, and for the breadth of the Headers
and the Closiers; a piece of Wainscot 7 Inches long, and
3 Inches and an half broad will serve for the length of
the Stretchers, and the breadth of the Headers, the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers
will be 1 Inch and 3/4 broad. So the Closier will be
half the breadth of the Header, and the Header half
the length of the Stretcher, which will look well.</p>
                     <p>It remains now to speak something to the other
part of the Arch, to wit, A D, whose Courses both in
<hi>Hanse</hi> and <hi>Scheam,</hi> run alike upon the <hi>Ellipsis</hi> Lines,
and seem of one bigness, although perhaps there may
be some small matter of difference, by reason I have
not divided the Courses to this Figure, from a right
Angle, but every Course from the Angle, which it
makes with the <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> which I chose rather to do,
that so the <hi>Bevil</hi> of one Course, might not seem to run
more upon the <hi>Ellipsis</hi> than the <hi>Bevil</hi> of another, and
the difference of the thicknesses being so inconsiderate,
is not discerned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:41812:178"/>
Having described both the <hi>Ellipsis</hi> lines A D, E G,
divide each of them into a like number of equal parts,
always remembring to make each Division on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Ellipsis</hi> line, no greater than the thickness of the
Brick will contain, when it is wrought; then through
each Division in both the <hi>Ellipses</hi> draw streight lines;
continuing them 4 or 5 Inches above the upper <hi>Ellipsis</hi>
Line, and as much below the Lower <hi>Ellipsis</hi> Line; then
having provided some thin Sheets of fine <hi>Pastboard</hi> about
20 Inches square, cutting one edge streight, take one
sheet and lay the streight edge even upon the line A E,
so that it may cover both the Ellipsis lines, and being
cut to advantage, it may cover 8 courses (or 9 of the
streight Lines) having laid it thus upon the figure of
the Arch, stick a Pin, or two, through it, to keep it in
its place; then lay a Ruler upon the Past-board true to
the 7, 8, or 9th. streight Line of the Arch, according
as the Past-board is in bigness to cover them, and take
a sharp Pen-knife, laying the Ruler upon the Past-board
true to the streight line (whose ends being continued
longer than the Arch is deep, as I directed before, will
be seen beyond the Past-board) and cut the Past-board
true to the Line, then take another sheet, and join to it,
and cut it as you did the first, so continue till you have
covered the Arch from AE, just to the line DG, stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pins in each Sheet to keep them in the places where
you lay them: Then describe both the Ellipsis lines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Pastboard, from the same Centres and Radii that
you described the Ellipsis's under the Past-board, and
either divide the Ellipsis lines with the Compasses on
the Past-board, or else draw lines upon the Past-board
from or by the streight lines underneath them whose
ends you see; but the surer way is to divide the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsis's
on the Past-board, and draw Lines through those
Divisions, as you did beneath the Past-board; then set
7 Inches, being the length of each Stretcher, from A
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41812:179"/>
towards E, and from D towards G, and describe from
the former Centres, the Ellipsis <hi>o o</hi> through each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
course on the Past-board, as you may see in the
<hi>Fig.</hi> also set three Inches and an half, being the breadth
of the Header, from A towards E, and likewise from D
towards G: Also set the same 3 Inches and an half
from E towards A, and from G towards D, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
these two Ellipsis lines from the same Centres
through each Course, which the Ellipsis line of the
Stretchers miss'd; likewise draw in the same Courses,
two other Ellipsis lines, one Inch and 3/4 from each of
those two Lines you drew last, which is the breadth
of the Closiers; thus one Course of the Arch will be
divided into two Stretchers, and the next to it into three
Headers and two Closiers through the whole Arch; this
being done, cut the Past-board according to the lines
into several Courses, and each other Course into two
Stretchers, and the Heading-courses into three Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and two Closiers, exactly according to the Sweep
of the balcklead lines, and mark each Course with Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
marking the first Course of the Hanse with 1, the
next with 2, the third with 3, and so continue till you
have marked all the Courses to the Key, or middle, for
every Course differs; you were best to mark the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Closier in each Course with a Cipher on the left hand
of its own number, that you may know it readily from
the upper Closier, and make no mistakes when you
come to set them; also the middle Headers in each
Course should be marked besides its own number;
the thickness of the upper Header being easily discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the lower Header needs no marking besides
its own number; the cross Joints, and likewise the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
side and upper side of each Course must be cut cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
as the Past-boards which are your Moulds direct
you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:41812:179"/>
If you will add a Keystone, and Chaptrels to the
Arch, as in the <hi>Figure;</hi> let the breadth of the upper part
of the Keystone be the height of the Arch, viz. 14 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and Sommer, from the centre at I, then make
your Chaptrels the same thickness that your lower part
of the Keystone is, and let the Keystone break without
the Arch, so much as you project or Sale over the
Jaums with the Chaptrels.</p>
                     <p>Other kind of <hi>Circular Arches,</hi> as half Rounds and
Scheams, being described from one Centre, are so plain
and easy, that I need say nothing concerning them: But
since <hi>Streight Arches</hi> are much used, and many Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
know not the true way of describing them, I shall
write something briefly concerning them. <hi>Streight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
are used generally over Windows and Doors, and
according to the breadth of the Piers between the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
so ought the Skew-back or Sommering of the
Arch to be; for if the Piers be of a good breadth, as 3
or 4 Bricks in length, then the <hi>Streight Arch</hi> may be
described (as its vulgarly said) from the <hi>Oxi,</hi> which
being but part of a Word, is taken from the word <hi>Oxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonium,</hi>
signifying an Equilateral Triangle, with three
sharp Angles; but if the Piers are small, as sometimes
they are but the length of two Bricks, and sometimes
but one Brick and an half, then the breadth of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
or more, may be set down upon the middle Line
for the Centre, which will give a less Skew-back,
or Sommering, than the Centre from an <hi>Oxi.</hi> I will shew
how to describe them both ways, and first from the
<hi>Oxi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppose a <hi>Streight Arch,</hi> one Brick and an half in
height, to be made over a Window, 4 feet in width. [See
<hi>Fig. 4.]</hi> wherein one half of the Arch is described from
the <hi>Oxi,</hi> and the other half from the width of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
let the width of the Window be A B, taking the
width between the Compasses, from A and B as two
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41812:180"/>
Centres, describe the two Arches, intersecting each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at P, (though I speak here of Compasses, yet
when you describe the Arch to its full bigness, you
must use a Ruler, or a Line, scarce any Compasses
being to be got large enough.) Then draw another
Line above the line A B, as the line CD, being paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to it, at such a height as you intend your Arch to
be, as in this <hi>Fig.</hi> at 12 Inches; but most commonly
these sort of Arches are but 11 Inches in the height, or
thereabouts, which answers to 4 Courses of Bricks, but
you may make them more or less in height according
as occasion requires; then laying a Ruler on the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
P, and on the end of the line A, draw the line A C,
which is vulgarly called the <hi>Skew-back</hi> for the Arch.</p>
                     <p>The next thing to be done, is to divide those two
lines A B and C D into so many Courses as the Arch
will contain; the thickness of a Brick being one of them,
which some do by dividing the upper line into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
equal parts, and from those parts, and from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
P, draw the Sommering Lines or Courses; others
divide both the upper and lower line into so many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
parts, and make no use of a Centre, but draw
the Courses by a Ruler, being laid from the Divisions
on the upper line, to the Divisions on the lower line,
both which ways are false and erroneous; [but this by
way of caution.]</p>
                     <p>Having drawn the <hi>Skew-back</hi> A C, take between your
Compasses the thickness that a Brick will contain,
which I suppose to be two Inches when it is rub'd, and
setting one Point of the Compasses on the line C D, So
that when you turn the other Point about, it may just
touch the line A C in one place, and there make a Prick
in the line C D, but do not draw the Sommering lines
until you have gone over half the Arch, to see how you
come to the Key, or middle; and if you happen to
come just to the middle line, or want an Inch of it, then
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41812:180"/>
you may draw the lines, but if not, then you must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
or shut the Compasses a little till you do.</p>
                     <p>Then keeping one end of the Rule close to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
at P. (the surest way is to strike a small Nail in
the Center P, and keep the Rule close to the Nail) lay the
other end of the Rule close to the Prick that you made
on the line C D, keeping the Compasses at the same
width (viz. 2. Inches) set one Point of the Compasses
on the line C D, as before, so that the other Point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turned about, may just pass by the Rule; and as
it were touch it in one place, (you must remove the
Point of the Compasses upon the line C D, farther or
nearer to the Rule, until it just touch the Rule in one
place,) and so continue with the Rule and Compasses,
until you come to the middle line, and if it happen, that
your last space want an Inch of the middle, then the
middle of the Key-course will be the middle of the
Arch, and the number of the Courses in the whose Arch
will be odd, but if the last space happen to fall just up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the middle line E F, as it doth in the <hi>Fig.</hi> then the
Joint is the middle of the Arch, (but if it should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
neither to come even to the line, nor want an Inch
of it, then you must open or shut the Compasses a small
matter, and begin again till it doth come right) and the
number of the Courses in the whole Arch, is an even
Number.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> When the number of all the Courses in the
Arch, is an even Number, then you must begin the two
sides contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> A Header to be the lower Brick of
the first Course on one side (or half) of the Arch, and
a Stretcher the lower Brick of the first Course on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
side (or half) of the Arch: And contrariwise, if it
happen that the Number of the Courses be an odd Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as 25 or 27, or such like, then the first Courses of
each half of the Arch, must be alike, that is, either both
Headers, or both Stretchers, at the botom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41812:181"/>
Thus having described the Arch, the next thing to
be done, is to make the Sommering Mould, which to
do, get a piece of thin Wainscot (being streight on one
edge, and having one side Plained smooth, to set the
Bevil strokes upon) about 14 Inches long, and any
breadth above two Inches, then laying your Ruler, one
end at the Centre P, and the other end even in the Skew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
line, clap the streight edge of the Wainscot close to
the Rule, so that the lower end of the Wainscot may
lye a little below the line A B, then take away the Center
Rule, but stir not the Wainscot; and laying a Ruler up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Wainscot just over the line C D, strike a line up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Wainscot, then set one Point of the Compasses
being at the width of a Course, <hi>(viz.</hi> 2 Inches) upon
that line, so that the other Point being turned about,
may just touch the streight edge of the Wainscot; (as
you did before in dividing the Courses) then make a
Prick on the line on the Wainscot, and laying your
Centre Rule upon it, and on the Centre P, draw a line
upon the Wainscot by the Ruler, with a Pencil, or the
Point of a Compass, and cut the Wainscot to that line,
and make it streight by shooting it with a Plain, then
your Wainscot will fit exactly between any two lines
of the Arch; you may let it want the thickness of one
of the lines, or some small matter more, which is enough
for the thickness of a Mortar; the length of your Stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
in this Arch, may be 8 Inches and 1/4, and the Header
3 Inches and 3/4, but if your Arch be but 11 Inches in
height, then make your Stretcher 7 Inches and 1/2 long,
and the Header 3 Inches 1/2; one piece of Wainscot will
serve both for the length of the Stretcher, and the length
of the Header, making it like a long square or Oblong,
whose sides are 8 Inches 1/4, and 3 Inches and 3/4. Then
take a Bevil, and laying the inner edge of it streight with
the line A B, and the Angle of the Bevil just over the
Angle at A, take off the Angle that the Skew-back line
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41812:181"/>
A C makes with the line A B, and set it upon the
smoothed side of your Sommering Mould, for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
stroke of your first Course; then drawing your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
towards E, streight in the line, until the Angle of the
Bevil be just over the Angle, that the second Sommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
line makes with the line A B; when it is so, draw
the Tongue of the Bevil to lye even upon the second
Sommering line; (In brief, cause the Bevil to lye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
on the line A B, and on the second Sommering
line) then take up your Bevil and lay it on the Mould;
and strike that Bevil line on the Mould, with the Point
of the Compasses, about half a quartar of an Inch
distant from the first, and that is the Bevil of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the second Course; proceed thus until you come
to the middle line E F, but after you have set 3 Bevil
lines upon your Sommering Mould, leave about 1/4 of
an Inch between the third and the fourth, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
between the 6th and 7th, and the 9th, and 10th,
which will be a great help to you, in knowing the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of each line on the Mould.</p>
                     <p>The Moulds for the other half of the Arch, namely
E B, are made after the same manner, but the Arch is
described from a Centre beneath P, as Q which causeth
a less Skew-back <hi>(viz.</hi> B D.)</p>
                     <p>The diminishing of the Sommering Mould to any
Skew-back may be found by the Rule of Three by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a foot into 10 equal parts, and each of these into 10
parts, so that the whole foot may contain 100 parts,
then proceed thus. The upper line C F, will be 309,
that is 3 Feet and almost one Inch, and the lower line
A E will be 252, that is 2 Feet and an half an 2/100, and
the upper part of the Sommering Mould will be 17 al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
that is, two Inches of such whereof there are 12
in a foot line measure; having these three Numbers
(viz. 309, 252, 17) work according to the Rule of
Three, and you will find 13 and 6/7 of 100 parts, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41812:182"/>
is almost 14 (such parts whereof there are 100 in a
Foot line measure) for the breadth of the lower part
of the Mould.</p>

the Angle G C H in <hi>[Fig. 5.]</hi> then take the upper line
C F, and set it from C. to F; also take the lower line
A E, and set it from C to E, and draw the line E F; then
take the thickness of your Brick, which suppose to be
2 Inches, and set it from F to G, and draw G H, paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to F E, I say F G is the breadth of the upper part
of the Sommering Mould, and E H the breadth of the
lower part: Then make your Sommering, Mould, true
to those two lines, and beginning in the middle line
F E, describe the streight lines by the Mould from the
Key F E, until you come to the Skew-back A C, and

                  <head>I shall concude this Exercise with the Art of making two
sorts of Cements, for the Cementing Bricks.</head>
                  <p>THere are two sorts of Cement, which some Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers
use in Cementing of Bricks for some kind of
Mouldings, or in Cementing a block of Bricks, as
they call it, for the Carving of Scroles or Capitals or such
like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One is called Cold Cement, the other is called
hot Cement, because the former is made and used without
Fire, but the latter is both made and used with Fire; the cold
Cement being accounted a Secret, is known but to few
Bricklayers, but the hot Cement is common.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>To make the cold Cement.</head>
                     <p>TAke 1/2 a Pound of Old Cheshire-Cheese, pair of the
Rine, and throw it away, cut or grate the Cheese
very small, and put it into a Pot, put to it about a Pint of
Cows-Milk, let it stand all Night, the next Morning get
the Whites of 12 or 14 Eggs, then take 1/2 a Pound of the
best Unslackt or Quick Lime that you can get, and beat it
to Powder in a Morter, then Sift it through a fine Hair
Sieve into a Tray or Bole of Wood, or into an Earthen
Dish, to which put the Cheese and Milk, and stir them
well together with a Trowel, or such like thing, breaking
the Knots of Cheese, if there be any, then add the Whites of
the Eggs, and Temper all well together, and so use it; this
Cement will be of a white Colour, but if you would have
it of the Colour of the Brick, put into it either some very
fine Brick-Dust, or Almegram, not too much, but only just
to colour it.</p>

                     <head>To make the hot Cement.</head>
                     <p>TAke One Pound of Rozin, one Quarter of a Pound
of Bees-Wax, half an Ounce of fine Brick-Dust, half
an Ounce of Chalk-Dust, or Powder of Chalk, Sift both
the Brick-Dust and Chalk-Dust through a fine Hair Sieve,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41812:183"/>
(you may beat the Brick and the Chalk in a Morter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you Sift it) boil altogether in a Pipkin, or other Vessel,
about a quarter of an hour, stirring it all the while with an
Iron or a piece of Lath or such like, then take it of, and
let it stand 4 or 5 Minutes, and 'tis fit for use.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> That the Bricks that are to be Cemented with this
kind of Cement, must be made hot by the Fire before you
spread the Cement on them, and then rub them to and froe
on one another, as Joiners do, when they Glew two Boards
together.</p>
