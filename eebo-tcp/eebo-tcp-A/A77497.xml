            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>So that (whatever ſenſe be put upon that place of the Prophet <hi>Malachy)</hi> yet this cannot be the ſenſe of the Apoſtle in this place, where he ſpeaketh of a holineſſe that was peculiar to <hi>beleevers,</hi> not common to <hi>Infidels</hi> as well as them.

            <p>
               <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is a <hi>paſsive ordinance,</hi> wherein the perſon baptized is a meer patient.

The reaſon he giveth for it, is, becauſe Chriſtians have a more <hi>excellent Circumciſion</hi> then that of <hi>Moſes.</hi> That you have, <hi>v.</hi> 11. proved and made good by three Arguments. 1. From the <hi>Author</hi> of their Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Not <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was but a ſervant, nor any other man, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe. <hi>[In</hi> (or <hi>by) whom ye are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed: [By the circumciſion of Chriſt.]</hi> 2. From the <hi>kind</hi> of it. It was not an <hi>outward,</hi> but an <hi>inward</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; a <hi>circumciſion not made with hands,</hi> as that <hi>Moſaicall</hi> circumciſion was; but <hi>made without hands,</hi> viz. the <hi>circumciſion of the heart,</hi> of the inward man by the ſpirit of Chriſt. 3. From the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>effect</hi> of it, which is far different from that <hi>Legall</hi> circumciſion. There was only the cutting off of one ſmall part of the body, the <hi>foreskin of the fleſh:</hi> but here is a cutting or putting off the whole <hi>body of ſin: [In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the circumciſion of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why but the <hi>Iewes</hi> here might object: This Reaſon is of no force; that becauſe Chriſtians were <hi>ſpiritually</hi> circumciſed, therefore they ſhould not need the <hi>outward</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:113192:32"/>
circumciſion: For ſo was <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet he received the outward circumciſion; He had the <hi>inward grace,</hi> and yet he received the <hi>outward ſigne.</hi> And thus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, though they be made partakers of this great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by Chriſt, yet they may ſtand in need of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>ſeale</hi> to aſſure them of their partaking herein.</p>
               <p>To this the Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>v.</hi> 12. ſhewing that Chriſt hath not left his people under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſtitute of ſuch an outward <hi>ſigne</hi> and <hi>ſeale:</hi> For hoever Circumciſion be taken away, yet there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Sacrament ſubſtituted and appointed in the room and place of it, a more excellent and <hi>lively Sacrament</hi> then ever Circumciſion was, a Sacrament reſembling it, and anſwering to it, viz. <hi>Baptiſme. [Buried with him in Baptiſme]</hi> viz. Sacramentally, Baptiſme being a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Regeneration,</hi> ſignifying and ſealing up both our <hi>mortification,</hi> and <hi>vivification.

They were <hi>confederates</hi> with God: God had taken them into Covenant, and therefore hee would have the ſeale of his Covenant ſet upon them. So much may be clearly collected (as from divers other paſſages in this Chapter, ſo) from the 10. 13. &amp; 14. verſes, where Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is ſtill called by the name of the Covenant: <hi>[My Covenant ſhall be in your fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

they are not; nor yet ſo <hi>demonſtrative</hi> and <hi>convincing,</hi> but that the Adverſary may take up ſome cavills againſt them.
