         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

However ſeeing my publike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

Advocate</hi> hath almoſt
been as long in the breeding, and
birth, as Infants uſe to lye in
their Mothers womb; ſo many
moneths hath paſt betwixt the
promiſe and performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
But let none grudge the
time if it appear at laſt in its

                     <hi>perfect ſhape,</hi> coming forth

                  <p>Some perchance will take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
at the plainneſs thereof
which by me was purpoſely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

which may be learned from the

only do underſtand, but in a
tongue whereby all the <hi>people

And ſeeing the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

I conceived it my duty to decline
all difficult words and phraſes,

perfectly perceive the truth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                  <p>Some perchance might expect
a confutation of their practice

ſuch repetition of Baptiſm will

to be accepted for his hearty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions

                  <p>Indeed <hi>great is the multitude of

this cauſe, and truly the more
the better, ſuch the worth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to deſerve, the weight thereof

the fierceneſſe and multitude of

me leave to bemoan a ſad acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the <hi>councel</hi> cannot agree
amongſt themſelves how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
their <hi>clients</hi> cauſe. Some
found it on a Jewiſh ceremony of
waſhing; others faſten it only on
the ancient practice of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church; others graft it on
the Analogie of Circumciſion;
<pb facs="tcp:114646:10"/>
others bottom it on an implicite
precept; others on expreſſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the New Teſtament.
And which is the worſe, many of
theſe are not content alone to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and advance their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
except alſo they decry,
and deſtroy, confute, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the arguments of others, by
which diſcords, our adverſaries
in this point gain to themſelves
no ſmall advantage.</p>
                  <p>I am confident thoſe our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
long ſince had wanted wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
had not our friends furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with all manner of muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
out of our own magazins.
Yet dare I not challenge ſuch
pleaders for Infants Baptiſm of
<hi>diſloyaltie,</hi> as if they wilfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
their truſt herein; though
<pb facs="tcp:114646:11"/>
I cannot excuſe them for <hi>indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

                  <p>It would be well therefore for

If a ſtrict enquiry ſhould be made

                  </p>
                  <p>Others are offended at ſuch Cruelty
therein exerciſed on a ſmall Infant, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably

                  <p>It is anſwered, that was cruelty indeed

Call not Circumciſion Cruelty, but
what indeed it was, Mercy, Pity, and

                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, we are bound to believe that
God doubled the guard of his providence,
to preſerve ſuch infants as were ordered

the Devils Martyrs; ſeeing God never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
it at their hands. But if any infant
miſcarried under <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> (the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents

a divine ordinance and injunction; the

                  <p>Come we now to conſider on whom
<hi>Circumciſion</hi> was to be adminiſtred. Theſe

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Before we come to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
anſwer hereof, be it premiſed, that
had God created at the firſt two diſtinct,
and abſolute, (as to the mutual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
each on other) principles of mans
being, the one <hi>male,</hi> the other <hi>female;</hi>
and had they both, wilfully forfeited
their integrity, then ſome neceſſity might
have been pretended that to <hi>Re-covenant</hi>
them both, both <hi>Sexes</hi> ſhould have been
ſigned with <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> But Divine
providence otherwiſe ordered the matter,
only making man at the firſt, and woman
of the man.</p>
                  <p>This laid down, we anſwer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114646:15"/>
though women were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
they were vertually <hi>circumciſed</hi> in
the <hi>males.</hi> What is done to the head none
will deny done to the body; The <hi>man</hi>
therefore being the <hi>head of the woman,</hi>
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. ſuch females as died in their
<hi>virginity</hi> were circumciſed in their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi>
ſuch as ſurvived to be <hi>married</hi> were
<hi>circumciſed</hi> in their <hi>husbands;</hi> Their nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
relation (<hi>one fleſh</hi>) ſwallowing up that,
which was more remote in their Father.
And thus all, though not directly, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
<hi>Circumciſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It follows, <hi>by whom it was adminiſtred;</hi>
this generally was the <hi>maſter of the family,
Abraham Circumciſed Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 21. 4.
As for <hi>Zipporahs</hi> Circumciſing her ſons,
<hi>Exod,</hi> 4. 25. in a caſe of extremity, and
her huſbands indiſpoſition, it was an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
act, not to be drawn into prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but to be recounted amongſt thoſe,
which when performed are valid, but
ought not to be performed.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to the time, <hi>When;
eighth day</hi> Here I will not ſearch with
ſome for a ſecret ſanctity in the Number

of <hi>Perfection,</hi> with the Addition of
<hi>one,</hi> that is Intireneſſe) leſt our Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reap what Gods wiſdom never ſowed
therein. The plain reaſon is this. Before
the <hi>eighth day,</hi> a child was not conceived
to be <hi>conſolidated fleſh,</hi> but till then in the
bloud of the mother. And for the ſame
cauſe, <hi>when a bullock, ſheep, or goat was
brought forth,</hi> Levit. 22. 27. <hi>Then it ſhall
be ſeven dayes under the dam, and from the
eighth day and thenceforth, it ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted

                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What became of the ſouls of
ſuch <hi>infants,</hi> who died before the eighth
day, and ſo wanted <hi>Circumciſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They wanted not <hi>Circumciſion.</hi>
For want is the abſence of that which
ought to be had; now there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of, (becauſe no command for)
their <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> before that time; God
the <hi>Grand Law-giver,</hi> though <hi>tying</hi> others,
is not <hi>tyed</hi> himſelf to his <hi>Law:</hi> But can,
and no doubt did, give ſpiritual <hi>grace</hi> to
many <hi>infants,</hi> (chiefly if children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving

                     <hi>Parents</hi>) dying in their <hi>non-age,</hi>

day that the child died:</hi> That is, <hi>ſeventh
day à nativitate,</hi> from the birth thereof,
as <hi>Tremelius</hi> expoundeth it; the more
probably becauſe no mention is made of
any <hi>name</hi> impoſed upon it. This child,
beſides the natural ſtain of original corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
had alſo the perſonal blemiſh of

(beſide that ſundry people, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

Circumciſion was principally ordained,
(not to be a badge of diſtinction, but) a
Seal of the conſecration of the Jews unto
God. More probable therefore it is,
that becauſe the Jews during that fourty
years were alwayes (though not actually

which is renewed; eſpecially if what was
but dark and obſcure before, hath the old

edition thereof, <hi>John</hi> 13. 34. <hi>A new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
I give unto you, that ye love one

was from the beginning, <hi>John</hi> 2. 5. though

then before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. It is improbable that this
covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> at Circumciſion,
ſhould be, a <hi>Grace-Goſpel-new-Covenant,</hi>
becauſe God four hundred years after,
(namely <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>) gave
the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114646:21"/>
Jews the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now
Gods mercy obſerveth a progreſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it doth, not (with the Sun on <hi>Ahaz</hi> his
<hi>Dial</hi>) go backwards; but with the maſter
of the feaſt, <hi>John</hi> 2. 10. <hi>He keepeth the beſt
wine unto the laſt:</hi> They therefore in a
manner <hi>degrade</hi> Gods goodneſſe, ſet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde,
who make his covenant with
<hi>Abraham</hi> a new-covenant of Grace, when
He gave an old covenant of Works ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years after it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are much miſtaken who
account the Law given to the Jews, a meer
<hi>Covenant of works,</hi> though indeed there
was very much of <hi>workiſh-neſs</hi> mingled
therewith. The <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>new covenant</hi>
at the giving of the <hi>Law,</hi> is <hi>dreſſed,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
in old <hi>clothes;</hi> many <hi>old forms</hi> are
uſed therein, alluding to the covenant of
Works made with <hi>Adam.</hi> Yea, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Jews (partly through their own
Ignorance, partly thorow their Rabbins,
and Phariſees falſe gloſſes thereon) mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook
it for a direct, down-right covenant
of works, reſting in the <hi>Rinde,</hi> or outward
<hi>Bark</hi> thereof, and depending on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114646:22"/>
of it for their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But let not this Covenant be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
for the moſt, but the beſt part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
let it be expounded, (not as the blind
Jews miſinterpreted it, but) as God
graciouſly intended, and the good Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
and Prophets wiſely accepted it, for
a <hi>covenant of grace,</hi> wherein Meſſiah
(though obſcurely) was tendered to ſuch,
who could not perform what the rigour
of the Law required. There is one
word in the ſecond Commandment, which
demonſtrateth this <hi>Law,</hi> to have <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi>
in the bowels thereof, namely the
word Mercy, <hi>Exod</hi> 20. 6. <hi>ſhewing Mercy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thouſands of them that love me and keep
my commandments.</hi> Now Mercy is a <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boleth</hi>
which a covenant of works can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pronounce, as utterly deſtructive to
the very nature thereof, and <hi>keeping com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>
there muſt be taken, for ſuch
as deſire and endeavour to <hi>keep them,</hi>
though falling ſhort of legal exactneſſe</p>
                  <p>But we leave the farther proſecution
of this point to thoſe learned Divines, who
have written juſt Treatiſes thereof; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it more proper for our preſent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114646:22"/>
purpoſe, to prove this covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
a new-Goſpel-covenant; and
the ſerious peruſal of one verſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7.
will afford us three arguments for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
thereof.</p>
                  <p>And I will eſtabliſh my covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and thee, and thy ſeed after
thee, in their generations, for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
covenant, to be a God unto thee,
and to thy ſeed after thee.</p>
                  <p>Hence we collect it a Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>From
<list>
                        <item>1. The language, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it.</item>
                        <item>2. The continuance, and
duration of it.</item>
                        <item>3. The bleſſings, and benefits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
by it.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the language, and expreſſion, <hi>the
voice is the voice of</hi> Jacob. <hi>The ſpeech agreeth
thereunto</hi> (not to betray it as it did <hi>Peter</hi>
to his ſhame, and ſorrow, but) to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this covenant to its honour, and our
comfort, to be an Evangelical Covenant.
That very phraſe, <hi>to be a God unto thee,</hi> is
a Goſpel-phraſe. Otherwiſe, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114646:23"/>
he, who upon the breach of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works, was left our enemy, our
inraged judge, to be a God unto us? I ſee
here <hi>Matthew</hi> in <hi>Moſes,</hi> the New couched
in the Old Teſtament. Parallel is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>And they ſhall call his
name</hi> Emanuel, <hi>which (being interpreted)
is God with us. God with us, and to be a
God unto us,</hi> differ ſomething in ſound,
nothing in ſence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>for the continuance and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it.</hi> An <hi>Everlaſting Covenant,</hi> that
with <hi>Adam</hi> was but a <hi>ſhort-laſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
Some conceive <hi>Adam</hi> never <hi>naturally</hi>
ſlept in his Innocency, (accounting that
<hi>cauſed deep ſleep, Gen.</hi> 2. 21. before <hi>Eve</hi>
her creation, ſupernatural) but forfeited
his Innocency before night. As there be
ſome kind of <hi>inſects,</hi> (called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>)
which, Naturaliſts ſay, ſurvive but a day;
ſo ſome conceive <hi>Adams</hi> integrity of no
longer duration And, though we dare
not certainly cloſe with their opinion (the
Scripture not acquainting us with the date
of <hi>Adams</hi> perſeverance in paradiſe) we
may be confident, that covenant of works
was of no long continuance before it was
broken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:114646:23"/>
This ſhort-liv'd covenant thus expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it was never reviv'd again on the ſame
conditions, but utterly extinguiſhed. Yea,
herein God magnified his mercy, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any termes he would treat with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
whom he might have condemned as
incapable of any future contract, for once
breaking of Covenant. Yet now he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up a ſecond agreement with them,
being a <hi>covenant</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> and that <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
ſuch his goodneſſe, that, though we
(if ſtrictly examined) break it with him,
he will not break it with us. I confeſſe
<hi>everlaſting</hi> in Scripture is ſometimes taken
for <hi>long-laſting</hi> (in which ſenſe the Hebrew
tongue accepteth of an <hi>ever</hi> after an <hi>ever</hi>)
but here it is taken truly for eternity, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>whom God loveth he loveth to the end,</hi>
without end.</p>
                  <p>The third argument to prove the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
nature of Gods covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
is drawn from the bleſſings, and
benefits conveyed thereby; whoſe ſize
and meaſure is ſo great, they are only of
a Goſpel proportion, <hi>to be a God unto thee.</hi>
Could leſſe be ſaid then this, ſo ſhort the
words? yet could more be ſaid then this,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114646:24"/>
ſo large the matter? All things herein are
comprized, a promiſe to give repentance,
faith, hope, and charity; patience in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
preſervation from, or in them,
competency of outward maintenance, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance
unto the end; in a word, grace,
and holineſſe here, glory and happineſſe
hereafter. How tedious are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our age (a ſpan of ground being
ſcarcely paſſed under a ſpan of parchment)
in compariſon of the conciſe Grants of our
ancient Kings, ſome of whoſe Charters
contain not ſo many words, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
Manours therein. Yet even thoſe
Patents are prolix, if compared with
Gods Covenant in my text, <hi>to be a God
unto thee,</hi> promiſing therein more, then
what man can aſk, or deſire. God hath
ſet us a pattern, <hi>therefore let thy words be
few,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 2. not to be <hi>babling</hi> to him,
in our <hi>prayers,</hi> ſeeing he is ſo plain, and
pithy to us in his <hi>promiſes,</hi> couching all
things in ſo ſhort an expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>To put all out of doubt, this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Circcumciſion made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and his ſeed, appears to be a Goſpel
Covenant, becauſe S <hi>Paul</hi> ſo expoundeth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114646:24"/>
it. If any ſcruple ariſe about the ſence of
a Law, to whom ſhould people repair for
ſatisfaction, but to the makers thereof, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.
Thus on the emergency of doubts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the nature of this Covenant, we may
and muſt have recourſe unto the Author
thereof. Now the ſame ſpirit, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
<hi>Geneſis</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> indited the Epiſtle
to the <hi>Romans</hi> by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. that <hi>Abraham recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the ſign of Circumciſion, the ſeal of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It is ſtrange to conceive how
in that age there could be a Covenant of
faith, the word faith appearing proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but once, <hi>Habac.</hi> 2. 4. in all the old
Teſtament, (and once afterwards with
a negation before it in reference to the
Jews) <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 20. <hi>Children, in whom is
no faith:</hi> Seeing therefore ſuch ſilence of
<hi>faith</hi> in the Old Teſtament, (ſo frequently
reſounded in the New) this Covenant
with <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeemeth ſuſpicious, to be
an old Covenant of Works, and to have

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>word Faith</hi> only, not the
<hi>thing</hi> ſignified thereby is wanting in the
old Teſtament. What Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
call <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>believing,</hi> that the
Prophets and pen-men of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
expreſſe by <hi>Truſting.</hi> The Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

briefly drawn up by <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 22. 4.
<hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee, they truſted and
thou didſt deliver them; they cried unto thee,
and were delivered, they truſted in thee and
were not confounded.</hi> I will not ſay the
Triplication of the word <hi>Truſt,</hi> denotes
their belief in the Trinity, Father, Son,
and holy Spirit; but here it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
they had their confidence in, and
dependence on God; (though then not

who account the Jews a meer huſk, ſhell,
and ſhadow of Gods people; as if all the
promiſes made unto them, meerly termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in temporal happineſſes. Thus they
feed the Jews bodies with <hi>milk,</hi> and fill
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114646:25"/>
their bellies with <hi>hony</hi> (even to a ſurfeit)
flowing from the fruitfulneſſe of the land
of <hi>Canaan;</hi> whileſt in the mean time they
ſtarve and famiſh their ſouls, excluding
them as incapable of heavenly, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>Their uncharitable errour is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on this argument; becauſe when their
bleſſings are reckoned up, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 3. it
extendeth only to the <hi>city, field, fruit of
their bodie, ground, cattle, kine, ſheep, &amp;c.</hi>
but no mention of their eternal beatitude
hereafter in heaven. Yea, when <hi>Iſaac</hi>
cordially bleſſed <hi>Jacob,</hi> deſiring no doubt
to make the ſame as compleat, as he could
beſtow, and <hi>Jacob</hi> receive, his expreſſions,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 28. amount no higher then to <hi>the
dew of heaven, the fatneſs of the earth, and
plenty of corn and wine.</hi> On the other ſide,
when the Jews curſes are ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 16. they are confined
to <hi>city, field, basket ſtore, fruit of the body,
land, kine, ſheep, &amp;c.</hi> Here a deep ſilence
of hell, and damnation, ſo that the ſmiles
or frowns of God to the Jews, ſeem to
reach no farther then to their well or ill

                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:114646:26"/>
To this it is anſwered, firſt in general;
by the ſame argument one may conclude,
that under the Goſpel no temporal, or
outward happineſſe is promiſed to thoſe
that fear, and ſerve God,; becauſe no <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes</hi>
thereof (deſcending to the like par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities
as in <hi>the old</hi>) are found in all
the <hi>new Teſtament.</hi> I meet but with one
in that nature (tendering an exact <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
of earthly wealth) namely, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.
30. And the ſame hath bitterneſſe as well
as ſweetneſſe therein; ſave that the cloſe
thereof maketh recompence for all the
reſt. <hi>But he ſhal receive an hundred fold now
in this time, houſes, and brethren, and ſiſters
and mothers, and children, and lands with
perſecution, and in the world to come eternal
life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To come cloſer to their argument.
Though generally temporal bleſſings are
only expreſſed in the Old Teſtament, yet
in and under them, is ſpiritual happineſſe
contained. Thus when in the fifth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
<hi>long life in the land which God
ſhall give them,</hi> is promiſed to dutiful
children, eternity in heaven is included;
and ſo did the judicious amongſt the Jews
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114646:26"/>
alwayes accept, and expound the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Moſt true therefore is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe
of the life that now is, and of that which is to
come.</hi> But where hath it the promiſe of
this life? Chiefly in the old Teſtament,
where temporal good is largely, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
ſpiritual, briefly, and dimly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
Where hath it the promiſe of
the life to come? Principally in the new
Teſtament, where ſpiritual bleſſings are
fairly and fully; temporal, ſhortly, and
ſlenderly preſented. Stock thy ſelf with
the one out of the Law, with the other
out of the Goſpel, with both out of the
Bible.</p>
                  <p>So much for the Covenant made as
inherent in <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſon; come we
now to conſider it as hereditary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
on his poſterity. I could name
the Caſtle, and rich Manour in <hi>England,</hi>
which was ſetled by Patent from Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> on one of her Courtiers. But,
when the Grant came to be examined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
King <hi>James,</hi> thoſe operative words,
<hi>to him and his heirs,</hi> were found omitted
in that emphatical place of the Patent,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114646:27"/>
where the eſtate therein ſhould have been
effectually conveyed. Whereupon the
Grant was interpreted meerly perſonal,
and forfeited to the Crown on the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the foreſaid Courtier.</p>
                  <p>God maketh ſure work in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Circumciſion. To prevent all
miſcarriages, and to intail the ſame on
<hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity, how often doth he
inſert, and repeat <hi>him and his ſeed,</hi> Gen.
17? twice in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, once in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
verſe, once in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, again, in the
12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>and thy ſeed after thee.</hi> If in
after-ages a wicked ſon chance to deſcend
from-<hi>Abraham,</hi> and the ſame prove a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
unthrift, yet God hath put it paſt
his power to alienate the ſpiritual inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Covenant from his children,
they ſhall not ſuffer for their fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault;
the ſame being made over to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
and his ſeed;</hi> and now we come to
ſhow what perſons are included within
the compaſſe of that relation.</p>

Seed of Abraham in Scripture.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THe ſeed of Abraham</hi> as it occurs often
in Scripture, ſo ſeverall are the ſences
thereof, and all of them worthy of our
eſpecial notice: But before and above all
other Acceptions, know firſt it is taken
eminently and tranſcendently for Jeſus
Chriſt, in whom all Nations ſhould be
bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>Even this ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
<hi>Luke</hi> 2. 21. Meerly out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
that Chriſt might ſhew himſelf
<hi>born under the Law,</hi> as ſent not to <hi>deſtroy,</hi>
but <hi>fulfil it.</hi> Indeed thoſe few drops of
bloud, preſumed ſhed by our Saviour at
his Circumciſion, might both in their
own Preciouſneſſe, and Gods Apprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, have been ſatisfactory for
the ſins of al mankind. But a <hi>Teſtament</hi> was
intended, by Divine Providence; and
that could not be made without the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatours
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114646:28"/>
Death, and therefore the very
heart Bloud of Chriſt, on the Croſſe, was
adjudged neceſſary for mans ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>So much for <hi>Abrahams</hi> extraordinary,
come we to his ordinary ſeed. This ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was <hi>immediately,</hi> or <hi>mediately</hi> begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by him. We find eight ſons of the
firſt ſort, namely, <hi>Iſmael</hi> begotten of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
Iſaac</hi> of <hi>Sarah,</hi> and ſix more, (ſee
their names, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 2.) of <hi>Keturah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> How cometh it then to paſſe
that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 4. 22. ſaith,
<hi>Abraham</hi> had two ſons, the one by a <hi>Bond-maid,</hi>
the other by a <hi>Free-woman,</hi> omitting
all the reſt, as if no ſuch perſons in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe two are mentioned <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,</hi>
but not <hi>excluſively</hi> of others. I
will not ſay, becauſe <hi>Keturah</hi> (though
ſometimes called the wife) is elſewhere,
1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 1. 32. ſtiled but <hi>Abrahams concubine;</hi>
therefore his <hi>Iſſue</hi> by her is left out by the
<hi>Apostle;</hi> but becauſe (though there was
<hi>Hiſtory</hi> of more, yet) there was <hi>Myſterie</hi>
but in theſe two ſons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114646:28"/>
two Mothers repreſented the two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Had <hi>Abraham</hi> afterwards begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
an hundred ſons, they <hi>all</hi> had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to the making of <hi>one Teſtament,</hi>
(but were all reducible to one of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Teſtaments, compleated in <hi>Iſmael,</hi>
and <hi>Iſaac.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Iſmael,</hi>

                     <hi>Luther</hi> is

his charitable opinion on that expreſſion,
becauſe it is ſaid of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 17. After
death that <hi>he was gathered to his Fathers.</hi>
A phraſe in the ſame chapter ſpoken of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and not applied in Scripture
to wicked men; though it is ſaid of <hi>Ahab,</hi>
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 40. (which amounts to the ſame
effect) that he <hi>ſlept with his Fathers.</hi> I will
interpoſe nothing to the contrary, but had

had it been ſaid of him that he

                  <p>
                     <hi>Abrahams</hi> immediate ſeed were either
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114646:29"/>
ſuch as were begotten, by him,</p>
                  <p>1. In his life, or</p>
                  <p>2. After his death.</p>
                  <p>Of the former were <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
both of them, being 15. years old, whileſt
<hi>Abraham</hi> was yet ſurviving, as may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
by the following Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Abraham</hi> was an <hi>hundred</hi> years <hi>old</hi>
when <hi>Iſaac</hi> was <hi>born,</hi> Gen. 21. 5.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was <hi>fourty</hi> years old, when
he took <hi>Rebeccah</hi> to <hi>wife,</hi> Gen. 25. 20.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was <hi>threeſcore</hi> years old, when
<hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were born, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 26.</p>
                  <p>4. All which years caſt up together,
amount to an hundred and threeſcore
years.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he died, was
an hundred threeſcore and fifteen years
old;</p>
                  <p>6. Ergo, <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were fifteen
years old before <hi>Abrahams</hi> death; an Age
capable of Inſtruction. Therefore when
God ſaith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18. 19. <hi>I know
that he will command his children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to
keep the way of the Lord. Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
his <hi>Grand-children</hi> were literally intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114646:29"/>
The latter, no doubt, being as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to learn, as his Grand-father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was able and induſtrious to inſtruct
him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed mediately begotten
from him after his death, were either</p>
                  <p>1. Literally and ſpiritually, as the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving

                  </p>
                  <p>2. Literally, and not ſpiritually, as the
<hi>unbelieving Jews,</hi> of whoſe <hi>foederal
right,</hi> largely in the next chapter.</p>
                  <p>3. Spiritually, and not literally, as
<hi>Proſelytes,</hi> and believing Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> or <hi>Advenae,</hi> were <hi>Aliens</hi> by
extraction, and <hi>Jewes</hi> by profeſſion;
and theſe again were either the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Proſelytes,</hi> or their ſucceſſours in all
Ages.</p>
                  <p>By Primitive Proſelytes I underſtand,
thoſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family when <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion</hi>
was firſt inſtituted therein. Theſe
I may call the <hi>Founders</hi> of that <hi>Order,</hi> and
the firſt ſtock wherewith that <hi>Society</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the <hi>ſucceeding Proſelytes,</hi> we
may take notice of two moſt memorable

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114646:30"/>
The one, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and Gods miraculous hand made
many <hi>Converts</hi> to their Religion; when
beſides the <hi>ſix hundred thouſand Iſraelites,</hi>
and <hi>their children,</hi> Exod. 12. 38. <hi>and a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
multitude,</hi> went up alſo with them, and
although this mixed multitude, Numb. 11.
4. <hi>afterwards fell a luſting,</hi> infecting alſo the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> therewith; and probably many
of them then periſhed; yet certainly a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Repreſentation of Pious proſelytes
ſtil continued in the congregation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other remarkable Addition of
Proſelytes was <hi>Joſhua</hi> 9. 27. When the
<hi>Gibeonites</hi> were condemned by <hi>Joſhua</hi> to
the ſervile work of the <hi>Temple, hewing of
wood,</hi> and <hi>drawing of water;</hi> Whereby no

of the true God; and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>Nethinims,</hi> people given over
to <hi>divine ſervice.</hi> Yea, what an eſtimate
God ſet upon them, plainly appears, by
his careful counting them, after their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the <hi>Captivity</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Ezra
2. 43. (with the children of <hi>Solomons ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>)

Additions of <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> there was
ſcarce any Country confining on <hi>Canaan,</hi>
(as ſome, a good way diſtanced thence)
but now and then did drop in a <hi>Proſelyte</hi>
into the congregation of <hi>Iſrael; Rahab,</hi>
the <hi>Hittite, Ruth,</hi> the <hi>Moabite, Naaman,</hi> the
<hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> &amp;c. And, (to ſhow God ſtands
as little on the difference of <hi>colours</hi> as <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries)
Ebed-Melech</hi> the <hi>Black-more,</hi> the
<hi>Treaſurer</hi> of the Queen <hi>Candace</hi> the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed theſe Proſelytes amongſt the
Jews, were divided into two ſorts; ſome
<hi>Proſelytes of the gates,</hi> admitted only into
civil ſociety, and cohabitation with them:
others call'd <hi>Proſelytes of Juſtice,</hi> who did
profeſſe, and undertake all the Law, and
theſe only we account the <hi>ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, believing Chriſtians are the
ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and are ſo
generally reputed in the Scripture.
Theſe to be true born on both ſides, muſt
have,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Sarah</hi> to their Mother.</p>
                  <p>When we ſee a child like unto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114646:31"/>
we uſe to ſay of him, <hi>Thy father will
never be dead whileſt thou art alive:</hi> ſo
<hi>Abraham</hi> ſurviveth, and <hi>Sarah</hi> is ſtill alive
in thoſe, which <hi>John</hi> 8. 39. <hi>do the works of
Abraham.</hi> What theſe <hi>works</hi> are, muſt
be collected out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> life, who
was, faithful to God, loving to his wife,
tender to his children, equal to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
kind to his nephew, courteous to
his neighbours the children of <hi>Heth,</hi> juſt in
his bargains, valiant to his enemies; in a
word, worthy in all his relations. <hi>Sarah</hi>
likewiſe is exemplary for her duty to her
husband and other feminine vertues, and
all thoſe are <hi>her daughters,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 6.
which imitate the ſame.</p>
                  <p>I need not be longer in ſo plain and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
a point; that believing Gentiles are
Spiritually <hi>Abrahams Seed,</hi> ſo frequently
inculcated by the Apoſtle in his Epiſtles to
the Romans and Galatians, who were as
meer Gentiles as we Engliſh-men are.
Come we now to ſhow, how far the Seed

Herein the Apoſtle intendeth not onely
the elect Jewes, but the diffuſive body
of that Nation. Yea, in this preſent point,
with heavineſſe of heart, he ſadly ſingleth
out ſuch Apoſtate Jewes, for whom verſe
3. he deſired in exchange to be accurſed,
and yet even to thoſe did this ſurvey of
priviledges belong.</p>
                  <p>This is farther cleared by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of the ſame Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
2, 3, 4. affirming that all the Fathers were
<hi>baptized into Moſes, all ate and drank of
the ſame ſpiritual meat, and drink,</hi> yet
adding afterward, that <hi>with many of them
God was not well pleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is evidenced by thoſe frequent
phraſes in Scripture, wherein the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
Jewes are threatned to be <hi>cut off
from his people,</hi> and <hi>from Gods preſence.
Levit.</hi> 22. 3. Such could not be <hi>cut off</hi>
from ſpirituall holineſſe, or happineſſe,
wherein they were never truly planted,
and whereof never really poſſeſſed, but
onely from being outward members of
that Church, which intitled them to a
true right of the aforementioned prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:114646:33"/>
Indeed one reaſon, which makes many
men loth to entertain this truth, to allow a
foederall right to the worſt of the Jewes,
is a ſuſpition, that the holding hereof will
betray them to the dangerous opinion of
<hi>falling off from grace,</hi> if that ſuch who
once were actually eſtated in ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-right,
ſhould afterwards make a
finall defection from the ſame. Now, as
I cannot blame them to be <hi>jealous with
a godly jealouſie,</hi> and to decline what is
introductory of ſo comfortleſs an errour,
as maintaining the <hi>apoſtaſie of Saints:</hi> ſo
I muſt condemn their over caution here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<hi>to fear where no fear is.</hi> For, this foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derall
right which the wicked Jewes had,
never ſtamped upon them any character
of ſaving grace, but was onely a <hi>right
of capacity,</hi> putting them into an actuall
poſſeſſion of the means, and a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſalvation it ſelf, if not fruſtrated
thereof by their own wilfull default.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe now there ſhould happen a
Conteſt betwixt the worſt of Jewes, and
the beſt of Heathens, about their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
condition, ſhould the Pagan bee ſo
preſumptuous as to affirm himſelf equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114646:33"/>
advantaged to a capability of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
with the Jew, the other might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confute his impudent bragging therein,
alledging that his extraction intailed on
him, a right to Circumciſion, with the
Covenant therein, and all the promiſes
thereto belonging.</p>
                  <p>All will allow a reall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
an Uſurper, and a Tyrant (though
both be bad) the former, invading what
is none of his own, the latter abuſing
what is truely his. Now, ſhould a Pagan,
<hi>quà Pagan,</hi> pretend to the Covenant of
Circumciſion, he were guilty of notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
uſurpation; whereas the wicked Jew
too often tyrannically abuſed that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
having a right unto it, but making
no right uſe of it. And, although ſome
civil Pagans did outſtrip many impious
Jewes in Morall performances, the Jews
might thank their own lazineſſe, falling
ſo far ſhort of the <hi>Mark,</hi> having ſuch
advantage at the <hi>ſtarting,</hi> as a true right,
and title to all Gods Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>foederall right</hi> therefore muſt not
be denied to the worſt of men, within the
Pale of the <hi>Church,</hi> leſt the godly receive

                  </p>

                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:114646:35"/>
In anſwer hereunto, firſt in generall;
It is enough to ſatisfie a ſober ſoul, and
content a modeſt minde herein, that God
hath appointed ſuch children at eight
dayes old to be Covenanters, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<hi>nomine poenae</hi> in caſe the ſame be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
That God, who never calls any to
any employment, but ever inables them
for the ſame, at leaſtwiſe with ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of ſufficiencie which he is pleaſed to
accept. Such as queſtion the truth hereof,
do tacitly, and interpretatively, charge
God with want of wiſdome in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
Let them whiſper no longer,
but plainly ſpeak out, that He lacks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
to manage his matters, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40. 13.
<hi>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord,
or being his counſeller, hath taught him?</hi>
The proud objecters might well give him
their adviſe, hereafter to chooſe wiſer
parties with whom to make a Covenant,
then children of eight dayes old.</p>
                  <p>What Charter hath this whole World
to ſhew for its being, other then Gods
bare <hi>fiat, Let it be. I have bleſſed him,</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Iſaac</hi> of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 27. 33.) <hi>yea, and
bee ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> God hath made eight-dayes-old-children
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114646:36"/>
Covenanters, and they
ſhall be Covenanters.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, to come to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
I conceive the ſoul of an Infant
may fitly be compared to the cloud which
went before the Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 20.
dark on the one ſide, but light on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
thereof. That part of the Infants
ſoul expoſed to humane eyes, is dark and
obſcure, no abilities at all diſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
therein; whileſt the bright ſide of
Infants ſouls is objected to Gods eye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
in them what wee cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                  <p>No wonder if men be <hi>non-pluſt</hi> about
the actions of Infants ſouls, when every
Infant is an heap of riddles caſt together,
whereof the leaſt and loweſt is too great,
and high for man to underſtand. <hi>David</hi>
ingenuouſly confeſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 6. that he
was <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made.</hi> The
faſhioning of the members of his body
being ſo ſtrange a work in nature, that
the <hi>knowledge thereof was too wonderfull
for him, and ſo high that he could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto it.</hi> If he was poſed with the
caſk, the caſe, and the ſhell, the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114646:36"/>
ſtructure of a babes body, let it not
ſeem ſtrange to us to be puzled with the
operations of an Infants ſoul, how the
ſame is able to covenant with God.</p>
                  <p>It paſſeth the ſkill of the greateſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
to clear and evidence the entrance
of Originall ſinne into an Infants ſoul:
Whoſe ſpirit, coming immediatly from
God, muſt needs be pure, and perfect
like the maker thereof. Nor can this
ſoul, thus pure in it ſelf, be infected from
the body, which being but a liveleſſe lump
of fleſh is incapable of ſin, eſpecially ſo
as to make an active impreſſion on the
ſoul. Soul, and bodie of Infants, thus
being ſeverally ſinleſſe, who can conceive
that the union of two clean things, can
produce one unclean? I mean, originall
corruption. Yet we all ſee by wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that Infants from their concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are infected therewith: That it is there
we know, but how it came thither, God
knowes.</p>
                  <p>If we cannot perceive the manner of
ſins poiſon, no wonder if we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the method of graces antidote in
Infants ſouls. Let us allow heaven to be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114646:37"/>
as incomprehenſibly miraculous in heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as hell hath been inſenſibly ſubtile in
hurting the ſame. And, ſeeing God hath
expreſſed thus much, that Infants are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by him to be Covenanters, let us with
humility, and modeſty beleeve them, to
be enabled with a proportion of grace, to
diſcharge their covenant in relation,
though it tranſcend our capacity to clear
all doubts, and difficulties, which may be
multiplied about the manner thereof.</p>
                  <p>In further clearing this Objection, know,
that beſides ſuch graces which wee are
bound to beleeve in Infants hearts, they
have three things elſe which aſſiſt them in
this Covenant.</p>
                  <p>1. Their Parents faith tendring them
to God.</p>
                  <p>2. Gods goodneſſe accepting the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>3. Their own actuall performance of
the Covenant, if living to years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, their Parents faith in tendering
them. Appliable to this purpoſe is that
expreſſion recorded by three of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts,
<hi>brought in a bed by four,</hi> who
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114646:37"/>
finding no door in the ſide (ſuch the preſſe
of people) made one in the roof of the
houſe, and let him down by cords into
the room where our Saviour was. <hi>Jeſus
ſeeing their faith,</hi> Matth. 9. 2. <hi>When Jeſus
ſaw their faith,</hi> Mark 2. 5. <hi>And when hee
ſaw their faith,</hi> Luke 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>Two things herein are conſiderable;
firſt, that the faith of the bearers was
a motive, and inducement to our Saviour
the more ſpeedily with favour to reflect
on this ſick man. Secondly that the words
<hi>their faith,</hi> are taken incluſively, taking
in a <hi>fift faith</hi> to the former <hi>four,</hi> namely
the faith of Him, who lay ſick on the Bed.
However, here we ſee that the beheſte of
friends, concurred to the expediting of
his <hi>Cure,</hi> and (though let down but by
<hi>four cords</hi>) he was lifted up into Chriſts
favour with a <hi>five-fold Cable</hi> of faith, <hi>which
cannot be broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nearer is the Relation betwixt Parent
and childe, then friend and friend. When
therefore a pious Father, Mother, or
(beſt then, when) both, ſhall with the
armes of their faith, offer an Infant (who
indeed is a part of themſelves) to God
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114646:38"/>
in Circumciſion, this muſt needs bee a
main Motive (through Gods mercy, and
no otherwiſe) to induce Him graciouſly
to behold the <hi>Preſent</hi> tendred unto Him.</p>
                  <p>Thus the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi>
advantageth <hi>Iſaac</hi> into Gods love, the
faith of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebeccah</hi> recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and preferred <hi>Jacob</hi> at his Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
into Gods favour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, at Circumciſion the childes
weakneſſe to covenant is aſſiſted by Gods
acceptance thereof. <hi>That is well ſpoken,
which is well taken.</hi> How ſimple and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſoever a childs performance is at Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
how low and little ſoever his
faith is, God ſtoops (ſuch his gracious
condeſcenſion) to take it up; He makes,
(as I may ſay) a <hi>long arm,</hi> to reach a <hi>ſhort
one,</hi> and ſo both meet together.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this ſtrengtheneth the Covenant
then made by the childe, that afterwards,
if arriving at years of diſcretion, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
ratifieth, and confirmeth the ſame
with his own actuall faith, evidenced to
others in his pious converſation. Men
uſed to ſay of <hi>Plato</hi> his Scholers, That
<hi>their Masters Precepts, did freez in them,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114646:38"/>
till they were about fifty yeers old, and then
began to thaw in them, till the day of their
death,</hi> meaning that the good counſels he
gave them made no viſible impreſſion on
the amendment of their manners, till the
heat of their youth was overpaſt, and
they come to their reduced age. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
may be ſaid to freez in Infants,
as to any eminent outward effect thereof,
during their Minority, the vigor and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
thereof is <hi>dormant,</hi> and ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>dead</hi> in them, but when come to the
vſe of Reaſon, then it raiſeth and rouzeth
it ſelf, namely when the Party <hi>makes good</hi>
the <hi>Covenant, made</hi> by him before, and
then the ſtrength of that Sacrament had
a powerfull influence on their ſouls all
the dayes of their lives. And although
there ought to be no <hi>iteration</hi> of outward
Circumciſion, which done <hi>once,</hi> is done
for <hi>ever,</hi> yet inwardly to circumciſe their
ſouls, was the dayly taſk of all devout
Jews, and ought to be our conſtant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and a word or two briefly of
the nature thereof.</p>

Surgeons, when forced to cut off a limb,
generally uſe two wayes to eaſe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.

(<hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 2. <hi>For ſo he giveth his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
ſleep</hi>) that humane receipts for the
ſame, either under, or over-do the work.
The other by ſtupifying, and mortifying
by degrees the part to be cut off, ſo to
render the party leſſe ſenſible thereof.
The ſame way is preſcribed us by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your

to have our ſouls circumciſed, and
corruptions cut from us whileſt we are in
the full feeling thereof, and therefore
ought it to be our endeavour by dayly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114646:41"/>
mortification to dull our ſenſe of the
ſame.</p>
                  <p>So much of Circumciſion; and now
let us briefly recollect with the Reader,
what progreſſe we have made in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
controverſie; and by what degrees
we have proceeded. Firſt, we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> at
Circumciſion and Evangelical Covenant.
Secondly, that the ſame deſcendeth on all
the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Thirdly, that
all believing Gentiles are <hi>Abrahams</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Fourthly, <hi>That eight-dayes-old-Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh-children</hi>
were accepted of God as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to covenant. Come we now to ſhew
that Baptiſm with Chriſtians, is what
Circumciſion was to the Jews; whence
this will naturally and neceſſarily follow,
that Chriſtian children at the ſame age,
have as much right to the one, as Jewiſh
infants had to the other.</p>

But the precedents of more: And let the

                  <q>Saul made havock, and haling men

both men and women.</q>
                  <p>See here the weaker ſex joyntly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in perſecutions, and (which was but
equal) did alſo communicate in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.
It was juſt that thoſe, who with
men had drunk their ſhare in the cup of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114646:43"/>
bitter affliction, ſhould alſo have their part
in the cup of Sacramental conſolation.</p>
                  <p>Let none be troubled that only two
places expreſly mention the baptizing of
Women. For Scripture proofs are not to
be taken by their number, but weighed in
the ballance; One witneſſe from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
mouth is as valid as one thouſand.
Yea, one teſtimony of Scripture, coming
from the Spirit which is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>all in

                  <p>Here let the weaker ſex enlarge their
gratitude to God, on this very account,
that he hath cleared their title to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
in the Goſpel; whoſe right to
Circumciſion under the Law was incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with ſome difficulty. For, ſuppoſe
a Jewiſh woman diſtreſſed in conſcience,
and complaining that ſhe was excluded
the Sacrament of Circumciſion, becauſe
not actually ſigned with it; and, ſuppoſe
a Rabbin, or Levite, endeavouring to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
her by the anſwers Chapter 1. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
alledged, (<hi>viz.</hi> that ſhe was vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
or reductively circumciſed in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114646:44"/>
or huſband) poſſibly all this might
not pacifie her minde; and, though ſuch
a ſcruple be but a <hi>mote</hi> in it ſelf, yet might
it prove painful in ſo tender a place, as
conſcience, the eye of the ſoul, is How
thankful therefore ought Chriſtian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to be to Gods goodneſſe, expreſly
admitting them to Baptiſm, and having
equal right with men in that Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three forenamed circumſtantial
differences between Circumciſion, and
Baptiſm, are not of ſuch conſequence,
as to diſeſſential them, or to make them
diſtinct Sacraments; both remaining the
ſame in effect, thoſe accidental variations

                  <p>For the like may be obſerved between

becauſe what ſucceedeth muſt come
after in time, when its predeceſſor is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted:
But Baptiſm for ſome years went
<hi>abreaſt</hi> with Circumciſion, both were ſet
a foot together in Church practice. For
Baptiſm was inſtituted in our Saviours life
time, uſed by his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 4. 2. to
the Jews, and enjoyned immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chriſts Aſcenſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. to be
practiſed upon all Nations: Now Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
held in force many years after,

unto it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is confeſt, that for ſome years
Circumciſion remained in the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Baptiſm was ordained. Have we not
often ſeen the Moon ſhining in Heaven
even after the Sun ſome hours hath been
riſen therein; But then ſhe ſhines dully
and dimly, with a faint and feeble light as
conſcious to her ſelf of uſurpation, and
guilty of intruſion to the territories and
dominion of the Sun; the Moon being
only made <hi>to rule the night.</hi> So may I ſay
there was a weak and wan appearance of
Circumciſion in the Chriſtian Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Baptiſm was ordained, and that for
theſe two reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It was continued ſome time in
the Church for the more decent expiring
thereof. God would not have that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
which had lived ſo long in lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre,
dye in ſhame: And therefore it was
thought fit, that Circumciſion, as it began
on a good man, ſo it ſhould expire on
a gratious Saint: <hi>Abraham</hi> being the
firſt, and <hi>Timothy</hi> the laſt; whom we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114646:47"/>
find Circumciſed in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God foreſeeing what an
advantage Satan might take, if his Church
were left <hi>Sacramentleſs,</hi> to aſſault the ſame
in the interval of the going out of the one,
and coming in of the other (as <hi>Ahab</hi> was
wounded, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 34. in the naked
place <hi>betwixt the joynts of his harneſs</hi>)
would have his Sacraments (rather then
they ſhould fall ſhort) one lap, and fold
over the other, that both ſhould be in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at once. Probably, had another go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church been prepared,
and fitted; yea, and ſet up (rather two
together then none at all) before the old
one was demoliſhed, profaneneſſe, and
damnable hereſies, which we now behold,
and bemoan, had not made their progreſs
ſo faſt, and ſo far into the Engliſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of all is this: Though <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. What it is to reaſon out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures;
and what credit is due to
deductions from Gods word.</head>
                  <p>WE do freely confeſſe, that there is
neither expreſſe Precept nor Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
in the New Teſtament for the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing
of Infants; and yet are confident,
by neceſſary and undeniable conſequence
from Scripture it will be made appear
to be founded thereon. Let us here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
and explain a practice of the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul,</hi> as much conducible to our purpoſe.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114646:48"/>
He coming to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> Acts 17. 2.
Reaſoned <hi>with the Jews</hi> out of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Three things herein are conſiderable.
Firſt, being to prove, that <hi>this Jeſus whom
he preached was Chriſt,</hi> he neither did nor
could produce a poſitive text of Scripture,
wherein the ſame was affirmed <hi>ſyllabical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
or in ſo many very words.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in proof hereof he did
not bring bare reaſon, which would
be but ineffectual; eſpecially to prove
that which was meerly an article of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in his <hi>diſputing</hi> he made a
wiſe compoſure of both, joyning Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
and reaſon together. Scripture was
the <hi>Well,</hi> Reaſon was the <hi>Bucket,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi>
was the <hi>Drawer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> precedent ought to be followed
by our practice herein. <hi>Scriptura non ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur,
otioſis: The Scripture was not writ for
the idle, but the induſtrious.</hi> Yea, to what
intent hath God beſtowed reaſon upon
us, improved in ſome with Learning and
Education, together with the promiſe of
his Spirit to conduct us into all neceſſary
truth; but that we ſhould improve the
ſame in the ſerious ſearching of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:114646:48"/>
One main motive which induced <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus</hi>
to believe the other ſide of this
Globe to be peopled with reaſonable
ſouls, and invited him to undertake the
diſcovery thereof, was a firm apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and belief, that God would not create
ſo glorious a creature as the Sun to ſhine to
Sea and Fiſhes alone; but that ſurely ſome
men did partake of the benefit thereof. Is it
probable that God would light the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
lamp of reaſon, learning, and grace in
mens ſouls, for no other purpoſe, or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
deſign, but meerly that men ſhould
make uſe thereof in peruſing of pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
and reading the works of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
writers; chiefly in examining the
word of God, with ſuch conſequences,
which naturally may be extracted from
the ſame?</p>
                  <p>Some things are, in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as graſſe
on the ground, which on the ſurface there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is apparent to every beholder; other
things are, in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as mines, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
in the bowels thereof, no leſſe the
product of the earth then the former,
though more induſtry muſt be uſed for
the eduction thereof. <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114646:49"/>
of the firſt <hi>ſort,</hi> obvious to a childe that
can read the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> But
he muſt be a<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>man of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
(which we all ought to be)
to whom <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is viſible by deduction
from Scripture.</p>
                  <p>See we here not only the uſefulneſſe
and conveniency, but even the abſolute
neceſſity of the profeſſion of Miniſters;
not only for the adminiſtration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but for the clearing thoſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſequences from Scripture, which at
the firſt view are not apparent to every
ordinary capacity.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
according to the proportion of Faith.</hi>
Now I believe it will generally be granted
that by <hi>Propheſie</hi> here is meant the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the word. Know then that the
<hi>proportion of Faith,</hi> conſiſts not in one, or
ſome, or many, but is the reſult of all
places of Scripture; the univerſal <hi>Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie</hi>
of them all, concerning ſuch a point
which is treated of. Here then is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Miniſter, to preſent to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(in any matter neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or practiſed) the <hi>ſence</hi> of the Old and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114646:49"/>
New Teſtament; This is ſometimes
not conſpicuous in any one place, as
being the <hi>collective,</hi> and <hi>conſtructive Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>
amounting from many particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
compared together.</p>
                  <p>Here, I ſay, the Miniſters office is called
upon; (in whom <hi>Reaſon</hi> is or ought to be
cleared and ſtrengthned by his learning)
to manifeſt and evidence to the people of
his flock, the riſe and reſult of ſuch dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
how naturally and neceſſarily they
flow from Scripture. This done, ſuch
of his flock, who of themſelves could not
ſee, will ſee when ſhown; who of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
could not go, will go when led; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
by Gods bleſſing on his help, will
both eaſily apprehend in themſelves, and
communicate to ſuch in their family, ſuch
<hi>Scipture-conſequences,</hi> which their ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
could never firſt have found out by
themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Then will it fare with ſuch people as
with the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> John 4. 42. who
came to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> at the womans <hi>invitation,</hi>
but <hi>believed</hi> on him, not becauſe of her
ſaying, <hi>but becauſe they heard him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
Unlearned people receive not ſuch
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114646:50"/>
conſequences for truths, on the credit of
the Learning and Religion of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
(though by his direction firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
therewith) but becauſe that
ſince they have been convinced in their
own judgements and conſciences of the
truth thereof, as no doubt the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
were, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> (as is aforeſaid)
<hi>reaſoned with</hi> them <hi>out of Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a greater then <hi>Paul</hi> is here to avouch
this practice, even our Saviour himſelf;
Who, being to confute the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who
not only denied the reſurrection of the
dead, but alſo that there was neither An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
nor Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 8. (exiſting ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the body) ſo that at death the
ſouls of men expired, and were utterly
extinguiſhed. In refutation of which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
our Saviour <hi>reaſoned out of Scripture,</hi>
Mat. 22. 31. 32. <hi>But as touching the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the dead, have ye not read that
which was ſpoken unto you by God, ſaying, I
am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,
and the God of Jacob? God is not the
God of the dead, but of the living. God is
not the God of the dead,</hi> that is, he is not
God to that which is annihilated, and null
in nature, but that thing muſt have an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
being in it ſelf, before it can be ſo
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114646:50"/>
related that God becomes a God unto it.</p>
                  <p>This text in it ſelf ſeems at <hi>great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
to prove the Reſurrection, and
never likely to <hi>meet</hi> the matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie;
unleſſe <hi>Reaſon intercede</hi> to joyn
them both together. The argumentation
being thus framed, and that to which God
pronounceth himſelf a God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath a true &amp;
real exiſtence. But God pronounceth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
God to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſome
hundreds of years after their death; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> &amp; <hi>Jacob,</hi> had ſtil a true
and real exiſtence. And thus an argument,
which formerly was vertually in the text,
is by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Reaſon</hi> actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
thence, and effectually applied to
the preſet purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Say not, Chriſt might have choſe in the
old Teſtament, more pregnant and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
places then this by him cited to prove
the reſurrection; as that <hi>Job</hi> 19. 26. <hi>And
though after my skin, worms deſtroy this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet in my fleſh ſhal I ſee God:</hi> For, firſt it is
preſumption for any to teach Chriſt;
which <hi>ſtone out of the brook</hi> to chuſe (as the
ſmootheſt, and fitteſt) when he is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
the <hi>Goliath</hi> of any errour. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the Sadduces only allowing the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114646:51"/>
                     <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or five books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> Chriſt
worſted them at their own weapons out
of that Scripture, which they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for Canonical; ſetting us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
by reaſon out of the Word, to
prove thoſe points which are not expreſly
contained therein.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point; when <hi>Eve</hi> was
brought to <hi>Adam</hi> newly awaked out of
his deep ſleep, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23. he gazed not on
her as a ſtranger, but welcomed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
her with this cheerful and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
expreſſion, <hi>This is now bone of my
bone, and fleſh of my fleſh; ſhe ſhall be called
woman, becauſe ſhe was taken out of man.</hi>
So ſhould <hi>Scripture</hi> behold thoſe legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<hi>deductions,</hi> which by right reaſon,
and lawful rules of Logick, are thence
drawn, and derived, it would inſtantly
own and acknowledge them for its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
iſſue and off-ſpring; command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to be called <hi>Derivative Scripture,</hi>
becauſe taken out of the body and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
thereof.</p>
                  <p>Here I pleade not for ſuch violent and
forced conſequences, (<hi>baſtards</hi> of mens
brains) which ſome unjuſtly <hi>father</hi> on
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114646:51"/>
the Scripture, <hi>wreſting</hi> it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16.
and not <hi>reaſoning,</hi> but <hi>wrangling</hi> from it.
Natural and neceſſary <hi>deductions,</hi> are by
me alone intended; by which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to prove, that Baptiſm is bottomed
on <hi>Reaſons out of Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here make we this <hi>motion</hi> to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and may he reſent it according to
the equity thereof. Though we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
and he peruſe theſe our <hi>reaſons out
of Scripture</hi> ſeverally, our deſire is they
ſhould all be compounded together, and
joyntly preſented to his judgement. This
deſire proceeds not from any <hi>jealouſie</hi> and
<hi>ſuſpition</hi> we have of their invalidity, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſingle, but out of a <hi>confidence,</hi> that
though they may be cavilled at (and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to be broken) as <hi>ſingle arrows,</hi>
they will be unbreakable to him who here
may have his <hi>Quiver full of them.</hi> For as
in a <hi>regular Fort,</hi> though ſingle <hi>flankers</hi>
thereof may be aſſaulted, yet the whole
will be impregnable; wherein each part
receiveth ſtrength from, and returneth
ſtrength to another; ſo we conceiv though

to doubt and debate, may be proved by
what formerly was explained, in Baptiſms

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> To this your arguing from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Circumciſion is of no validity;
yea, and of very dangerous conſequence:
For on the ſame account you may extend
the Analogie to the reviving of all the
Jewiſh Ceremonies, long ſince dead and
rotten in the grave of our Saviour; Such
<hi>Necromancy</hi> in Conjuring up the Ghoſts
of dead Judaiſm, is unlawful of it ſelf, and
prejudicial to Chriſtian liberty; ſhould
we be put under the Goſpel to ſuch ſlaviſh

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We confeſſe this exception true
and juſt, had Circumciſion been but a
bare Ceremony and no more; But Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
had in it more of what was <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental</hi>
then <hi>Ceremonious.</hi> The <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious</hi>
part thereof is utterly extinct,

Goſpel part thereof, as it contained an
everlaſting Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
ſeed; that is, all true believers, may
be ſaid to ſurvive, in Baptiſm the true
heir thereof; <hi>Sacramenta non moriuntur,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Proceed we to prove the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with a new Syllogiſm;</hi> They who
once in Circumciſion were made members of
the Church, and never ſince were ſolemnly
outed of the ſame, remain ſtill in the ſtate of
their memberſhip: But Circumciſed Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
under the Jews were made members of

remain members.</p>
                  <p>Here the <hi>Minor</hi> alone is expoſed to ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

when, where, how, and by whom
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114646:53"/>
they were caſt out of that memberſhip.
Sure I am, ſeeing the old Teſtament leaves
them in <hi>peaceable poſſeſſion</hi> thereof; And
no <hi>firm ejection</hi> of them appears in the
new Teſtament; it muſt needs be ſome
<hi>Apocrypha writing,</hi> or <hi>forged deed,</hi> which

                  <p>
                     <hi>For the further clearing hereof, Let us
ſuppoſe, a</hi> Jew <hi>about the time of S.</hi> Paul
<hi>converted into a</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>and ſoon after
made</hi> father <hi>to a</hi> ſon. <hi>If this</hi> child <hi>in his
infancy may not be admitted to Baptiſm,
what cauſe had it no leſſe juſtly then
Grievouſly to complain? Might it but
borrow a tongue from the ſtanders by,
how pathetically would it expoſtulate his
condition?</hi> Alas, how ſad is my eſtate?
My father being but a Jew, was at eight days
old made a member of the Church by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion:
His infancy was no bar and obſtacle
unto him, to render him uncapable of the
Covenant. I had thought now my Father
is turned Chriſtian, that the Child ſhould not
be impaired becauſe his father is improved?
Is a Chriſtians ſon found in a worſe caſe then
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114646:54"/>
a Jews ſon was left? I thought the alteration
of our condition by Chriſts coming was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
not diminiſh what we had before? Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
may be a good Religion for men to
die in, but Judaiſm was better for Children
to be born in: We Infants who ſignified ſome.
thing under the Law, are made cyphers under
the Goſpel, no notice being taken of us, until
we are arrived unto years of diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>This complaint might be largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
with more earneſtneſſe, but a
word is enough, the rather if we conſider
what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Heb. 8. 6. But now hath he
obtained a more excellent miniſtry, by how
much alſo he is a mediator of a better cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
which was eſtabliſhed upon better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi>
What a Scale of <hi>melioration</hi> have
we here, <hi>better,</hi> and better, <hi>excellent,</hi> and
more <hi>excellent.</hi> But if Children ſince
Chriſts coming are excluded the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
which were admitted unto it before,
his is a <hi>leſs excellent Miniſtry,</hi> &amp; he the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of a <hi>worſe</hi> Covenant upon <hi>worſe</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
ſeeing the ſame is not extended now
as formerly, to all ages, Sexes and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of people, (children, included under

<hi>information</hi> before, they now ſue for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>confirmation</hi> from the infallible ſpirit
of the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>Alas, will ſome ſay for the loſſe of this
<hi>letter</hi> of the Corinthians to S. <hi>Paul:</hi> Pitty
it was that providence did not tranſmit the
ſame to poſterity; How uſeful had it been
for us if it had come into our hands? Let
ſuch know, firſt, this their <hi>letter</hi> was
no part of Canonical Scripture, pen'd by
a fallible Spirit. Secondly, we have ſtill
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114646:55"/>
this <hi>letter</hi> in effect, becauſe we have Saint
<hi>Pauls</hi> anſwers to the queſtions therein.
Thirdly, men generally are more curious
to enquire about thoſe parts of Scripture
which they ſuſpect to have miſcarried,
then careful to improve thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
and are ſufficient for our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt theſe Queſtions, this was not
the eaſieſt, whether a believing huſband
or wife were to continue in wedlock with
an unbelieving wife or huſband, if by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
it ſo came to paſſe that one was an
Infidel, the other a Chriſtian. The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
no doubt ſeem'd probable to ſome,
and on this account, <hi>that if he who is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to an Harlot is one body,</hi> then by the
ſame conſequence, Idolatry being ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
whoredom, Copulation with an infidel
is unlawful, and infectious.</p>
                  <p>But S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the foregoing verſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
the contrary; That in caſe the
<hi>Infidel</hi> is pleaſed to dwel with the <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
they ought ſo to continue; rendring
a reaſon thereof in the words afore alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>for the believing husband, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:114646:56"/>The words contain

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is <hi>reciprocal,</hi> it turneth
and windeth backwards and forwards,
<hi>the unbelieving husband is ſanctified by the
wife, and the unbelieving wife is ſanctified
by the husband;</hi> the proof thereof is in the
enſuing words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>elſe were your children
unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
the <hi>Cardinal</hi> word <hi>Sanctifie,</hi> (as

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sanctified</hi> here is not taken, <hi>quoad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonam,</hi>
to <hi>enholy</hi> the party ſo, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his or her eternal ſalvation. If the
holy <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job,
Ezek.</hi> 14. 20. could ſave <hi>neither ſon nor
daughter,</hi> but their ſole <hi>ſelves</hi> from a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
deſtruction, much leſſe can the
ſanctity of a Chriſtian huſband or wife,
operate ſo effectually on his, or her <hi>Pagan
Partner</hi> as to eſtate them in a ſaving condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Indeed the wives holy <hi>converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
may be inſtrumental to her huſbands
<hi>converſion,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 1. But it is God alone
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114646:56"/>
who <hi>ſanctifies,</hi> in this high acception there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sanctified</hi> then here is taken <hi>quoad uſum,</hi>
that is <hi>eouſ<expan>

relation to Marriage, that the chriſtian
may have a lawful, and comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
and cohabitation in <hi>bed</hi> and <hi>board</hi>
with the <hi>counter-Pagan.</hi> Thus all meats
(though ſome of them formerly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
as unlawful by the Levitical Law)
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. are <hi>ſanctified by the word of
God and prayer;</hi> that is, the uſe of them
is legitimated, and they made healthful
to the bodies, and lawful to the ſouls
of ſuch praying Chriſtians as feed upon
them.</p>
                  <p>See we here firſt, <hi>Grace where it came,
did not always take one and all in a family;</hi>
God in diſpenſing thereof, dealeth as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
did in bleſſing <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,
Gen. 48. 14. He croſſeth his hands witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
taking <hi>a husband out of one</hi> houſe, a <hi>wife</hi>
out of another; a <hi>wife</hi> out of one <hi>houſe,</hi> a
<hi>husband</hi> out of another. The reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<hi>Mat. 11. 26. even ſo father, becauſe it
pleaſeth thee,</hi> John 3. 8. <hi>the Spirit blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

the effects thereof; <hi>I cauſe it to
rain upon one city and not upon another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hence we may learn, that
<hi>Dominion is not founded in Grace:</hi> Had it
been ſo, then the believing wives to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
huſbands, had a juſt title to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
any obedience, pleading that their
huſbands by their Paganiſm had forfeited
all power over them; yet the Apoſtle,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. enjoyneth ſubjection, even
to ſuch huſbands who did not <hi>obey the
word,</hi> and who as yet were <hi>without the
word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, and chiefly hence we obſerve,
<hi>Mixt mariages made againſt Gods will, do
defile the Religious, but continued according
to Gods will, do ſanctifie the profane perſon.
Solomon</hi> may be a proof of the firſt, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi>
11. 4. not <hi>converting</hi> his Idolatrous wives,
but <hi>perverted</hi> by them. Namely, becauſe
he croſſed Gods commandment, <hi>Deut. 7. 3.
Neither ſhalt thou make Mariages with them;</hi>
and the reaſon is added, <hi>for they will turn
thee away from following me. And although
the husband was doubly</hi> advantaged, both
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114646:57"/>
with his <hi>marital authority,</hi> and a <hi>good cauſe</hi>
on his ſide, rather to <hi>prevail</hi> on his wife
then to be <hi>impoſed on</hi> by her; yet becauſe
there was <hi>Laeſum principium,</hi> a fault in his
firſt Match, the <hi>edge</hi> was taken off from
all his arguments to her, and added to her
arguments againſt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> making them by
Gods juſt judgement, twice more <hi>pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi>
and <hi>powerful</hi> to ſeduce him.</p>
                  <p>Should then a Chriſtian Man wilfully
take a Heathen wife, he could not pretend
that his <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſhould <hi>ſanctifie</hi> her
<hi>Infidelity,</hi> ſo far as to make <hi>his bed and
board</hi> comfortable and lawful unto him,
becauſe he croſt a poſitive precept, which
enjoyns the believing party if at liberty,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 39. to Marry <hi>only in the Lord:</hi>
The Phyſitians obſerve, that <hi>faults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the firſt concoction, are ſeldom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in the ſecond:</hi> ſuch men had ſmall
hopes to better their condition by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
their wives after Marriage, who
before Marriage ran ſo deſperate a hazard
againſt Gods will in his word.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, when <hi>mixt Marriages
are continued according to Gods will,</hi> they
do ſanctifie the profane perſon: I mean
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114646:58"/>
when both parties at Marriage were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
Pagan, and one of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
converted to Chriſtianity. In ſuch
a caſe a <hi>ſeparation</hi> is not to be made, (as
was done, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 13. 30. when he <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>
the Jews from all their <hi>ſtrange wives</hi>)
but the Chriſtian may continue in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
with the Pagan, without fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and with a double comfort.</p>
                  <p>1. That hereafter his, or her Pagan

                  </p>
                  <p>2. That for the preſent the Pagan com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

that all <hi>conjugal acts qua-conjugal</hi>

Whereas when grown a man <hi>he ſets up

what was worſt in the premiſes of

pious parentage?</hi> We anſwer, <hi>much every
way;</hi> chiefly becauſe extraction from

They have alſo the benefit of their

not to <hi>People Hell,</hi> but <hi>Plant Heaven.</hi>
When growing up, capable to learn, they
have advantage of <hi>precepts (Abraham</hi> will
teach his children) of good <hi>precedents,</hi>
whiles the children of wicked parents ſee
daily what they ſhould <hi>flie,</hi> theſe ſee what
they ſhould <hi>follow;</hi> the advantage of <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
moderately and ſeaſonably uſed.
All theſe are the <hi>ſap</hi> which the <hi>root</hi> of holy
parentage ſends up into the <hi>branches</hi>
thereof, though all of them too often
prove ineffectual, and God (who finally
ſaveth not <hi>children</hi> for their <hi>parents</hi> ſake,
but <hi>parents</hi> and <hi>children</hi> for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake)
juſtly condemneth many children of good
parents, for neglecting all theſe precious
advantages to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>To conclude. In the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> the
eldeſt ſon of a <hi>Commiſſion Captain,</hi> being

Chriſt alone be our Captain, every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                  <head>CHAP. XI. The third Reaſon, taken from the
Holy Spirit, which is given to
little Infants.</head>
                  <p>THe Third <hi>Reaſon out of Scripture,</hi> is
thus framed: Such who receive the
Spirit of God may and ought to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
but infants receive the Spirit of
God, therefore they may and ought to be
Baptized.</p>
                  <p>The Major hereof is in effect the words
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114646:62"/>
of the Text; <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47. <hi>Can any
man forbid water that theſe ſhould not be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized,
which have received the holy Ghost as
wel as we?</hi> Can he? that is, can he juſtly? can
he lawfully? can he ſo do it, as to avouch
it to God and man, when he hath done it?
Though I confeſſe too many <hi>de facto,</hi> do
it now adayes. <hi>Can any man? we can do
nothing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>against the
Truth but for the Truth,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 8. It is
not ſtrength, but weakneſſe; for one to
be able to do that which he ought not to
do. <hi>Can any man?</hi> Be he an Apoſtle, or
even <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, MAN. He muſt be
either worſe then a man for his <hi>Envy,</hi> or
leſſe then a man by his <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Minor remains to be proved, that
Infants receive the Spirit of God, whereof
we have two pregnant proofs, one in the
old Teſtament, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Before I formed
thee in the womb I knew thee, and before
thou cameſt out of the womb I ſanctified thee,
and ordained thee to be a Prophet unto the
Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> This ſanctification of <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
intends not ſuch as accompanieth the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the ſoul, but meerly importeth
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114646:62"/>
a deſignation of him to the Prophetical
function, with qualification for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
thereof. It is therefore impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alledged to prove, that Infants have the
ſaving Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is confeſſed that <hi>Jeremy</hi> his
deſtination to be a Prophet, was a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
part of his <hi>ſanctifying</hi> here mentioned.
Yet was it not the total thereof, as being
but a ſprig and branch of the ſame, which
extended to Gods forming him according
to his <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>approbation</hi> and <hi>hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
him as yet unborn, to be his Saint and
ſervant.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond inſtance in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is that of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 41.
<hi>Leaping in his mothers womb at the ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the virgin Mary.</hi> Not that (as
ſome have miſtaken it) that <hi>then his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was first ſenſible that ſhe quickned of
him,</hi> ſeeing it was ſaid before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 36.
<hi>This is the ſixth moneth with her which was
called barren;</hi> but as it is <hi>verſ.</hi> 44. the
babe <hi>leaped in my womb for joy,</hi> knowing
and acknowledging Chriſt the Saviour of
mankind, and tranſported with tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
gladneſſe for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:114646:63"/>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>Jeremy and John the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt,</hi>
were <hi>Jeremy and John the Baptist,</hi> I
mean, ſignal perſons of extraordinary ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of grace, above the ſize of common
Chriſtians. Your Logick is but bad, if
from the induction of two inſtances, you
infer a general concluſion: As ſoundly
you might prove, that all <hi>Davids wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi>
were equal in valour and atchive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 19. <hi>unto the first three,</hi>
as that al infants of Gods children may for
their abilities be matched with <hi>theſe two</hi>
by you alledged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant no leſſe, That theſe two
inſtances were extraordinary: However
thus much advantage we gain thereby,
that they plainly prove <hi>the ſtate of Infancy</hi>
to be <hi>receptive</hi> of grace, and of ability to
entertain the ſame. Let none look on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
as ſo <hi>indiſpoſed</hi> and <hi>unorganized</hi> by
reaſon of their weakneſſe, but that the
lowneſſe of their age is capable of the <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
to ſanctity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though we acknowledge
ſuch <hi>redundancy</hi> of the Spirit in the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and miraculous proportion
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114646:63"/>
thereof confined to a few perſons, in
Chriſts and the Apoſtles time, yet we may
no leſſe truly then confidently maintain,
that a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> thereof as to ſalvation, is
conferr'd on all Gods ſervants now adays,
as well as before; Nor is Gods Spirit
<hi>ſuper-annuated</hi> with aged <hi>Naomy,</hi> Ruth,
1. 11. or grown ſo <hi>barren,</hi> or <hi>effete,</hi> but
that it is ſtill procreative, and produceth
the effects thereof in Gods ſervants now,
as vigorouſly as ever before.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe, moſt doleful, yea, indeed
deſperate were the conditions of Gods
ſervants now adays, if devoid of the Spirit
of God, <hi>as to the eſſentials thereof,</hi> having
now a <hi>fiercer foe and worſe weapons</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
him, then the Chriſtians had in
former ages: <hi>A fiercer foe,</hi> Satan himſelf
growing ſubtiler, with the addition of
fifteen hundred years experience; and
crueller, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. becauſe the ſhorter
his reign, the ſharper his rage: <hi>Worſe
weapons</hi> if we be left altogether naked of
the offencive and defencive armor of the
Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot but admire at the
practice of ſome perſons now adayes,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114646:64"/>
boaſting of ſtrange meaſures of the Spirit
beſtowed upon them (and we muſt needs
believe them, <hi>for they ſay ſo themſelves;</hi>)
yea, ſuch prodigious proportions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
whereby <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> they conceive
themſelves enabled for ſuch offices, for
which they were never fitted by their
education. And yet the ſelf-ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who are thus prodigal in the praiſe of
their own perfections, aſſuming ſo much
of the Spirit to themſelves, are moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
nigardly to others, and eſpecialy
to Infants denying the leaſt degree of the
Spirit unto them.</p>
                  <p>Whereas let matters be beheld with an
unpartial eye, and it will appear, that it is
more probable children ſhould partake
of the company of the Spirit, then men
now adayes: May it not juſtly be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the ſpiritual pride, uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſelf-intereſt, ſiniſter reſpects, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
and oppreſſion of many men do
<hi>fright</hi> away <hi>the ſpirit</hi> from them, how
highly ſoever pretending to holineſſe:
whereas the mildneſſe, meekneſſe, ſilence,
humility and patience of a childe, may
invite the ſociety of the ſpirit the ſooner
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114646:64"/>
unto it, and the <hi>Dove</hi> converſe rather <hi>with
Doves</hi> then with <hi>Vultures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To put all out of doubt, we can plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonſtrate the fruits of Gods Spirit
and Sanctification in Infants, dying Infants,
and therefore the root therof muſt be
granted to be in their hearts, which we
thus prove.</p>

                  <p>THe Fourth <hi>Reaſon out of Scripture</hi> is

anſwered, <hi>if thou believest with all thy heart

Chriſt took them up in his arms, as not
big enough to <hi>kneel down</hi> and be bleſſed,
which otherwiſe was the poſture of ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
upon the ſame occaſion.</p>
                  <p>That theſe little children pleaſed Chriſt,
is proved by his <hi>expreſſions</hi> (the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
of love or hatred in that heart
which could not diſſemble) concerning
them, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Suffer little children to

ſuch is the kingdom of God.</hi> Of Such, that
is not only of thoſe who are like unto
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114646:66"/>
theſe, (in which ſenſe our Saviour might
as ſignificatively have ſaid the ſame of
<hi>Doves</hi> or <hi>Lambs,</hi> that the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
conſiſts of ſuch who are like unto
them) but of theſe, and alſo of thoſe who
imitate them in their innocential qualities.
Such make ſtrange interpretation of the
words, who exclude the <hi>Original,</hi> and
only admit the <hi>Copy;</hi> let in ſuch as are
like to children, and ſhut out children
themſelves from the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>complacency</hi> Chriſt took

                  </p>
                  <p>Here we diſtinguiſh between childrens
<hi>being ſenſible of the meaning,</hi> and their
<hi>being capable of the benefit,</hi> by a bleſſing.
Probably ſome of the ſmalleſt children
here preſented unto Chriſt, underſtood
not our Saviours language, nor the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Thus as many though by natural

                  <p>THe Fift <hi>Reaſon out of Scripture</hi> may
thus be contrived; They who are
ſubject to the malady of ſin, ought
to partake of the remedy againſt it; But
Infants are ſubject to the malady of ſin;
therfore they ought to partake of baptiſm
the remedy againſt it. For the proof of the
<hi>major</hi> or firſt part thereof, I appeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Chriſtians, only to the married;
amongſt the married, only to the parents
of children. Theſe cannot deny it, but
that againſt their wills, as the unhappy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
they have derived corruption
to their infants, as conveyed in the ſame
charter of their being unto them.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhould be ſo ſenſleſs as to deny In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
infected with Original Corruption,
the contrary will be ſadly demonſtrated
by thoſe ſeveral diſeaſes, and death it ſelf,
to which they are ſubject, before they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114646:68"/>
have or can commit actual ſin. All will
confeſſe no ſuffering can follow but
where ſin hath gone before, and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
deeply ſhare in ſufferings, daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
approveth. Some of them
whileſt they lie in the Cradle, how lie
they on the rack? Such ſighes, ſuch ſobs,
ſuch gripes, ſuch groans, ſuch convulſions,
ſuch diſtortions, enough almoſt to kill the
hearts of the beholders, relating unto
them, if all pitty be not dead in them
before: Nor can all the rending of the
fathers hair, abate the aching of the childs
head, nor all the rain of the mothers
tears, allay the wind in the babes body.
<hi>Quid teneri infantes in te committere tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum?
quid pueri potuere.</hi> But theſe little
Lambs wherein have they offended? Their
hands did never hurt others, which could
not help themſelves: Their tongues did
never lie, ſwear, &amp;c. which cannot ſpeak;
Their feet were never ſwift to ſhed bloud
which cannot go. All theſe miſeries, and
death at laſt, fals often, on Infants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of actual ſin, becauſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of their nature wherein they were
born and conceived.</p>

Seeing therefore Infants are ſubject to
the malady of ſin, what a cruelty were it
for parents to leave them in this pittiful
caſe neglecting the remedy for the ſame?
By the Levitical Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 33. <hi>If a

by pleading the <hi>cuſtome of the Country,</hi>
ſo it is confeſſed, that too many in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114646:70"/>
in matters both of faith and fact, have
alledged Cuſtome to Patronize their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
opinions, and injurious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p>But all this ought not to beget in us a
neglect of ſuch Cuſtomes, which like
<hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> are <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>without father,
without mother, without diſcent;</hi> whoſe
firſt <hi>original</hi> cannot be found out; <hi>as pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
in the Church, time out of mind;</hi> no
remembrance, or <hi>record</hi> extant to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Now as <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> in the ſame
place, is ſaid to have <hi>neither beginning of
dayes,</hi> and what neceſſarily followeth
thence, <hi>nor end of life;</hi> ſo it is but juſt and
equal that ſuch <hi>Ancient Cuſtomes</hi> in the
<hi>Church,</hi> which never had memorable <hi>Riſe,</hi>

ſuch which probably began at the <hi>firſt,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here I plead not for ſuch <hi>miſ-ſhapen
Cuſtomes,</hi> which either run up all in <hi>length,

With you:</hi> Selves, and ſucceſſours,

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words, <hi>To be with you,</hi> import
not only a promiſe of protecting them

them in all doctrines, neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved

And this promiſe being made not ſo much

which amounteth from them all.</p>
                  <p>We confeſſe that notwithſtanding the
foreſaid promiſe of protection and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
many good men have been guilty
of great errours, and have alſo fallen by

about his Church in general, that he will
not ſuffer the ſame to be univerſally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in all Ages with any one dangerous
Errour. And therefore <hi>a Church Cuſtome
in all times and places,</hi> muſt be preſumed
conformable to the will of God, becauſe
were it erroneous, it were utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with that ſolemn promiſe which
God hath paſſed to his Church, to <hi>be with

                  </p>
                  <p>Such who on the contrary ſide are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and will not confide in the Univerſal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
of the Church: I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
therein they do ſhew more want of
Charity in condemning ſo many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

                     <hi>What a high valuation S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſet on

                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:114646:72"/>
1 Cor. 11. 16. But if any man ſeem to
be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtome, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Churches of God: <hi>For the better
underſtanding whereof, know that the
Corinthians were guilty of an</hi> innovation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>wherein they were an</hi> exception <hi>from the</hi>
rule <hi>of the general practice in all Chriſtian
Churches: The Innovation was this, that
their women uſed to pray</hi> uncovered, <hi>the
men</hi> covered; <hi>that is, as it is generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
the women with ſhort, the men
with long hair. This ill faſhion S.</hi> Paul
<hi>confutes with ſeveral reaſons drawn from
the power of man over his wife, appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo to natural decencie therein.
And at laſt concludes all with this cloſe;</hi>
But if any ſeem to be contentious, we have no
ſuch Cuſtome, nor yet the Churches of God.
<hi>As if he had ſaid,</hi> could you Corinthians
preſcribe any cuſtome, that in Gods Churches
grave and godly men and women have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

uncovered. Then ſhould you alledge much
in your own juſtification. But I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
on the contrary, that no ſuch cuſtome
can be produced, and therefore your ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
is condemned by the joynt practice of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:114646:72"/>
all Gods Churches againſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>But if any man
ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
neither the Churches of God;</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
only, that Gods Churches have no
cuſtome to be contentious: Chriſtians
ought to be of a quiet and peaceable

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This cannot be the meaning
of the words: For was ever man ſo ſilly
as to ſuppoſe and conceive that Gods

have a ridiculous <hi>cuſtome of being conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious?</hi>
The Church is ſo far from having
ſuch cuſtome (which is a habit reſulting
from many acts) that it condemneth each
ſingle act of cauſeleſſe contention as wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ungodly. Yea, no civilized

did ever delight in <hi>Barrettors:</hi> More then
muſt be meant herein, that Gods Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

                  <head>CHAP. XV. The Antiquity and generallity of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing
of Infants, proved by the
confeſſion of Pelagius.</head>
                  <p>DIvers Learned and Godly Divines,
have undertaken, and performed
this taſk, to prove the conſtant
practice of Infants Baptiſm in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church, by the induction of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
of ſeveral Fathers to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
And as the Angels in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 12. Some aſcended, others
deſcended upon it; ſo in this <hi>ſcale of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,</hi>
ſome have deduced the practice
downwards from Chriſts time to our
dayes; others by an inverted method
have raiſed it upwards from our days to
Chriſts time, both by different motions
meeting in the ſame point.</p>
                  <p>It is our hap, like <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> to be ſent
laſt on the ſame errand: the proof of this
point. And although far be ſuch arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114646:74"/>
from me as to hope with him to
come firſt to our journeys end (and to do
<hi>better</hi> then my <hi>betters</hi> have done before
me) yet thus far wil I follow the example
of <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>To run by the way
of the plain.</hi> Having to deal with people
who generally are unlearned, &amp; therefore
the heaping of Quotations in unknown
tongues, were probable to offend, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,
rather then to edifie and inform
them, we will imbrace the plaineſt way
to make the Baptizing of Infants appear
an Antient and general Church Cuſtome
unto them.</p>
                  <p>This will be proved by the confeſſion of
<hi>Pelagius,</hi> when firſt we have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to the Reader what he was, when,
and where he lived, and what opinions he

                  <p>Amongſt the many dangerous doctrines
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114646:75"/>
which <hi>Pelagius</hi> maintained, we will inſiſt
on that alone; the confutation whereof,
makes mainly for our preſent purpoſe.
He defended that Infants were conceived
and born without original ſin, which came
unto them (when growing in years) not
from an inward <hi>principal of corruption,</hi>
but from their <hi>imitation of outward</hi> ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
preſented unto them. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
undertakes his confutation, and amongſt
many other ſolid Arguments to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
principally inſiſteth upon this, that
it <hi>was the cuſtome of the Church in all ages
to Baptize Infants;</hi> which plainly proves
that they were conceived in original ſin.
<hi>For that which is clean needs not to be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Argument is often inculcated by
S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in ſeveral places, as namely in
his 150 Epiſtle unto <hi>Sixtus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewiſe in his ſecond book of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and concupiſcence,</hi> in the eighteenth
chapter.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe in his four books to <hi>Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
and every where in his ſix books a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Julian,</hi> one of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his ſchollers.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe in his firſt book of <hi>imperfect

                  <p>
                     <hi>Now how eaſie had it been for</hi> Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
<hi>to anſwer this argument, by denying
childrens Baptiſm to be a Church cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
had not his conſcience been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the truth thereof: How might
he have rejoyned,</hi> Original ſin cannot be
proved from the Baptizing of Infants, <hi>which
is</hi> but a modern cuſtome, &amp; an innovation in
the Church of God. What the Sodomites ſaid
of <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 19. 9. <hi>This one fellow came
in to ſojourn and will he needs be a judg?
may be ſaid of</hi> Infants Baptiſm: This cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
is new and novel, lately crept into the
Chuch (as yet rather a ſojourner, then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
therein) and muſt this regulate
matters in a judicial way, ſo that arguments
muſt be deduced from the ſame? Beſides, I
have been a Traveller, and have converſed
with moſt Churches in Christendome, being
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114646:76"/>
born in <hi>Britaine</hi> (a little world by it ſelf;)
I have been in the great world abroad: Jew
and Gentile, Eaſt and Weſtern Churches
have I obſerved: <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> that was, and
<hi>Rome</hi> which is, ſo eminent for Religion, are
places wherein I am well acquainted. <hi>This
I know ſome Churches obſerve, others
neglect, ſome uſe,</hi> others ſlight the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Infants. <hi>Nor</hi> can it be accounted a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
cuſtom of the Church which is but local,
and partial, in a word, both <hi>NEW</hi> and <hi>NAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROW,</hi>
as neither coming down from Christ,
nor extended over all Chriſtendome.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Pelagius</hi> endeavoured to evade
S. <hi>Austins</hi> argument by another device;
namely, by pleading that Baptiſm was
admitted to Infants, <hi>not to waſh away their
Original ſin, but to bring them to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven.</hi> A fancy which he was
the firſt, and (he and his) the laſt to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of all is this; Seeing <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
was ſo great a ſchollar, knowing full
well how to manage a bad cauſe to its
beſt advantage; and ſeeing he was ſo
great a Traveller, who had not <hi>eat his bread
all in one place,</hi> but had roved up and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114646:76"/>
down to know the cuſtomes of the
Church, and yet feeing by his ſilence (ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
nothing againſt it) and by his ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(ſeeking otherwiſe to evade it) he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
the truth of Infants Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm;
we conclude the ſame in his days
received for an Ancient and Univerſal
practice of the Church. For why ſhould
he adventure the breaking of his bones,
(or at leaſtwiſe the bruiſing of his fleſh) by
leaping out of the <hi>window,</hi> who hath a
<hi>wide door</hi> ſet open unto him? Why ſhould
he make ſo poor and pittiful, ſo baſe and
beggerly an eſcape, to avoid S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
againſt him (by forming a frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
fancy of his own) who had a ful, free,
and fair paſſage at pleaſure to go forth,
durſt he but have denied the Baptizing of
Infants to have been a general Church cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
in his time?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To conclude this point, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of</hi> Jephthah <hi>to the King of</hi> Ammon,
<hi>carrieth great weight therewith,</hi> Judg. 11.

                  <p>In like manner may we urge it againſt

the Ancient Church conceived the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of Infants an uſurpation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment,
injurious and unlawful, why
did not the Church of God in ſo long a
time caſt out the cuſtome which made ſo
unjuſt an invaſion therein? For S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
lived about the fift Century after
Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Pedo-baptiſm was in a
<hi>peaceable paſſiſſion</hi> of Church practice, and
<hi>Pelagius</hi> himſelf (ſufficiently impudent)
was ſo modeſt and ingenious not to deny
the ſame, though ſuch a denial had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
much to his own advantage.</p>
                  <p>I have done, when I have told the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> brought the <hi>Baptizing of
Infants</hi> as an argument to prove <hi>Original
ſin;</hi> and in our age (wherein <hi>Original ſin</hi>
is on ought to be granted by all) we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the ſame as a reaſon to prove the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of <hi>Infants Baptiſm;</hi> and ſurely ſo
ſolid is the argument <hi>reciprocally,</hi> that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114646:77"/>
both may be firmly grounded on the

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. The Grand Objection, drawn from
the ſilence of Scripture herein,
Anſwered.</head>
                  <p>OUr Adverſaries in this point, gain
not a greater advantage againſt us
amongſt common people, then by urging
of that, which indeed we confeſſe, no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
precept or practice for Pedo-baptiſm
in Scripture. By popular improving of
which argument, they not only gain to
themſelves the reputation of a ſtrict ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
to the Word, and will of God,
but alſo aſperſe us with the dangerous
imputation of wil-worſhip, and Popiſh
inclinations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yea, which is more, they threaten us
with a curſe pronounced,</hi> Rev. 22. 18.
If any man ſhall adde unto theſe things, God
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114646:78"/>
ſhall adde unto him the plagues that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in this book.</p>
                  <p>In Anſwer whereunto; In the firſt
place we requeſt our Adverſaries to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that this place by them cited
out of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> like a two edged
ſword, cuts on both ſides; for it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
immediatly, <hi>And if any ſhall take away
from the words of the book of this propheſie,
God ſhall take away his part out of the book
of life.</hi> See here a curſe incurr'd, as well
by the defect, as the exceſſe. And be it
reported to our oppoſites in this point,
whether denying ſuch conſequences,
which infallibly flow from Scripture,
be not taking away from the words, as
well as mutilating, or abſtracting the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
words from the ſame.</p>
                  <p>More particularly I anſwer; Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of Infants appears not to ſuch who
only <hi>read the Scripture,</hi> but is plainly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to thoſe who alſo <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi>
(which <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. is the duty of all judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Chriſtians) as by <hi>reaſons out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
we have made it to appear.</p>
                  <p>Here will it not be amiſſe to mind our
adverſaries in this point, that they account
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114646:78"/>
themſelves concerned in conſcience to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and practice many things as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to ſalvation, which notwithſtanding
are built on the ſame foundation with the
<hi>Baptiſm of Infants,</hi> namely not on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
letter of Scripture, but undeniable
conſequences ariſing from the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But I conceive ſuch inſtancing, though
lawful yet not expedient, in this unhappy
juncture of time, <hi>leſt Satan get an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
over us, for we are not ignorant of his
devices;</hi> and leſt ſuch inſtancing, though
intentionally good in us, prove occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
evil to others, by caſting ſcruples
into mens conſciences who are quiet,
for the preſent. There needs more allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of old, then raiſing of new jealouſies
in divinity, more needful to ſettle, then
ſcatter mens belief, in our dayes, wherein
ſo many deniers, and more doubters, in
moſt Articles of Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indeed the</hi> words of the wiſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.
11. are as goads or as nailes faſtened by the
masters of the aſſemblies; <hi>But ſuch buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
muſt be wary, leſt whileſt they</hi> faſten
<hi>one</hi> nail <hi>they do not</hi> looſen <hi>another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However to prove this point, I will
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114646:79"/>
embrace a way, as ſure to clear the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and more ſafe, not having any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
influence on the times. This may
be done by removing the inſtance, from
our age; and fixing the ſame in the time
of Gods Church amongſt the Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now
none will deny but that <hi>wil-worſhip,</hi> or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Gods Word, and his Service, was
as utterly unlawful amongſt them, as
amongſt us Chriſtians; Yet the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
amongſt them, uſed that as their
bounden duty, and neceſſary to Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which hath no original expreſly in
the word of God.</p>
                  <p>For proof hereof, we ſhall offer three
things to the readers conſideration.</p>
                  <p>1. Repairing to <hi>Synagogues</hi> amongſt the
<hi>Jews,</hi> was a neceſſary part of Gods
ſervice.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſame was not grounded on any
expreſſe of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>3. But conſequentially on ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
prudentially joyned together.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, It plainly appeareth by
Chriſts conſtant practice, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 16. <hi>And
as his cuſtome was, he went into the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
on the ſabbath day.</hi> As ſure as a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114646:79"/>
day</hi> return'd every <hi>week,</hi> ſo certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did our <hi>Saviour</hi> viſit the <hi>ſynagogue.</hi> It is
alſo evident by the continual cuſtome of
all pious <hi>Jews,</hi> Acts 15. 21. <hi>For Moſes of
old time hath in every city them that preach
him, being read in the ſynagogues every ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day.</hi> To deſtroy theſe <hi>ſynagogues</hi> was
accounted a wicked work, witneſſe Gods
ſervants their paſſionate complaint,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 8.</p>
                  <p>And again, to erect them was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
act, alledged by the <hi>Phariſees</hi> as
an argument to endeer the <hi>Centurion</hi> unto
our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Mat. 8. <hi>he loveth our nation
and hath built us a ſynagogue.</hi> Laſtly, it was
eſteemed a heavy puniſhment, equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to our <hi>excommunication,</hi> John 9. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.
<hi>to be put out of the ſynagogue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>repairing</hi> to <hi>ſynagogues,</hi> or the
<hi>erecting</hi> of them was not founded on any
poſitive precept in Gods word. Indeed
the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and afterward the <hi>Temple,</hi>
were of Divine <hi>inſtitution</hi> where all <hi>males</hi>
were commanded to preſent themſelves
<hi>thrice</hi> a year; namely at the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> the
<hi>feaſt of Trumpets,</hi> and <hi>Tabernaclos.</hi> But
theſe <hi>ſynagogues</hi> (which I may terme <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114646:80"/>
of eaſe,</hi> to the <hi>mother-Temple</hi>) no writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
law obliged men either to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or frequenting of them.</p>
                  <p>Yet that the ſame was grounded on
rational <hi>deductions</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi> may
infallibly be evinced. The text ſaith,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Remember thou keep holy the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day.</hi> And reaſon dictated unto them;
Firſt, that peoples preſence at publick
ſervice was a principal part of ſanctifying
the <hi>ſabbath.</hi> Secondly, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for them to repair to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and return to their houſes, ſuch
their diſtance betwixt them. Thirdly,
therefore it was neceſſary ſome <hi>room of
receipt</hi> ſhould be provided, ſequeſtred
from common uſes, wherein people
ſhould meet together. Laſtly, another
text affirming, <hi>That the Priests lips ſhould
preſerve knowledge.</hi> It was proper for
them, and the <hi>Levites</hi> diſperſed in all <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
on the <hi>ſabbath,</hi> in the <hi>ſynagogue,</hi> to
read <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people. Thus we
find the firſt <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>ſynagagues,</hi> not
on the floating <hi>ſands</hi> of humane fancy, but
<hi>firm rock</hi> of Gods <hi>Word;</hi> Though not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
yet by conſequence collected from
the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:114646:80"/>
In a word, as chambers and houſes
were for mens perſonal &amp; family devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
every day, or as oft as they pleaſed, &amp;
as the Temple was for the national ſervice
of the <hi>Jews, thrice</hi> every year, ſo Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
were interpoſed in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
both; for Towns and Cities to
ſerve God on the Sabbath day: the whole
nation meeting thrice a year, every City
once a week, as private perſons every
day, and as oft as they pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suppoſe now that a</hi> Prieſt <hi>amongſt the</hi>
Jews, <hi>ſhould preſſe an obſtinate</hi> Jew <hi>to
repair to the</hi> Synagogue, <hi>how might he
have returned this anſwer according to
the</hi> Principles <hi>of our</hi> Anti-pedo-baptiſts?
I will go up to the Temple thrice every year,
and there I will not appear empty-handed:
But I will not on the ſabbath preſent my ſelf
in the Synagogue, which meeting is not <hi>JURE
DIVINO,</hi> a meer civil inſtitution, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
on Gods word; ſhew me a place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
injoyning my attendance in a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
and I will become your convert; Till
which time I will not only my ſelf refrain my
appearance there, but wil alſo account it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip,
in all ſuch as there aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:114646:81"/>
I believe not one of our <hi>Adverſaries,</hi>
in our preſent <hi>Controverſie,</hi> which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous,
but will condemn ſuch a <hi>recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi>
amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> for <hi>refractory</hi> and
<hi>obſtinate:</hi> Yea, they will conceive him,
if perſiſting herein, to deſerve <hi>Church-cenſure,</hi>
for his ſchiſmatical <hi>ſingularity.</hi>
Yet give me leave with love, grief, and
anger to ſay unto him, as once <hi>Nathan</hi> to
<hi>David, thou art the man,</hi> in denying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
Baptiſm, which (though not in ſo
many words expreſſed) is by neceſſary
conſequence infallibly founded on Gods
Word.</p>
                  <p>Now although I freely confeſſe, no
litteral precedent of <hi>Pedo-baptiſm</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
yet ſuch an one therein is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto us, which although it will not
confute our oppoſites, it will confirm us
in our judgements; and though it be not
able, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 9. to <hi>convince the gainſayers,</hi>
yet it will ſtrengthen us in the <hi>Truth:</hi>
When the <hi>principal</hi> is known of him ſelf to
be ſufficient, any <hi>ſecurity</hi> with him will
be accepted, and the following inſtance
may be caſt in, as <hi>over-weight,</hi> to ſuch
minds, who already have their full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:114646:81"/>
of perſwaſion in this point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Namely, when it is ſaid,</hi> Acts 16. 15.
Lydia was Baptized and her houſhold: <hi>And
again,</hi> Acts 16. 33. <hi>of the Jaylor,</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized,
he, and all his, ſtraight way. <hi>Alſo</hi>
1 Cor. 1. 16. I baptized alſo the houſhold
of Stephanas.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Jaylor;</hi> That Children (if he
had any) were compriſed under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,

by <hi>Satans</hi> interpretation, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 12. of Gods

thy power;</hi> and Gods conſenting thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
when permitting him by vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to deſtroy all <hi>Jobs children.</hi> And
whereas in the other two inſtances, the
baptizing of whole <hi>houſholds</hi> are expreſt,
we muſt rationally conceive that ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
were amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſſe I can tell the time,
when there were three houſholds of
young folk in the world (and then but
three houſholds of young folk in the
world) namely, the three ſons of <hi>Noah,</hi>
and his daughters in law in the <hi>Ark,</hi> and
yet not one <hi>Infant</hi> betwixt them all. But
this was a rare and myſtical accident:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114646:82"/>
Again to hold the ballance even, I can
tell the time when in a large Country
every famil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> offered a <hi>first-born,</hi> namely
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12. 3. <hi>There was not a
houſe where there was not one dead.</hi> Which
S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> accounts miraculous, God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
making every family fruitful, that
it might yield a fit object for his own ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                  <p>But to wave theſe inſtances of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
diſpenſation; take three houſes
together, indifferently numerous, ſuch
as thoſe of <hi>Lydia,</hi> the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> and <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
muſt be preſumed to be, (conſidering
the garbe of that age, wherein moſt of
mens moveable wealth conſiſted in men
and maid ſervants, with the children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by them) and it is utterly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
but ſome infants will be amongſt
them. For a great family is like unto an
Orenge tree, which at the ſame time hath
buds and bloſſoms and knobs, and green
and half ripe, and full ripe Orenges on it
all together. I mean, infants, children,
ſtriplings, youths, men of perfect, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
decayed ages.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVII. An Objection Anſwered, drawn from
the inability of Infants to repent
and believe.</head>
                  <p>ALthough we conceive this formerly
ſatisfied, yet finding it to recur in
our proceedings, we will repeat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in our larger Anſwer thereunto.
We perceive many men infidels in the
point of infants faith, and do not believe
that they do or can believe; whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
is principally grounded on theſe
two cauſes; partly becauſe infants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
evidence their believing to others,
partly becauſe men cannot conceive the
manner of infants belief.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt of theſe we ſay, it is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to conclude infants incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
becauſe they cannot manifeſt it
to others. On the ſame account, and
with as much truth and right, one might
deny reaſonable ſouls to infants, becauſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114646:83"/>
they neither do nor can make any expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
thereof.</p>
                  <p>Let matters be meaſured by outward
appearance, and the young ones of bruit
beaſts, ſeem more rational, (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it be but <hi>natural inſtinct</hi> in them)
then any childe whatſoever. A Lamb
new wean'd, and Chicken new hatch'd,
know their Dam, can ſtand, go, do many
things in order to their ſelf-preſervation
better then a new-born infant, and yet no
wiſe man will pronounce them more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
then a childe.</p>
                  <p>Yea, give me leave a little here to make
an uſeful digreſſion.</p>
                  <p>There is no one miſtake w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hath betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mens judgements to more abſurdities,
in the points of <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>
then a miſapprehenſion in making the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the ſtandard of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſame by the proportion thereof.
I am afraid there be too many, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſouls like the pipes in an Organ,
ſome longer, ſome ſhorter, ſome leſſer,
ſome larger; and fancy degrees of their
dimenſions, variable with their ages. So
that a new-born infant ſhould have a ſmal
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:114646:83"/>
ſoul, a weaned childe a ſoul ſomewhat
greater, and ſo ſucceſſively, that the ſouls
of boyes, youths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtriplings, men, ſhould
gradually exceed one another in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Yea, I am afraid, that ſome do farther
extend this their falſe apprehenſion, even
to imagine, that at the laſt day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the ſouls of ſuch who died in their
infancy ſhall appear before Gods Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
little <hi>diminutive Spirits.</hi> This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
makes men behold infants with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful
eyes, accounting them but <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
which ſignifie but little in nature,
and nothing in Religion. To rectifie their
erroneous judgements, let them know,
that all reaſonable ſouls as created by
God, and firſt infuſed into bodies, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
in their eſſence; and that ſomething
extrinſical and adventitious, cauſeth that
grand diſparity betwixt ſouls in their
natural, moral, and ſupernatural opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>1. In their <hi>natural,</hi> as the wiſe man,
and the fool are equal in their death,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 16. ſo alſo in their birth, not
only in the manner thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114646:84"/>
of an adequation of all the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of their ſouls. The different tempers
of their brains, and more or leſſe perfect
fabrick of their bodies, differenceth them
in their <hi>actions,</hi> who in their <hi>beings</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
                  <p>2. In their <hi>moral.</hi> That which makes
the difference betwixt them is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt,
<hi>education</hi> beſtowed on one more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
whereby he arrives at a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
above his equals. Secondly, Habits
of vertues or vices, which one hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
more or leſſe then the other.</p>
                  <p>3. In their <hi>ſupernatural.</hi> Only the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
ariſeth from infuſed graces,
more plentifully conferred on one then
another, and from the holy improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof, which one, frugal in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
makes above him which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift
therein.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or <hi>kind</hi> with all ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical
perfections, are not partial to one
<hi>individuum,</hi> to make that a <hi>favourite</hi> more
then another, but all indifferently partake
thereof: And as amongſt the Iſraelites,
<hi>Exod. 16. 18. all had their juſt omer of
manna;</hi> ſo the man, yea the giant, hath
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114646:84"/>
no more of the reaſonable ſoul then the
Dwarfe or the Infant, all ſhare alike in the
eſſence thereof.</p>
                  <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the ſouls of
<hi>Children and men.</hi> The eſſentials of a childs
ſoul are as large and ample to all purpoſes
and intents, as that of a man. The <hi>houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper</hi>
is the ſame, though pent for rooms
he cannot make the like entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Indeed we read, <hi>Rev. 20. 12. I ſaw the
dead, great and ſmall, ſtand before God:
and the books were open, &amp;c.</hi> But the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality</hi>
there, relates not unto their <hi>ſouls</hi>

                  <p>What matters it then, though Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
cannot diſcover, and though men
cannot perceive their belief? It follows
not but that God may ſee, what a child is
not ſenſible of in it ſelf nor others in it.
God judgeth not as man judgeth, nor
doth he ſee as man ſeeth. Man only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
the out-ſide of childrens opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
loaden with defects ariſing from
their bodily indiſpoſition; Gods ſees the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114646:85"/>
heart, and (what mainly moveth therein)
the ſoul, and (age being meetly <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial</hi>
and <hi>accidental</hi> thereunto) it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no odds at all in Gods diſcovery
therein, who can ſee in them that <hi>beliefe,</hi>
which we cannot behold.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe the worſt that Infants nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do nor can believe, yet this cannot
be a bar to their Covenanting in Baptiſm,
no more then it was to the Jewiſh children
in Circumciſion. Their tender age knew
not what a Covenant with God meant.
Nor had they feeling how thereby they
were engaged to keep the Law; Nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
what did belong to the inward
Circumciſion of the heart, yet were
vouchſafed to be <hi>foederati cum Deo;</hi> So it
can be no bar to the children of Chriſtian
parents to receive a ſeal of covenantſhip
with Chriſt, albeit they at that time want
reaſon to know the nature of a Covenant,
nor how they put on Chriſt, nor what it is
to believe, and to be waſhed clean from
ſin. There is no more abſurdity or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
upon one then the other.</p>

for any to account themſelves fitter and

was. Now Chriſt himſelf was not
Baptized, <hi>Luke 3. 23. till he began to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thirty years of Age,</hi> none ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to prevent that date of time in their
Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>
till <hi>thirty</hi> years of Age, remember he
was <hi>circumciſed,</hi> Luke 2. 21. on the eighth
day. Secondly, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
out of neceſſity, (needing no ſoul-phyſick,
who had no ſoul-ſickneſſe) but a
voluntary deſign to <hi>Baptize baptiſm,</hi> and to
give a ſoveraign vertue thereunto. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Many of <hi>Chriſts</hi> actions were for our
inſtruction, not imitation. Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:114646:86"/>
after his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> faſted fourty days,
and fourty nights, which the urgers of this
argument will not pretend unto.</p>
                  <p>Diſcover we here a corruption too
rife in all our hearts: Such is the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of our croſſe-grain'd nature, that
we lazily ſtand ſtill and admire ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which we ought to follow,
and vainly ſtrive to follow thoſe his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which we ought to admire. Oh that
we all would learn of him, <hi>Mat. 11. 29.
to be meek and lowly of heart,</hi> to think
more humbly of our ſelves, and more
charitably of others; I ſay would we
could <hi>learn this thing of Chriſt,</hi> and leave
ſuch things to Chriſt, which were perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
in him, and not precedential to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Had <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his judgement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and approved the <hi>baptizing</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi>
ſurely he would have baptized ſuch
children, which, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. were brought
unto him, whereas his omiſſion thereof,
plainly argues <hi>Chriſts</hi> disaffection to the
ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Chriſt</hi> in his own perſon Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:114646:86"/>
none at all, as we read, <hi>John</hi> 4. 2. an
office improper for him to perform. How
unfit had it been for our Saviour thus to
Baptize thoſe Infants, <hi>I Jeſus Baptize this
Infant into the Name of Jeſus?</hi> If S. <hi>Paul</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
it beneath his <hi>place</hi> to <hi>Baptize,
1 Cor. 1. 17. For Chriſt ſent me not to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize,
but to preach the Goſpel:</hi> How much
was the <hi>miniſtration</hi> thereof too <hi>mean</hi> for
our <hi>Saviour?</hi> Indeed <hi>Christ</hi> came in all
humility, to be a pattern of patience unto
us, and condeſcended to mean imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

(though not <hi>ſtate</hi>) decency in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſtood much, though not on the
pomp, on the propriety of what he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
as here in his declining to Baptize
any. When a <hi>Lord</hi> hath <hi>ſigned</hi> a <hi>Letter</hi>
with his <hi>own hand,</hi> it is uſual with him to
conſign the ſealing thereof to his <hi>Secretary</hi>
or ſome other ſervant; ſo when Chriſt
had inſtituted Baptiſm, and with his own
hand confirmed the ſoveraign vertue of
that Sacrament, it well befitted his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to command, and his diſciples duty to
perform the adminiſtration thereof.</p>

for himſelf to Baptize thoſe Infants,
yet had he approved <hi>Pedo-baptiſm</hi> in his

ſome of his Diſciples for the doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
This not done, we may infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his diſlike of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A negative argument of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is of no validity. <hi>No mention is made
of theſe Infants Baptizing.</hi> Ergo, <hi>they were
not Baptized:</hi> we may obſerve a grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Evangeliſts relating this ſtory,
<hi>Luke</hi> 18. 17. mentioneth their bleſſing
only without any manner of geſture at all
uſed by our Saviour unto them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.
15. only takes notice that Chriſt <hi>laid his
hands on them, and departed thence,</hi> Mark
10. 16. regiſtreth all three remarkable
actions, <hi>He took them up in his arms, laid
his hands on them, and bleſſed them;</hi> Saint
<hi>John</hi> addeth, <hi>chap.</hi> 21. 21. And there are
alſo many other things which Jeſus did,
<hi>which are not written,</hi> amongſt which for
ought appears to the contrary, the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of theſe infants might be one of them.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:114646:87"/>
However grant they were not formally
and ſolemnly Baptized, yet we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
Baptiſm conſiſteth of two parts, the
<hi>application of water,</hi> which we may call
the <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>the impreſſion of the bleſſing,</hi>
which we may terme the <hi>ſoul</hi> of Baptiſm.
The later which indeed was the principal,
was here conferr'd on babes, which ſhews
them capable of the other, as being the
leſſe Spiritual part of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>

they ought not to be Baptized.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection may with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
advantage, be alſo enforced againſt
the Baptizing of men arrived at years of
diſcretion, many of them are profane in
their hearts, though they cunningly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
the ſame. Hypocrites will never
be kept out of the Church; Be the doors

they will creep in at the windows; yea,

It is placed in the middle betwixt adou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Firſt, If the dumb and deaf can with ſigns

to Baptiſm, as the third Councel

Thoſe <hi>Mutes</hi> after maturity, can
never recover their hearing and ſpeech
but by miracle, whereas Infants naturally
are capable of both in due ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>We read <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 32. that they brought
one to our Saviour that was deaf, and <hi>had
an impediment in his ſpeech,</hi> not that he
was only troubled with a liſping, or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering,

infirmities are twins, going both together;
yet Chriſt diſcovered in him a ſufficiency
of faith, ſuch as he was pleaſed to accept
for his bodily cure.</p>
                  <p>How more comfortably then may
Chriſtian parents preſume that God will
graciouſly behold their Infants, who
though deaf (that is not hearing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand)
and dumb, not able to ſpeak, may in
proceſſe of time arrive to the uſe of both.
That God I ſay, who when with a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

favourable looking for it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, ſuch perſons defective in their

                  <p>This cannot be done by infants; their

and the Captive Infants of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
are to be Baptized.</head>
                  <p>SOme maintain that <hi>infancy</hi> alone, is
the <hi>requiſite</hi> to qualifie <hi>Infants</hi> to be
Baptized: Others upon juſt grounds
conceive a choice muſt be made of the
infants admitted thereunto, and thoſe
moſt ſcrupled at, fall under the following
<hi>Quaternion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt are the Children of <hi>Profane
Parents,</hi> living within the pale of the
Church, ſuch as I may ſorrowfully terme
<hi>Pagan Chriſtians;</hi> Chriſtians by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
<hi>Pagans</hi> by their notorious viſible
debauched converſation: Otherwiſe I
confeſſe the words <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>profane</hi> in our
modern <hi>Religious Canting,</hi> made by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
words of <hi>party</hi> and <hi>intereſt,</hi> to cry up
or decry ſuch who in <hi>private opinions,</hi> or
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:114646:92"/>
                     <hi>civil concernments</hi> agree with, or diſſent
from them; The queſtion is if ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Parents <hi>alone</hi> tender their children
to baptiſm, and deſire the ſame, whether
or no ought they to be admitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?
I ſay <hi>alone,</hi> for if a good Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
or Grand-mother (the mediate
Parent) ſurvive, conjoyn with them in
ſuch a <hi>tender,</hi> the caſe is ſufficiently clear,
that Baptiſm cannot be denied unto it.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer. If any one, related as kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or friend to this childe, will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
conditionally (<hi>viz.</hi> if he himſelf live,
and God bleſſe his endeavours, farther
then which, parents themſelves ought
not to promiſe and cannot perform) for
the education thereof, as <hi>Judah</hi> in another
caſe, for the <hi>bringing up</hi> of his brother
<hi>Benjamin</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 43. 9. <hi>I will
be ſurety for him, at my hands ſhalt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
him,</hi> baptiſm ought not to be denied
unto it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſuppoſe ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
cannot be found, ſeeing <hi>he who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth</hi>
[eſpecially Spiritual] <hi>ſuretiſhip is
ſure,</hi> Prov. 11. 15. and one may juſtly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:114646:93"/>
ſuſpect according to the proverb, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
16. 44. <hi>As is the mother, ſo is the daughter;</hi>
that ſuch a childe will follow the vicious
examples and diſpoſitions of his parents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here I deſire the Reader to call
to mind (to ſpare my repetition thereof)
what formerly Chap. 4. we have written
of wicked mens ſharing in the <hi>foederal
right</hi> to Circumciſion. Let him alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Apoſtles words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16.
<hi>If the root be holy ſo are the branches.</hi> Now
the <hi>root</hi> we know is <hi>under ground,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen;</hi>
and, although the immediate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
be bad, yet charity commands us to
believe, that, ſome generations removed,
the anceſtors of this child (whom Divine
Providence <hi>appointing the bounds of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
Acts</hi> 17. 26. would have born
within the <hi>pale</hi> of the Church) might be
holy and religious. We have a ſaying,
<hi>Every beggar is deſcended from ſome King,
and every King is deſcended from ſome beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi>
Truer it is, that (if the pedegrees
of people were ſtrictly examined) <hi>every
pious perſon is extracted from ſome profane,
and every profane from ſome pious anceſtor;</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:114646:93"/>
a motive in my opinion not to deny ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm
to the childe of bad parents if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
the ſame. Paſſe we from them to
<hi>Baſtards,</hi> againſt whoſe baptizing ſome
object.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Baſtards amongſt the Jews
were not to be Circumciſed, which may
thus be proved: It was faſhionable for
the mother at her purification, to preſent
her Circumciſed ſon in the Temple to the
Lord, as may appear by the example of
the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> Luke 2. 22. But Baſtards,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 2. were forbidden entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the congregation, unto the tenth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
Therefore they were not Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the <hi>not entring into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the Lord,</hi> is meant, <hi>munus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum
in populo Dei ne gerito; let him not
bear office in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> people of God.</hi> Indeed
<hi>Jephthah,</hi> though the <hi>ſon of an harlot,
Judg.</hi> 11. 2. was choſen a <hi>General,</hi> becauſe
neceſſity conſtrained it; and Military of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
(where valour alone was a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
qualification) were not confined to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:114646:94"/>
the regularity requiſite to religious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments:
Otherwiſe certain it is, firſt,
that wantonneſſe in this kinde was too
frequent amongſt the Jews; our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
expreſſion to <hi>commit folly</hi> with a
woman, being borrowed from <hi>Thamars</hi>
words to <hi>Amnon,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>do not
thou this folly.</hi> Secondly, that baſtards
ſo begotten, were excluded Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is what no wiſe or learned author
durſt ever affirm.</p>
                  <p>More particularly: If the parents of
baſtards publickly profeſſe their peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to the congregation, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the ſame eſtate they were in
before the fault committed, and their
children to be held as of unſtain'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.
Far be it from me to ſcatter
any thing, which may occaſion the leaſt
countenance to wantonneſſe in any. What
ſaid the reſt of the Iſraelites, to the Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benites?
<hi>Joſh.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>Is the iniquity of
Peor too little for us, from which we are not
cleanſed until this day?</hi> that they ſhould
contract (as they ſuſpected) the guilt of a
new idolatry. Is <hi>original</hi> ſin too little to
condemn a child, but that parents muſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:114646:94"/>
                     <hi>double-hatch</hi> their children with guilt of
their adulterous nativity? However, for
the comfort of the penitent, know that
only <hi>four females</hi> are mentioned in our
Saviours pedegree, and all of them <hi>ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized.</hi>
1. <hi>Thamar</hi> inceſtuous. 2. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
an harlot. 3. <hi>Ruth</hi> a Moabiteſſe (and
therefore a dog, no ſheep of <hi>Iſrael:</hi>) And
4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> the wife of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> certainly an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe,
and too probably privy to the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of her huſband. Thus Chriſt came, as
for ſinners, ſo from ſinners, &amp; thoſe noted
ones, for uncleanneſſe, whoſe children
notwithſtanding were undoubtedly Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed.
As no <hi>bar of baſtardy</hi> can bolt
out an infants right to the Sacrament,
nor his benefit, by it if God will have it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
therein. Proceed we from theſe, to
<hi>expoſed children,</hi> left on bulkes and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
by their parents deſerting them,
whoſe title to baptiſm ſeems doubtful,
and difficult to many on this account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> The Children of thoſe who
are worſe then infidels may not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
But the parents of theſe children are
worſe then infidels, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. becauſe,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:114646:95"/>
                     <hi>not providing for them of their own houſe.</hi>
Therefore they ought not to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such who out of careleſneſſe
or cruelty, wilfully refuſe to maintain
their own, are in this particular act mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
worſe then infidels (of whom many
high Chriſtians fall ſhort in civil perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances;)
yea, worſe then birds, and
beaſts, which hatch, and ſuckle their own
young ones. Yet they are not in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
capacity worſe then infidels, as if
thereby they had forfeited their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
right for them, and theirs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
charity herein commands us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the beſt. That theſe parents are
not with the <hi>Oſtrich, hardned againſt their
young ones, as though they were not theirs;</hi>
but that there being a long combate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
their induſtry, and poverty, the
latter at laſt got the conqueſt; and they
thereby forced to leave their children to
a general providence. An act which may
rather be in ſome ſort excuſed, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
yea, the cauſe thereof rather pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied,
then the deed it ſelf in any ſort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:114646:95"/>
Say not, ſuch poor parents, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened
with charge of children,
ought to complain to the officers of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> Church, who (no doubt) on the
diſcovery of their ſad condition, would
order their relief. Yea, it is ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
the cauſe of their poverty is not
excuſable, whoſe pride is ſo damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that they would not ſeaſonably
confeſſe the ſame to ſuch, who might,
and ought to be helpful unto them.
All this is confeſſed, with many more
<hi>grains of guilt,</hi> which might be caſt
into the <hi>ſcale</hi> of the parents; but of
no weight on the other ſide, againſt
the children, and therefore ought not
to hinder their baptiſm, I mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally,
in caſe they were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>baptized.</hi> Here I will not inſtance
in <hi>expoſed children,</hi> who afterwards
have proved eminent inſtruments of
Gods glory in the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
ſo that, <hi>Pſal. 27. 10.
when their father and mother forſook
them, then the Lord took them up;</hi>
yea, advanced them to high prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114646:96"/>
I ſay, I purpoſely forbear
ſuch inſtancing, leſt the remembrance
of the meanneſſe of their original,
ſhould any whit abate our deſerved
reſpect unto their memories.</p>
                  <p>It is faſhionable in ſuch caſes (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in popular places) for the
whole pariſh to be <hi>loco parentis,</hi> and
to be interpreted as the parent, for the
education of ſuch expoſed children.
For my own part I had rather bring
oyl to, then caſt water on any chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
deſign. Yet give me leave, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to admoniſh ſuch to take heed, that
that be not neglected of all, which is
expected of many. It is the argument
urged by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> againſt <hi>Plato</hi>'s fancy,
that all children ſhould be brought up
by the care, and at the coſt general of
all alike, that what is every mans work
is no mans work; and it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the catechizing, and inſtructing
ſuch children, will not effectually be
done by any, where all are equally
engaged unto it, except ſome be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
and particularly deſigned for
the ſame.</p>

Children of Pagans <hi>remain, taken
from them when infants: What the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the Ancients was herein, we
may learn from</hi> Fulgentius, De Veritate
praedeſt. lib. 1. <hi>who ſaith,</hi> Parvulum paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus
infidelibus violenter ablatum, aut
furto ſurreptum, ſi ad ſanctum baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
quorumlibet Sanctorum pia chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
producatur, &amp; mox ut baptizatus
fuerit de hac vita diſcedat, factum eſſe
haeredem Dei, &amp; cohaeredem Chriſti.
That a little child violently taken, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
ſtolen from infidel parents; if by
the pious charity of any Saints, it be
brought to holy baptiſm, and by and by
ſo ſoon as it hath been baptized depart
this life, is made the heir of God, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir
of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>However, becauſe ſome may think
this goes too far, and that a difference
ought to be made betwixt children
of Chriſtian parents, who have (as
<hi>Tertullian</hi> phraſeth it) <hi>Seminis praeroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivam,
The priviledge of the ſeed whence
they ſpring;</hi> and thoſe of meer Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:
And becauſe all things ought
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114646:97"/>
to be done in the Church, <hi>decently and
in order;</hi> it is fitteſt and ſafeſt, that the
baptizing of ſuch infants be deferred,
till they be able in their own perſons to
give an account of their faith. Such
cautious deferring of the Sacrament,
offereth no injury, nor occaſioneth
any danger unto them, but will tend
at laſt to their greater advantage.</p>
                  <p>When Mr <hi>Cranmer,</hi> (after Arch-Biſhop

of the ſufficiency of ſuch who
Commenced in Divinity; he denyed
many their Degrees for want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent

theſe, compelled by their repulſe to

                  <p>For the firſt; I find one <hi>Balthaſar
Pacimontanus,</hi> about the year of our

pretending, belike, that he
fetcht the firſt principles thereof out

I cannot learn what heretical opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
this man maintained, that the
demerit of them ſhould deſerve death.
If it were only for denying infants ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,
I conceive all the ſpectators at

by their tears to have quenched the
fire. Indeed I would have all of his

held not in our Saviour, being piety
it ſelf, though converſing with Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans

generally it fails not but that men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,

not therefore make any conſcientious
Chriſtians, juſtly wary to entertain
the doctrine of Anti-pedo-baptiſm,

                  <p>Some will ſay, there was no

Who knows not, but an honeſt man

I was never bred in the <hi>ſchool of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and am loath to load the doctrine

unity and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
concord which was betwixt the Saints
and Servants of God in the infancy of the
Church, after <hi>Christs</hi> aſcenſion, <hi>Acts 1. 14.
Theſe all continued with one accord.</hi> Acts 2. 1.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114646:101"/>
They were all with one accord in one place. 2. 46
Continuing daily with one accord in the
Temple. <hi>So again,</hi> Acts 4 24. Lift up their
voice to God with one accord. <hi>And again,</hi>
Acts 5. 12. All with one accord in <hi>Solomons</hi>
porch.</p>
                  <p>2. Some perchance may impute this
their unity to the paucity and fewneſs of the
Profeſſours of the Goſpel in that age. It is
no wonder (will they ſay) if an handfull of
men did agree, which is impoſſible now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
in the numeroſity of ſo many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
But know, that even then there were
enough, even amongſt the <hi>three thouſand</hi>
Converts made by S. <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, to
furniſh out (allowing a <hi>Leader,</hi> and <hi>Follower</hi>
to each Faction) <hi>fifteen hundred</hi> ſeveral <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.</hi>
No, it was not their ſmall number,
but the vigorous acting of the Spirit of
unity on their Hearts which kept them in
ſuch agreement. God foreſeeing, <hi>Rents</hi>
would quickly ruine his Infant Church,
bound them together the faſter in the <hi>hand</hi>
of <hi>Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. But alas, this unity was too fine ware
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114646:101"/>
to have much meaſure thereof. The virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of it was firſt loſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 1. about a
money-matter, (and money we know parteth
the deareſt friends, many differences ariſing
about the queſtion, what ſhould be <hi>jure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi>
and what <hi>jure humano,</hi> but more about
<hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi>) the unequal [conceived]
diſtribution of the <hi>collection-money</hi> for the
Poor. The Heathen Philoſopher bitterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
againſt the <hi>Schiſmatical Number</hi> of
<hi>Two,</hi> which durſt make the firſt defection,
and departure from the intireneſs of <hi>One.</hi>
But we have too juſt cauſe to bemoan this
unhappy difference, which firſt <hi>brake the
Ranks,</hi> made the firſt jarring in the muſick
of the Primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>4. The ſecond ſad difference was, <hi>Acts</hi>
15. 1. about the unſeaſonable and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
preſſing of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> by ſome as
abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>Except ye
be circumciſed after the manner of</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye
cannot be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. The third dolefull falling out, we
finde in the ſame Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 39. being ſo
much the ſadder than either of the former,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114646:102"/>
becauſe happening not btwixt infirm and
ignorant (though pious) people, but thoſe,
who for grace and knowledg were moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and formerly had been familiar and
intimate boſom-friends, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi>
Then the Devil endeavoured to deal with
Gods Church, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſerved the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Dagon, Judg.</hi> 16. 29. <hi>He took hold of
the two middle pillars, upon which the houſe
ſtood, and on which it was born up,</hi> and no
doubt by ſhaking and claſhing them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
had ſhattered the whole Fabrick, had
not divine providence prevented it, ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>diviſion</hi> into the <hi>multiplication</hi> of
the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>6. It is enough to ſatisfie, (if not to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet)
us, to inſiſt onely on this <hi>first three,</hi>
theſe <hi>original</hi> diſſentions in the Primitive
Church, which ever ſince have too truly
been copied out. As lately in the <hi>Acts of
the Apostles,</hi> we often met, <hi>with one accord,
with one accord,</hi> with one accord; ſo look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into their <hi>Acts,</hi> who (though no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles)
are <hi>Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> we more frequently finde,
<hi>with many diſcords, with many diſcords, with
many diſcords,</hi> ſuch their diſſenting in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114646:102"/>
and diſagreeing in affections. It will
therefore be a ſeaſonable ſubject for us to
treat of, how we ought to behave our ſelves
to ſuch Brethren as for the preſent diſſent
from us in judgment, and what hope we may
juſtly conceive of their future agreement
with us. Hearken herein to my Text, out
of which we may extract, not onely counſel
what to do, but alſo comfort what to hope
in this kinde. <hi>And if in any thing, ye be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
minded, God ſhall reveal even this
unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. The words, (though ſhort in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
contain the <hi>Uuhappineſs,</hi> and the
happineſs, of the Servants of God. And
know to your comfort, the Unhappineſs is
firſt, and the Happineſs comes after, to cloſe
and conclude all; and <hi>and all is well, that ends
well,</hi> yea the unhappineſs is but <hi>ſuppoſitive,</hi>
what <hi>may be;</hi> the happineſs <hi>poſitive,</hi> what
<hi>ſhall be.</hi> The unhappineſs, is this, a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of good men in matters of religion, to be
otherwiſe minded one from another. The
Happineſs is a gracious Promiſe, that ſuch
who erroniouſly diſſent, from their Brethren,
ſhall in due time agree when the Truth ſhall
be revealed to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:114646:103"/>In the ſuppoſition the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis</hi>
of two words
muſt be examined.
<list>
                        <item>And if in
<hi>ANY</hi> thing.</item>

the pale of Gods Church. However let us
give this <hi>Ye</hi> the true dimenſions thereof.
Let us not extend it too far as to include Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
or ſuch pretended Chriſtians, as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
overturn all the foundations of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Nor let us contract this <hi>Ye</hi> too ſmall,
as to confine it to the <hi>Philippians</hi> alone,
which reacheth all Chriſtians, though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
in the ſuperſtructures, conſenting
in the Fundamentalls of Religion. If there
be a Ye or a Your in all this Epiſtle, to the
<hi>Philippians</hi> (as Chap 4. 5. <hi>Let your moderation
be made known to all men</hi>) which enjoyneth
any precept, certainly all Chriſtians, as well
as the <hi>Philippians,</hi> are obliged and engaged
to the performance of it; at their own pain
and perill of the neglect thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the ſame rule of proportion, Every
Chriſtian may juſtly claim a right and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in all promiſes made to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi>
and this among the reſt the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereafter of truths unto them, hitherto
concealed from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114646:103"/>
9. <hi>And if in any thing.</hi> Any thing. Far
be it from us to ſhrink a larg Text with a
narrow comment S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth <hi>any thing,</hi>
let not us ſay <hi>ſomthing,</hi> Be they <hi>otherwiſe
minded,</hi> in matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> or of <hi>Faith,</hi> or
of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> what ever it
be, (for it needs muſt be <hi>nothing,</hi> which
comes not with the reach or compaſs
of <hi>any thing</hi>) God will reveal it unto them.
Here let us take notice, what was the laſt
matter, which immediately moved S. <hi>Paul</hi>
to fall on this expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>In the foregoing <hi>verſes</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
a Riddle or ſeeming contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to fleſh and bloud; for he had ſaid.</p>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 12.</bibl>
                  <q>Not as though I were already
perfect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <bibl>Verſ. 15.</bibl>
                  <q>Let us therefore as many as be
perfect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>That perfection which firſt he denyed in
himſelf, preſently he avoweth both in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and many others. This Riddle it ſeems
it would not ſink into the Heads of ſome
of the weaker <hi>Philippians,</hi> how the ſame
Perſon at the ſame time ſhould be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in deed, execution, performance, yet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114646:104"/>
perfect in deſire, intention, endeavour. But
well it is for us, that ſome amongſt the
<hi>Philippians,</hi> through ignorance were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
minded, whoſe error herein gave the
happy occaſion to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> from Gods
mouth to pronounce this comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
both to them and us and all diſſenters,
that <hi>if any be otherwiſe minded, God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
even this unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. DOCT. <hi>Godly men as long as they
live in this world will diſſent in many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of religion.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe none
know either <hi>Perfectly</hi> or <hi>Equally,</hi> in this
life. Not perfectly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>Now we
know in part.</hi> Not equally; for though men
underſtood <hi>imperfectly</hi> in this life, yet if all
underſtood <hi>equally imperfectly,</hi> upon the
ſuppoſition of equal <hi>ingenuouſneſs</hi> to their
<hi>Ingenuity</hi> (that is, that they would readily
embrace what appears true unto them) all
would be of the ſame judgment. <hi>But alas,</hi> as
none ſees clearly, ſo ſcarce any two ſee equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſome are <hi>thick-ſighted,</hi> ſome <hi>ſhort-ſighted,</hi>
ſome <hi>pur-blind,</hi> ſome <hi>ſand-blind,</hi> ſome <hi>half-blind,</hi>
and the worſt of them (bleſſed be
God) better then <hi>ſtark-blind.</hi> Theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114646:104"/>
degrees of ſight, cauſe the difference
of judgment amongſt Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>11. A ſad inſtance, hereof, we have, in
the differences about the Sacraments of
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> What by
divine goodneſs was intended and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
to unite and conjoyn Chriſtians,
hath by mans frailty, and Satans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
been abuſed to make many Rents
and diviſions. About the time when, the
Parties on whom, the manner how,
Baptiſm is to be adminiſtred. But where
Baptiſm hath divided her <hi>Thouſands,</hi> the
Lords Supper hath divided her <hi>Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. Amongſt all the ordinary pot-herbs
which grow in Gardens none more wholeſom
than ſage, (eſpecially at ſome times of the
year,) whoſe Latine name <hi>Salvia,</hi> carrieth
much of <hi>health</hi> therein. Whereupon it is, that
the envious <hi>Toad</hi> commonly neſleth it ſelf
under the roots thereof. Spitefully to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſon
that which otherwiſe is ſo uſefull
for mankinde. Satan being ſenſible of the
great good which generally may redound
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114646:105"/>
to men by the charitable receaving of the
Lords Supper, hath imbittered it with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
and diſſention, betwixt Papiſts and
Proteſtants about Tranſubſtantiation; <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi>
and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> about Conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;
<hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> about the
geſture of genuſlection and Perſons to be
admitted to the Sacrament. And thus mens
diſſenting in judgments being too plainly
proved, ariſing from their proneſs to err,
come we now to the gracious promiſe of
their information in the truth, <hi>God will
reveal even this unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>13. See here S. <hi>Pauls</hi> charity. He ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, let him be <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi>
or let him be <hi>cast out of the Synagogne,</hi> or
<hi>let him be to you as a heathen or a Publican</hi>
but onely <hi>God will reveal even this unto him.</hi>
Here take notice of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
with three ſorts of people. Firſt,
with thee <hi>otherwiſe minded</hi> in my Text,
ſuch, who though not <hi>Orthodox,</hi> are peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and err onely in the leſſer
and ligher points of Religion. For theſe, no
puniſhment capital, or corporal, no penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of pain, or ſhame in purſe or perſon, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114646:105"/>
onely a patient expectation of their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with a comfortable promiſe of the
ſame.</p>
                  <p>14. Secondly with ſuch as <hi>make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
of faith and a good conſcience,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it onely in relation to their own <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture</hi>
therein, maintaining Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to Salvation. Of theſe were <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneus</hi>
and <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Whom
he delivered unto Satan,</hi> that is (as it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
expounded) by Church Cenſures
cut off from <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>viſible Church</hi> and
then being cut off from him, we know to
whoſe ſhare they do fall.</p>
                  <p>15. Thirdly, to ſuch, as not content to
confine their damnable errours to their own
boſom, are active to infect others therewith:
of theſe he ſpeaketh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>I would they
were even cut off that trouble you.</hi> In which
phraſe ſurely more is imported than a bare
Excommunication. For that ſpiritual Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
S. <hi>Paul</hi> ever carried about him: why
then ſhould he <hi>wiſh</hi> what he could <hi>work?
deſire</hi> what he could <hi>do?</hi> if ſo pleaſed. It is
probable therefore that he could have wiſht
them cut off with temporal death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:114646:106"/>
16. Here we ſay nothing of ſuch Doctrines
as bear <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>treaſon</hi> impaledtogether,
pregnant with Sedition to raiſe tumults in a
State. Theſe we leave to the cognizance and
cenſure of the civil Authority; and ſhall
proceed on the promiſe of the Revelation of
truth to the firſt ſort of diſſenting brethren.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Quest.</hi> What, more Revelation
ſtill? When ſhall Chriſtians come to an
end? When ſhall we ſay, <hi>It is finiſhed?</hi>
When ſhall they certainly know the full
meaſure of all which they are to believe and
practice as neceſſary to ſalvation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here be it premiſed, that the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi>
at this time wherein S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote
unto them might expect extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,
(and thoſe <hi>additional</hi> to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
then in being) on an account more
probable to receive them, than any now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
can expect the ſame. For when S. <hi>Paul</hi>
wrote this Epiſtle, ſome of the Goſpels
(and particularly that of S. <hi>Johns</hi>) were
not yet penned, which though placed before
the Epiſtles (as containing the Hiſtory of
our Saviours life which was firſt in time)
yet were written afterwards. But ſeeing long
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114646:106"/>
ſince the Canon of the Scripture is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
yea, <hi>ſigned</hi> and <hi>ſealed</hi> by God, and
delivered to mankinde, it is not onely vain,
but wicked for men to look for more Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
of ſuch things which men ought to
know and believe to their ſalvation. But to
anſwer the queſtion more particularly.</p>
                  <p>18. There are two ſorts of Revelations.<list>
                        <item>One doth <hi>revelare credenda,</hi> reveal
thoſe things which we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</item>
                        <item>The other doth make us <hi>credere reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latis,</hi>
more quickly and firmly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to what hath formerly been
delivered in the Scripture.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt ſort of Revelations are ceaſed in
this Age. As for the ſecond ſort we may
look for them, pray for them, and labour
them, as which God hath promiſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow,
and which the godly dayly receive.
Such Revelations our Saviour gave to the
two Diſciples travelling to <hi>Emaus, Luke</hi> 24.
27. <hi>When he expounded unto them all the
Scriptures.</hi> And in the ſame Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 45.
to the reſt of the Diſciples, <hi>When he opened
their underſtanding, that they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114646:107"/>
the Scriptures.</hi> He made not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<hi>more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> but more plain unto them; not
larger, but clearer unto them. Such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
is intended in the text, to make er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
perſons more clearly to apprehend,
and more firmly to adhere to the truth in
Gods word.</p>
                  <p>19. But <hi>quando, when,</hi> and <hi>quouſque<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how
long Lord holy and true,</hi> how long ſhall thy
ſervants go on in their errours and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?
When ſhall they without fail re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this promiſed Revelation, to have the
truth manifeſted unto them. I anſwer, my
text (beloved) hath not told the time, and
therefore I cannot tell it you. You will ſay,
If the text had told the time, you could
have told it me. Be it ſo, and now both you
and I muſt contentedly be ignorant thereof.
Yet, not to ſatisfie the curious, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious
ſo far as I may, I will more than
conjecture that the punctual time, when this
Revelation ſhall be made.</p>
                  <p>20. Of all the years of thy life, in that
year, moneth, week, day, hour, minute, and
(if any will be ſo hypocritical as to ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114646:107"/>
minutes) in that moment wherein the
hid providence of Heaven ſhall diſcover to
be moſt for Gods glory, and for thy good.
Thou canſt not wiſely wiſh it to be any whit
before that time, and I do confidently aſſure
thee, it ſhall not be any whit after it.</p>
                  <p>21. And yet I dare not be over confident
to promiſe thee, that ſuch Revelation of the
truth ſhall certainly happen to thee in this
life. Many of Gods good ſervants have
gone to the grave with grievous errours
which they have maintained. Yea, it is no
abſurdity to maintain, that the bleſſed in
Heaven are as yet ignorant of many truths,
and that there ſhall be an acceſſion unto
them, as of glory, ſo of knowledg in the
Day of Judgment. Yea, many things of
Gods proceedings ſhall not be revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, untill <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. the day of the
Revelation of the righteous judgment of
God.</p>
                  <p>22. <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſuppoſe it be never at all
revealed unto a man, what is to be conceived
of his final condition who liveth and dieth a
ſtiff defender of a <hi>damnable doctrine?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:114646:108"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Give me leave in the firſt place to
diſtinguiſh of <hi>damnable doctrines,</hi> a phraſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
of two ſenſes. If <hi>damnable</hi> be taken
<hi>paſsively,</hi> for that which ought to be <hi>damned</hi>
or <hi>condemned,</hi> then every errour is in it ſelf a
<hi>damnable</hi> errour. Diſcretion adviſeth us to
refuſe not onely poyſon, but unwholeſom
food; and we ought to condemn a falſhood
<hi>quatenus</hi> a falſhood, though it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with ſalvation. But if <hi>damnable</hi> be
taken <hi>actively</hi> (in which ſenſe it is uſed,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Who privily ſhall bring in damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Hereſies, even denying the Lord that
bought them</hi>) for that which <hi>damneth</hi> or
condemneth the maintainer thereof, then
onely <hi>fundamental</hi> errours in Religion are
<hi>damnable doctrines.</hi> This premiſed, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the queſtion, Gods goodneſs ſo
keepeth his ſervants, that he will not ſuffer
them to fall into damnable errours in
the laſt and worſt acception thereof. As for
ſmaller errours, which deſerve to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
but are not ſo peſtilent as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the maintainers thereof, they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
through the mercy of God and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of <hi>Christ,</hi> on the death-bed of ſuch as
defend them.</p>

                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:114646:108"/>
23. All good Chriſtians pray with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
if not in the ſame words, to the ſame
ſenſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12. <hi>Cleanſe me from my ſecret
ſins.</hi> Whereby is meant, not onely ſuch ſins,
as we deſire and endeavour to hide and keep
ſecret from men, but alſo ſuch as are hidden
and kept ſecret from us, ſuch our <hi>ignorance</hi>
as not to <hi>know,</hi> or <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> as not to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg</hi>
them to be ſins. Now all ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
conſiſtent with ſalvation are remitted
unto the maintainers thereof, under the
maſs, bulk, and heap of <hi>ſecret ſins,</hi> though
they be not, and indeed cannot be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
repented of, becauſe concealed from
him; who committeth them.</p>
                  <p>24. Come we now to ſhew how men
ought to prepare their own hearts for the
more ſpeedy receiving, and ſure retaining of
ſuch <hi>Revelations.</hi> Say not, all ſuch prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are uſeleſs. The Dove of the Spirit
will not build in a Neſt of this making, but
in one of her own providing. For ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
diſpoſing of our ſelves is acceptable
to God, and will expedite the coming of
Revelations unto us. Indeed in the firſt act
of Converſion we are purely paſſive, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114646:109"/>
can in no degree prepare our ſelves being
<hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> But being once
freed by grace, we are free; and may, and
muſt by lawfull means move Gods Spirit to
move us, according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> counſel,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Stir up the grace of God that is in
thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>25. Firſt, diveſt thy ſelf of <hi>Pride.</hi> What
ſaith <hi>Solomon: Prov.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Onely by
pride cometh contention. Onely by pride,</hi> as if
ſuch were the <hi>pride</hi> of <hi>pride,</hi> that it ſcorneth
and diſdaineth to admit a <hi>partner,</hi> or <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
with it ſelf to cauſe contention. And
although <hi>pride</hi> ſometimes be pleaſed out of
ſtate, to accept of other vices in raiſing of
Diſcords, yet ſtill ſhe preſerveth her ſelf
Paramont, making uſe of all the reſt onely
as ſubſervient unto her.</p>
                  <p>26. Now proud men create to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
two needleſs fears, which make them
ſo obſtinately embrace their errours. The
firſt is, that if they alter their opinions,
they muſt confeſs that formerly they have
erred, which confeſſion ſtabbeth Pride, (and
Pride is dextrous in ſtabbing others) under
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114646:109"/>
                     <hi>the fifth rib.</hi> For all men by nature deſire to
be, and to be accounted <hi>petty Popes,</hi> having
the <hi>ſpirit of infallibility</hi> faſtened unto their
<hi>chairs,</hi> ſo that their opinions ſhall paſs for
oracle of undeniable truth.</p>
                  <p>27. The other is, that they ſhall be brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by men for levity and inconſtancy, if once
they offer to change their judgments. This
makes many of them to ſay ſullenly and
ſurlily with <hi>Pilate, John</hi> 19. 22. <hi>What I
have written I have written.</hi> What I have
ſaid, I have ſaid; what I have done, I have
done; what I have defended, I have defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
I will not abate an ace, remit a tittle,
recede an hair from my former opinions.
Whileſt others turn as faſt as the Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock,
I will ſtand as firm as the Steeple, the
rather becauſe otherwiſe I ſhall incur the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
of inconſtancy.</p>
                  <p>28. Whereas let it be but ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
and the renouncing of an errour
which we formerly maintained, argueth not
frailneſs but firmneſs, not levity but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in us. For this is or ought to be the
grand and general reſolution of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114646:110"/>
to imbrace any truth, which appeareth
unto them out of the Word of God.
Wherefore when a Chriſtian renounceth a
particular errour, this is not inconſtancy;
becauſe croſſing the late and leſſer boughs,
but it is conſtancy; becauſe concurring with
the firſt and faireſt Root of his Reſolution,
namely, always to thoſe with the revealed
truth.</p>
                  <p>29. This hath been the practiſe of pious
people in all ages. The hand of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
never ſeemed ſo fair and ſo handſom,
as when he wrot backward, I mean, when
he wrot his <hi>Retractations.</hi> Pale faces, which
otherwiſe are well proportioned, never look
ſo lovely, as when they are caſually betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a bluſh, which ſupplies that colour in
their cheeks which was wanting before.
Good men who once maintained an errour,
never appear more amiable in the eys of
God and the godly, as when bluſhing with
ſhame (not to be aſhamed for) at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of their former faults, which maketh
them more thankfull to God, more humble
in, more carefull over themſelves, and more
charitable to others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:114646:110"/>
30. Well in the firſt place deveſt thy
ſelf of pride, and know that <hi>David</hi> tels us,
how all thoſe ought to be qualified, whom
God intendeth to teach, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25. 9. <hi>The
meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek
will he teach in his way.</hi> The proud are
improper to be Gods Scholars, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themſelves able to be his Teacher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and wiſe enough to inſtruct him.</p>
                  <p>31. Secondly deveſt thy ſelf of Paſſion,
than which nothing more prejudicial to the
judgment. Fire is accounted an hurtfull
object to the eye, as water is eſteemed an
helper thereof to look upon it, comforting
and uniting (as the other ſcattereth) the
viſive beams. What then when the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder
is all fire, I mean all paſſion and
choller, is it probable that during this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
the ſpirit will deſcend upon him?
Obſerve the carriage of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>K.</hi> 3. 15.
(being in an high rapture of anger with
<hi>Joram.</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for his ſubmiſſive
applications unto him in his diſtreſs when
he and three Armies were likely to die of
thirſt) and now ſaith he, bring me a Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrel
namely, by Muſick to pacifie himſelf
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114646:111"/>
and to diſpoſe his ſoul for the regular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and ſolemn entertainment of the
ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which accordingly came to paſs
<hi>when the Minſtrel played the hand of the
Lord came upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>32. See we here in the firſt place, that
it is lawfull to uſe all good means to invite
the Spirit to deſcend upon us. <hi>The Spirit
of the Prophets,</hi> was never <hi>ſo ſubject to the
Prophets,</hi> as to come at their call and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
Secondly though <hi>Eſhiſhah</hi> in anger for
the man was holy anger (juſtly offended with
King <hi>Joram,</hi> for making Idolatrous Prieſts
his <hi>choiſe</hi> in proſperity, and Gods Prophet
his <hi>refuge</hi> in adverſity) yet he was ſenſible
to himſelf, that he was diſturbed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed
therewith. And though the
cauſe of his anger was juſt, and <hi>matter</hi> of
his anger commendable, yet poſſibly the
<hi>meaſure thereof,</hi> might be faulty, (<hi>Eliſha</hi>
being like <hi>Eliah,</hi> and <hi>Eliah a man ſubject
to like pasſions as we are,</hi> James 5. 17. And
He might ſee in himſelf (what others ſaw
not in him) that he was too much tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with paſſion, and perchance did too
much inſult on the preſent perplexity and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114646:111"/>
extremity of King <hi>Jehoram.</hi> Wherefore
conceiving that He in <hi>the ſtill voice,</hi> would
not come to one in ſo loud a <hi>pasſion,</hi> he
calls for a Minſtrel, ſo to reduce, pacate,
and compoſe his Soul, that it might return
to a quiet temper: Whence it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
what an enemy Paſſion is generally
to the receiving of Gods Spirit, and that
all thoſe which deſire a Revelation of the
truth unto them, muſt labour to deveſt
themſelves thereof.</p>
                  <p>33. Thirdly deveſt thy ſelf of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs.
Here take notice, how eaſily men
are perſwaded to embrace thoſe opinions
(though never ſo erroneous,) which bring
in profit unto them: for inſtance; One with
weak ſinnews of <hi>Logick,</hi> &amp; worſe colours of
<hi>Rhetorick</hi> will quickly perſwade a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to be a convert in this point, that he
is not bound to pay Tithes to his Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>34. On the other ſide it is hard to wean
men from ſucking on thoſe Opinions
which are ſweetned unto them by commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.
<hi>For by this craft we get our gain,</hi> Acts
19. 25. No wonder if the Pope zealouſly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114646:112"/>
maintaineth Purgatory, ſeeing that Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
ſo plentifully maintaineth the Pope.
The ſame may be ſaid of other lucrative
errours in their Religion, Pilgrimages, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
Prayers to the Saints, Prayers for the
dead, <hi>&amp;c. Scylla omnes ſuos divitiis implevit,</hi>
it was the policy of that cunning Senatour
to enrich all of his party tyed by their
purſe-ſtrings the faſter unto him; whereas
the Antifaction of the <hi>Marians</hi> being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo well monied by their Patron
cleaved not ſo ſtedfaſtly unto him. Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
errors ſoon gain and long keep ſuch as
deſire them; whereas ſpeculative opinions
which terminate onely in the brains having
little influence on mens practiſe and leſs
on their profit are nothing ſo taking of men,
and men nothing ſo tenacious of them.</p>
                  <p>35. As for the errour of ſuch as deny
the Baptiſing of Infants, we have cauſe to
conceive the greater hopes of their return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the truth, becauſe that their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can not make them a <hi>thred,</hi> or a <hi>ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latchet</hi>
the richer by the maintaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<hi>Tully</hi> ſaith of our <hi>Brittainy</hi> in his time,
(when <hi>Caeſar</hi> rather diſcovered than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114646:112"/>
it) that it had naturally, <hi>Ne micam
auri aut argenti,</hi> not <hi>a crum of gold or ſilver,</hi>
as within the bowels of the earth thereof.
So may I ſay of the Doctrine of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poedo-baptiſm,</hi>
it is a bare and poor opinion,
<hi>Gold and Silver it hath none,</hi> and therefore,
(alone of it ſelf) is never probable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
the patrons and defenders thereof.</p>
                  <p>36. And yet as <hi>Tully:</hi> went a little too
far, in condemning <hi>Brittain,</hi> as utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
of Silver oar, and is diſproved by the
induſtry of our Age, which ſome years
ſince hath diſcovered Silver mines in <hi>Wales,</hi>
ſo poſſibly this opinion may be more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
to the defenders thereof, than is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to the eye of every common beholder.
It may be it may make them more capable
of preferment, and that either they are or
conceive themſelves to be in a better proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to advancement by maintaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as more favourably reflected on than
others; as if this opinion gave the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
teſtimony of their good affections to the
preſent government, whereby they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
themſelves: the next <hi>reverſions</hi> to
preferment I believe they miſtake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114646:113"/>
therein, and that no ſuch partiality
is in the preſent ſtate. However let them
examine their own ſouls and deveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
of covetouſneſs in caſe they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
to themſelves that expectation of
profit inclines them to this opinion.</p>
                  <p>37. Come we now to Poſitive counſels,
what we ought to perform. And here I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
ſome will be offended at the ſimplicity
&amp; plainneſs of them. There is a book entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>De medecinis facilè parabilibus, of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
which may eaſily be procured,</hi> and very
good for ſuch w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> take Phyſick <hi>in forma pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris.</hi>
Yea generally it is conceived nothing
ſo much detracteth from the worth of thoſe
medicines, as the cheapneſs and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
thereof, ſo that if we did but fetch
from the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> what now groweth in our
gardens, it would then be accounted a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Drug which now we eſteem a common
Potherb. In like manner I fear that theſe our
counſels, ſhall be undervalued for the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſs
and obviouſneſs of them. If a Soul-Mount-abank,
ſhould preſcribe ſuch new fangled
means, which was never heard of
before, he ſhould get more patients than all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114646:113"/>
the grave Phyſicians of the City. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we will adventure to preſcribe theſe
plain means which God hath preſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us.</p>
                  <p>38. Firſt, pray to God, that he that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
and no man ſhutteth, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and no man openeth, would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in his own due time to reveal all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
truths unto thee. Secondly, be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in reading Gods Word. <hi>Luther</hi> did
profeſs that when he firſt began to write
againſt the Pope, many fancies were put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his head, plauſible to fleſh and bloud, but
groundleſs on Scripture, which made him
daily to pray, <hi>Domine in verbo, Domine in
verbo,</hi> Lord teach me in thy Word.</p>
                  <p>39. Thirdly, be carefull in keeping the Lords
day, not with any ſuperſtitious but godly
obſervation thereof. On what day did
God reveal the <hi>Revelation</hi> to S. <hi>John?</hi> On
the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. Thus Princes uſe
to beſtow their Boons, and confer their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
chiefly on thoſe days, which more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
are called their days; as on the Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
of their Births or Coronations. Fourthy,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114646:114"/>
Repair to the place of Gods Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Fifthly, as the Magiſtrate bears not
the <hi>Sword</hi> in vain, the Miniſter bears not
the <hi>Word</hi> in vain. But leaſt we Miniſters
ſhould ſeem to plead our own cauſe herein
we leave this to God to plead for us.</p>
                  <p>39. <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome erroneous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
will be ready to ſay unto me, as the
young man did to our Saviour in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<hi>All theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have I done from my
youth.</hi> I have conſtantly prayed, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
read, and conſcienciouſly kept the
Lords day, and diligently repaired to the
publick Miniſtery, and have endeavoured to
deveſt my ſelf of pride, paſſion, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,
and yet no errour is revealed to
me, which I formerly maintained. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I conclude my ſelf to be in the right.
Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb, as it hath much of
rudeneſs, ſo it hath no leſs of truth therein,
<hi>One is not bound to ſee more than he can.</hi>
And I conceive I am in no errour, becauſe I
follow my preſent light, and all the means
of your preſcription have made no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on my underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:114646:114"/>
40. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Give me leave to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
over theſe Objectors, with a godly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie.
I exſpect not the validity of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
preſcribed, but ſuſpect their effectual
application thereof, whether or no they
have ſincerely practiſed the ſame; this I
am ſure, as <hi>men</hi> can ſcarcely (for the main)
give <hi>other,</hi> ſo <hi>Angels</hi> can give no <hi>better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>41. And here I ſhall deceive their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
who conceive that on the ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the former Receipts, I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to preſcribe other means, whereby a
brother diſſenting from the truth, ſhall be
reclamed unto it. Onely I remember a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of <hi>Eliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 34. when accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his command, they had once poured
water upon the Altar, <hi>And he ſaid, Do it
again, and they did ſo the ſecond time; and
he ſaid, Do it the third time, and they did it
the third time alſo.</hi> The next ſeven years,
(if thou liveſt ſo long) pray, reade, keep
the Lords day, attend on Gods publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
and in caſe the truth be not then
revealed unto thee, the next ſeven years (if
thou liveſt ſo long) do the like. I have no
alteration, but a meer repetition, of what
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114646:115"/>
already hath been preſcribed: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we proceed to give inſtructions to ſuch
who by the benefit of theſe means are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
reclamed from their errours A word
or two how they ſhould behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>42. Firſt, practiſe our Saviours precept
to S. <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

thy ſelf in the <hi>peaceable poſſeſsion</hi> of a
truth, untill ſuch time as thou haſt impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to others: the rather becauſe it is
more than probable, that by thy example,
(if of any eminency) thou haſt invited
others to, or confirmed others in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and therefore in civility and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
thou ſtand'ſt obliged to undeceive
them.</p>
                  <p>43. In <hi>Hungaria</hi> they have a cuſtome,
that a Gentleman wears ſo many Feathers
as he hath killed <hi>Turks</hi> And truly, a <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>44. But O how glorious in Heaven will
S. <hi>Peter</hi> appear? who at the preaching of
one Sermon gained <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 4. <hi>three thouſand
ſouls.</hi> What a Conſtellation, what a Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſtars will he alone be?</p>
                  <p>45. <hi>See the</hi> pathetical expoſtulation, <hi>and
the</hi> ingenuous <hi>confeſſion of S.</hi> Paul <hi>before
King</hi> Agrippa, Acts 26. 8. <hi>His</hi> pathetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation,
Why ſhould it be thought a thing
incredible with you, that God ſhould raiſe the
dead? His ingenious confeſsion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I verily
thought with my ſelf that I ought to do many
things <hi>contrary,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How freely and fully
doth he acknowledg his fault, labouring to

                  </p>
                  <p>46. This wrought ſo far with <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
that it made him a <hi>Demi, Almoſt a Chriſtian.

47. Who knoweth what may come to

might but live to hear ſome of our; yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
brethren, after their returning to the
truth, to argue the caſe thus with thoſe

own Precedent, that ſuch as err may ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be reclamed.</p>
                  <p>48. Come we to ſhew how the ſtanders

49. Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> load them not with opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Language, of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and the like.
Be more charitable in thy words to them,
and thoughts of them. Though they ſhould
account us <hi>Dogs,</hi> let us account them <hi>Sheep,</hi>
but what <hi>Sheep? wandring Sheep.</hi> Though
they eſteem us <hi>Baſtards,</hi> we will eſteem
them <hi>children,</hi> but what <hi>children? prodigal
children.</hi> We will think better of them than
they think of us, (though not ſo well as
they think of themſelves) and no diſcreet
perſon will conclude, our faith the worſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our charity is the more.</p>
                  <p>50. Secondly, widen not the wound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us, to make it worſe than it is. And if
thou haſt occaſion to ſtate the controverſie
betwixt us and them, deal fairly in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Do not paint them of a blacker com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
than they be, neither repreſent their
opinions partially to their diſadvantage.</p>
                  <p>51. Here under favour I conceive, that it
is fit at a Diſputation in the Schools, to
charge them home, with all the dangerous
or abſurd Conſequences, which reſult na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
from their erroneous opinions. We
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114646:117"/>
may bring a juſt <hi>action</hi> againſt them, and at
the <hi>ſuit</hi> of <hi>Logick</hi> arreſt them for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch abominable Conſequences: we
may lay the ugly <hi>Brats</hi> at their fathers
doors, that they may have the ſhame and
pain in getting them, the coſt and charge to
provide for them. As <hi>is the Mother, ſo is the
Daughter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>52. But in caſe our <hi>diſſenting brethren</hi>
ſhall diſclame ſuch Conſequences, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
from their hearts deteſt and abhor
ſuch damnable Deductions which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
naturally and inevitably flow from
their own erroneous principles, conceive
that, though they may be preſt with ſuch
conſequences in the Schools they may not
be charged with them <hi>in foro conſcientiae.</hi>
But that onely they are anſwerable to God
for the primitive errour, and not for ſuch
derivative ones, which notwithſtanding are
the undoubted off-ſpring thereof.</p>
                  <p>53. Laſtly, when they ſhall recant their
errours willingly, chearfully, greedily, give
unto them <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>the right hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>
Indeed the <hi>left hand</hi> by <hi>vulgar tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:114646:117"/>
(not to ſay <hi>miſtake</hi>) is preſumed nearer
to the <hi>heart,</hi> but the <hi>right hand</hi> if not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(by cuſtome) is the ſtronger and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Say not, I muſt make ſome difference
betwixt thoſe, that never left, and thoſe
who lately returned to the truth. My <hi>right
hand</hi> I muſt reſerve for ſuch who never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from the right way, my <hi>left hand</hi> ſhall
ſerve thoſe who were brought back unto it.
O no, love both alike, and though the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of thy heart be equal to both, if
there be any odds in thy behaviour, expreſs
moſt love to thoſe <hi>Reverts,</hi> ſo to invite
more to come over to the truth.</p>
                  <p>54. Do any hear my Sermon this day
who diſſent from me, and many other, (and
indeed from all the practiſe of the ancient
Primitive Church) in the point of baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Infants. O let ſuch conſider what
hath been ſaid by us in this point, and God
give them underſtanding, and on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
of truth unto them, let them inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly
renounce their own erroneous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                  <p>55. Never be aſhamed to do that, which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114646:118"/>
wil bring ſafety to your ſelves, glory to God,
joy to Angels, grief to none but ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
at your deſtruction. We may obſerve
in Horſes, that after a ſtumble, for ſome paces
they go better and quicker than before. Some
impute this to their fear, to be beaten, and
deſire to avoid it; others to their generoſity,
to make amends for their former fault, with
double diligence.</p>
                  <p>56. <hi>Be not like the Horſe and Mule which
hath no understanding, Pſalm</hi> 32. 9. that is,
do not imitate them in their brutiſh head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrongneſs.
Yet be like the Horſe and Mule
in their commendable conditions, (as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
far above Piſmires, and Lillies) imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
thoſe generous principles which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
of Nature hath put into them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
what is paſt in your ſtumbling by
your future activity; in going the faſter in
the path of truth and righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>57. To conclude, there is for the preſent
a great Gulph and diſtance betwixt you and
us in our opinions. Indeed though we ſhould
deſire it, we dare not approach nearer unto
you in point of judgment. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114646:118"/>
even of his brother S. <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>To whom
we gave place, no not for an hour, that the
truth of the Goſpel might continue with you.</hi>
We may not yield to you, no, not a hairs
breadth. We have already <hi>in ſtating the
Controverſie</hi> betwixt us, drawn as near as we
can without betraying the truth, prejudicing
Gods cauſe, and our own conſciences. And
having gone to the very marches and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
of the truth, we there ſtand on tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes
ready to embrace you if you come to
us, and no otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>58. But as for difference in <hi>affection,</hi> ſeeing
we conceive your error not ſuch as intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on ſalvation, (becauſe not denying but
deferring Baptiſm) and onely in the out limbs
(not vitals of) Religion, wherein a latitude
may and muſt be allowed <hi>to diſſenting bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
we deſire that herein the meaſure of
our love may be without meaſure unto you.
Lightning often works wonders when it
breaketh the Sword, it doth not ſo much as
bruiſe the Scabbard; Charity is a more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
fire, and therefore may be more mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
in its operations. You ſhall ſee that
our love to you, as it doth deteſt and deſires
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114646:119"/>
to deſtroy your errours, ſo it will at the ſame
time, it will ſafely keep, and preſerve your
erroneous perſons.</p>
                  <p>59. For mine own particular, becauſe I
have been challenged (how juſtly God and
my own conſcience knoweth) for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſenes
in my behaviour towards ſome <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
brethren,</hi> in my Pariſh, this I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and God giving me grace I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it. Suppoſe there be one <hi>hundred</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
betwixt me and them in point of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I will go <hi>ninety nine</hi> of them, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they will ſtir the <hi>one odd</hi> pace, to give
them an amicable meeting. But if the Legs
of their Souls be ſo lame, or lazy, or ſullen,
as not to move that one pace towards our
mutual love, we then muſt come to new
<hi>propoſitions.</hi> Let them but promiſe to ſtand
ſtill and make good their ſtation, let them
not go backward, and be more imbitter'd
againſt me than they have been, and of the
<hi>hundred paces,</hi> in point of affection, God
willing, Ile go <hi>twice fifty</hi> to meet them. As
for matter of judgment I ſhall patiently
and hopefully expect the performance of
Gods promiſe in my Text, when to thoſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114646:119"/>
which are otherwiſe minded in the matter of
<hi>Infants Baptiſme,</hi> God will reveal even this
unto them. Amen.</p>

peace, plenty and proſperity of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Danger</hi> thereof, It cauſeth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of the ſpirit, and is deſtructive to
the health of the ſoul. Yea, when this diſeaſe
comes to the <hi>Paroxiſm,</hi> the height and heat
thereof, it becometh diſhonourable to God;
aſperſing and be-libelling him, as if he wanted
Goodneſs, and would not; or Power, and
could not; or Juſtice, and doth not order
matters better then they are.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> thereof it proceedeth from a

                  <p>1 Want of <hi>Faith</hi> to truſt in God.</p>

                  <p>This is the reaſon why the practice of theſe

                  <p>One is a ſerious conſideration, <hi>ver.</hi> 35 of the

It was a good prayer of a <hi>good man, Lord keep

the wicked, <hi>there are no bands in their death:</hi>
and no wonder, when they have all bands af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is a ſtudious obſervation of the

concluſion, <hi>Mark the Perfect, behold the

                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve in the words two general parts:</p>

                  <p>2 <hi>The</hi> direction to the Living.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>deſcription of the Dead,</hi> we have two
particulars:</p>
                  <p>1 What he was. A practicer of Perfection
and Uprightneſs.</p>
                  <p>2 What he is. A poſſeſſour of a peaceable
end.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>direction to the Living</hi> we have an
invitation, or rather an injunction to mark
and behold.</p>
                  <p>1 What was done by the man, when
living: his Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>2 What was done to the man, when dead:
his Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>This our Sermon being now preached in
the juncture of the old and new Year: What

better ſubject to end the old, then to ſpeak
of the deſcription of the dead? What fitter
matter to begin the new, then to treat of the

                  </p>
                  <p>Before we enter on the words, it will be a
charitable work to reconcile the ſeeming va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
betwixt the two Tranſlations: I mean
that which is commonly prefixed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and what is conſtantly inſerted in
the middle of our Bibles.</p>
                  <p>The Old Tranſlation.</p>
                  <q>Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing
that is right, for that ſhall bring a man peace
at the laſt.</q>
                  <p>The New Tranſlation.</p>
                  <q>Mark the Perfect man, and behold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,

                  <p>See here a vaſt difference betwixt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
rendring of the words: <hi>If the Trumpet,</hi>
1 Cor. 14. 8. <hi>give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall
be prepared for the battel?</hi> But where ſhall the
unlearned, though honeſt hearted Reader,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114646:126"/>
diſpoſe of his belief and practice, when
there be ſuch irreconcileable differences in
the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the ſeeming difference ariſeth
from the latitude of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words, ſo
extenſive in their ſignification: for <hi>Shemor</hi>
which in my text is tranſlated, <hi>Mark,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the firſt and moſt frequent acception
thereof: ſignifieth alſo in a ſecondary ſenſe,
to <hi>Keep, ſeeing thoſe things which we mark, we
alſo keep, at the leaſt for ſome ſhort time in our
memorie.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid, that the
word <hi>Behold,</hi> in my Text, is rendered in the
<hi>Old Tranſlation, take heed,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Hebrew</hi> wil
bear both: <hi>Tham</hi> and <hi>Jaſchar,</hi> moſt commonly
and conſtantly denote the <hi>Concrete, Perfect, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
Righteous,</hi> and <hi>Innocent:</hi> But ſometimes
ſignifieth the abſtract alſo, Perfection, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs,
Innocencie. Let not therefore the
two Tranſlations fall out, for they are <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
and both the <hi>ſons</hi> of the ſame <hi>Parent,</hi>
the <hi>Original:</hi> Though give me leave to ſay
the youngeſt <hi>child</hi> is moſt like the <hi>father,</hi> and
the neweſt <hi>Tranſlation</hi> herein, moſt naturally
expreſſeth the ſenſe of the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let none cavil that ſuch laxity in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>

14. 2. The Lord looked down from Heaven upon
the children of men, to ſee if there were any that
did understand and ſeek after God. They are all
gone aſide, they are altogether become filthy, there
is none that doth good, no not one. <hi>But what

the general corruption <hi>ad prae varicatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>
of all mankind by nature; in the latitude
whereof we confeſs the perfect man in my
Text was involved. As all Metals when they
are firſt taken out of the earth, have much
droſs and oar, but by art and induſtrie may
afterwards be refined: ſo the man in my text
was equally evil with all others by nature, till
defecated by grace, and by Gods goodneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to ſuch a height of puritie as in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

                  <p>In a fourfold reſpect may a ſervant of God
be pronounced Perfect in this life.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Comparatively,</hi> in reference to wicked
men, who have not the leaſt degree or deſire
of goodneſs in them. Meaſure a ſervant of

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114646:128"/>
goodneſs he hath with that great proportion
which by Gods law he ought to have, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth

But ſtick we may and muſt to <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the reaſon the Saints are unwilling
to own any other <hi>perfection:</hi> for though God
<hi>Job</hi> 1. 1. is pleaſed to ſtile <hi>Job</hi> a <hi>perfect man,</hi>

God might ſay it, <hi>Iob</hi> durſt not for fear of
pride and preſumption. Indeed <hi>Noah</hi> is the firſt
perſon, who is pronounced <hi>perfect</hi> in <hi>Scripture,
Gen.</hi> 6. 9. But mark I pray what went in the

of the Lord.</hi> Not that his <hi>finding grace</hi> is to be
confined to his particular preſervation from
the Deluge, (which was but one branch or

perſon was by Gods goodneſs accepted of,
<hi>Noahs</hi> perfection more conſiſting in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
then his own amiableneſs, approved
not ſo much becauſe God found goodneſs in

what more uſual then to ſee Gods ſervants
toſſed, tumbled, tortured, tormented, often

deaths. <hi>Cuſhi</hi> being demanded by <hi>David</hi> to
give an account of <hi>Abſaloms</hi> condition, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
18. 32. made this mannerly and politique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:
<hi>The enemies of my Lord the King, and all

                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, if this be a <hi>peaceable

<hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 36. <hi>My kingdom is not of this world:</hi>
So ſay we, to ſalve all objections, our <hi>peace,</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:114646:129"/>
that is the <hi>peace</hi> in our Text, (and God make
it <hi>ours,</hi> not only to treat and hear, but partake
thereof,) <hi>is not of this world,</hi> conſiſteth not in
temporal or corporal proſperity; but is of
a more high and heavenly nature. Indeed this
<hi>peace</hi> is <hi>in</hi> this world, but not <hi>of</hi> this world;
begun here in the calm of a clear and quiet
conſcience, and finiſhed hereafter in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

then become <hi>perfectly peaceable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However we may ſee that ſometimes (I

of his favour on ſome of his ſervants, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at their end a generall calm, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal

                  <p>It once came to paſs in <hi>England</hi> (and but
<hi>once</hi> it came to paſs in <hi>England</hi>) namely, when
<note n="*" place="margin">See his life lately printed.</note> Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> was <hi>Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,</hi>
that the <hi>Cryer</hi> in <hi>Chancery</hi>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114646:130"/>
then there was no more <hi>ſutes</hi> depending in

ripened for Trial, were decided. Then was
<hi>Janus</hi> his Temple ſhut clean throughout
<hi>England,</hi> in Caſes betwixt <hi>Plaintiff</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,</hi>
relating to equity and conſcience.
Whether this proceeded from the peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
of people in that age, not ſo quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and litigious as in ours: or from the
goodneſs of the Judge, either, happy, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
to compound differences without any
ſute; or dextrous, publickly to decide them
with all expedition.</p>
                  <p>But when ſome good man hath lyen on
his <hi>death bed,</hi> though having many ſutes in
his life, all then are ended and compoſed.
Call the <hi>ſute</hi> betwixt this man and his <hi>God,</hi>
long ſince it is attoned, and both made friends
in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Cal the <hi>ſute</hi> betwixt this man and his

Thus I ſay ſometimes, not alwayes,
God graceth ſome of his ſervants that they

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let it retrench our cenſuring of the
final eſtate of thoſe whom we know led god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lives, and we ſee had ſhameful deaths. Let
us expound what ſeems doubtful at their
death, by what was clear in their life. A true
concluſion may ſometimes be inferred from
falſe premiſes: but from true premiſes the
concluſion muſt ever be true. Poſſibly a
good life in the next world, may follow a bad
one in this; namely, where (though late) ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
repentance interpoſeth. But moſt certain
and neceſſary it is, that a good life here muſt
be crowned with a good condition hereafter.
What then though. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> loſt his head
by <hi>Herods</hi> cruelty, he ſtill <hi>held his head</hi> in the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> phraſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. By a lively faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
his dependance on, and deriving life
and comfort from Jeſus Chriſt, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
he may be ſaid to have dyed in peace.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſharp and bitter paſſage in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Luk.</hi> 9. 23. And yet if the ſame be ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a word or two in my Text, it may
not only eaſily be ſwallowed, but alſo will
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114646:133"/>
certainly be digeſted into wholſome nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
the words are theſe, <hi>and let him take
up his Croſs daily and follow me.</hi> His Croſs; ſome
will ſay, I could comfortably comport my
ſelf to carry ſuch a mans Croſs, his is a ſlight,
a light, and eaſie; mine a high, a huge and
heavy Croſs. Oh but children muſt not be
chooſers of that rod where with they are to be
corrected; that is to be let alone unto the
diſcretion of their father. Men may fit cloaths,
but God doth fit Croſſes for our backs: no
Croſs will pleaſe him for thee to take up, but
<hi>thy Croſs,</hi> only that which his providence hath
made thee the proprietarie thereof. Well
take it up, on this aſſurance, that the <hi>end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſhall be peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take up thy Croſs.</hi> Is it not enough that I be
paſſive, and patiently carry it when it is laid
upon me? What a Tyranny is this for me to
<hi>croſs my ſelf</hi> by <hi>taking up my own croſs?</hi> But
God will have it ſo, thou <hi>muſt take it up:</hi> that
is, Firſt thou muſt freely confeſs that nothing
hath befaln thee by chance or fortune, but by
Gods all-ordering Providence. Secondly,
Thou muſt acknowledge that all afflictions
impoſed upon thee, are the juſt puniſhment
of thy ſins deſerved by thee; if inflicted more
heavily, ſeeing all things is mercy which is on
this ſide of hel fire. This it is to <hi>take up thy croſs</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:114646:134"/>
do it willingly, <hi>for it will be peace at the laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt is the worſt word, <hi>Daily.</hi> Not
that God every day ſends us a new affliction,
but he requires that every day we ſhould put
on a habit of <hi>patience,</hi> to undergo whatſoever
croſs is laid upon us. This I conceive to be <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
meaning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 14. <hi>and chaſtened eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
morning. Daily,</hi> ſuperſtitious Fryers never
eſteem themſelves ready till they have put on
their Crucifix, and religious Proteſtants muſt
never accompt themſelves ready till they
have put on their croſs.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts have beſprinkled their Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar
with many <hi>feſtivals,</hi> having no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or ancient Church Hiſtory.
One day they call the <hi>Exaltation of the Croſs,</hi>
which is <hi>May</hi> 3. another the <hi>Invention of the
Croſs,</hi> which is <hi>September</hi> 14. But we muſt
know there is one day of the <hi>Croſs</hi> more, <hi>Day</hi>
which continueth from the beginning to the
end of the year, namely, the <hi>Aſſumption of the
Croſs;</hi> every one muſt take it up daily, do it, &amp;
do it willingly, for the <hi>end thereof wil be peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet there is a fourth thing remaining
in the Text, when we have took up our Croſs
we muſt follow Chriſt; it is not enough to take
it up, and then ſtand ſtill, as if ſuffering gave
us a <hi>ſuperſedeas</hi> for doing; but God at the
ſame time will have our <hi>hands, back,</hi> and <hi>feet</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:114646:134"/>
of our <hi>ſoul</hi> exerciſed; <hi>hands</hi> to take up, <hi>back</hi>
to bear our <hi>Croſs,</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> to follow him; and
happy it is for us, though we cannot go the
ſame pace, if we go the ſame <hi>path</hi> with our
<hi>Saviour;</hi> for the end thereof will be peace.</p>
                  <p>O the amiableneſs of the word <hi>Peace!</hi> oh
the extenſiveneſs of the word <hi>End! Peace?</hi>
what can be finer <hi>ware? End?</hi> what can be
larger <hi>meaſure?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The amiableneſs of Peace, eſpecially to us,
who ſo long have prayed for it, and payed for
it, and ſought for it, and fought for it, and yet
as yet in <hi>England</hi> have not attained it. For the
<hi>Tragoedy</hi> of our war is not ended, but the
<hi>ſcene</hi> thereof removed, and the Element only
altered from <hi>earth</hi> unto <hi>water.</hi> Surely had we
practiſed <hi>Davids</hi> precept, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 14. <hi>Eſchew
evil and do good. ſeek peace and enſue it,</hi> before
this time we had obtained our deſire. It is to
be feared we have been too earneſt proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the laſt, and too ſlow performers of
the firſt part of the verſe: great have been
our deſires, but ſmall our deeds for peace.
Had we <hi>eſchewed evil and done good,</hi> God ere
this time, would have crowned our wiſhes
with the fruition of peace.</p>
                  <p>The Marriners <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 30. (men skilful to
ſhift for themſelves at Sea) had a private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for their own ſafety, namely, to quit their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114646:135"/>
crazie ſhip, (with the ſouldiers and paſſengers
therein,) and ſecretly to convey themſelves
into the boat. But their deſign miſcarried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcovered by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the ſouldiers, <hi>who
cut the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All men ought to have a publick ſpirit for the
general good of our Nation, the ſucceſs where
of we leave to the al-managing providence of
the God of heaven and earth. But I hope it wil
be no treaſon againſt our State, and I am ſure it
wil be ſafe for us, who are but private perſons
to provide for the ſecuring of our ſouls, and
to build a little Cock-boat, or ſmal Veſſel of a
<hi>quiet conſcience</hi> in our own <hi>hearts,</hi> thereby
to eſcape to the Haven of our own Happineſs?
We wiſh well to the great <hi>Ship</hi> of our whole
Nation, and will never deſert it ſo, but that
our beſt prayers and deſires ſhall go with it.
But however providence ſhall diſpoſe thereof
we will ſtick to the petty Pinnace of Peace in
our own conſciences. Sure I am, no ſouldiers
ſhall be able to cut the <hi>Cables,</hi> I mean no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
impreſſion from <hi>without,</hi> ſhall diſturb
or diſcompoſe the peace which is within us.</p>
                  <p>O the extenſiveneſs of the word <hi>End!</hi> It is
like the widows oyl, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 6. Which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed
to fill the number and bigneſs of all
Veſſels brought unto it, ſo here bring dayes
weeks, months, years, myriads, millions of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114646:135"/>
years end will fill them all, yet it ſelf is never
filled, as being the endleſs end of eternity.</p>
                  <p>We will conclude all with a paſſage of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus,</hi>
when he firſt went to make diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the new world. Long time had he ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſeen nothing but Sea, inſomuch as the
men and Marriners with him begun to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reſolving to go no further, but return
home again. Here <hi>Columbus</hi> with good words
and fair language pacified them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
perſwading them to ſail forward for one
month more. That month elapſed, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intreated
them to hold out but 3 weeks lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
that three weeks expired, he humbly
and heartily ſued unto them, that for his ſake
they would ſail on but 3 dayes more, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to comply with the Reſolutions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,
in caſe that within thoſe 3 dayes, no
encouragement to their contrary was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
Before the ending whereof they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcryed
<hi>fire,</hi> which was to them a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that it was not ſubjected on water, and
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> invited them for the finding out of thoſe
<hi>Iſlands,</hi> whereby others afterwards diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole <hi>Continent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whileſt we live here below in our bodies,
and ſail towards another world in our ſouls
and deſires, we muſt expect to meet with
much diſturbance in our diſtempered paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114646:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yea, ſuch as ſometimes in the hour of
<hi>temptation</hi> will amount to a <hi>mutiny;</hi> and much
diſhearten us when <hi>toſt</hi> with the <hi>tempeſt</hi> of
afflictions we can <hi>make no land,</hi> diſcover no
hope of <hi>happineſs.</hi> It muſt then be our work
to ſtill and <hi>calm</hi> our <hi>paſſions,</hi> perſwading them
to perſevere, and patiently to proceed, though
little hope appear for the preſent. Not that
with <hi>Columbus</hi> we ſhould indent with our
ſouls to expect any ſet-time of years, months
or dayes, (this were <hi>unlawful,</hi> and with the
wicked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 41. <hi>To limit the Holy One of
Iſrael</hi>) but <hi>indefinitely</hi> without any notation
of time: Let us till on our ſouls by degrees,
a <hi>while,</hi> a <hi>little while,</hi> yet a <hi>very little while</hi> to
depend on God, and go on in goodneſs. Then
at laſt a <hi>pillar of fire,</hi> a comfortable light of a
conſcience cleared through the blood and
merits of Chriſt will appear unto us, not only
contenting us for the preſent, but directing us
for the future to that bliſs and happineſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
by the Subject of my Text, <hi>Mark the
Perfect, behold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright; for the end of that
man is Peace.</hi> AMEN.</p>
