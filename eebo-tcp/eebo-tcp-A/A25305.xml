            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALthough theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs ſeem to have very much of the Air of a Romance, yet there are very few that are more true. I Originally know the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Affairs, which I relate, and the reſt comes from ſo good Hands, that I ſhould be too blame to doubt the Truth of them. However

if ſome certain Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which ought to have been very ſecret, make it be believed, that I have added a great deal of my own, as thoſe often do, that take upon them to Write, I deſire the Reader to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his Judgment, until he can enquire after them from ſome body, who ſhall not be ſuſpected by him.

            <p>That Declaration amazed the Dutcheſs, who had often heard her Husband ſpeak of theſe kinds of Diſtempers, of which experienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> but that, as he had already told her, ſhe muſt be ſpeedily cured, or elſe it might become ſuch. When ſhe heard that, ſhe told him, that ſhe had ſo great a confidence in him, by reaſon of the Reputation which he had in the World, that ſhe would put her ſelf entirely into his hands; and at the ſame time naming her ſelf, ſhe ſurprized the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51066:57"/>
Chirurgion; who knowing that he had to do with a Perſon of the higheſt Quality, was troubled he had talked to her after the rate he had done. He asked her pardon for his having appeared ſo free in words, excuſing himſelf, that ſince the greateſt Proſtitutes did frequently entertain him with the ſame Language, which ſhe had uſed, he thought himſelf obliged to make her thoſe anſwers that he did, he not having the honour to know her.</p>
            <p>The Dutcheſs eaſily pardoned him, nevertheleſs upon condition, that he ſhould ſoon diſpatch the buſineſs, which the Chirurgion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her, if ſhe would obſerve a certain rule of living. She told him, that ſhe would do every thing that he ſhould order her. And did even more; for ſhe would keep her Bed while ſhe took Phyſick, fearing, that if ſhe had continued to live as ſhe was accuſtomed to

do, watching might have heated her Blood, and rendred her Cure more difficult.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, though ſhe had no mind to ſee any body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſince it was very tireſome for her to be alone continually, ſhe permitted Monſieur the Advocate, the Maſter of Requeſts, to come and Viſit her, who had long ſince made love unto her without being able to obtain any favour. Monſieur the Advocate was a <hi>Jews</hi> Son, of the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> who after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten an Eſtate of two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions by his Uſury, ſuffred himſelf to dye with cold, for fear of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a penny upon a F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ggot. His Mother was alſo of the Jewiſh Race. Nevertheleſs, with all that, he was eſteemed a man of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and tho' he was of the long Robe, yet he never was pleaſed, but when he was in the Company of Sword men, to whom he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a Divertiſement.

            <p>The Reputation which he had of being no dangerous man with the Women, to whom it was ſaid, that he could do neither good nor harm, having made the Dutcheſs <hi>de la Ferte</hi> believe, that he would perceive leſs of the reaſon which kept her a bed, than any other, ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

At length his Chirurgion having finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cure, he ſoon forgot the ſickneſs he had ailed, and having heard the buſineſs of the Duke <hi>D'Aumont</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadour</hi> talk't of, and his way being to procure reconciliations, he told them both, that he was very much troubled at his not having been

            <p>The Dutcheſs could not ſuffer theſe reproaches from the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate without entring into a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſion.

She bid him get out of her Houſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhe would make him leap out at the Windows, and ſhe puſht him towards the Door with the end of the Tongs.

fetching deep ſighs, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>arge, and fearing to meet ſome body, he kept back his tears until he was in his Coach.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was in it, there came one of the <hi>Mareſchal de la Ferte</hi>'s People, to tell him, that his Maſter would ſpeak with him before he went away, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to endeavour ſtill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them, and after having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted his Perruque and his Band, which were in a little diſorder, he went up into the <hi>Mareſchal</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, where he found a very handſome Lady with ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who were all there for a quarrel which they had together. The <hi>Mareſchal</hi> told him that he had given him the trouble of coming up, to ſee if there were any means to compound a difference between theſe People, without obliging them
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51066:70"/>
to come before a general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bly of the Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> and there being already ſome proceed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ings had on either ſide, and thoſe regarding him (for the Great <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cander</hi> had granted the hearing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Monſieur the Advocate asked, what the matter was, and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal</hi> having told him that he muſt needs have ſeen the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, the Maſter of Requeſts anſwered, that his Secretary had not yet laid them before him, which ſerved for a good excuſe. The <hi>Mareſchal</hi> knowing that it was an eſtabliſht Cuſtom with him, to let his Secretary do all the buſineſs, told him, that the Lady, whom he ſaw there before him, complained, that a Gentleman who was alſo there preſent, had diſhonoured her by ſcandalous Stories<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which ſhe demanded ſatisfaction; that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51066:70"/>
though there were no Witneſſes, yet the thing was a verred by the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans own confeſſion, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that, far from having inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Lady, he was very much in the right; that to juſtifie that, he reported, how that he had paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately loved her, and had ſought after all opportunities of ſerving her; that he had rendred her ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deable a ſervice as to furniſh her at one time with 200 Piſtols, but that in recompence ſhe had given him nothing but a Diſeaſe, which had kept him three entire Months in his Bed; that he, believing he had reaſon to complain of it, had publiſht, that this Lady was not cruel, but yet that he would have no more of her Favours at that price.</p>
            <p>Monſieur the Advocate hearing a Story that had ſo great a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his own, believed that his Intrigue was diſcovered, and that ſome body muſt have heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51066:71"/>
at the Dutcheſſes Door; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore quite out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, he bluſht and grew pale again, and wrapping himſelf up in his Cloak, he told the <hi>Mareſchal</hi> that he jeered him, and took his way towards the Door, without ſaying any thing more. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal,</hi> who was in his Bed, not being able to run after him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him back; but ſeeing that he would not return, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Captain of his Guards, not to ſuffer him to go away ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had need of him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that buſineſs. Monſieur the Advocate made a difficulty of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, telling the Captain that Monſieur the <hi>Mareſchal</hi> only rallied with him: But the Captain ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told him, that there was no jeſting in the caſe, and that what the <hi>Mareſchal</hi> did, was becauſe he deſired to do thoſe Perſons ſervice; he re-entred the Chamber, and the <hi>Mareſchal</hi> asked him ſince when
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51066:71"/>
he had given over making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition between Gentlemen, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach which he made him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew, that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſuch buſineſs, he neglected other Affairs which did appertain to the Duty of the Office, which he had in the Great <hi>Alcanders</hi> Council.</p>
            <p>After that Monſieur the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate had excuſed himſelf as well as he could, they began to handle the matter in queſtion, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waiting for a deduction of all the Particulars, he decreed, that the Gentleman ſhould be ſent to Priſon, from whence he ſhould not be ſet free, until he had asked the Ladie's pardon, who to thank him for his favourable Decree, made him a very low reverence. The Advocates Sentence was punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed by the <hi>Mareſchal,</hi> and the Gentleman was ſent into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:51066:80"/>In the mean time Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> was in a mortal fear, leſt this young Beauty ſhould rob her of the Prince's Heart, with whom ſhe had very lately had a filling out ſome few days before. For pretending that he ought to treat her ſtill as he had done in the beginning, the taxed him for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no greater complaiſance for her, and becauſe the Great <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> made anſwer, that they had been too long acquainted to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo much Ceremony, ſhe was ſo tranſported with paſſion, as to ſay very diſobliging things unto him. She began with reproaching him of all that ſhe had done for him; that ſhe had forſaken her Houſe, her Children, her Husband, and even her Honour for him; that there was no manner of Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance that ſhe did not continually expreſs to engage him; but that he was of late become very cold and indifferent; that if years had
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51066:81"/>
brought upon her any imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he ought not to attribute them to her, but to time, that deſtroys all things; however that ſhe did not yet perceive (thanks be to God) that there was ſo great an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in her Perſon; but that for him ſhe could ſay, nevertheleſs without having any deſign to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger him, that though he had great cauſe to be thankful to nature, yet that he was not exempted of all manner of faults; that he had one great one among the reſt, which he perhaps never perceived; but that ſhe had been very ſenſible of it, without ever making any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, becauſe ſhe believed that none ought to take ſuch particular notice of thoſe they loved.</p>
            <p>The Great <hi>Alcander,</hi> whom no body durſt ever upbraid before, was extreamly moved to hear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> ſay theſe things, for whom he had done no leſs than ſhe had done for him; for if ſhe had
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51066:81"/>
forſaken her Houſe, Children, and Husband to ſtick to him, he had abandoned for her the care of his Reputation, which was very much blemiſht, for having loved a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, who had ſo great reaſons to be more diſcreet. However, ſince we are more ſenſible of the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which we receive from thoſe that we love, than we are of thoſe which we receive from Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to us, he ſuffered not this reproach to fall thus to the ground, but demanding of Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpan,</hi> what his faults then were, he provoked her to declare them, by informing her of her own; at which Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> was ſo concerned, that ſhe replied unto him, that if ſhe had thoſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections whereof he did accuſe her, yet that ſhe had not in the leaſt any offenſive ſmels about her.</p>
            <p>This being as much as to ſay, that the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> was not without them, it is impoſſible to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51066:82"/>
expreſs how ill he took this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. He told Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpan</hi> ſuch things, as were enough to have touched her home, and to have made her recollect her ſelf if ſhe had any ſenſe of Virtue yet remaining. But having entirely given her ſelf over to her paſſions, ſhe was no more moderate in the anſwer, which ſhe gave him, than ſhe had been in the beginning of this Converſation.</p>
            <p>While they quarrelled thus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently with each other, the Prince <hi>de Marſilliac</hi> came to the Cloſet Door wherein they were, and the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> having given him power to enter any where, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out demanding leave, he had his Foot already within the Door, when he underſtood by the ſound of the Prince's voice, that he was in anger; this made him ſtop ſhort, and being deſirous to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might enter, he began to call out aloud Doorkeeper, Doorkeeper;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51066:82"/>
and there being none in the way, he called out louder yet, who is here, that will give me an anſwer. The Great <hi>Alcander,</hi> who gave ear to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that he ſaid, truly gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after having given him ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that he did ſo out of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and being glad to have an opportunity to break up ſo diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable a converſation, he told the Prince of <hi>Marſilliac,</hi> that he might come in; which was the reaſon that Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> endeavoured to conſtrain her ſelf, for fear that the report of her diſgrace, which ſhe was willing to conceal, ſhould ſpread over the whole Court.</p>
            <p>She departed in a moment after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and left the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> at liberty to open his heart to the Prince of <hi>Marſilliac,</hi> who had a great ſhare of his confidence, and to whom he had given in leſs than one year, above one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livres in places, for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Monſieur <hi>de Lauſun's</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:51066:83"/>
diſgrace he forced him to take the Government of <hi>Berry,</hi> which that Favourite had poſſeſt, and which he was unwilling to accept of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, having never been his Friend, he was afraid, leaſt the world ſhould ſay, that he had provoked the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> to cauſe him to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, in order to benefit himſelf of his ſpoils.</p>
            <p>The Great <hi>Alcander</hi> looked upon this delicacy to be ſo much the more excellent, as it was rare amongſt Courtiers, and ſince it could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed only from a great heart, he had yet a greater eſteem for him. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after he again gave him the place of great Maſter of the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, void by the Death of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Saintry,</hi> who was killed at the paſſage of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but he gave it him after ſo obliging a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the Preſent was leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for its greatneſs alone, than for the goodneſs which the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> expreſt towards him, when
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51066:83"/>
he made it. For he told him, that he gave him that place only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate his Affairs, and not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ncommode them; that if it were more profitable for him to ſell it, than to keep it, he himſelf would find out a Chapman, and make him give a Million for it.</p>
            <p>Thus the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to give marks of his amity to the Prince of <hi>Marſilliac,</hi> and the other Courtiers looked upon him as a kind of Favourite, but alſo as one much more worthy to poſſeſs that place, than Monſieur <hi>de Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſun,</hi> who deſpiſed all the world, as if there had been no man worthy to approach him. In the mean time this Favour, which failed not to create a jealouſie in all the reſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed yet the more, by reaſon of the cold indifferency, wherein the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> was fallen for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> and of the new paſſion, which he reſented for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Fontanges,</hi> who was that

She therefore told him, that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51066:84"/>
ſhe received with joy the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which he juſt then had made unto her: That the Great <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had ſuch charming Qualities to make himſelf be beloved, that ſhe muſt of neceſſity be very ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humoured not to be charmed with his paſſion: But that however, ſhe could place no great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in it, as long as Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> poſſeſt his Favour as ſhe did; that ſhe was nice, and could not believe any thing of what ſhe had then heard out of his mouth; that if ſhe had been capable of kindling any fires in his heart, they were only fires that would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon quenched as they were kindled, for the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> would no ſooner have ſatisfied his deſire, but he would return to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Monteſpan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Marſilliac,</hi> who deſired to ſucceed the firſt time in his Embaſſy, replyed to that, that if the future may be gueſt at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51066:85"/>
by things, that are paſſed, there was no great appearance, that the Great <hi>Alcander,</hi> who was diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> would ever return to her; that he was conſtant when he once gave himſelf up to any one, and that if he had forſaken Madam <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere,</hi> it was, becauſe ſhe her ſelf had contributed very much unto it, by an unequality of Spirit, that did not pleaſe the Prince. That ſhe might have heard, how that Madam <hi>de la Valiere</hi> before her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a Convent for good and all, had gone into one contrary to the Great <hi>Alcanders</hi> pleaſure, who was obliged to fetch her out, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which time ſhe did nothing but diſcourſe to him of the remorſe of her Conſcience, which by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little weaned him from her, the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to oppoſe her Salvation: That then he loved Madam <hi>de Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> and would it may be have
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51066:85"/>
loved her ſtill, if ſhe had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved her ſelf towards him after a manner, that might poſſibly have befitted a private mans Miſtreſs, but not the Miſtreſs of ſo power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Prince, as was the Great <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> towards whom ſhe ought to have ſhewn a more ſubmiſſive and complaiſant humour; that he would inſtruct her how to carry her ſelf, as occaſion ſhould require, but that for the preſent, ſhe need only tell him ſomething that might ſet the King's mind at reſt. Then he adviſed her as a good Friend not to let ſlip ſo fair an opportunity, ſaying, that if ſhe loſt it through her own fault, ſhe would repent of it for all her life.</p>
            <p>Then he related to her the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel that the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> had had with Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die's Inſolence, and the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. This laſt Circumſtance having convinced her more than all his reaſons, ſhe ſent the Great

               <hi>Alcander</hi> word, that if ſhe had been obliged to him for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent which he had made, and which I have already mentioned, ſhe was much more ſo, for what he had ordered the Prince of <hi>Marſilliac</hi> to tell her, and that ſhe was ready to give her ſelf up to him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſhe might have him entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her ſelf.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Madam <hi>de Monteſpan,</hi> who miſtruſted this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, employed all her Friends, in order to regain the Great <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's</hi> confidence.

            <p>Thus without its being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it proceeded from him, he rid himſelf of all the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and inſtead of a Council there was held that day a long Conference between the Great <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cander,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Monteſpan</hi> In the mean time, all knowing that Monſieur <hi>de Louvoy</hi> ſtaid in the Chamber, they believed him to be ſhut up with the Prince, and the other Miniſters, who were ſent back without being ſuffered to enter grew jealous of it, not knowing to what to attribute this long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which occaſioned that

there was no Council held that day, which never happened before, the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> being uſually very punctual in all his actions.</p>

            <p>The Great <hi>Alcander</hi> was ſo well ſatisfied with this new Conqueſt, that he gave the Prince of <hi>Marſilliac,</hi> the place of Chief Huntſ man, for a reward of his having procured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

The Dutcheſs <hi>de la Ferte</hi> is more immoderate than ever in her Pleaſures, neither is the Dutcheſs of <hi>Vantadour</hi> her Siſter leſs wanton, though ſhe manages her buſineſs with a little more diſcretion and conduct. As for the <hi>Mareſchaleſs de la Ferte,</hi> ſhe is at any man's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that will give moſt, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſo great Humility after certain misfortunes, which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to her, reſembling thoſe that I have related of her Daughter in Law, that ſhe hath made a vow ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to refuſe any body, provided that they have but mony.</p>

By this means Monſieur <hi>de Lauſun</hi> is returned, not indeed to Court, but to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he is obliged to live as a private Man. For the Great <hi>Alcander</hi> would not permit his Marriage to be declared; but he is ſo often at the Princeſſes Houſe, that it is all one as if he lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there. In the mean time, this Princeſs is ſo jealous of him, that he wiſhes with all his heart he had never thought on her: She hath ſet Spies all about him, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a ſtep, that ſhe is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of; ſo that going out of one Priſon, he is entred into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which appears to him no leſs cruel. She hath given him ſome Land by the Great <hi>Alcander's</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but it is all that ſhe hath done for him, for ſhe could not give him one penny of ready money,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51066:92"/>
having loſt all her Credit by this Marriage. For no man is willing to lend her any mony, leaſt it ſhould be hereafter ſaid, that being in a Husband's power, ſhe could not lawfully borrow. This is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that there are four or five years paſt, ſince ſhe began to build her Houſe at <hi>Choiſi,</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving yet finiſhed it; for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of it muſt be taken out of her yearly Revenue. But ſhe would be comforted ſtill for all theſe things, if Monſieur <hi>de Lauſun</hi> were the ſame that he hath been heretofore. I would ſay, if he ſtill poſſeſt the ſame quality towards Ladies, that he once did: But it is reported, that he is now ſo pitiful a Fellow that way, that it is hard to believe, he had formerly been ſo brave.
