            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>RELIGION and VIRTUE, as they have near relation one to another, and are ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to reſide together; ſo they are very rarely conſider'd apart, or diſtinguiſh'd from one another. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſince there have bin inſtances of ſome, who having great Zeal in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have yet wanted even the common affections of Humanity, and have bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely vitious and corrupt; and ſince others, even amongſt thoſe who have ſcarcely own'd a Deity, have bin ſeen to practiſe the rules of Morality, and have ſeem'd to act with good meaning and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards Mankind: it has given occaſion to ſeveral to enquire HOW FAR VIRTUE ALONE COULD GO;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59040:4"/>
AND HOW FAR RELIGION WAS EITHER NECESSARY TO SUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PORT IT, OR ABLE TO RAISE AND ADVANCE IT. And ſince by the example of others we have bin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in an enquiry of this kind, and are now about to enter upon a Subject where there is need of a very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Explanation of things, and of a more than ordinary clearneſs in terms; we may do well firſt of all to conſider <hi>What it is that we call</hi> ATHEISM, <hi>and what</hi> VIRTUE: and afterwards we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin <hi>the conſiſtency of theſe two together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FIRST, then, AS TO ATHEISM. And here it cannot juſtly be wonder'd at, if the method of explaining this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears unuſual and ſtrange, ſince the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it ſelf, and the Queſtion here treated of, has, perhaps, ſo little enter'd into conſideration, and is a matter of ſo nice and dangerous ſpeculation. But to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, therefore, according to the beſt of our Reaſon; the judgment of which is ſubmitted to others.</p>
                  <p>IN the Whole of things (or in the Univerſe) <hi>either</hi> every thing is according to a good order, and the moſt agreeable to a general intereſt that is poſſible: <hi>or</hi> every thing is not according to a good order; but there is that which might poſſibly have bin better, more wiſely
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59040:4"/>
contriv'd, and with more advantage to the general intereſt of Beings, or of the Whole.</p>
                  <p>IF every thing that exiſts be according to a good order, and for the beſt, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wiſeſt and juſteſt manner; then is there of neceſſity no ſuch thing as REAL ILL in the Univerſe, nothing ILL with reſpect to the whole.</p>
                  <p>WHATSOEVER, then, has ſuch an Exiſtence or Being as that it could not have <hi>bin</hi> better, or better ordered, is perfectly <hi>Good.</hi> Whatſoever in the order of the world is call'd ILL, ſuppoſes a poſſibility in the nature of the thing to have bin otherwiſe contriv'd or order'd by ſome wiſdom or other: for if it could not have bin better made, or any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have <hi>bin</hi> better, by any ſuppos'd or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or regulation; it is perfect, and in no wiſe defective or ILL.</p>
                  <p>WHATSOEVER is ILL there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt be caus'd or produc'd, either by deſign (that is to ſay, with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Judgment) or through want of deſign, from chance.</p>
                  <p>IF the order of all things be ſuch, that nothing can be thought of, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, more wiſe, perfect and juſt; then it is impoſſible but that there muſt be Wiſdom, Underſtanding and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in the whole; and that in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59040:5"/>
and higheſt manner and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                  <p>WHATSOEVER is from Deſign implies a Mind, Diſcernment, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence.</p>
                  <p>IF there be any thing ILL in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe from deſign (and it muſt be, if at all, either from Deſign, or from Chance) then that which is the cauſe of, or which diſpoſes <hi>all</hi> things, is no one good deſigning Principle. For either there is but <hi>one</hi> deſigning Principle or Mind, and <hi>that</hi> corrupt; or if there be <hi>one</hi> that is good, there is <hi>another</hi> in being which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates contrarily, and is ILL.</p>
                  <p>IF there be any thing of ILL in the Univerſe from Chance, or which was not deſign'd, but accidental; then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Principle or Mind, whether good or bad, cannot be the cauſe or guidance of <hi>all</hi> things. And if there be a deſigning Principle which is the cauſe of good, and is good, but cannot prevent the ill which happens from Chance, or from a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill deſign; then is there no ſuch thing as a ſupreme good Deſign or Mind but what is impotent and defective: For not to correct, or totally exclude that ill of Chance, or of a contrary ill deſign, muſt proceed either from impotency, or ill will.</p>
                  <p>WHATSOEVER has intelligence, and is a Mind, having a ſuperior power
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59040:5"/>
over us, or having any eminent place, direction, or controul in nature, is that we call <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Deity.</hi> For, tho a People believe and worſhip that which they think neither perfectly good, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly powerful, nor yet eternal; it is a Deity or God ſtill, tho an imperfect one, which they worſhip: or whether they think fit to worſhip or no, ſtill they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a God of ſome ſort.</p>
                  <p>WHATSOEVER therefore is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in any degree over the World, or that rules in nature with diſcernment and a Mind, is that which we call GOD. If there are ſeveral ſuch ſuperior Minds, they are ſo many Gods. But if that ſingle ſuperior, or thoſe ſeveral ſuperiors are not in their nature neceſſarily good, they rather take the name of DAEMON. For remove all <hi>good</hi> from either of thoſe Beings, and we ſhall immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it <hi>a Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO believe therefore that every thing is govern'd, order'd, or regulated <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt,</hi> by a deſigning Principle or Mind, ſuch as is good and eternal, is to be a perfect THEIST.</p>
                  <p>TO believe nothing of a deſigning Principle or Mind, nor any cauſe or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or rule of things, but Chance; ſo that in nature neither the intereſt of <hi>the whole,</hi> nor of any <hi>particulars,</hi> can be ſaid
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59040:6"/>
to be purſu'd, deſign'd, or aim'd at; is to be a perfect ATHEIST.</p>
                  <p>TO believe no <hi>one</hi> ſupreme good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Principle or Mind, but <hi>ſeveral,</hi> is to be a POLYTHEIST.</p>
                  <p>TO believe this one ſingle Mind, or theſe many Minds, are not abſolutely and neceſſarily good in their nature, but are vitious and unjuſt, is to be a DAEMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIST. For, to believe any thing of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or of a Being which dos univerſally ſuperintend, which governs all things by his Power and Will, but not with that obligation and neceſſary confinement to good, and to what is <hi>beſt,</hi> is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an infinit Devil, and not an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit God.</p>
                  <p>TO believe this ſupreme Mind, or theſe ſupreme Minds good, and not the cauſe of ILL (if real Ill be allow'd) is to allow ſome other cauſe, which is either Deſign or not Deſign. If it be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and of conſequence a malicious and ill Deſign (that is to ſay, if it proceed from the prevalency of an ill Mind or Minds) then is this in reality being a <hi>Daemoniſt</hi> in ſome degree. If it be from no deſign, but from chance; ſo that a Mind prevails but in ſome things, and Chance in others; then is this to be an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in ſome degree, or in as far as Chance is thought prevalent and unſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59040:6"/>
by the power and wiſdom of any ſupreme Mind or Minds.</p>
                  <p>THERE are few men who think always conſiſtently, or according to one certain Hypotheſis upon any ſubject ſo abſtruſe and intricate, as this concerning the <hi>Cauſe of all things,</hi> and the <hi>Oeconomy or Government of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi> For it is plain in the caſe of the moſt devout Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and by their own confeſſion, that they have times when their Faith only ſupports them, and that they are ready to judg (that is to ſay, that their reaſon inclines them to judg) to the diſadvantage of a Providence and a juſt Rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THAT</hi> alone therefore is to be called a man's Opinion, which is of any other the moſt habitual to him, and occurs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt occaſions. So that it is hard to pronounce of any one, that <hi>he is an Atheiſt;</hi> becauſe, unleſs his whole thoughts do at all times carry him againſt <hi>all</hi> deſign, or government of a Mind, he is no perfect Atheiſt: for, to believe any thing of deſign, or government of a Mind, tho limited, and not infinitly powerful, is to believe ſomething of a God. And that this is a proper way of ſpeaking, and a neceſſary one, appears from this; that otherwiſe if no one were to be ſtiled a Theiſt in any degree, who permitted any thing to Chance;

then likewiſe would no one be to be ſtiled a Theiſt who permitted any thing to a contrary ill Principle, as thoſe do, who believe a Devil or Daemon, oppoſit to God; or that there is any ſuch thing in the Univerſe, as real Ill, which is neither from chance nor from God.

                  <p>BUT to examin now concerning VIRTUE. There is in every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a certain Intereſt or <hi>Good,</hi> which is as an End in that Creature; and to which End if any thing either of his Appetites, Paſſions or Affections be not conducing, but the contrary, this is ill to him: and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59040:8"/>
in this manner he is ill <hi>with reſpect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> as he is ſaid to be ill alſo <hi>with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to others,</hi> when any ſuch Appetites or Paſſions make him injurious to them. And if, by the natural conſtitution of any rational Creature, the ſame irregularities of Appetite which make him to be ill towards others, make him to be ill alſo as to himſelf; and that the ſame regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Affections which makes him to be good in one ſenſe, makes him to be good alſo in the other; then is that Goodneſs by which he is thus uſeful to others (if this perhaps be what we call Virtue) a real good to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>WHETHER this be ſo or not, is reſerv'd to be conſider'd afterwards. Our preſent deſign is, to examin ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly the good of Virtue to Society.</p>
                  <p>IF any one will maintain that a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture well conſtituted as to himſelf, may yet be contrariwiſe towards others; then, notwithſtanding a Creature be thus good for himſelf, this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make it be ſaid of him that he is <hi>a good Creature;</hi> unleſs he could be underſtood to be abſolute and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in himſelf, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al relation to any thing in the Univerſe beſides. For if there be any where in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>a Syſtem</hi> of which this living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be conſider'd as a <hi>part;</hi> then,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59040:9"/>
if the Creature be to carry the name of <hi>good,</hi> he muſt be ſuch <hi>a part</hi> as makes to the good of that Syſtem or Whole. Now if there be any thing in the ſtructure of a particular Animal more than what has relation to himſelf, or his own privat Syſtem or Nature, and by which he has an abſolute relation to ſome other thing, or other Syſtem or Nature without him; then is this Animal but <hi>a part</hi> of ſome other Syſtem: for inſtance, if an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal have the parts of a Male, it is with a relation to the Female; and the parts both of the Male and Female have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to another thing beſides the Syſtem of themſelves. So that they are parts of another Syſtem: which Syſtem is that of a particular ſpecies of living Creatures that have ſome one <hi>common Nature,</hi> or are provided for by ſome one <hi>order</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> of things ſubſiſting together, and uniting to that end, of their ſupport.</p>
                  <p>IN the ſame manner, if a whole ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Animals be ſuch as contribute to ſome other thing; and that their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence has a neceſſary relation to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, or to the exiſtence of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpecies of Animals; then is that whole ſpecies but <hi>a part</hi> of a Syſtem. For inſtance, to the exiſtence of a Spider, the exiſtence of ſuch Animals as Flies is made to be neceſſary: ſo that the Fly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59040:9"/>
has a relation to the Spider, as the Web of the Spider, and the Spider it ſelf have relation to ſuch Animals as Flies. And thus, in the ſtructure of one of theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, there is abſolutely as apparent and perfect a regard and relation to the other, as in the ſyſtem of our ſelves and in our own body there is a relation of parts one to another; as of the ſtomach to the limbs: or, as in the branches or leaves of a Tree, we ſee a relation to a root and trunk. In the ſame manner are Flies neceſſary to the exiſtence of other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both Fowls and Fiſhes. And thus are other ſpecies or kinds ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to one another; which is being <hi>Parts</hi> of a certain ſyſtem, according to which the nature of Animals is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                  <p>SO that there is a Syſtem therefore of all Animals together; an <hi>animal Syſtem,</hi> and an <hi>animal Nature,</hi> or a Nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Animals.</p>
                  <p>IN the ſame manner if the whole ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of Animals, together with that of Vegetables, and all other things in this world of ours; that is to ſay, if this whole ſyſtem of the Earth has a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, or a dependence on any thing elſe whatſoever (as it has, for inſtance, with reſpect to the Sun, and Planets round that Sun) then is the Earth but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59040:10"/>
a PART of ſome other ſyſtem. And ſince there muſt be a SYSTEM OF ALL THINGS, <hi>a univerſal Nature,</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture common to the whole;</hi> there is no particular being or ſyſtem which muſt not be either good or ill in that <hi>general Syſtem</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe:</hi> For if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant and of no uſe, it is a fault or imperfection, and conſequently ill in the general Syſtem. Therefore if any being be <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>really</hi> ILL, it muſt be ill with reſpect to the univerſal Syſtem; and then the Syſtem of the Univerſe is ill or imperfect. But if the ill of one privat Syſtem be the good of other Syſtems, and be ſtill the good of the general Syſtem (as when one Creature lives by the deſtruction of another; one thing is generated from the corruption of another; or one planetary Syſtem or <hi>Vortex</hi> may ſwallow up another) then is the ill of that privat Syſtem no ill in it ſell; more than the pain of breeding teeth is ill in a Syſtem or Body, where without that occaſion of pain, the body would ſuffer worſe by being defective. So that we cannot ſay of any Being, that it is wholly and abſolutely ill, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we can poſitively ſhew and aſcertain it, that <hi>that</hi> which we call ILL is not GOOD in ſome other Syſtem, nor in THE WHOLE.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59040:10"/>BUT if any intire ſpecies of Animals be deſtructive to all the other Species, then is that to be call'd an ill Species, as being of ill in the <hi>animal Nature</hi> or <hi>Syſtem.</hi> And if in any ſpecies of Animals (as in <hi>Men,</hi> for example) one man is ſuch as to be of a nature pernicious to the reſt, then is he <hi>an ill Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT we do not ſay a man <hi>is an ill man,</hi> becauſe he has the Plague-ſpots upon him, or becauſe he has convulſive fits which make him ſtrike and wound thoſe that come near him. Nor do we ſay a man is a good man, when his hands are ty'd, which hinders him from doing the harm that he has a mind to do, or (which is near the ſame) when he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains from executing his ill purpoſe, through a fear of ſome impending puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or through an allurement of ſome privat pleaſure or advantage, which draws him from his ill intention.</p>
                  <p>SO that in a ſenſible Creature, that which is not done through any affection (and conſequently with no knowledg, conſciouſneſs or perception at all) makes neither good nor ill in the nature of that Creature, according to the ſenſe we ſpeak in, when we ſay a Creature is a good or an ill Creature. And whatever is done either of good or ill, otherwiſe than as through good or ill affections in that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59040:11"/>
Creature, it is in the nature of that Creature neither good nor ill, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common underſtood ſenſe of a good or ill Creature, a good or ill Man.</p>
                  <p>A CREATURE in this ſenſe is only good therefore when Good or Ill (that is to ſay, a Good or an Ill to his Syſtem, or to that which he has a relation to) is the immediat object of ſome Affection mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: it being then only to be truly ſaid that he has good Affections, good Inclinations or Paſſions, a good Nature, or a good Soul.</p>
                  <p>FOR if a Creature that is mov'd by a paſſion of Hatred to his own kind, be by a violent fear of ſomething hurtful to himſelf, mov'd ſo as to do that Good which he is not inclined to, by any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Good it ſelf; it is not good (that is to ſay, good as above) which is the object of the affection moving him: for that which moves him is no affection relating to any good of his Species, or of that which he is joined to, or is a part of: and therefore there is no Goodneſs there; that is, there is nothing which takes from, or abates any thing of the ill Nature or ill Diſpoſition (which is the true illneſs of the Creature) altho the effects of that ill nature or ill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be accidentally prevented, or that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59040:11"/>
ſome Good come accidentally to be wrought by that Creature, without good Nature, good Diſpoſition, or good Intention.</p>
                  <p>IF there be any affection towards privat Good, which is for the good of the Species in general that every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual ſhould have, this cannot be other than a good Affection; <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> it be not for ſuch affection as this, that a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is commonly called good.</p>
                  <p>IF there be any affection towards pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat Good which is not really conſiſtent with ſuch privat Good or Happineſs; this, as being hurtful to the Creature, and being ſuperfluous, and ſuch as muſt detract from, anticipate, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the other good affections, is vitious and ill.</p>
                  <p>IF there be any affection towards pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat or ſelf-good which is conſiſtent altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with real privat Good or Happineſs, but is inconſiſtent with that of the other kind, the public Good or good of the Species (which whether a thing poſſible to be ſuppos'd or no, will be afterwards conſider'd) this muſt be ill and vitious in the common ſenſe of Illneſs and Vice; for altho profitable to the particular Creature, it is injurious to the Society or Whole. If the Affection, by being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>in a moderate degree,</hi> be agreeable to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59040:12"/>
other general Good; but by being <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate,</hi> is the contrary; then is the <hi>immoderate</hi> degree of this affection viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but not <hi>the moderate.</hi> And thus, if there be any thing which is the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a more than ordinary ſelf-concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or regard to ſeparat and privat Good, or of an over-great extenſion of the appetite <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

                  </p>
                  <p>NOW, if there be any affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſelf-good, or towards pleaſure, which is in it ſelf contributing to the other good, that of the Species or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem; then is that affection ſo far <hi>good,</hi> as that it is abſolutely neceſſary in order to conſtitute a Creature good.</p>
                  <p>FOR if the want of ſuch an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as for inſtance, of that towards Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſervation, or towards Generation) be of injury to the Species or Syſtem; then is it vitious in ſome degree to want thoſe affections, or to have ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: as no body would doubt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, if they ſaw a man who minded
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59040:12"/>
not any precipices that lay in his way, or who had a diſpoſition that rendred him averſe to any commerce with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-kind, and of conſequence unfitted him through <hi>illneſs of Temper</hi> (and not merely through a defect of <hi>Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) for the propagation of his Species or Kind.</p>
                  <p>SO that the affection to ſelf-good or privat good, may be a good affection or an ill affection. For if the affection towards ſelf-good be too ſtrong (as for inſtance, <hi>the love of Life,</hi> which by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-great, unfits a Creature for any generous Act, and hinders him in the doing his PART) then is it vitious; and if vitious, the Creature that is mov'd and acted by that, is vitiouſly mov'd, and can never be otherwiſe than vitious in ſome degree, whilſt mov'd by that vitious affection. Therefore, if through ſuch an over-great love of Life and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Creature be accidentally induc'd or engag'd to do a good thing, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>good</hi> things (as he might be upon the ſame terms induc'd to do <hi>ill</hi>) he is not any more a good or a virtuous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for this good he dos, than a man is ſo much more a good man for pleading a juſt Cauſe which he is hired to, or for fighting in a good Cauſe againſt a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant whom he happens to have a privat
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59040:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
quarrel with, and whom he fears or hates on that account only.</p>
                  <p>WHATSOEVER therefore is done that happens to be of good to the Species, or to the Syſtem as above, through this affection towards ſelf-good, or ſeparat privat Good, dos not imply any more Goodneſs in the Creature than as the affection is good. And if that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in it ſelf be not to be ſtiled a good or virtuous Affection; whatſoever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens through it, is not Goodneſs nor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor the Creature any more a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous or good Creature: but let him do whatſoever Good, if it be <hi>only</hi> that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious affection of exorbitant ſelfiſhneſs, or an exceſſively extended Appetite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Self-good, which moves him; and that there be wanting therefore to move him any good affection, ſuch as ought of right to do it; the Creature is in it ſelf ſtill vitious, and will always be ſo in ſome degree, whilſt the paſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Self-good, tho ever ſo moderate and reaſonable, is in any degree his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the doing that which a natural affection to his kind ſhould have mov'd him to; but, which natural Affection is wanting in him, or ſo weakly implanted as to be inſufficient to move him without help from the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59040:13"/>NOR indeed can there be any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs till it comes to be a part of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temper of a Creature, ſuch a one as is mov'd by affections, to be carri'd by ſome immediate affection, <hi>directly</hi> and not <hi>conſequentially</hi> or <hi>by accident,</hi> to Good or againſt Ill: that is to ſay, till ſome Good or Ill (which is a Good or an Ill as above) come to be the object of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, either as towards it, or againſt it; and that ſuch affection become part of his natural Temper: for in the inſtance of Fear beforemention'd, where through fear a Creature hating his own Kind, is kept from hurting them, or is even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to do them good; in this caſe the fear of ſelf-ill or privat ill, or love of ſelf-good or privat good, is part of the natural Temper: but the fear or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of other Ill, or love of other Good (which is requiſit in a good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is no part of the natural Temper, but far the contrary. So, let the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture act how it will, or whatever way it is caſually mov'd by thoſe affections which regard merely privat or ſeparat Good or Ill; it will not have any thing more of true goodneſs on that account, but will be ſtill vitious and depraved, unleſs the natural Temper come about, and the nature of its Affections change.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59040:14"/>FOR inſtance, if a Creature natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fierce and cruel, loſe that fierceneſs, and is made tame, gentle and treatable; then is his natural Temper chang'd. Suppoſe now that the Creature has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a tame, gentle and mild Carriage, but that it proceeds only from the fear of his Keeper; which if ſet aſide, his other Paſſion inſtantly breaks out; then is that mildneſs not his natural Temper: but his natural Temper is what it was, and the Creature ſtill as ill a Creature in its own nature.</p>
                  <p>SUPPOSE on the other ſide, that a Creature be naturally inclin'd towards the preſervation of its young; but that the terror of the Hunters, or of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy in ſome extraordinary caſe, cauſe it to abandon them: in this caſe the Temper of the Creature remains ſtill what it was, and is not prejudic'd or impair'd, tho hindred from operating by a ſtrong Paſſion ſuſpending it for the time. But if by any operation of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, or by any thing from within, that Paſſion or Affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the young comes to grow weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo that other Paſſions may more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail over it; then is the natural Temper chang'd in ſome degree, and the Creature not ſo good a Creature.</p>

                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59040:14"/>NOTHING therefore being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly either goodneſs or illneſs in a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but what is from his natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (or from thoſe Paſſions or Affections which conſtitute natural Temper) as it reſpects that Good or Ill of his Kind or Species; a good Creature or a good Man in ſuch a one as by his Affections or natural Temper, is carried <hi>primarily and immediately,</hi> and not <hi>ſecondarily and accidentally,</hi> to Good and againſt Ill; and an ill Man the contrary: who is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in right Affections of force enough to carry him towards Good, and bear him out againſt Ill, or who is carried by his natural Affections juſt contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; to Ill, and againſt Good.</p>
                  <p>IF the natural Temper be vitious, the man is vitious in the ſame degree: and ſo if the natural Temper be good, he is in the ſame degree good.</p>
                  <p>IF a man be by his natural Temper juſt, equitable, kind; but that his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temper towards Ambition fights againſt his other Temper, but not ſo as to conquer it; in this caſe he is good ſtill <hi>by natural Temper;</hi> the better natural Temper being that which is prevalent in him, and has the maſtery.</p>
                  <p>WHEN in the general, all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections or Paſſions are ſuted to the Good that we have ſpoke of (the good of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59040:15"/>
Syſtem to which man relates) then is the natural Temper, and conſequently the man, chiefly good. If any ſuch Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Affection be wanting, or any Paſſion or Affection be redundant and over and above, or too little and weak, or repugnant, or any way ſuch as to be unconſonant to that good, and diſſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and contrary to that end; then is it vitious.</p>
                  <p>I NEED not inſtance in Rage, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefulneſs, and other ſuch (where it is ſo obvious) to ſhew how they are ill, and conſtitute an ill Creature: but even in Kindneſs and Love, tho rightly plac'd, and towards a proper object (as when it is that ſort of love of a Creature to its young) if it be immoderate and beyond a certain degree, it is vitious. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, not to have it at all, or not to have it <hi>to a certain degree,</hi> is a Vice in the Temper: and not to have it at all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>this</hi> object, but to <hi>ſome other</hi> which is improper (as when a fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Woman is fonder of a Toy, or of ſome tame Animal, than of her Child) this is a double Vice. But where the good Paſſion is too intenſe and eager, as where love to the young, or pity is in that degree; it is both hurtful to the Creature, and diſſerviceable to that end it carries to: for ſo over-fondneſs is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59040:15"/>
to the young, and exceſſive pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty uncapable of giving ſuccor. Thus the exceſs of motherly Love is a <hi>vitious fondneſs;</hi> over great pity, <hi>effeminacy and weakneſs;</hi> over great concern for ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <hi>meanneſs and cowardwiſe;</hi> too little, <hi>raſhneſs;</hi> and none at all, or that which is contrary (<hi>viz.</hi> a Paſſion or Paſſions inclining to ſelf-deſtruction) <hi>a very great depravity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN a Creature capable of forming ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Notions of things, not only the ſenſible things that offer themſelves to the ſenſe, are the objects of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the very <hi>actions</hi> themſelves, and the <hi>affections</hi> of Pity, Charity, Kindneſs, Juſtice, and ſo their contraries, being brought into the Mind by reflection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Objects; as even that very thing it ſelf of a good and virtuous Life, or the PART of a good and virtuous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, having a thorow good Affection, or intire good Affections: ſo that, by means of this reflected ſenſe, there ariſes another kind of Affection, which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the very Affections themſelves that were firſt felt, and are now the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a new feeling, when either they cauſe a liking or averſion. And thus the ſeveral Motions, Inclinations, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Diſpoſitions, and conſequent Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Behavior of Creatures in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59040:16"/>
various parts of Life, being in ſeveral ſcenes repreſented to the Mind, which readily diſcerns the good and the ill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Species or Public; it proves afterwards a new work for the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either virtuouſly and ſoundly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to, and affect what is juſt and right, and diſaffect what is contrary; or, vitiouſly and corruptly to affect what is ill, and diſregard or hate what is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and good.</p>
                  <p>AND in this caſe alone it is that we call any Creature virtuous, when it can have a notion of Good, and can make Goodneſs and Illneſs an object, or have the ſpeculation or ſcience of what is morally good and ill, of what is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or blameable, right or wrong: for tho we may call a Horſe <hi>a vitious</hi> Horſe; and ſo in the caſe of other Animals and things (as a vitious Medicin, a vitious Stomach) yet we never ſay of a good Horſe, or even of an Idiot or Changeling, tho ever ſo well natur'd and good, that he is <hi>virtuous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SO that if a Creature be generous, kind, conſtant, compaſſionate; yet if he cannot reflect on what he dos, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what he dos or ſees others do, by obſerving what that thing is that is generous, juſt, or honeſt; and making that idea or conception of Goodneſs, or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59040:16"/>
a good Action done through good Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to be an object of his Affection, he has not the name of being virtuous: for thus, and no otherwiſe, he is capable of having a <hi>ſenſe, in any kind, of what is right or wrong;</hi> that is to ſay, of what is done through juſt, equal, and good Affection, or what is not ſo.</p>
                  <p>IF any thing be done through an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which is not juſt, equal, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally conducing to the good of the Species or Syſtem to which man belongs; this is certainly of the nature of <hi>wrong.</hi> If the Affection be equal, ſound, and good, and the ſubject of the Affection ſuch as may with advantage to Society be ever in the ſame manner proſecuted or affected; this cannot but be right. For, <hi>Wrong</hi> is not barely ſuch action as is the cauſe of harm (for thus a Son ſtriking to kill an enemy, but killing with that blow his Father, would do wrong, which is not ſo) but that which is done through inſufficient or unequal Affection (as when a Son has no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the ſafety of a Father, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the ſafety of an indifferent perſon to the ſafety of his Father) this is of the nature of Wrong.</p>
                  <p>BY <hi>unequal Affection</hi> is meant Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unproportionably or unequally appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not towards the Object as it always
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59040:17"/>
actually exiſts or is (for then the running to ſave a Father in diſtreſs, but taking a wrong man for him, would be unequal Affection, and conſequently wrong) but towards the Objects or Object, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be, as it is the Object of the Mind, and as repreſented by the Senſes. For in this inſtance laſt mentioned, the Affection was, according to this mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rightly applied to the Object; ſo that the Affection was not unjuſt, but equal and right, tho the Sight perhaps were ill; and that it were a purblind man who thus miſtook a Stranger for his Father.</p>
                  <p>NEITHER can any weakneſs or imperfection of this ſort create <hi>wrong,</hi> as occaſioning the unequal application, abuſe or proſtitution of the Affection, ſo long as the Object, in the manner that it is taken or apprehended, is neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd nor improper, but ſutable to, and worthy of the Affection or degree of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection applied to it: for if it be poſſible to ſuppoſe a rational Creature who has an intire and forcible Affection towards Right and Good, and who never fails in a juſt and right degree of Affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards every Object preſenting it ſelf, but that his Memory or Parts fail him; and that the Objects are through the Senſes, as through ill Glaſſes, falſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59040:17"/>
and repreſented to him, not as they are actually, but after a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the perſon thus failing, ſince his failure is not in the Affection, but elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, is only vitious where his defect is; that is to ſay, in his Senſes (as in his Hearing, Seeing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) or in his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but it being not for ill Memory, or ill Organs of Senſe that a man is called vitious, this is not Vitiouſneſs or Wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in one thus defective.</p>
                  <p>BUT as the extravagance of Opinion and Belief is ſuch, that in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries we have known that even Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys, Cats, Crocodiles, and ſuch like Animals, have bin held for Deities; ſhould it appear to any one of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Faith of that Country, that to ſave ſuch a Creature as a Cat, before a Parent, was <hi>Right;</hi> and that the Cat deſerved the greater affection of the two; this would be wrong, notwithſtanding the appearance of the thing, or any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance or belief in the World.</p>
                  <p>SO that whatſoever is the cauſe of the miſconception or miſapprehenſion of the worth or value of any Object, ſo as to raiſe an affection or degree of affection towards it, ſuch as ought not to be; this muſt be the occaſion of <hi>Wrong,</hi> as it is the occaſion of an inequality or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion in the affection towards the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59040:18"/>
Object repreſented or appearing. For thus he who affects or loves a man for the ſake of ſomething which is reputed honorable, but which is in reality viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is himſelf vitious and ill: as when an ambitious Man, by the fame of his high Attempts; a Robber or a Pyrat by his boaſted Enterprizes, raiſes in any others an eſteem and admiration of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of that immoral and inhuman Character which deſerves abhorrence. But on the other ſide, he who loves and eſteems another, as believing him to have that Virtue which he has not, but only counterfeits, is not on this account wrongful, vitious, or corrupt.</p>
                  <p>SO that a miſtake <hi>in fact</hi> (where there is due advertency) being no cauſe of, nor any ways implying ill Affection, can be no cauſe of Wrong. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is a miſtake <hi>of Right</hi> (that is to ſay, of the worth of the Object repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented) this being the cauſe of unequal or unproportioned Affection, is the cauſe of Wrong.</p>
                  <p>BUT as there are many occaſions where the matter of Right (that is to ſay, the worth of the Object repreſented) may even to the moſt diſcerning part of Mankind appear difficult and of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deciſion (as when a man amongſt ſeveral Relations or Friends about to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59040:18"/>
doubts whom he ſhall firſt ſuccor) it is certain that the very leaſt miſtake in this way, the leaſt wrong preference, tho in a matter the moſt intricate, is in ſtrictneſs of ſpeaking an Injuſtice or Wrong: yet however, as to that name or appellation of a <hi>worthy or good Man,</hi> or <hi>Man of Integrity,</hi> it is not the very leaſt error of this ſort, or the ſlighteſt inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or diſproportion of the Affection, through a miſtake of Judgment, which takes away that denomination, and makes a Man to be eſteemed a vitious or ill Man, whilſt the Aim and Intention is ſtill good, and the Affection ſtrong and of full force towards public Good, Juſtice and Equity. Tho on the other ſide, where this good Aim is ever ſo much; and where the Affection towards Right is ever ſo ſtrong; yet if through Superſtition or ſtrange Cuſtom and Vogue, or through any wildneſs or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy of Opinion, there come to be very groſs miſtakes in the aſſignment or application of the Affection (as when human Sacrifices or Beſtiality are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed as worthy and right) this cannot but be wrong and vitious; and muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate a man <hi>ill:</hi> and the ſame when the Miſtakes are leſs groſs; but ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated and frequent, that a Creature cannot well live in a natural ſtate; nor
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59040:19"/>
with due affections, ſo as to perform his part even but tolerably well towards his Society or Syſtem.</p>
                  <p>AND thus we find how far Virtue (which is Goodneſs or Soundneſs of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in a rational Creature) depends on a right knowlege of what is right and wrong, and on ſuch a right uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as may give ground to a right appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and exerciſe of the Affections; that nothing horrid or unnatural, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unexemplary, nothing contrary to, or deſtructive of that natural Affection by which the Species or Society is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, may on any account or principle whatſoever, through any notion of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or on any pretence of good to Mankind, or of obedience to ſupreme Powers, be at any time affected or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted as a good and proper Object of inclinable Affection, Love, and Eſteem. For ſuch an Affection as this muſt be wholly vitious: and whatſoever is acted upon it, can be no other than Vice and Immorality. And thus if there be any thing which teaches men either Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, Ingratitude, or Cruelty, tho un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the color and pretence of Religion, or of any preſent or future good to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind or Society; if there be any thing which teaches men (as amongſt ſome Indians) that to torment Captives of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59040:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
War in ſport, and to eat their fleſh, is a thing very plauſible; or that to eat the fleſh of Enemies; or that to cut and ſlaſh themſelves in a religious Fury be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their God; or to commit all ſort of Beſtiality, is excellent or lovely in it ſelf, or conducing to his particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Society, or to Society in general, or to the Intereſt or Honor of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and as ſuch, praiſeworthy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable; be it what it will that teaches this; be it Cuſtom that gives applauſe, or Religion that gives a Sanction; this is not <hi>Virtue,</hi> nor ever will be of any kind, or in any ſenſe; but is ſtill horrid Depravity in theſe men, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Cuſtom or Religion of their Country, which may be ill and vitious it ſelf, but can never alter the eternal meaſures and true nature of Virtue.</p>
                  <p>TO conclude therefore, upon this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from what has bin ſaid before. As to thoſe Creatures who are only capable of being moved by <hi>ſenſible Objects;</hi> they can only be either GOOD <hi>or Vitious</hi> (for we cannot ſay they are VIRTUOUS <hi>or Vitious</hi>) as thoſe ſort of Affections ſtand. A Creature on the other hand, capable of framing in his mind thoſe other <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Objects</hi> of moral Good, of Juſtice and Right, of what is generous, worthy, and becoming; altho his other Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59040:20"/>
towards <hi>the ſenſible Objects</hi> may, any of them, remain ill; yet if they do not prevail over him, becauſe of his good Affections to the other ſort (that is to ſay, to Goodneſs and Virtue, as they are <hi>Objects of his Reaſon</hi>) then is his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temper good in the main; and the Perſon eſteem'd-virtuous by all people, according to that natural Temper which is the Teſt ſtill, and by which every thing of Goodneſs or Virtue is meaſur'd.</p>
                  <p>NOW, if by natural Temper any one is paſſionate, angry, fearful, amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or the like; but that he reſiſts theſe Paſſions, and keeps to Virtue, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their impreſſion and force, we ſay commonly in this caſe, <hi>that the Virtue is ſo much the greater:</hi> and we ſay well. Tho if that which keeps the Perſon virtuous, in oppoſition to theſe Diſpoſitions, be no good Affection elſewhere in the Temper towards Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Virtue; but that it be only ſome Affection towards privat good or ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good (as hope of Reward, or dread of Puniſhment) then is this not ſo much as any Virtue at all, as has bin ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But this ſtill is evident, that if an angry Temper bears, or an amorous one refrains, ſo as that nothing of Severity, nor any Action immodeſt or irregular can be drawn or forc'd from ſuch a one,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59040:20"/>
thus ſtrongly tempted; we applaud the Virtue of the Perſon, above what we ſhould do, if he were free of this Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and theſe Propenſities: tho, at the ſame time, there is no body will ſay that a propenſity to Vice can be any way underſtood to be an addition to Virtue, or helping to complete a virtuous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. But thus it is. If there be any part of the natural Temper in which ill Paſſions or Affections are ſtir'd, and which is conſequently vitious; but that in another part of the natural Temper the Affections are ſo vaſtly forcible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Good; and that the ſentiments of Right and Wrong, of a virtuous Life, and of Integrity, are ſo ſtrongly fixed, as to maſter theſe other Attempts, of a contrary vitious Temper; then is this the greateſt proof imaginable, how ſtrong the principle of Virtue is in ſuch a perſon, and how much a thorow good Affection toward Good and Right (which is the true principle of Virtue) is ſtrongly fixed in and poſſeſſed of the natural Temper. Whereas if there be no ſuch ill Paſſions ſtirring in the natural Temper, a perſon may be much more <hi>cheaply</hi> virtuous; and may live virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having ſo much of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous principle as this other. But if this other, who has the principle of Virtue
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59040:21"/>
ſo highly and ſo ſtrongly implanted, be without, or do loſe theſe natural Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments; he certainly loſes nothing in Virtue, or is wanting in any manner to Virtue; but loſing that other part which is vitious in his natural Temper, is more entire to Virtue, and has it in a clearer and higher degree.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER ill the natural Temper be with reſpect to the ſenſible Objects; as for inſtance, however paſſionate, furious, luſtful or cruel any Creature naturally be; yet if there be any attractiveneſs or prevalency in thoſe rational Objects of Juſtice, Generoſity, Gratitude, or any other Image or Repreſentation of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſo as that it draws an Affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; there is however ſome Virtue here. And on the other ſide, however vitious the Mind be; or whatever ill Rules or Principles it goes by; yet if there be any flexibleneſs in the Temper towards the ſenſible Objects of moral Good or Ill (as when there is any ſuch thing as Mercy, Compaſſion, Bounty) ſtill there is ſome good left in that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and he is not wholly unnatural and depraved.</p>
                  <p>THUS a Ruffian who refuſes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Aſſociates out of a ſenſe of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Honor of any kind whatever; and who rather than betray them is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59040:21"/>
to endure Torments in a Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and there expire, has ſomething of the principle of Virtue, and may be call'd virtuous in ſome degree: and ſo in the ſame manner that Malefactor who rather than do the office of Executioner to his Relations, choſe to be executed with them.</p>
                  <p>IN ſhort, therefore, it is hard to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce of any man, <hi>that he has no Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> or <hi>that he is entirely vitious;</hi> there being few even of the horrideſt Villains who have not ſomething of Virtue, or ſome Goodneſs. Nothing being more juſt than what is a known ſaying, THAT IT IS AS HARD TO FIND A MAN WHOLLY ILL, AS WHOLLY GOOD: becauſe wherever there is any good Affection left, there is ſome Goodneſs or ſome Virtue ſtill remaining.</p>
                  <p>AND, having conſider'd thus as to Virtue, what it is, we may now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how it ſtands with reſpect to the Opinions concerning a Deity, as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd.</p>

                  <p>THE nature of Virtue conſiſting (as has bin explain'd) in juſt and equal Affection, which we may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after call <hi>a due ſenſe of Right and Wrong,</hi> as comprehending in one the ſoundneſs both of Judgment and Affection; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can in a Creature capable of ſuch a <hi>ſenſe,</hi> exclude a principle of Virtue, or can obſtruct or make it ineffectual, but what</p>
                  <p>1. EITHER wholly, or in ſome degree, excludes or takes away the <hi>ſenſe of Right and Wrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. OR cauſes a wrong and diſturb'd <hi>ſenſe</hi> of what is right and wrong.</p>
                  <p>3. OR, tho there be a ſenſe of Right and Wrong, is the means however of guiding the Affection to what is contrary. As when a man knowing any Action or. Behavior to be morally ill and deform'd, yet through ſome violent paſſion, as of Luſt or Anger, or through love of ſome imagined good, he notwithſtanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ill or unſociable Action.</p>
                  <p>AND ſo, on the other ſide, nothing can be aſſiſtant to, or promote Virtue, but what <hi>either</hi> in ſome manner nouriſhes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59040:22"/>
and ſupports that ſenſe of Right and Wrong, <hi>or</hi> preſerves it from being falſe and imaginary, <hi>or</hi> cauſes it, when ſound and genuin, to be obey'd and ſubmitted to, by ſubduing and ſubjecting the other Affections to it.</p>
                  <p>UPON this account therefore, we are to conſider, how it is that any of theſe Opinions about the ſubject of a Deity do affect in theſe caſes, or cauſe any of theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>I. AS to <hi>the firſt caſe,</hi> THE TAKING AWAY THE NOTION OR SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG. It will not be imagin'd, that by this is meant the taking away the notion or ſenſe of what is good or ill for the Species, or in Society, ſince this is what no rational Creature can be unſenſible of: but, it is then that we ſay it of a Creature, that he has loſt the ſenſe of Right and Wrong, when being able to diſcern the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Ill</hi> of his Species, he has at the ſame time no concern for either, nor any ſenſe of excellency or baſeneſs in what relates to one or the other. So that except mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with relation to privat or ſeparat Good, there is nothing which gains any eſtimation or any good affection towards it; nothing which is thought right, or worthy <hi>in it ſelf</hi> of admiration, love or good affection; nor any thing on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59040:23"/>
ſide which is accordingly diſlik'd or hated, as morally ill, be it ever ſo horrid or deform'd.</p>
                  <p>THERE is in effect no rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatſoever, but knows that when he offends or dos harm to any one, he cannot fail to create an expectation or fear of like ill, and conſequently a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and animoſity in any Creature looking on; and therefore muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf of being liable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in ſome manner to ſuch a treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from every one, as if he had in ſome degree offended all.</p>
                  <p>THUS Offence and Injury is always known as puniſhable, and claiming pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from every one; and Equal Behavior, which is therefore called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> as rewardable and well deſerving from every one. This is no more than what the wickedeſt creature imaginable has, and cannot but have a ſenſe of. So that if we have any farther meaning in this, of a <hi>ſenſe of Right and Wrong;</hi> if there be any ſenſe of Right and Wrong which an abſolute wicked creature has not, it can be only the hatred and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of what is accounted morally ill; HATRED of offence and injury, as <hi>ſuch merely,</hi> and the love of, or approbation of what is accounted morally good; LOVE of equal Behavior; equal and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59040:23"/>
kind Affection <hi>as ſuch merely,</hi> and not becauſe of conſequent Puniſhment or Reward, which implies only love of privat Good, hatred of privat Ill, and not of any thing farther, as <hi>in it ſelf</hi> amiable or deteſtable. So that <hi>Senſe of Right and Wrong,</hi> as here treated of, is nothing but the very Affection it ſelf of kindneſs or diſlike to ſuch objects of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good or ill, as above explain'd.</p>
                  <p>IT is ſcarcely to be conceiv'd, that any Creature ſhould be at the very firſt ſo ill, and of ſo curſt a nature, as that if it be merely a ſenſible, not a rational Creature, it ſhould as ſoon as it comes to be try'd by objects, have no one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Goodneſs towards its kind, no foundation in its Temper of either pity, love, ſuccorableneſs, or the like: or if the Creature be more than ſenſible, and be a rational Creature, that it ſhould as ſoon as it comes to be try'd by rational Objects, as of Juſtice, Generoſity, and other Virtue, have no inclining Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no kind of <hi>liking</hi> towards theſe, or <hi>diſlike</hi> towards what is on the contrary ſide cruel, horrid, baſe, villanous, or the like, but ſo as to be of abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference towards any thing of this kind; this is in a manner impoſſible to ſuppoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59040:24"/>SENSE of Right and Wrong there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being as natural to us as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affection</hi> it ſelf, and being a firſt principle in our Conſtitution and Make; there is no ſpeculative Opinion, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, or Belief, which is capable <hi>immediatly,</hi> and <hi>of it ſelf</hi> to exclude or deſtroy it: and it being it ſelf an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of firſt riſe and production in the affectionate part, the Soul or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; nothing but contrary Affection, by frequent check and controul, can ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon it ſo as to make it ceaſe to be; ſince that which is of original and pure nature, nothing but contrary Habit or Cuſtom (a ſecond nature) is able to diſplace: for, where the Mind is the moſt earneſtly bent, merely againſt any bodily geſture or meen, either natural or by Habit acquir'd, and would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to break it, ſo as to remove it wholly out of the carriage; it is not by ſuch an immediate and ſudden diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, or contrary bent of the Mind that this can be remov'd; neither can that Affection in the Soul, of hatred to Inhumanity, love of Mercy, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe in a rational Creature implies a ſenſe in ſome degree of Right and Wrong, be inſtantly, nor yet without much force and violence effac'd or ſtruck out of the natural Temper, even by the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59040:24"/>
means of the moſt pernicious Opinion and Belief in the world. But this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief being not to be effected directly through any Opinion, but in conſequence and by effect of untoward and oppoſit Affection (which may often be owing to, and occaſion'd by Opinion) we may then ſpeak of it more particularly when we ſpeak of the ill operation of other Affections, ſet in oppoſition to that of a ſenſe of Right and Wrong.</p>
                  <p>II. AS to the ſecond caſe. If there be A SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG, BUT THAT IT BE MORE OR LESS MISTAKEN AND CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FOUNDED, as in the caſe of thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations, as above; it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that it is no Opinion at all about the ſubject of a Deity which influences in this place: for it is frequently nothing elſe but the cuſtom of ſome Countries, and the force of Education againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where ſuch and ſuch things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly view'd with Applauſe and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor accompanying them. So that it is poſſible that a man forcing himſelf, may eat the fleſh of his enemies, not only againſt his Stomach, but <hi>againſt his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) and yet think it very right and honorable, as being of conſiderable ſervice to his Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and capable of advancing the name,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59040:25"/>
and ſpreading the terror of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>BUT to ſpeak of the Opinions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to a Deity, and what effect they have in this place, which is our buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>AS to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> it dos not ſeem that it can directly have any effect at all here towards the ſetting up, or making of a falſe ſpecies or ſhew of Right or Wrong. For tho a man by ill practice, which may be occaſion'd by Atheiſm, may come to loſe, in a manner, all ſenſe of Right and Wrong (that is to ſay, all ſenſe of good or ill, amiableneſs or deformity in any moral Action, as above) tho Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, thus, may be the occaſion of an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thorow ſelfiſhneſs, as when a creature has ſcarcely any thing that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts him but what is of a ſelfiſh kind, and what relates to a deliberat ſelf-end, the ſatisfaction of ſome Luſt, or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the animal State; yet it dos not ſeem that Atheiſm ſhould of it ſelf be the cauſe of any ſuch eſtimation, or valuing of any thing as noble of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, generous, ſelf-worthy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, which was juſt the contrary: ſo as that it ſhould be thought that the being able to eat man's Fleſh, to commit Beſtiality, or any ſuch like Actions as have bin mention'd, were after the ſame manner, <hi>good and excellent in themſelves.</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59040:25"/>
But this is certain, that by means of ill Religion, or <hi>Superſtition,</hi> many things the moſt horridly unnatural and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, come to be receiv'd as moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, good and laudable in themſelves: For, where the commiting Beſtiality is taught as a religious Practice, there it is generally in high eſteem, and thought to be in it ſelf a thing excellent: For if any thing that is abominable and horrid be injoin'd by Religion, as the ſuppos'd command of ſome Deity; if the thing be not taken for good and excellent, but for horrid and abominable, then muſt the Deity be taken for ſuch, and be thought of as a Being odious and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; which every Religion forbids to believe. Therefore whatever teaches the love and admiration of a Deity, that has any character of <hi>Ill,</hi> teaches at the ſame time a love and admiration of that <hi>Ill,</hi> and cauſes that to be taken for good and amiable which is horrid and deteſtable.</p>
                  <p>SO that if the Praiſe and Love of a Deity be that which is proper to every Religion, there is no Religion where God is not repreſented intirely good, and free of malignity, injuſtice and cruelty, but what muſt make that ſort whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, of malignity, injuſtice, or cruelty, to be applauded and taken for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59040:26"/>
Good and Right; and muſt be the cauſe therefore of mens acting againſt natural Affection, and of their growing malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, unjuſt, cruel, and the like.</p>
                  <p>FOR inſtance; if JUPITER be he that is ador'd and reverenc'd; and that the Hiſtory of JUPITER makes him to be luſtful, and to ſatiate his Luſt in the moſt looſe and exorbitant manner; then is it impoſſible but his Worſhipper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving this Hiſtory and Character, muſt be taught a greater love of luſtful Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If there be a Religion that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the adoration and love of a God, whoſe Character it is to be full of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, captious, and of high reſentment, ſubject to wrath and anger, furious, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful, and revenging injuries on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers than thoſe who did injury; and if there be added in the Character of this God, a fraudulent inclination, incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceit and treachery, favorable to a few, and that for ſlight cauſes or no cauſe, and cruel to the reſt; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the caſe of ſuch a Religion as this, that it muſt of neceſſity raiſe even an approbation and reſpect towards the vices and imperfections of this kind, and breed accordingly that parallel diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that unſociable and jealous temper, partiality, ſelfiſhneſs, moroſeneſs, bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and revengefulneſs, as well as trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59040:26"/>
and inhumanity: for whatever is of this nature muſt in many caſes appear noble to him who views theſe things in that Being to which he gives the higheſt Honor and Veneration.</p>
                  <p>BUT, if it be ſuppos'd, that in the worſhip of ſuch a God, there is nothing beſides what proceeds merely from fear and aw, without the leaſt eſteem or love towards him, as to one ſuppos'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable or excellent; then is not any one indeed by this opinion, miſled as to his notion of Right and Wrong, of what is amiable or deteſtable in Actions. For if in following the precepts of his God, or doing what is neceſſary towards the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of ſuch his Deity, he be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd only by fear, and act againſt his inclination the thing which he diſlikes as barbarous, unnatural, or any other way ill and odious; then has he a ſenſe of what is ill, and of what Right and Wrong is, and is ſenſible of ill in the character of his God: however nice he be in pronouncing any thing concerning it, or in not daring ſo much as to think for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally about it out of a ſuperſtitious fear or ſhyneſs. For whoever pretends to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a God, and that God is <hi>juſt and good,</hi> muſt mean that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice, Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> according to which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59040:27"/>
that God <hi>is juſt:</hi> for if the Will of God, or Law of God alone, be ſaid to be that which makes <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> then muſt this be a name only for what <hi>is or is not his Will:</hi> for thus if by his will one Perſon were to be puniſh'd for anothers fault, this would be Juſt and Right; and ſo the ſame, if arbitrarily and without reaſon, ſome Beings were made to ſuffer nothing but Ill, and others only to enjoy Good; which to ſay is <hi>juſt,</hi> is to ſay nothing, or to ſpeak without a meaning.</p>
                  <p>AND thus it ever is, and muſt be an ill conſequence in falſe and ill Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that where there is a real Reverence, Eſteem and Worſhip of a ſupreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, repreſented not as abſolutely juſt and perfect, it muſt occaſion the loſs of rectitude in the Creature ſo worſhipping and adoring, and who is thus immorally Religious.</p>
                  <p>TO this I need only add, that as the character of a vitious God (or rather <hi>Daemon</hi> or Idol of the Mind) dos injury to the affections of Men, diſturbs and impairs the ſenſe of Right and Wrong; ſo on the other hand, it muſt highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the fixing of right Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and a ſound ſenſe of Right and Wrong in men, to contemplate, reſpect, and adore a God who is ever, and on all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59040:27"/>
accounts repreſented to them ſo as to be actually a true model and example of the moſt exact Juſtice, and higheſt Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Worth; and who by a conſtant good Affection expreſs'd towards the Whole, muſt of neceſſity engage us to act within our Compaſs, or in our Sphere or Syſtem, according to a like Principle and Affection: and having once the good of the Species or Mankind in view, and as our end or aim, it muſt be with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that we can be miſguided to a wrong ſenſe of what is Right or Wrong. Nor can any thing more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on men, or more naturally form their Minds to a union with Virtue and Excellence, than an eſtabliſh'd opinion, ſuch as this, concerning a ſupreme De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. But of this afterwards.</p>
                  <p>AS to this ſecond caſe therefore; RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGION (according to the kind it may be of) is capable of doing great good or great harm, and ATHEISM not any poſitive good or harm. For, however it may be indirectly an occaſion of mens loſing a good and ſufficient ſenſe of Right and Wrong; yet it will not, <hi>as Atheiſm merely,</hi> be the occaſion of ſetting up falſe Right and Wrong, which only fantaſtical reaſoning, ill cuſtom, or ill Religion can do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59040:28"/>
III. AS to the laſt caſe, THE OP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSITION OF OTHER AFFEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS TO THOSE VIRTUOUS ONES, WHICH CREATE A REAL SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG; it is to be conſider'd that a Creature having this ſort of ſenſe or good Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any conſiderable degree, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily act according to it; if this Affection be not oppos'd <hi>either</hi> by ſome intereſting Affection towards a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary imagin'd Self-good and privat Advantage, <hi>or</hi> by ſome ſtrong and forcible paſſion, as of Luſt or Anger, which may not only overbear the ſenſe of Right and Wrong, but even the ſenſe of privat Advantage too, and overrule even the moſt ſettled opinion of what is conducing to ſelf-good.</p>
                  <p>NOTHING therefore can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or ſuppreſs this <hi>ſenſe</hi> we ſpeak of, or injure the integrity of ſuch a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but what EITHER raiſes or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords growth to thoſe ſtrong and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat Paſſions; OR otherwiſe cauſes an imagination of ſome intereſt or ſelf-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in oppoſition to this affection of Virtue; ſo as to cauſe this good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be reſiſted and gone againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberatly, and in cool judgment. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is of this kind, beſides that it turns a Creature towards Vice in ſpite
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59040:28"/>
of this other good diſpoſition<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it muſt in time alſo even wear out that good diſpoſition it ſelf, and ſo leave the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a manner totally reſign'd to Vice.</p>
                  <p>NOW, in this former part of our Inquiry, our buſineſs is not to examin (as we afterwards ſhall) all the ſeveral ways by which this corruption is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd or increas'd: but we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the opinions concerning a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity do influence one way or another in this place, or cauſe this corruption where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we act <hi>in contradiction of good and right Affection,</hi> and which is follow'd by the loſs of that right Affection, or ſenſe of Right and Wrong.</p>
                  <p>AND this being after this manner complicated, we ſhall treat it more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at large.</p>
                  <p>THAT it is poſſible for a Creature capable of uſing reflection, to have a liking or diſlike of moral Actions, and conſequently a ſenſe of Right and Wrong, before ſuch time as he may have any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſenſe of GOD at all; this is what will hardly be queſtion'd: it being a thing not expected, or any way poſſible, that a Creature ſuch as <hi>Man,</hi> ariſing from his Childhood ſlowly and gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to ſeveral degrees of Reaſon and Reflection, ſhould at the very firſt be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59040:29"/>
taken up with thoſe ſpeculations or more refin'd ſort of Reflections, about the ſubject of God's Exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>BUT to make this more plain; let us ſuppoſe a Creature wanting Reaſon, or unable to reflect at all, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding has many good Qualities and Affections; as conſidering only that one of Pity or Compaſſionatneſs: it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that if you give to this Creature a reflecting faculty, it will at the ſame inſtant approve of Charity and Pity, be taken with any ſhew or repreſentation of Pity, and think <hi>Pity</hi> amiable and good, and <hi>Cruelty</hi> the contrary: and ſo the ſame in caſe of any other Paſſion or Affection. And this is to be capable of Virtue, and to have a ſenſe of Right and Wrong.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE therefore that a Creature may be ſuppos'd to have any Notion or Opinion one way or other, concerning the ſubject of a God, he may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have a ſenſe of Right and Wrong, and to have Virtue and Vice in different degrees; as we know by experience of thoſe who have liv'd in ſuch places, or in ſuch a manner as never to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into any thoughts or opinion at all in that matter; who yet are very different amongſt themſelves, as to their Honeſty, Good nature and Virtue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59040:29"/>BUT whether we ſuppoſe in a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but the leaſt part of this good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or virtuous Principle; let us conſider what it is (as to any of theſe Opinions concerning a Deity) that can, or is likely <hi>to raiſe any Affection in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> or on the other ſide, may be able <hi>to prevent and hinder any ſuch oppoſit Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſubdue it, or make it leſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW, as to the belief of a Deity, and how men are influenc'd to yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and act in conformity to ſuch a ſupreme Being; it muſt be either <hi>in the way of his</hi> POWER, as expecting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or harm from him, or <hi>in the way of his</hi> EXCELLENCY <hi>and adorable Perfections,</hi> as thinking it the perfection of Nature, and higheſt Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to follow and imitate him, or to be approv'd by him.</p>
                  <p>IF (as in the firſt caſe) there be a belief or conception of a Deity, who is fear'd as one that will puniſh ſuch or ſuch a Behavior; and if upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>through the fear of ſuch a certain Puniſhment,</hi> the Creature be reſtrain'd from doing that particular ill, which he is not otherwiſe in any manner averſe from; this is not, nor ever can be, as has bin prov'd, any Virtue or Goodneſs, any more than as it may be ſaid perhaps, that there is meekneſs and gentleneſs in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59040:30"/>
a Tyger chain'd up, or innocence and ſobriety in a Monky under the diſciplin of the Whip. For however orderly and well thoſe Animals, or Man himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like terms, may be brought to act, while the Mind or Reaſon is not gain'd, nor the Inclinations carri'd that way; but that Aw alone is that which prevails and forces obedience; the obedience is but <hi>ſervil,</hi> and all that is done through it merely <hi>ſervil;</hi> and the greater degree of ſuch a ſubmiſſion or compliance is but the greater <hi>ſervility</hi> towards whatſoever ſubject it chance to be. For, whether ſuch a Creature have a good Maſter, or an ill one, he is not leſs ſervil in his own nature: and tho the Maſter or Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſo fear'd be ever ſo perfect, and of ſo excellent a Nature, yet the greater and more proſtitute ſubmiſſion that is caus'd in this caſe, and through this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or Motive only, is but the lower and more abject ſervitude, and implies the greater wretchedneſs and meanneſs in the Creature, as having thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Self-love, or towards Self-good ſo much more ſtrong and exceſſive, that is to ſay, more faultily and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; as has bin explain'd. So that this belief of a God diſpenſing Rewards and Puniſhments according to ſuch and ſuch Actions, is not of it ſelf <hi>directly</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59040:30"/>
the cauſe of <hi>Virtue;</hi> tho it may be perhaps of <hi>a virtuous-like Behavior.</hi> But if it be the character of a Religion, to injoin not only the good Action, but the Affection, ſuch as Charity and Love; and that in reality it be the effect of ſuch a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make men endeavor all they can to create in themſelves ſuch free diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Goodneſs: then is a Perſon by this means made to have Virtue in any particular, when he begins to act through ſuch ſincere and ſound Affection. And thus the fear of Puniſhment and hope of Reward may be underſtood to be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Virtue, when it gives riſe to another Principle than it ſelf, and is at length the occaſion of doing good out of ſome other Affection than either that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Reward, or that of apprehenſion and dread of Puniſhment; there being no ſuch thing poſſible as either actual Love, Charity, or Goodneſs, till ſuch time.</p>
                  <p>IF (as in the ſecond caſe) there be a belief or conception of a Deity, who is admir'd and ador'd, as being underſtood to have the moſt high and glorious Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; ſuch as of infinit Power and Wiſdom, which make him conſpicuous and cauſe him of neceſſity to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd and held in Veneration; and if in the manner that this ſoveraign and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59040:31"/>
mighty Being is apprehended, or as he is related and deſcrib'd, there appear in him a high and eminent regard to what is good and excellent, a concern for the good of <hi>all,</hi> or an affection of Kindneſs and Love towards the Whole; ſuch an example as this (of the good of which we have already ſpoken) muſt certainly help to raiſe and increaſe the affection towards Virtue, and help to ſubmit and ſubdue all other Affections to that. And if join'd to this, there be an opinion or apprehenſion of the ſuperintendency and all-ſeeingneſs of ſuch a ſupreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as <hi>one</hi> who is a witneſs and ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of human Actions, and conſcious of whatſoever is felt or acted in the Univerſe; ſo that in the perfecteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs or deepeſt Solitude there is not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>one</hi> cloſely join'd to us, whoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſingly is of more moment than that of the moſt Auguſt Aſſembly on Earth, or of all Mankind overlooking, before whom as the ſhame of guilty Actions muſt be the greateſt ſhame, ſo the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of well-doing, even under the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt cenſure of a whole World, muſt be the greateſt Honor and Applauſe; in this caſe, it is to the commoneſt view appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent how far conducing <hi>a perfect Theiſm</hi> muſt be to Virtue, and how much want there is in <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59040:31"/>THEREFORE, if there be a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceiv'd, all-intelligent, and all-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of infinit Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs; the belief of ſuch a Being (which is barely <hi>the Theiſtical Belief</hi> and no more) muſt of neceſſity, thus, be highly effectual to the creating or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of good Affections, and to the removing of contrary ones; by rendring every thing that is of Virtue more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſplendid, and attractive, and every thing that is of Vice more ignominious and deform'd.</p>
                  <p>WHAT the fear of <hi>future Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and hopes of certain <hi>future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> may farther do towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Virtue; and of what Benefit this acceſſion of Belief may be to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, we ſhall further conſider as we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <p>BUT this in the mean while is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that neither can this fear or hope be of the kind of thoſe Affections which we call <hi>good Affections,</hi> as being the ſprings and ſources of all Actions truly <hi>good.</hi> Nor yet can it, as has bin prov'd, ſo much as admit of a thorow good Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, where it ſtands as eſſential to any moral performance, or where it has to do, as but in <hi>part a motive</hi> to that which ſome other Affection ought <hi>alone</hi> to have bin a <hi>motive full and ſufficient:</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59040:32"/>
ſo that it is therefore not only <hi>not the Cauſe,</hi> but is <hi>excluſive</hi> in ſome degree, of any virtuous Action, and muſt withal, as it increaſes, ſtrengthen the vitious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that of <hi>exceſſive ſelfiſhneſs, or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual earneſt attention of the Mind, and application of the Paſſions towards ſelf-good;</hi> which Principle as it is improv'd and made ſtronger every day, by the ſtrong exerciſe of the Paſſions in this Subject of more extended Self-intereſt, muſt ſpread it ſelf through the whole Life; and by cauſing a greater attention to ſelf-good in every thing elſe, muſt of neceſſity take off from, and diminiſh the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards other Good, that is to ſay, public and extenſive Good, or good of the Syſtem, as above; in ſhort, muſt deſtroy more and more true Generoſity and Virtue, and introduce meanneſs and narrowneſs of Soul.</p>
                  <p>THUS if true Piety be eſteem'd a Love of God for his own excellency, it will follow, that as this ſolicitous regard to privat Good expected from him, is greater or leſſer; ſo it will prove either more or leſs a diminution to the Love of God for his own excellence, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prove a diminution of Piety: becauſe whilſt God is belov'd <hi>only</hi> as the cauſe of privat Good to any one, he is belov'd but as any other inſtrument or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59040:32"/>
means of Pleaſure by any vitious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and when there is more of this ſort of Paſſion or Affection towards pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat good, there is leſs room, as has bin ſhewn, for the other towards more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Good, or towards any deſerving object worthy of Love and Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for its own ſake; ſuch as is God.</p>
                  <p>IN the ſame manner, if the love and deſire of Life, or prolongation of Being, be remarkably ſtrong in any Creature; the ſtronger it is, the leſs he is able to have true ſubmiſſion or reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Providence, or the Rule and Order of God, and conſequently the leſs is his Piety. And if his Reſignation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly on that expectation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit Reward, the meaning of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, whatever the appearance be, is only this, <hi>That he reſigns all other things upon a condition of</hi> THAT <hi>which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes to be much beyond an Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, viz.</hi> eternal Living, and in a State of higheſt Pleaſure and Enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>BUT, notwithſtanding this, it is certain that altho the Principle of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue cannot in its own nature but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer diminution by whatſoever is of that other Kind; as by <hi>eagerneſs of Reward</hi> (which by it ſelf, and in the room of better Affection is <hi>mercenarineſs</hi>) and <hi>dread of Puniſhment</hi> (which is in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59040:33"/>
ſame ſenſe <hi>ſervility:</hi>) and altho as any ſuch ardent purſuit of Pleaſure, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great attention of the Mind to ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment increaſes, the principle of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, Magnanimity and Virtue, muſt ſuffer and decreaſe; yet it is certain that this Principle of <hi>fear of future Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>hope of future Reward</hi> may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, and in particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, be the occaſion of great good and advantage to Virtue; and what this may be, we ſhall to the full endeavor to ſhew.</p>
                  <p>IT has bin already conſider'd how, that notwithſtanding any implanted ſenſe of Right and Wrong, or any good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards Society, yet by violent Paſſion, as by Rage or Luſt, this other good Affection may be frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol'd and overcome. Where therefore there is nothing in the Mind capable to make ſuch Paſſions as theſe the objects of its averſion, and to cauſe them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to be oppos'd and ſtruggled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; in this caſe, if there be any thing in Religion which creates a belief that Paſſions of this kind as well as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Actions, are the object of a Deitys animadverſion, it is certain that ſuch a Belief muſt be allow'd benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to Virtue, as it will be allow'd to tend to the calming of the Mind, and to the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59040:33"/>
diſpoſing or fitting the Perſon to a better recollection and obſervance of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good and virtuous Principle, which by being unobſtructed muſt the more increaſe.</p>
                  <p>THIS alſo may be ſaid as to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which this Belief <hi>of a future Reward and Puniſhment</hi> may prove to Virtue; that as it is capable of raiſing men to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue who were at firſt in a manner ſtrangers to it; ſo where men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in a virtuous Courſe, it may prove that which alone can ſave them from falling off from the Virtue they poſſeſs, into a licentious and vitious practiſe.</p>
                  <p>TO prove how this may be, we may conſider the thing thus. A Perſon who has much of goodneſs and natural recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in his Temper, being ſenſible of Poverty, Croſſes and Adverſity; and being perhaps of a Nature too ſenſible towards ſome certain Pleaſures, as of Fame or Reputation, Eaſe, Indolency or Repoſe; it is certain that the meeting with any of theſe <hi>firſt,</hi> or the being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in any of theſe <hi>latter,</hi> muſt give a ſourneſs and diſtaſte to the Temper, and make it averſe to that which is the occaſion of ſuch ill. Now if the Perſon be ſo affected as to think his Honeſty or ſtrict Integrity to be at any time the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this ill; it is likely he may be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59040:34"/>
made diſſatisfi'd with his good Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Principles. And if his own thoughts, or the corrupt inſinuations of other men ſtill preſent this to his Mind, <hi>that his Honeſty is the occaſion of this ill to him,</hi> and <hi>that if freed from this reſtraint of Virtue and Honeſty, he might be much happier;</hi> 'tis very obvious that his love and reliſh towards Virtue and Honeſty, muſt every day diminiſh, as the Temper grows uneaſy and quarrels with it. But if he oppoſes to this the conſideration, that Honeſty carries with it, if not a preſent, at leaſt a future recompence, ſo as to make up that loſs to privat or ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good which he repines at; then may this injury to his good Temper and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Principle be prevented, and his Love or Affection towards Honeſty and Virtue remain the ſame.</p>
                  <p>IN the ſame manner where there is not a love, but a ſort of averſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what is Good and Virtuous, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Lenity and Forgivingneſs, and that there is a love of its contrary, <hi>Revenge;</hi> it is poſſible and very natural, that by the conſideration that <hi>Lenity</hi> is, by its rewards, made the cauſe of a greater ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good; that very Affection of Lenity and Mildneſs may be induſtriouſly nouriſh'd, and the contrary depreſs'd; ſo that the good Affection may come at laſt to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59040:34"/>
ſeated in the Temper, and the good and proper Object to be belov'd, as by a Creature well affected, <hi>when no Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or reward is thought of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THUS we ſee that in a State or Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, a virtuous and good Adminiſtration, and an equal and juſt diſtribution of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments is of ſervice, not only to reſtrain vitious men, and to make them act uſefully to the public; but, by making Virtue to be apparently the intereſt of every one, it removes all prejudices againſt it, creates a fair recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it, and leads men into that path which afterwards they cannot eaſily quit. For, thus a People made virtuous by the long courſe of a wiſe and juſt Adminiſtration, when ever this happens to be interrupted by ſome ſudden Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny or Uſurpation, they will on this account rather be raiſed to exert a ſtronger Virtue. And even, where by long and continued arts of a prevailing Tyranny, they are at laſt totally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, the ſeeds of that Virtue will ſtill remain, and for ſome Ages afterwards ſhew themſelves not wholly extinct. But this withal we muſt here obſerve, that it is <hi>Example</hi> which chiefly works theſe Effects; for a virtuous Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſeldom but accompanied with Virtue in the Magiſtrate. Nor is it ſo
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59040:35"/>
much the reward it ſelf, or the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which dos this, as the natural eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Virtue, and ſhame of Villany which is excited and mov'd by theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the hatred of Mankind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards injuſtice, and their approbation of Goodneſs and Virtue. For even in the ſuffering of the greateſt Villains them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we ſee generally that the infamy of their Act, the odiouſneſs of their Crime, and their ſhame towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, contribute more to their miſery than all beſides; and that it is not ſo much Death it ſelf which creates their horror, as that kind of Death they undergo.</p>
                  <p>IT is the ſame in privat Families: and here tho the Slaves and mercenary Servants, reſtrain'd and made orderly by puniſhment, and by the ſeverity of their Maſter, are not on that account made Good or Honeſt; yet the ſame maſter of the Family uſing proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments towards his Children, teaches them Goodneſs, and by this help inſtructs them in a Virtue which afterwards they practiſe upon other grounds, and without thoughts of reward.</p>
                  <p>IF by <hi>the thoughts of future Reward,</hi> or what regards another State, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the love and deſire of virtuous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, or of the very practice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59040:35"/>
of Virtue in another Life; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation or hope of this, muſt not only be a great encouragement to Virtue; but it appears plainly, that the very fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Virtue in hope to obtain that ſupreme Happineſs which conſiſts in the perfection of it, is of it ſelf a degree of Virtue, a proof of the ſincere Love we have for it, as for its own ſake; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be call'd a motive of ſelf-intereſt or ſelfiſhneſs: for if the love of Virtue be any thing diſtinct from that which we mean by common and narrow ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, then the love and deſire of Life (when lov'd and deſir'd for the ſake of Virtue alone) muſt alſo be diſtinct. But if the deſire of continu'd or prolong'd Life, be only through the violence of that averſion which is towards Death; if it be through the love and deſire of ſomething elſe in Life, than virtuous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Practice, and through the unwillingneſs of parting with ſomething elſe than what is purely of this kind; then is this no longer any Virtue, or ſign of Virtue.</p>
                  <p>WHOEVER therefore (from what has bin ſaid before) is after any manner, or in any way at all perſwaded or induc'd to think that Honeſty and Virtue have their Rewards; ſuch a one is capable of being led to a Virtue which he already
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59040:36"/>
is not arriv'd at; tho yet his doing any thing on the conſideration or foreſight merely of ſuch Reward ſeparate from Virtue and of another nature, is no Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; nor even that thing of ſetting about to make himſelf virtuous on that ſcore, can be any Virtue. For tho he may intend to be virtuous, he is not become ſo, for having only intended, or for on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intending to be ſo, becauſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Virtue: but as ſoon as he is come to have one ſingle good Affection, any Affection towards what is good and worthy, ſociable, human, or any way morally good, as liking and affecting this <hi>for its own ſake,</hi> and as good and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>in it ſelf;</hi> then is he in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree Good and Virtuous, and not till then.</p>
                  <p>UPON the whole therefore, one who has not any Reaſon or Belief to hinder him from thinking that Virtue is the cauſe of Miſery, and is of ſelf-ill, ſuch a one muſt be ſubject to loſe much of his Virtue and good Diſpoſition. And one who has a contrary Reaſon and Belief, which makes him think Virtue to be his Good, or a cauſe of good to him, has an inducement to Virtue, and an aſſiſtance in it which the other has not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59040:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>WHOEVER thinks always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently, or according to one fix'd or ſettled Judgment, <hi>that Virtue cauſes Happineſs, and Vice Miſery;</hi> or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is, who, as they ſay common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>feels by himſelf,</hi> that he can never be happy, if he quits his Integrity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency; either of theſe Perſons carry with them that requiſit ſecurity, and that aſſiſtance to Virtue abovemention'd. Or if there are ſuch who have not ſuch thoughts, nor can believe that Virtue is their intereſt in Life, except they are otherwiſe rewarded; yet if they believe a God diſpenſing Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this preſent, or in a future State, to Virtue and Vice, they carry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo this ſecurity and aſſiſtance to Virtue along with them; whilſt their Belief continues thus, and is not in the leaſt either wavering or doubtful. For it muſt be obſerv'd here, that whenſoever the dependence upon this is exceeding great, it very much takes off from any other dependence or encouragement; for, where high Rewards are inforc'd, and the imagination ſtrongly turn'd towards them, the other natural Motives to Goodneſs are apt to loſe much of their force, whilſt the Mind is thus tranſported and taken up in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation and purſuit of a highly elevated
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59040:37"/>
Self-intereſt, and in a concernment of ſuch infinit importance to our ſelves in particular, that on this account, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Affections towards Friends, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Mankind (mere worldly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) are ſlightly look'd upon; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of our Soul being ſo far ſuperior. And we know this by experience, that the Perſons who are the moſt highly Devout, are, from the contemplation of the high enjoyments of another State, accuſtom'd to undervalue all other earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantages of Goodneſs; and in the ſame religious Zeal are often carri'd to decry all other natural benefits of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: ſo as to declare, that except only for the ſake of that ſupreme Reward, they would deveſt themſelves of all Goodneſs at once, and ſhould think it their greateſt advantage to be vitious. So that there may be nothing more fatal to Virtue, than the weak and uncertain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a future Reward and Puniſhment; for, having laid the ſtreſs wholly here, if this come to fail, or looſly to waver, it muſt prove a betraying of Virtue, and muſt prove, if not the ruin, at leaſt of mighty prejudice to mens Morals.</p>
                  <p>BUT to return to our Argument; the belief of a God therefore may ſupply that defect in the Thought or Opinion concerning the want of Happineſs in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59040:37"/>
Virtue, which Atheiſm has no remedy for. Altho it be not otherwiſe imply'd, but that without an abſolute and clear aſſent to that Hypotheſis of full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>Theiſm;</hi> the other Opinion, or the other Thoughts as to the Happineſs of a man with good Affections, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of a man with contrary ones, may poſſibly be eſtabliſh'd in the Mind; and ſo Virtue be eſteem'd good, or the means of Good; and Vice always the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Tho yet the natural tendency of Atheiſm be very different; ſince beſides the unaptneſs and diſproportion of ſuch a belief as that of Atheiſm, to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion or imagination of any thing in ſuch juſt order, and according to ſo admirable a diſpoſition as that would be, were Virtue always the Good, and Vice the Ill of every Creature: it muſt be beſides confeſs'd too, that there is a great deal wanting in this Belief to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the promotion of that particular good Affection of <hi>love to Virtue;</hi> which Love however when at its height, and when forcibly felt, is the chiefeſt thing that can make the happineſs of Virtue to be well credited: for it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible <hi>conſtantly and firmly</hi> to retain this opinion of the great Happineſs ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Virtue it ſelf, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving high thoughts and eſtimation of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59040:38"/>
                     <hi>the Pleaſure and Delight</hi> reſulting from the very love of Virtue; from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of what is worthy in it ſelf, as well as from the mere conveniences of a virtuous Life: which ſort of <hi>Pleaſure and Delight</hi> is likely to gain but little opinion or credit where it is not highly experienc'd. The chief ground and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, therefore, of this Opinion, of <hi>the conſtant Happineſs of Virtue,</hi> muſt be from the powerful feeling of this Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the knowledg of its Power and Strength. But this is certain, that there muſt be but little encouragement or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of any ſuch Affection as this, or <hi>of liking and affecting any thing as in it ſelf good and beautiful,</hi> where there is neither <hi>goodneſs</hi> nor <hi>beauty</hi> allowed in the WHOLE it ſelf; nor any perfect or wiſe direction for the good of any thing, nor any good Affection of a ſupreme Mind or Will towards the good of <hi>all</hi> in general, nor any conſciouſneſs in ſuch an all-knowing and perfect Mind, of the Virtue and good Affection of particulars. This muſt tend rather to the cutting off of all love, veneration or eſteem of any thing decent, juſt or orderly in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, to the weaning of the Affections from any thing amiable or ſelf-worthy, and to the ſuppreſſing even of that very Habit and Cuſtom of contemplating
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59040:38"/>
with ſatisfaction and delight the beauties that are in Nature, and whatever in the order of things is according to a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and proportion the moſt reſulting to ſenſe. For how little diſpos'd muſt ſuch a Perſon be, either to love or admire any thing as <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>comly</hi> in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, who thinks that the Univerſe it ſelf is nothing but <hi>diſorder?</hi> how unapt to reverence or reſpect any particular or ſubordinat Beauty (ſuch as is part of the ſtructure) when the WHOLE it ſelf is thought to want perfection, and to be only a vaſt and infinit defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity?</p>
                  <p>AND when we conſider further concerning ſuch an opinion of the WHOLE as this is, and the thoughts of living in ſuch a diſtracted Univerſe, from which ſo many ills may be ſuſpected, and in which there is nothing good, nothing lovely to be contemplated, or that can raiſe any affection towards it other than that of Hatred and Averſion; it will ſeem hardly poſſible for us to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of ſuch an Opinion as this, than that it muſt by degrees imbitter the Temper, and not only make the love of Virtue to be leſs felt, but help to impair and ruin natural Affection and Kindneſs. So that as there is nothing ſo exalting to Virtue, or ſo hightning to the pleaſure deriv'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59040:39"/>
from it, as a pure and perfect <hi>Theiſm;</hi> ſo on the other ſide a perfect <hi>Atheiſm</hi> is that which muſt tend exceedingly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all ground of delight in Virtue, and even that very Principle it ſelf of all Virtue, <hi>viz.</hi> natural and good Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>BUT now on the other ſide; neither is it impli'd that every one whoſoever that believes a God, believes to this effect, and with this advantage to Virtue; or that whoever believes both a God, and Rewards and Puniſhments diſpens'd either in this preſent, or in ſome future State, believes to this effect. For if he believes that theſe Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are tied to, or follow ſomething elſe than good or ill Affections (as they do, who believe Rewards for ſimple actions or performances irrational, and without account; or who believe ſuch Rewards and Puniſhments as are tied to things caſual and accidental, as the being born in ſuch a place, or of ſuch Parents) then may the Affections grow ill and vitious without hindrance, or rather with help, as has bin ſhewn; becauſe of the ſuppos'd want of Rectitude in the ador'd ſovereign Being.</p>
                  <p>WHOEVER therefore has a firm belief of a God whom he dos not merely <hi>call</hi> Good, but of whom in reality he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59040:39"/>
nothing but what is good, and is really ſutable to the exacteſt character of Juſtice; ſuch a Perſon believing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments in another Life, muſt believe them Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Virtue and Vice merely, and not of any other Qualities or Accidents, which make them either Rewards for ill, or for nothing; and therefore not properly <hi>Rewards,</hi> but <hi>capricious diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Happineſs or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> And ſuch a Perſon as this has the advantage ſpoken of, and can grow to be, or can keep himſelf virtuous where an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> cannot; in caſe there be a failure, as abovemention'd, in the thoughts or opinion as to the happineſs of Virtue in it ſelf, and that it come to be believ'd the contrary way, <hi>that Virtue is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Happineſs, with reſpect to this Life merely:</hi> which that it is ſo <hi>in the main,</hi> is an opinion that only an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect <hi>Theiſt</hi> can have. For whatever be decided as to that of any Life after the preſent one, and of Rewards and Puniſhments to come, he who is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Theiſt,</hi> and who believes an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal univerſal Mind, reigning ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and through all things, and with the higheſt perfection of Goodneſs, as well as Wiſdom and Power, cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Virtue is made the good or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59040:40"/>
advantage of every Creature capable of having Virtue. For what could be more an unjuſt Ordinance and Rule, or be imagin'd more a defective Univerſe and ill conſtitution of things, than if Virtue were naturally made the ill, and Vice the good of every Creature?</p>
                  <p>THUS therefore there is an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to Virtue neceſſarily ſuppos'd in perfect <hi>Theiſm,</hi> which is not in the Atheiſtical Belief: on the contrary it is, tho not wholly impoſſible, yet very rare and difficult, that through all the ill Chances to which a virtuous man may be expos'd, the certain remembrance and belief <hi>that Virtue is the beſt or only means of Happineſs,</hi> or <hi>the conſciouſneſs of his not being able to recede from it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling into greater Miſery, and a more deplorable State,</hi> ſhould be able to keep it ſelf a firm principle in his Mind, if he be one who has no opinion at all of any wiſdom or order in the Government of the Univerſe; no example above himſelf of any Goodneſs or good Affection, and whoſe natural reflections on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject cannot well be other than melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and diſguſtful. Now, if there be wanting in a Mind that which can more kindly diſpoſe the Temper, and is able to raiſe the Affection to a greater admiration and love of Virtue; then is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59040:40"/>
there much wanting of what ſhould make the happineſs of Virtue credited; ſince nothing is more aſſiſtant to this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief than the full experience of thoſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and kinder Affections, and of that ſatisfaction enjoy'd in the love of Virtue it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>AND now in the laſt place, there is yet greater advantage to Virtue, in that opinion of perfect and compleat <hi>Theiſm,</hi> which we will endeavor to explain; tho the matter it ſelf be of that kind which is nicely Philoſophical, and may be thought, perhaps, to be ſo overmuch. There is no Creature, according to what has bin prov'd above, but muſt be ill in ſome degree, by having any Affection towards, or againſt any thing in a ſtronger degree than ſuch as is ſutable to his own privat good, and that of the Syſtem he is join'd to: for, in this caſe the Affection is an ill Affection. Now if a rational Creature has that degree of averſion which is requiſit againſt any particular ill (as ſuppoſe that <hi>Ill</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome, baniſh'd, or ruin'd in Fortune) this is regular and well. But if after the ill happen'd, his paſſion of averſion proves ſuch, that he ſtill rages at the accident, and is in continual ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence towards his fortune or lot; then will this be acknowledg'd vitious in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59040:41"/>
it ſelf, and further prejudicial to Temper, and to all Virtue: as on the other ſide, the patient endurance of the Calamity, and the ſupport of the Mind under it, muſt be acknowledg'd virtuous and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative</hi> of Virtue. Now altho that which Atoms and Chance produce (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing no other Principle beſides) need not give occaſion to that exceſs of abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, violent Rage and Anger, which is what a tolerably rational man may allay by conſidering, that what is done is neither meant nor deſign'd, but is from Atoms and Chance only; yet if there be nothing at the bottom, nor any Rule or Reaſon beſides Chance and Atoms, there can be no ſatisfaction at all in thinking upon what <hi>they alone</hi> produce: for if the thing ſeems ill, and be ill felt, it cannot be admitted in that Hypotheſis, (or in the Atheiſtical one whatever it be) that this Ill is a real good elſewhere, and <hi>with reſpect to the whole of things,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the wiſeſt and beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that is conceivable. Now that which is thought ill, and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable and without reaſon, cannot but raiſe ſome degree of Averſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. But in another Hypotheſis (that of perfect Theiſm) the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of this, <hi>that whatever happens is good,</hi> muſt neceſſarily (as has bin prov'd)
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59040:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be the Belief. Therefore in the courſe of things in this world, whatſoever Ill occurring would ſeem to force from a rational Creature a cenſure and diſlike, or whatſoever may happen to be his privat Lot; he may not only acquieſce in it, and have patience, which is but an abatement of the natural anger and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, but he may make the Lot or <hi>Part</hi> aſſign'd to him, an object of his good Affection in ſome ſort, as having a good and kind Affection in general to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all that is produc'd in the Univerſe, as coming from the moſt perfect Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and being perfectly Good: which Affection, ſince it muſt in a much greater degree cauſe a good ſupport of whatever is endured for Virtue, or in any ſtate of ſufferance; and ſince it muſt cauſe a greater acquieſcence and complacency with reſpect to ill accidents, ill men and injuries (and conſequently a greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, meekneſs and benignity in the Temper); ſo it muſt of neceſſity be a good Affection, and the Creature that has it, ſo much the more a virtuous and good Creature: for whatſoever is the occaſion or means of more affectionatly joining or uniting a rational Creature to his PART in Society, and cauſes him to proſecute the public good or good of the Syſtem he is join'd to, beyond what he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59040:42"/>
would otherwiſe do, is undoubtedly the occaſion or cauſe of greater Virtue in him. Now if the ſubject of ſuch an Affection be not juſt or deſerving, if no ſuch Hypotheſis is to be admitted as that of perfect <hi>Theiſm</hi> (ſo that there is <hi>real Ill</hi> continually produc'd in the courſe of things in the Univerſe, and no good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and powerful Principle able to exclude ſuch ILL) yet notwithſtanding this, the Affection towards this <hi>falſe</hi> ſubject (if it be to be ſuppos'd <hi>falſe</hi>) muſt be ſo far good, as that the having of it will be the occaſion of greater ſtrengthning and forwarding of Virtue, as has bin ſhewn. But if the ſubject be <hi>juſt;</hi> that is to ſay, if every thing which the Univerſe produces be according to all reaſon the wiſeſt and beſt of what could be imagin'd, and be therefore the moſt worthy of admiration, applauſe, and all good Affection of rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as coming from a moſt perfect, wiſe and good Principle; then dos ſuch an Affection become due and requiſit in every rational Creature, ſo as that it muſt be vitious to want it. On which it may be grounded, <hi>that the relation which Virtue has to Piety is ſuch, as that the</hi> FIRST <hi>is not compleat but in the</hi> LAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER: and that where this latter is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there cannot be the ſame benignity,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59040:42"/>
perſeverance, the ſame good compoſure of the Affections, nor ſo good a Mind.</p>
                  <p>TO conclude then: Having conſider'd how any Opinion about the Exiſtence of a God can have influence on the Manners of men, and cauſe either Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or Vice; if the reaſons we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered be found to be of any weight, it will appear in reſolution of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which has bin treated of: That one who has not the Opinion or Belief of an intelligent Principle or God, may, tho very difficultly, and at a great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, be capable of Virtue, ſo as to have an Honeſty, a Faith, a Juſtice perhaps of great note and worth; may have many generous and good Paſſions, and <hi>poſſibly</hi> that of <hi>love to Virtue</hi> for its own ſake, as well as for being believ'd advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but <hi>that</hi> in the other Belief, there are not only greater ſecurities and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to Virtue, but there is beſides <hi>a degree of Virtue</hi> which the Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it cannot admit. So that the chiefeſt ſecurity, the perfection and the higheſt degree of Virtue, muſt be owing to the belief of a God.</p>

                  <p>WE have already conſider'd WHAT VIRTUE IS, who may be allow'd in any degree virtuous. It remains now to ſhew, WHAT OBLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GATION THERE IS TO VIRTUE, and how any one may have reaſon to imbrace Virtue, and ſhun Vice.</p>
                  <p>WE have ſeen that to be virtuous and good, is for a rational Creature in the uſe of good Underſtanding and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have all his natural Affections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or better Paſſions, his diſpoſitions of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59040:44"/>
Mind and Temper ſutable and agreeing with the good of his Kind, or of that Syſtem (as explain'd before) where he is included, and of which he is a PART. So that to have all theſe Affections <hi>right</hi> and <hi>intire,</hi> by which we are kindly and naturally join'd to our PART in Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; this is nam'd <hi>Rectitude, Integrity:</hi> and to want any of theſe, or to have their contraries, ſuch as alienate from hence, is <hi>Depravity, Corruption, Nature vitiated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT in the Paſſions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of particular Creatures there is a relation to the intereſt of a Species or <hi>common Nature</hi> (as that there is an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards the propagation of the kind, towards the nurture of the young, towards mutual Support and Succor) this is not deniable, neither will it be denied; therefore, that ſuch an Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this of a Creature towards the good of that common Nature, is as proper an Affection, and as natural to him, as to any member of a Body to work in its own way, as to a Stomach to digeſt, as to other Intrails to perform their other offices, or as to any other Part in an animal Body to be ſo affected, and to operate ſo as is appointed to it in its Syſtem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:59040:44"/>IT is certain alſo, that a Creature having ſuch Affections as theſe towards the <hi>common Nature,</hi> or Syſtem of the Kind, at the ſame time that he has thoſe other Affections toward the privat Nature or Self-ſyſtem, (as in the caſe of ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, ſelf-ſupport and maintenance) it muſt happen that in following the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe Affections, the Creature muſt often contradict and go againſt <hi>theſe latter;</hi> as in the inſtance ſo often before us'd, where the love to the young makes every other Affection towards privat good give way, and cauſes a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal neglect of ſelf-intereſt or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT may ſeem therefore in this place, that there is a perfect oppoſition between theſe two; as if the purſuing or being carried towards the <hi>common Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Good,</hi> by ſuch Affections as are ſuted to that common Intereſt, were a hinderance to the attainment of <hi>privat Good,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hinderance and check to thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which aim thither. And it being found that <hi>hazards</hi> and <hi>hardſhips</hi> make but ill for the animal State, in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat Syſtem; theſe other Affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another Good (that of the Kind, or public Syſtem) being ſuch as do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten expoſe to <hi>hardſhips</hi> and <hi>hazards,</hi> by overruling their oppoſites, the ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59040:45"/>
paſſions, and by neceſſitating the Creature thus to ſelf-denial, and, as it were, ſelf-deſertion; it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, perhaps, from hence, that it is beſt for the Animal to be without any ſuch Affections at all. So that that Love which joins us to others of the ſame Kind; that reconciling Affection towards a Species or fellowſhip of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with whom we are bred, and live; that ſocial Kindneſs, or whatever elſe, be it what Affection ſoever that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that other Principle, takes the place of the ſelf-intereſting Paſſions, and draws us as it were out of our ſelves, ſo as to make us diſregardful of our own convenience and ſafety; whatever is of this kind ſhould be aboliſh'd; love to the young, tenderneſs and pity aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; in ſhort, all natural Affections ſhould thus be extinguiſh'd and rooted out, as dangerous, tormenting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive.</p>
                  <p>ACCORDING to this it would ſeem to follow, that in the conſtitution of that Order or Syſtem of a Kind or Species, the PART is ill affected, and in an ill ſtate <hi>as to it ſelf,</hi> which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and well affected towards the WHOLE: and the only natural and good ſtate of the privat nature or ſingle PART, as to it ſelf, is to be in an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59040:45"/>
and ill ſtate towards the common Nature or WHOLE. A ſtrange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution indeed! in which it muſt be confeſs'd that there is much diſorder and untowardneſs; but which in Nature is no where obſerv'd beſides: that in a Syſtem, as in a Tree or animal Body, any Part or Member ſhould be in a good and proſperous ſtate <hi>as to it ſelf,</hi> which was under a contrary Affection, and in an unnatural operation <hi>as to its Whole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT this is otherwiſe, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to demonſtrate, ſo as to make it appear, that what ſeems thus to be an ill Order and Conſtitution in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, (and which, if true, would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily make natural rectitude <hi>the Ill,</hi> and depravity <hi>the Good</hi> of every Creature) is in reality according to a wiſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Order in the Univerſe; inſomuch that for every particular in its Syſtem, to work <hi>to the good of that Syſtem or Public,</hi> and <hi>to its own good,</hi> is all one, and not to be divided. By which means natural Rectitude or Virtue muſt be the advantage, and Vice the injury and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of every Creature.</p>
                  <p>IT has bin ſhewn before, that no Animal can, <hi>as an Animal,</hi> be ſaid to act in any manner but through Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Paſſions, ſuch as are proper to an Animal: for in convulſive fits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59040:46"/>
a Creature ſtrikes either himſelf or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is a ſimple Mechaniſm, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, or piece of Clock-work that acts, and not the Animal.</p>
                  <p>WHATSOEVER therefore is done or acted by any Animal <hi>as ſuch,</hi> is done and can be done only through ſome Affection or Paſſion, as of Fear, Love or Hatred, moving him.</p>
                  <p>AND as it is impoſſible that the weakeſt Affections ſhould overcome the ſtrongeſt (as that a leſſer love ſhould overcome a greater love, a leſſer fear a greater fear) ſo it is impoſſible but that where the Affections or Paſſions are ſtrongeſt, or where they make the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſide, either by their number or force, thither the Animal muſt incline, and by that be govern'd and led to action.</p>
                  <p>THE Affections or Paſſions which muſt influence and govern the Animal are either,</p>
                  <p>1. THE natural ones towards the Kind, or which carry to the good of ſomething beyond the privat Syſtem.</p>
                  <p>2. OR the ſelf-ones, which carry to the good of the privat Syſtem, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſelf-preſervation, ſelf-nouriſhment or ſupport, ſelf-defence, or repelling of Injury.</p>
                  <p>3. OR ſuch as are neither of theſe, and neither tend to any good of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59040:46"/>
or privat Syſtem. And it is through theſe ſeveral Affections or Motions that a Creature muſt be Good or Ill, Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Vitious. But, before we come to ſpeak of theſe ſeparatly, it may be convenient to premiſe ſome few things in general, in order to clear ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which may create a doubt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance.</p>
                  <p>WHEN in a rational Creature, any thing is done with real and full intention towards public Good, and with that juſt and excellent <hi>natural Affection</hi> which leads towards the good of Society; if there be any failure in the Judgment, which notwithſtanding guides and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects amiſs; how far this may be viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, has bin before mention'd, ſo as not to need any thing farther in this place, nor is this worth inſiſting on: it having little to do with the eſſential part of Vice, and that which is with moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon complain'd of in the world, as cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating thoſe diſorders we ſee. For where there is in a rational Creature an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrong affection towards Virtue, ſuperior to all other Affections, preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent over all Obſtructions, and freed from the ill influence of any unnatural Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch as thoſe raiſed from Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and horrid Cuſtom before ſpoken of; there is little fear of failure through
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59040:47"/>
wrong choice or preference in moral acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or through want of a right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Duty when rightly and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought: but if notwithſtanding ſuch a ſearch, it be however miſs'd in any ſmall degree, the misfortune or ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury is, as the Vice it ſelf, very ſlight and of little moment.</p>
                  <p>THE natural Affections ſeparatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, as either Pity or Compaſſion, love to the young, and ſuch like, however excellent they are, they may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be in a too great, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>vitious</hi> degree: as when Pity is ſo overcoming as to deſtroy its own end, and prevent the ſuccor and relief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd; or as when love to the young is ſuch a fondneſs as diſables from right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking care of the young, or ſuch as deſtroys the Parent, and conſequently the young too. And tho it ſeems harſh to call that <hi>vitious</hi> which is but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of ſome natural and kind Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet the thing being rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, it is apparent, that wherever any ſingle Affection of that kind is over great, it muſt be worſt for the reſt, and take off from their operation: for a Creature poſſeſt with ſuch an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat and exceſſive Paſſion, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity allow too much to that Paſſion, and too little to others of the ſame note or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59040:47"/>
character, and equally natural and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent as to their end; ſo as that this muſt be the occaſion of partiality and injuſtice, whilſt only <hi>one</hi> duty or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral PART is earneſtly follow'd, and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> duties neglected, which ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company, or perhaps take place and be prefer'd.</p>
                  <p>NOW as <hi>natural Affection</hi> of this ſort <hi>may be too high,</hi> ſo may the <hi>Affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the privat Syſtem, or</hi> SELF, <hi>be too weak.</hi> For if a Creature were ſelf-neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſenſible to danger, or wanted ſuch a degree of Paſſion in any kind, as was neceſſary to preſerve, ſuſtain, or defend it ſelf, this would be a vice or imperfection in the natural temper, with reſpect to the privat Syſtem, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Nature in the animal Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in the ſame manner as it would be a vice or imperfection in that ſingle part <hi>an Eye</hi> not to ſhut of its own accord and unknowingly to us, by a natural cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and timidity; which, were it, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however we might deſign the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our Eye, we ſhould not preſerve it by any obſervation or ſteady intention of our own ever ſo good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the preſerving it. And thus tho the Paſſions of this kind do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly regard, nor have for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the good of the Kind, but a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59040:48"/>
and altho no Creature be (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) called good and virtuous for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of theſe: yet ſince it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the public Good, or Good of the Syſtem, can be preſerved without <hi>theſe;</hi> or that it ſhould be well with the Particulars, if theſe were wanting, which are for the good of the PARTS, and of the <hi>Whole</hi> together; it follows that a Creature wanting any of theſe, and being wanting to it ſelf and to the Whole, is in reality wanting in ſome degree to Goodneſs and natural Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and may thus be ſaid to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective or vicious, tho this be not what is commonly call'd ſo.</p>
                  <p>'TIS thus that we ſay of a Creature that he is <hi>too good;</hi> when he either has his affection of any ſort towards the Kind ſo violent, as to carry him even beyond his <hi>Part;</hi> or that it happens that he is really carried beyond his <hi>Part,</hi> not by a too highly kindled paſſion of that ſort, but through want of ſome ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to reſtrain him in ſome bounds.</p>
                  <p>IT may be objected here, That this of having the natural Affections too ſtrong, (where the ſelf ones are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much ſo) or of having the ſelf ones thus defective or weak (where the natural ones are weak) may often prove upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59040:48"/>
the only reaſon of a Creature's act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honeſtly and well. For, thus poſſibly, a Creature inſenſible to ſome ſelf-intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſion (as ſuppoſe he were altogether indifferent to life) may even with the ſmalleſt degree of ſome one natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, do what the higheſt Affection of that kind ſhould or can perform: and thus a Creature exceſſively timorous may by as exceeding a degree of ſome one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affection, do that which requires the perfecteſt Courage to perform.</p>
                  <p>TO this I anſwer; That when we ſay of any Paſſion that it is <hi>too ſtrong,</hi> or that it is <hi>too weak,</hi> we muſt ſpeak with reſpect to a certain Conſtitution or Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of a particular Creature, or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Creatures. For if a Paſſion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to any right end, be only ſo much the more ſerviceable and effectual, for being ſtrong; if the violence of it be no way the cauſe of any diſturbance or diſtraction within, or of any diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionableneſs between it ſelf and other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; then conſequently the Paſſion, however ſtrong and forcible, cannot be blam'd as vitious. But if to have <hi>all</hi> the Paſſions in equal proportion with it, be what the conſtitution of the Creature cannot bear or ſupport; ſo that <hi>one or more</hi> Paſſions are perhaps rais'd to this height, but that the <hi>others</hi> are not, nor
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59040:49"/>
can be in the ſame proportion; then is it to be ſaid of thoſe more than ordinary forcible Paſſions, <hi>that they are exceſſive:</hi> for, notwithſtanding that they may be ſuch as the Creature can well bear, that they agree with his frame and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that they are no ways an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to their own end; yet theſe Paſſions being in unequal proportion to the others, and cauſing an ill <hi>balance</hi> in the Affection, muſt be the occaſion of inequality in the Conduct, and muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to a wrong moral practice.</p>
                  <p>BUT to explain a little further this of <hi>the Oeconomy of the Paſſions,</hi> by what we may obſerve in other Species or Kinds. As to thoſe Creatures that have no manner of power or means given them by nature for their defence againſt Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor any thing by which they can make themſelves terrible to ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure or offend them; it is neceſſary that they ſhould have very great and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Fear, but little or no Animoſity or Paſſion, ſuch as ſhould cauſe them to make reſiſtance, or ſhould delay their flight, which is their only ſaſety, and to which the paſſion of Fear is uſeful and of help. It is thus that Timorouſneſs, and an habitual and ſtrong paſſion of Fear may be <hi>according to the Oeconomy</hi> of a particular Creature, both with reſpect
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59040:49"/>
to himſelf and his Species: and that on the other ſide, Courage may be vitious. Even in one and the ſame Species this is by Nature differently order'd, with reſpect to different Sexes, Ages, Growths. At a time when the whole Herd flies, the <hi>Bull</hi> alone makes head againſt the Lion, or whatever other invading Beaſt, and ſhews himſelf conſcious of his part; for ſo nature has made him to be: and ſhould he loſe this generous Paſſion and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, he would be degenerate. Even the Female of this Kind is, we ſee, arm'd by nature in ſome degree to reſiſt Violence, ſo as not to fly a common danger. As for a Hind, a Doe, or any other inoffending and defenceleſs Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it is no way unnatural or vitious in ſuch a one to deſert the young and fly for ſafety: for to do otherwiſe would be <hi>contrary to the Oeconomy</hi> of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Species. But for thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are able to make reſiſtance, and are by nature arm'd (as thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of the Wood) with that which can mortally offend; it is natural in one of theſe to be rouz'd with fury, and to oppoſe it ſelf to death againſt its Enemy or Invader; by which known paſſion in the Creature its Species is ſecur'd: ſince ſuch a one can hardly on this account be aſſaulted, or injur'd with impunity, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59040:50"/>
that a Creature, ſuch as this, ſells his own and offspring's Life at ſo dear a rate. To do leſs therefore than this, is in ſuch a one unnatural and degenerate, and is a betraying of his Species. And of all other Creatures <hi>Man</hi> is in this ſenſe the moſt terrible: ſince if he thinks it juſt and exemplary, he may in his own, or in his Countrys cauſe, revenge an injury on any one living; and by throwing away his own life (if reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute to that degree) is almoſt certain Maſter of another's, tho ever ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded: of which ſeveral examples given, have ſerved to deter thoſe in power, and reſtrain them from uſing the utmoſt outrages, and urging men to extremity.</p>
                  <p>BUT to come to what was ſaid: No Paſſion therefore, which carries to a right end, and which is ſuch as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his conſtitution can bear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deſorder or ſufferance of his Body or Mind, and which is no other than proportionable with reſpect to other Paſſions, ſuch as are ſuted likewiſe to the Oeconomy of the Creature, and of the Species in which he is included; no Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuch as <hi>this</hi> can be too ſtrong or too forcible a Paſſion. But whatever Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (tho of the ſort of thoſe we call the natural Affections, or Affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59040:50"/>
the kind) is overſtrong in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to any other Affection, this is immoderate Paſſion, and in too high a degree. And in anſwer therefore to the Objection made: tho it be true that this of having a ſelf-paſſion too weak, or a natural affection too ſtrong, may occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Virtue in <hi>one</hi> place, and cauſe <hi>one</hi> virtuous action; yet, with reſpect to the <hi>whole of Life,</hi> it is what muſt create confuſion and diſorder, and muſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion too (as has bin ſhewn before) <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and injuſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT, to expreſs this all at once, under an eaſy and very familiar Compariſon. It is the ſame with the Paſſions in an animal Conſtitution, as with the Cords or Strings of a muſical Inſtrument. If theſe, tho in ever ſo juſt proportion one to another, are ſtrained however beyond a certain degree, it is more than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument will bear; and by this the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is abuſed, and its effect loſt: On the other ſide, if while ſome of the Cords are duly ſtrained, others are not wound up to their due proportion; then is the Inſtrument ſtill in diſorder, and its part ill performed. The ſeveral Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Creatures are as different ſorts of Inſtruments: And even in the ſame Species of Creatures (as in the ſame ſort of Inſtrument) <hi>one</hi> is not intirely
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59040:51"/>
like the <hi>other;</hi> nor will the ſame Cords fit each: the ſame degree of ſtrength which winds up the Cords of <hi>one,</hi> and fits them to a Harmony and Conſort, may in <hi>another</hi> burſt both the Cords and Inſtrument it ſelf. Thus men who have the livelieſt and exquiſiteſt ſenſe, and who are in the higheſt degree af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Pleaſure or Pain, have need of the ſtrongeſt ground and foundation of other Paſſion, as that of natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſenſibleneſs to Friendſhip, Love, Pity, and the like, in order to keep a <hi>right Balance</hi> within, and to preſerve them in their duty, and the performance of their part; whilſt others, who are more flegmatic, heavier, and of a lower Key, need not, nor are made for the feeling thoſe other Paſſions in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo high a degree.</p>
                  <p>IT would be agreeable enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thus into the different <hi>tunings</hi> (if one may ſpeak ſo) the different ſtructures and proportions of different men, with reſpect to their paſſions, and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mixtures, temperatures and allays, which make that which we call <hi>Temper,</hi> according to which the goodneſs and worth of any Creature is eſteemed. But here we ſhould have too large a Field: Tho however we may, in paſſing by, obſerve, that whilſt we ſee in all
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59040:51"/>
other Creatures around us ſo great a proportionableneſs, conſtancy and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in all their paſſions and affections; ſo great a harmony, and ſuch an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Nature; no failure in the care of the Offſpring, or of the Society (if living in Society); no proſtitution of themſelves, nor no exceſs in any kind; whilſt we ſee thoſe Creatures who live as it were in Cities (as Bees and Ants) never to go out of that conſtant Train and Harmony, nor contradict thoſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which carry them on to operate to the public Good, the Good <hi>of their</hi> WHOLE; and that even thoſe Beaſts that live the fartheſt out of Society of that ſort, maintain however a conduct one towards another, ſuch as is exactly well fitted for the good of their own Species; Man in the mean time, vicious and unconſonant man, lives out of all rule and proportion, contradicts his Principles, breaks the Order and Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of all his Paſſions, and lives at odds with his whole Species, and with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo that it is next to a Prodigy to ſee a Man in the world who lives NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURALLY, and as A MAN.</p>
                  <p>THUS having clear'd this Part, and having explain'd what is meant by having any paſſion <hi>in too high</hi> or <hi>too low a degree;</hi> and how that to have any
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59040:52"/>
natural Affection too high, or any ſelf Affection too low, is (tho not ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) a Vice and moral Imperfection, and is prejudicial both to the privat and public Syſtem; we come now to that which is the chiefeſt and moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of Vice, that which alone is call'd Vice and Illneſs.</p>
                  <p>THE ſeveral ſenſes in which a Creature may be ſaid to be ill or viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are, firſt, <hi>when the Affections are all orderly and right; but that through want of judgment, any error is committed in the choice of moral Objects.</hi> Of this there is no need to ſpeak more than we have done. All other Vice or Illneſs beſides, muſt be through the immediat diſorder of the Affections themſelves; as when <hi>the natural Affections are too ſtrong,</hi> or <hi>the ſelf Affections too weak:</hi> Tho nothing of this hitherto be what we ordinarily call <hi>Illneſs</hi> or <hi>Vice.</hi> That which remains of any way or ſenſe, in which a Creature may be ill, or can poſſibly act ill, is either <hi>through the want of natural and good Affections, and the having no ſuch thing at all to move him, or that is ſufficient to move him;</hi> or, <hi>through contrary Paſſions or Affections moving him to what is wrong,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming thoſe others, whenſoever there are any of thoſe to make oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:59040:52"/>THAT is to ſay, <hi>either</hi> by having the natural Affections weak or deficient: <hi>or</hi> by having the ſelf Paſſions too ſtrong: <hi>or</hi> by having ſuch as are neither natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, nor ſelf ones; and of which the ſmalleſt and moderateſt degree is not tending to the ſupport or welfare of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Species or privat Syſtem.</p>
                  <p>OTHER WISE than <hi>thus</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible any Creature can be ill or vitious. And if it may be proved that it is the intereſt of the Creature to have his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Affections never <hi>thus,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe; it will then be proved, that it is the intereſt of a Creature to <hi>be,</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> in that ſtate in which he cannot but be good or virtuous: ſo that Virtue, then, can never be but his Good, and the contrary his Ill.</p>
                  <p>OUR buſineſs therefore will be to prove,</p>
                  <p>1. THAT to have thoſe excellent Affections (the kind and natural ones, ſuch as have bin mentioned) is to have the chief enjoyment of Life; and that to want them, is, and muſt be, beſides the loſs of that Good, the occaſion of farther and greater Ill.</p>
                  <p>2. THAT to have the ſelf Paſſions exceſſive or beyond ſuch a degree in which they cannot but of neceſſity yield, as is fitting, to the natural ones,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59040:53"/>
whenever they meet or are oppoſed to each other, is alſo injurious to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is of ſelf-ill.</p>
                  <p>3. AND that to have the other ſort of Paſſions, thoſe which are neither na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affections towards the kind, nor ſelf ones, of which the leaſt degree is eſſential or requiſit in the Conſtitution or Oeconomy of the Creature, is preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Creature.</p>

                  <p>THERE are few, who when they think of ſuch a Creature as is void of all natural Affection, all ſocial Inclination, Friendlineſs, Complacency or Love, but think of it as in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion miſerable enough as to it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to the ill terms upon which ſuch a Creature muſt live with thoſe that are his fellow Creatures: 'Tis generally thought, I believe, that ſuch a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as this feels but a little part of the ſatisfaction of Life, and reliſhes but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thoſe few Enjoyments which are left with him, <hi>thoſe</hi> of eating, drinking, and the like; when <hi>thoſe others</hi> of ſociable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, kindneſs and love, are ſubſtracted. It is well known, that to ſuch a Creature as this, it is not only <hi>incident,</hi> to be moroſe,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59040:53"/>
rancorous and malignant; but that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity a Mind or Temper thus deſtitue of all mildneſs and benignity, of all kind and indulgent inclination, ſenſe or feeling, muſt turn to that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, muſt be agitated and wrought by Paſſions of a different kind, and be a continual ſeat and lodgment of thoſe bitter, hateful and perverſe ones, made from a conſtant ill humor, frowardneſs, and diſquiet, in an uncalm, unaffable, and unloving Temper; and that the conſciouſneſs of ſuch a Mind or Nature, thus diſſociable, obnoxious, and averſe to all humanity, hating and hated of Mankind, muſt overcloud the Mind with dark ſuſpicion and continual jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, alarm it with fears and horror, and raiſe in it a continual diſturbance and diſeaſe, in the moſt appearing fair and ſecure ſtate of Fortune, and in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt outward Proſperity.</p>
                  <p>THIS, as to the <hi>perfect</hi> immoral or inhuman ſtate, is generally notic'd: and where there is this abſolute degeneracy, and a <hi>total</hi> deprivation of all humanity, love, or natural affection, there are few who do not ſee and acknowledge the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of ſuch a State, when <hi>at worſt</hi> as here ſuppos'd. The misfortune is, that this eſcapes us, and is not perceiv'd in leſs <hi>degrees:</hi> as if to be fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59040:54"/>
horrid, unſociable and inhuman, were indeed the greateſt misfortune and miſery that could be; but that to be it in <hi>a little degree</hi> ſhould be no miſery nor harm at all: which is as reaſonable as it would be, to allow that it is the greateſt ill of a Body to be in the utmoſt manner diſtorted, maim'd, and in an abſolute diſuſe or perverſion of all its Organs; but that to loſe the uſe of <hi>one</hi> Limb, or to be impair'd in ſome <hi>one ſingle</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is no inconvenience or ill at all.</p>
                  <p>THE parts and proportions of the Mind, their relation to, and dependency on one another, the connexion and frame of thoſe Paſſions which conſtitute the Soul or Temper; in ſhort, the whole Order or Symmetry of this inward Part being no leſs real and exact than that of the Body, yet by not being obvious to ſenſe as that other is, it comes not into conſideration. So that tho the greateſt miſery and ill is allow'd to be from the Mind or Temper, which it is own'd may ſuffer by abuſe and injury, as the Body dos; yet it is not known by what means <hi>this former</hi> ſuffers, how it receives abuſe or injury, or at what rate and in what degrees it comes to be impair'd; it is not known nor though of, what it is that ſhould maim or offend any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part; or how it ſhould happen to a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59040:54"/>
Temper or Mind, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being wounded or hurt in any one particular part, the whole ſhould be the worſe for it. On the contrary, we think that a man may violate his Faith, commit any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unfamiliar to him before, engage in any Vice or Villany by which a breach is made on good Affection, to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance and promotion of what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe malignant, horrid and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and all this without the leaſt prejudice to himſelf, or any miſery fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing from the ill action <hi>merely.</hi> 'Tis thus that it is often ſaid, <hi>ſuch a one has done ill;</hi> but <hi>what is he the worſe for it?</hi> And yet we ſay of any nature ſavage, curſt, and throughly inveterate, <hi>that ſuch a one is a plague and torment to himſelf.</hi> And we allow that by certain Paſſions, and merely by Temper alone, a man may be fully miſerable, let his circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as to other reſpects, be what they will.</p>
                  <p>NOW did it appear that this fabric of the Mind were ſuch, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to remove from thence, or out of the natural Temper, any one good or orderly Affection, or introduce any ill or diſorderly one, without danger of ruin and fatal deſtruction, without drawing on in ſome degree that horrid and deteſtable ſtate, and making <hi>in part</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59040:55"/>
that havock and confuſion, which <hi>at its height,</hi> or but in ſome particular occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is obſerv'd and juſtly confeſs'd to be ſo miſerable; were this made appear from the oeconomy of the Mind, or of thoſe Paſſions which conſtitute the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temper or Soul, it would then be confeſs'd, that ſince no ill, immoral, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, or unjuſt action could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without a violence committed here, without either a new inroad and breach on the Temper and Paſſions, or a farther advancing of that execution al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun; whoever did ill, or acted in prejudice of his Virtue, Integrity, good Nature, or Worth, acted in the ſame manner towards himſelf, but with leſs mercy, than he who with his own hands ſhould wound or any way deſtroy or ruin his own Body.</p>
                  <p>I. BUT to begin now in the firſt place with this proof, THAT TO HAVE THE NATURAL AFFECTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS (ſuch as are founded in Love, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, Goodwill, and in a ſympathy with the Kind or Species) IS TO HAVE THE CHIEF ENJOYMENT OF LIFE; <hi>and</hi> THAT TO WANT THE SAME AFFECTIONS IS TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERABLE. We may conſider, firſt,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59040:55"/>
what thoſe are which we call <hi>Pleaſures</hi> or <hi>Satisfactions,</hi> from whence Happineſs is reckon'd and eſteem'd. They are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions or pleaſures (according to the common diſtinction) either <hi>of the Body,</hi> or <hi>of the Mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT <hi>the pleaſures of the Mind are greater than thoſe of the Body,</hi> is allow'd by moſt people, and may be prov'd by this; that whenſoever the Mind having a high opinion or feeling of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence (be it in what ſubject it will, either where worth or excellence is, or is not) has receiv'd the ſtrongeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and is wrought up to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch or degree of Paſſion towards the Subject; at ſuch time it ſets it ſelf above all bodily pain, contemns Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Racks: for thus we ſee Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Barbarians, Malefactors, and the very horridſt and moſt execrable Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains in the world, oftimes, for the ſake of a particular Gang or Society, or out of ſome cheriſh'd notion or principle of Honor, of Revenge, of Gratitude, or ſomething of that kind with which they are taken, embrace any manner of Hardſhip, and defy Torments and Death. Whereas on the other hand, a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plac'd in all circumſtances of outward enjoyments, ſurrounded with every thing that can allure or charm the Senſe, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59040:56"/>
being then actually in the very moment of ſuch an indulgence; yet no ſooner is there any thing amiſs <hi>within,</hi> no ſooner has he conceiv'd any <hi>internal ail or diſorder,</hi> any thing <hi>inwardly</hi> vexatious or diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, but inſtantly his enjoyment ceaſes, the pleaſure of ſenſe is at an end; and every thing that is a means of that ſort becomes ineffectual, and is plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as uneaſy, and giving diſtaſt when offer'd.</p>
                  <p>THE pleaſures of the Mind being allow'd, therefore, ſuperior to thoſe of the Body, it follows, <hi>that whatever can create to any intelligent Being a conſtant flowing, a ſeries or train of mental Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is more conſiderable to his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than that which can create to him the ſame conſtant courſe or train of ſenſual ones of the Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE mental Enjoyments in a great meaſure <hi>are actually the very natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections themſelves, in their immediat ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>OR, <hi>they proceed from, and are cauſed by natural and good Affections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HOW much <hi>the natural Affections themſelves are really Pleaſures and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> cannot but be own'd by any one who knows the condition and feeling of the Mind under a lively and forcible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Kindneſs, Love, Gratitude,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59040:56"/>
Bounty, Succor, or whatever elſe is of a generous, ſociable, or friendly kind; and who is ſenſible of what pleaſure the Mind perceives when it is imploy'd in acts of that nature, and is touch'd and mov'd in that ſort. The difference we find between a Solitude and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; between a <hi>common</hi> Company, and the Company or merely <hi>the ſight</hi> of thoſe we love; the reference of almoſt all our Pleaſures to Society, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence which they have either on So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety it ſelf immediatly, or on the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and ſuppoſal of it, as preſent; all theſe are ſufficient proofs, or rather experiences and inward convictions of the truth of this. That the Pleaſures of this ſort are thus forcibly felt, and are even ſuperior to thoſe of any bodily kind, may be known too from effects; not only from this (tho this withal may be remark'd) that the very outward fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the marks and ſigns which attend this ſort of Joy, are expreſſive of a more intenſe, clear, and undiſturb'd Pleaſure, than thoſe which attend the ſatisfaction of Thirſt, Hunger, Luſt, and the like; but it may be known with certainty from the prevalence and aſcendency of this ſort of joy over any other; from the ſilencing and appeaſing of every other motion of Pleaſure where <hi>this</hi> preſents
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59040:57"/>
it ſelf; and from the preference which is apparently given by every Nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, at ſome time or other, to this feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or affection, which has the power of drawing from every other (as in the caſe of love to the young, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other inſtances) or of ſo engroſſing the whole Temper, as to render it, in the midſt of all other Pleaſures, ſenſible in a manner only to this alone, which remains as maſter of, and ſuperior to the reſt. There is not any one who, by the leaſt progreſs in Science or Learning, has come to know barely the principles of Mathematics, but has found that in the exerciſe of his Mind, or the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries he there makes, tho merely of ſpeculative Truths, he receives a pleaſure and delight ſuperior to that of Senſe. But <hi>this</hi> again, how great ſoever the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure may be, muſt of neceſſity be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly ſurpaſs'd by <hi>virtuous Motion</hi> or <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> where, together with the ſtrongeſt delightful affection of the Soul, there is an approbation given by the Mind to what is acted in conſequence of that Motion or Affection; and where there is the faireſt matter of Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the goodlieſt view and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Earth, which is that of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, proportionable, and becoming Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſelf applicable, and of which the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59040:57"/>
memory and conſciouſneſs is of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing the moſt ſolidly and laſtingly pleaſing. In the paſſion of Love (we mean of that ſort which is between the Sexes) in which there is a mixture of the ſtrongeſt ſenſual Affection together with natural Affection, or affection of Kindneſs (ſuch as is in that caſe towards the object belov'd) it ſo far appears that the ſenſe or feeling of the <hi>former,</hi> and the Pleaſure enjoy'd in it, is outdone in <hi>this latter,</hi> that it is commonly known how that often, through that affection of Kindneſs, and for the ſake of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon belov'd, when in any danger, or any ways expos'd, the greateſt things in the world have bin done, and are ſo every day; the greateſt Hardſhips ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, and even Death it ſelf volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily embrac'd, without any deſired or expected <hi>compenſation;</hi> not <hi>here</hi> in this World ſurely, for Death puts an end to all; nor hardly, I ſuppoſe, <hi>hereafter,</hi> for there are few who have ever thought yet of providing a Heaven or future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the ſuffering Virtue of Lovers. But what is more yet, as to the excellence of theſe natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their agreeableneſs to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; not only the natural Affections of this kind, when Joy, Sprightlineſs and Gaity are mixt with them, have real en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59040:58"/>
and happineſs above Senſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the gratification merely of Senſe; but even that natural Affection which is clouded and under the worſt appearance, the very <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> (if one may ſay ſo) which belongs to natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to a generous, humane and kind Concern; tho it may be thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Pleaſure, is yet for contentment and ſatisfaction far above thoſe other pleaſures of indulg'd Senſe. And where a ſeries or continu'd ſucceſſion of theſe Motions or Affections can be carried on, even through fears, apprehenſions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms, doubts (the object <hi>Virtue</hi> being ſtill kept in ſight, and its Beauty appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill in the midſt of the ſurrounding Calamities) there is inſeparably join'd to this a contentment and ſatisfaction of the higheſt ſort; inſomuch that when by mere illuſion, as in a Tragedy, the Paſſions of this mournful kind are art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully excited in us, we prefer the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Pleaſure to any other enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of equal duration, and find by our ſelves that the moving our Paſſions in this ſort, the engaging them in the behalf of Merit and Worth, and the exerting of that Goodneſs that is in us, tho there be nothing more remote from ſenſual or bodily Pleaſure, is yet of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit ſenſation, and to ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59040:58"/>
enough to feel it, more moving, and of greater enjoyment than any thing of the other kind abſtracted intirely from this. And after this manner it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how much <hi>the mental Enjoyments are actually the very natural Affections them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HOW much they proceed from, and are cauſed by natural Affection,</hi> we have now to conſider.</p>
                  <p>THAT the affection of Love, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Bounty, is <hi>it ſelf</hi> of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of mental Pleaſure, has bin ſhewn. The EFFECTS of Love or kind Affection in a way of mental Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure are, <hi>a delight in, and enjoyment of the Good of others; a receiving it, as it were, by reflection, ſo as to participate in the Joy, Pleaſure, or Proſperity of whom we love or kindly affect;</hi> And <hi>a pleaſing conſciouſneſs of love or approbation from others, or of our meriting it from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THERE is nothing plainer than that both theſe Satisfactions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, <hi>viz. Joy in, and participation of the Good of others;</hi> and <hi>pleaſing conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs or ſenſe of merited Love from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> can poſſibly be nothing elſe but the EFFECTS of Love in us; and that they increaſe and decreaſe, as their CAUSE diminiſhes or grows. So that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59040:59"/>
where no Love or natural Affection is, or where it is but weak or unſound, there the conſequent Pleaſures cannot be at all, or at leaſt muſt be but weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound. Now the Pleaſures of <hi>ſharing Good with others;</hi> of receiving it in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and company; of gathering it from the pleaſed and happy States of thoſe around us, from accounts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of ſuch Happineſſes, Joys, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances; from the very Countenances and pleaſed Looks even of Creatures foreign to our Nature and Kind, whoſe ſigns of Joy and Contentment we can diſcern or underſtand; the Pleaſures or Delights of this ſort are ſo infinitly ſpreading and diffuſive through our whole lives, that there is hardly ſuch a thing as Pleaſure or Contentment, of which this is not a part, and which, if this were taken away, would not totally ſink and be corrupted, or at leaſt loſe its chiefeſt vigor, that which made its refinement, and without which it would be droſs. And thus in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to the other Pleaſure, that of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs to the love of others, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of merited Eſteem and Love;</hi> which in as far as it is a pleaſure, muſt be wholly the EFFECT of Love, and cannot be felt where natural Affection is not felt. How familiar and natural it is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59040:59"/>
to us, continually to be drawing ſome ſort of ſatisfaction from hence! How frequent and habitual it is with us, and how great a part of our enjoyment of Life, to be in joy and delight, as either well ſatisfied in the conſciouſneſs of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Eſteem and Kindneſs from others; or as flattered by the <hi>imagination</hi> of it! What Wretch is there, what open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator of the Laws of Society, deſtroyer or ravager ſo great, who has not a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, or ſome particular Set, either of his own Kindred, or of ſuch as he calls Friends, with whom he ſhares his Good, in whoſe Welfare he delights, and whoſe Joy he makes <hi>his</hi> Joy? Who are there amongſt theſe that are not flattered by the kindneſs of ſome that are near them, and ſenſibly moved by the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which they apprehend is bore to them, even by ſuch as are no way capable of aſſiſting them, or ſerving their Intereſt? It is to this that almoſt all their actions have reference; and without this there are few even of theſe ununiform and inconſiſtent livers, who would not find themſelves in an unſupportable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and deſertion, and think Life it ſelf a torment to them. It is this that goes through our whole lives, and mixes it ſelf even with moſt of our Vices. Of this, Vanity, Ambition, Luxury, have
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59040:60"/>
a ſhare, and many other diſorders of our Life partake. So that were Pleaſure to be computed in the way that other things commonly are, it might be ſaid, that out of theſe <hi>two Branches</hi> would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe more than nine tenths of all that is enjoyed in Life. Now there is not, nor can be any thing of this kind which dos not immediatly depend on the having natural and kind Affection. And as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affection is narrow, broken, or imperfect, ſo muſt be the Content and Joy ariſing hence.</p>
                  <p>FOR, firſt, PARTIAL AFFEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, or natural Affection <hi>in part,</hi> and only to ſome particulars, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency and contradiction: And as it has no foundation or eſtabliſhment <hi>in reaſon,</hi> ſo it muſt be eaſily removable and ſubject to alteration <hi>without reaſon.</hi> Now the variableneſs of ſuch ſort of Paſſion, which depends ſolely on capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs and humor, and muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the changeable ſucceſſions of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Hatred and Love, Averſion and Inclination towards the ſame Object, muſt not only in the end diminiſh natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affection, and together with it the pleaſures enjoyed from <hi>reflected Good,</hi> or <hi>Good of Participation,</hi> as above; but muſt create continual diſturbance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, unquietneſs, diſguſt, and give an
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59040:60"/>
allay to whatſoever is actually enjoy'd in the way of natural and ſocial Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Whereas on the other hand INTIRE AFFECTION (which is throughout, and equal towards the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or <hi>Whole,</hi> whereſoever any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies) as it is anſwerable to it ſelf, duly proportion'd, rational, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable; ſo it is irrefragable, ſolid, and laſting. And as in the other, every deficiency elſewhere, and every exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy in the Affection, dos in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reſiſt and diſturb the preſent and immediat feeling of ſocial and friendly Affection; ſo <hi>in this,</hi> every other good <hi>Affection,</hi> and the conſciouſneſs of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and ſoundneſs, caſts a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, and an addition of contentment on every particular Affection felt, and makes it of more inward pleaſant feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Soul, and more ſatisfactory and rejoicing in the Mind. Thus he who is leaſt ſelfiſh, and can, according as there is merit, love another with moſt ſincerity and ſtrongeſt Affection, dos not only enjoy moſt by <hi>diviſion</hi> or <hi>ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Good, and by <hi>communicating and imparting</hi> of it; but through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of the Juſtice, Beauty and Excellence of that Love, of its propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionableneſs to all his other Affections,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59040:61"/>
and of the ſutableneſs of thoſe Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Nature, and to <hi>the whole,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a ſatisfaction vaſtly above what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from that limited, entangled, and much corrupted pleaſure of imperfect, <hi>partial,</hi> and <hi>unintire</hi> Affection.</p>
                  <p>AND in the laſt place, as PARTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AL AFFECTION is fitted but to a ſmall enjoyment of thoſe Pleaſures <hi>of communicative and reflected Good</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd; ſo neither is it capable of extracting any thing conſiderable from that other principal Branch of human Happineſs and Delight, <hi>The being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the love and eſteem of others, and the being conſcious of that which merits it.</hi> For in the ſame manner as the Affection it ſelf is narrowly limited, infirm and changable; ſo accordingly is the merit ariſing hence very imperfect, and of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle account. And, as the Merit is but low and inferior, whilſt only towards ſome mean and inconſiderable part of Mankind, and not towards Society and the Whole; ſo, accordingly, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent pleaſure of the mind muſt below and defective. And as it is not poſſible that any who eſteem not, nor love ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Virtue, ſhould in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their ſo beloved and eſteemed Friends find either thoſe in whom they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59040:61"/>
can ſo conſtantly and throughly rejoice, and have ſatisfaction in meriting from, or whoſe reciprocal love, eſteem, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited approbation, they can equally and conſtantly prize and enjoy; ſo, they of neceſſity muſt fall ſhort in this other part of mental Enjoyment. Nor can the Pleaſures gather'd from ſelf-flattery in that <hi>unſound</hi> eſteem and love of thoſe who are neither rightly nor conſtantly eſteemed or loved, be any other than <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound,</hi> diſorderly and diſturbed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other hand, INTIRE AF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FECTION has all the oppoſit advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; it has Applauſe and Love from the <hi>beſt;</hi> and, in diſintereſted caſes, from the very <hi>worſt</hi> of men: and of this we may ſay, that it has a conſciouſneſs of merited love and approbation from all Society, from all intelligent Creatures, and from that which is the higheſt and ſupreme of all Intelligences. And the ſatisfaction which attends this <hi>Intire Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> is full and noble in proportion to its <hi>ultimate and final Object,</hi> which carries all in it ſelf, and contains all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, according to that ſenſe of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi> above eſtabliſh'd. This is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of Virtue: and to have this IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIRE AFFECTION, or INTEGRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, is <hi>to live according to Nature,</hi> and the Dictates and Rules of ſupreme
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59040:62"/>
Wiſdom; this is Morality, Juſtice, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and natural Religion.</p>
                  <p>THUS therefore it is evident that by reaſon of the EFFECTS of natural Affection in <hi>reflected good from the joy and good of others,</hi> and in that of <hi>ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to kindneſs and love from others,</hi> the chiefeſt of mental Pleaſures (which are the chiefeſt of all Pleaſures) are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from, and owing to natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>AND to ſhew by farther inſtance yet, how much the mental Pleaſures <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from, and are caus'd by natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi> let any one conſider, that all thoſe Pleaſures which a man can have in any other beſides a merely ſenſual way, all thoſe Pleaſures receiv'd from Converſe, Familiarity, Society, in privat Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, Thought and Retirement, in Mirth and Entertainment, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be of that Species and Kind of mental Pleaſures; they are wholly in a manner founded <hi>in the having aſ well diſpos'd and eaſy Temper or Spirit, free of harſhneſs, diſtaſt, ſowerneſs, turbulence;</hi> and in having <hi>a Mind or Reaſon in good order, reconcilable to it ſelf, ſuch as creates it ſelf no unpleaſant views, nor is of ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</hi> Now ſuch a MIND and ſuch a TEMPER as this, which muſt fit and qualify for the enjoying of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59040:62"/>
mention'd, is, and muſt be owing to the natural and good Affections.</p>
                  <p>AS to what relates to TEMPER (which we will conſider firſt) and how a Temper of that happy ſort comes to be really owing to natural Affection; it may be conſider'd thus.</p>
                  <p>THERE is no ſtate of Health or Proſperity ſo great, where Inclination and Will are always anſwer'd, Fancy and Humor pleas'd; where there are not hourly almoſt ſome ſtops, impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or croſſes to the Intention, Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite or Liking; ſome Accidents or other <hi>from without</hi> to check the licentious courſe of the Deſire; or ſomething <hi>from within,</hi> from the diſpoſition of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Humors, or what elſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the ordinary courſe of a Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which muſt occaſion diſtaſt and vexation, and cauſe a habit of that kind, where there is nothing to oppoſe it, ſo as to ſtop the progreſs of it, and hinder its gaining upon a Temper. Now the only thing that can be oppos'd to this, is ſome natural and kind Affection: for if the Mind by reflection reſolves to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this ill at any time when riſen in the Temper, and that it thinks fit to do it in good earneſt on any account, it can no otherwiſe effectually and really do it but by introducing into the Soul, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionat
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59040:63"/>
Part, ſome affection of Love, ſome motion of Kindneſs, Affectionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Candor, to allay and convert that motion of Impatience and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. For, if it be not done this way, the Countenance may indeed be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, but the Heart not chang'd: and if it be done only by the power of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Fear or Apprehenſion, or by the power of any other Affection than ſuch as is by nature oppoſit and contrary; the ill Paſſion is ſuſpended only during the time which that fear laſts, but is not ſubdu'd or in the leaſt debilitated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the next occaſion, nor hindred therefore as to its progreſs or gaining over the Temper. So that where an affable, benign, and kind diſpoſition reigns not; where there is not a mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſerenity ſpread through the whole Temper, ſo as to render it of eaſy acceptation, and fair conſtruction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant, eaſily conceding, charitable and good; there can be but little of <hi>an eaſy and free Spirit</hi> long remaining, and conſequently but few and ſlender Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a mental kind: for in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per where the ſlighteſt thing diſeaſes and provokes, where diſpleaſure and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence are always ready to ariſe, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing kind and reconciling to allay and turn thoſe Motions; but where bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59040:63"/>
and choler in a manner ſwim at the top and over all, and where ſomething of a froward and malignant kind is ever ſtirring and active; in ſuch a Temper as this there can be but little reception for any of thoſe mental Pleaſures, which in this caſe can be but very rarely experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd, muſt be very faint, and of ſmall continuance.</p>
                  <p>BUT, to preſs this further yet: It is moſt certain that <hi>by what proportion the natural and good Affections are loſt or want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any Creature, by that proportion the ill and unnatural ones muſt prevail.</hi> It is the nature of every Paſſion by uſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to grow ſtronger and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd. There are in every Life, even in the moſt proſperous (as has bin ſaid already) continual ſources of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and uneaſineſs, either from inward bodily conſtitution, variety of diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the unconformity of <hi>things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> to fancy, humor and will: and if thoſe who are in the higheſt circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Fortune ſeem to come off the eaſieſt, it is to be conſider'd that the moſt humor'd and indulg'd State is what receives the moſt diſturbance from every diſappointment or ſmalleſt ail. Now ſince beſides what is of the kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affection, there is nothing of any kind elſe which can hinder the courſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59040:64"/>
and growing habit of impatience, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and vexation; much leſs can any thing elſe beſides natural and kind Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, reſiſt the more violent motions of Anger, Rage, Revengefulneſs; and, where provocations, offences and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ariſe, (as there are ſubjects infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit) be able to correct the virulence and malignity of thoſe Paſſions once kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and to expel that which is infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in them, and poiſonous to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: ſo that the forward, prone and ſudden paſſions of Reſentment, Pique, Vexation and Frowardneſs, which are ſure to be mov'd on a thouſand occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and which ariſe in a manner of themſelves, without any apparent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, having no check or controul; but, being left maſters and poſſeſſors of the Soul (when there is nothing there either of human or good Affection to reſiſt or make a ſtand) and growing thus by uſe and exerciſe into greater ſtrength and prevalence, they cannot but cauſe a ſettled inveteracy and rancor, and make this the ground and bottom of the whole Temper. But, of the miſery of this we ſhall ſpeak when we come to conſider of <hi>the unnatural State.</hi> In the mean time it ſeems to have bin prov'd, that all thoſe mental pleaſures of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, Mirth, Familiarity, and the reſt,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59040:64"/>
depend upon a <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly diſpos'd; and that the TEMPER which produces theſe <hi>is and muſt be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the natural and good Affections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW as to the other part, a MIND <hi>or Reaſon thus diſpos'd and in good order, reconcilable to it ſelf, and of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection;</hi> and upon what account this <hi>is, and muſt be owing to natural Affection,</hi> we may conſider it after this manner. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Creature has Intelligence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the manner that we have it, and who from ſeveral degrees of reflection has riſen to that Capacity which we call Senſe and Underſtanding; ſuch a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as this, in the very uſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative or reaſoning Faculty, is forc'd to receive reflections back into his Mind of that which paſſes in it ſelf, of the actions of his Will, and of his forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Behavior in the common courſe of his natural Temper towards his fellow Creatures, as well as in all occaſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. And tho we ſay of ſome giddy and heedleſs people, that they live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflection, it is not that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from this ſort of feeling, or have not this conſciouſneſs with them as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have (for their Memory is as good, and the neceſſary occaſions are as many of remembring and calling to mind what they did or felt before) but they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59040:65"/>
are ſaid to have no reflection, becauſe they do not deſignedly, or with any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or help to themſelves in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, call to mind any number of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to draw Inference from thence to what is preſent or future. Now to ſuch a reaſoning or reflecting Creature as this, who is forc'd of neceſſity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the <hi>review</hi> of his own Mind and Actions, and to have repreſentations of himſelf and his own Affairs conſtantly before him, obvious to him, and paſſing in his Mind; to ſuch a Creature as this there are TWO things which muſt be horridly offenſive and agrieving; to have the reflection in his Mind <hi>of any paſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Behavior which he likes not ſhould be imputed to him, which he knows odious, and feels to be of ill merit:</hi> or, to have the reflection in his Mind <hi>of any thing fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done (either as ſupinely and negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or as raſhly and extravagantly) in the prejudice of his own Intereſt and Good.</hi> CONSCIENCE is one or other, or both of theſe. For the fear of future Evils or of eternal Ill inflicted at the will of ſome ſuperior and ſupernatural Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is to have aw and terror of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, but dos not imply Conſcience, any more than the fear of thoſe evils which are apprehended from Spirits, Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch like, dos imply Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59040:65"/>
for to fear the Devil and to fear God would (as to Conſcience) be then all one; and to fear God in any other manner than as in conſequence of ſome juſtly blameable and imputable act, is to fear a deviliſh Nature, or Devil in the ſtead of God: ſo that Conſcience may even be where ſenſe of future divine Puniſhment is not. Nor dos the terror of Hell, or a thouſand other terrors of the Deity imply Conſcience except in this caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> where there is ill reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Mind <hi>of what is wrong, odious, morally deform'd, and ill deſerving;</hi> or of <hi>what was committed contrary to wiſdom, and unaccountably:</hi> and whereſoever <hi>this</hi> is (whether join'd or not join'd with any poſitive fear of future divine Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted) there Conſcience is, there Conſcience accuſes. And thus there is beſides <hi>a religious Conſcience</hi> that which we may call <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:</hi> altho that alſo may be call'd <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Conſcience</hi> which regards the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of any act with reſpect to the all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeingneſs of the Deity; who being ſo highly thought of as to all Excellence and Greatneſs, it cannot otherwiſe be, but that in the conceiv'd preſence of ſuch a Being, the ſhame of Villany or Vice muſt with great forcibleneſs be felt, even independently of that apprehenſion or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59040:66"/>
ſenſe of any future Puniſhment of poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive infliction.</p>
                  <p>AS for a rational Creature therefore, ſuch as Man, who whilſt he continues to be Rational and to have a Mind, muſt of neceſſity through the courſe of his Life be conſcious of, and have before him ſtill, the reſults of that Mind, the determinations and actions of his Will, and the effects of his natural Temper and Affections in his foregoing Life: if there be any action which, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded hence, is odious of imputation, and <hi>of ill reflection,</hi> it muſt be diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and afflicting to him, as being acted againſt <hi>natural Conſcience.</hi> There is no ſenſible Creature who maliciouſly and intentionally dos ill, who is not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible likewiſe that he <hi>deſerves ill:</hi> and in this ſenſe every Creature has Conſcience. For, with all Mankind, and all intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Creatures this muſt ever hold, <hi>that</hi> WHAT <hi>they know they deſerve from every one,</hi> THAT <hi>they neceſſarily muſt fear and expect from every one:</hi> and thus ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ill apprehenſions muſt grow, and terrors ariſe both of Men and of the Deity. But beſides this, and over and above the very Return and Puniſhment which is fear'd, there muſt, in almoſt every rational Creature, be yet farther Conſcience, <hi>from ſenſe of deformity in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59040:66"/>
what is thus ill-deſerving and unnatural, and from the conſequent regret and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of incurring what is odious, and moves averſion.</hi> There ſcarcely is, or can be any Creature whom conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Villany <hi>as ſuch merely</hi> dos not at all offend; nor any thing opprobrious or hainouſly imputable, move or affect: or if there be ſuch a one, it follows then, that with ſuch a Creature as this all things that are of a moral kind, or relate to either the good or ill of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, muſt be equal and indifferent in the Affection (for if it were not ſo, but that any thing of that kind were odious, it muſt be moſt of all odious of imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> application.) If this be ſo, then neither can there be any natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: if not that, then neither any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Society, or mental Enjoyment, as above; but inſtead of that, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of horrid, unnatural and ill Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; of the miſery of which we are to ſpeak diſtinctly under our laſt head. So that not to be ſenſible to the odiouſneſs or mere deformity of Crime and Injuſtice (which is to have no ſenſe of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or illneſs of any act, nor any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affection at all) and to be ſo far without Conſcience, is to be moſt of all miſerable in Life: but where Conſcience or ſenſe of this ſort remains, there it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59040:67"/>
follows, that whatever carriage, action or deed, is contrary to the ſenſe of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deſervingneſs, and is therefore odious of imputation, unbecoming, and of ill conſciouſneſs, this muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, by means of Reflection, be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually grievous and offenſive. A man who in the height of Anger and Fury happens to kill another, dos, as we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſee, relent immediatly at the very ſight of what he has done, and only by beholding the miſerable ſtate of a dying Creature, in that ſpectacle of Death which he himſelf has caus'd: for this he ſuffers Agony; the ſubject of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually occurs to him in his mind; and of this he muſt have ill memory and conſciouſneſs. If on the other ſide, he dos not relent nor ſuffer any concern at all, then, either he is ſuch a one as has no ſenſe of Deformity, of Crime and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, no natural Affection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no Happineſs or Peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: or if he have ſenſe of moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Illneſs, but that in this or any particular, he affects THAT as noble, gallant or worthy, which is the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; it muſt follow, that as there is no proportion, aptneſs or fitneſs but in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue alone to Eſteem, Approbation, or good Conſciouſneſs; he muſt either through the inconſiſtency, contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59040:67"/>
and abſurdity of ſuch an unlaſting and unaccountable Eſteem and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and through the ill influence it muſt have in time upon his Temper, come to loſe at laſt even this remaining imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Conſcience; or, if he ſtill retains it in any degree, it muſt follow that through the ſame unſutableneſs of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or Eſteem to any thing of a contrary nature to Virtue, there muſt be great confuſion and diſagreement in Life, and continual diſturbance and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction in the ſervice of ſuch a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> For it is impoſſible that a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, or one of the Banditi, a Pirat, or any confederate Cheat or Ruffian, or in ſhort, any one who is falſe to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Mankind in general, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts natural Affection, ſhould have any <hi>Principle</hi> that holds throughout, any fix'd Standard or Meaſure upon which he can regulate his Approbation or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, any Reaſon or Rule for his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of any one action moral; if any thing morally good or ill, amiable or deteſtable has place with him: ſo that the more he engages in the love or admiration of any thing as morally worthy, which is morally ill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable; the more ſelf-contradiction he muſt meet with, the more diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſelf-diſapprobation in the main,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59040:68"/>
through the perpetual variableneſs and inſtability of that Rule by which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves and diſapproves, and through the irreconcilableneſs of his Mind and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to it ſelf. And there being nothing more certain than this, <hi>that no natural Affection can be contradicted, nor no ill one advanced</hi> (as by falſe applauſe it is) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a prejudice in ſome degree to all the other natural Affections;</hi> it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that natural Deformity growing greater by the incouragement of unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affection in any particular, if at the ſame time there remains a ſenſe of moral Good or Ill; there muſt be of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity more work created for ill Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, more ſubject of ill conſciouſneſs; and the matter or ground of ſelf-diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or ſelf-diſſatisfaction in Life, muſt be more increas'd, as irregular and ill Affection increaſes.</p>
                  <p>IN ſhort, there is no tranſgreſſion, loſs or violation of natural Affection in any degree, without ill Conſcience of the firſt ſort, viz. <hi>of ill merit or ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervingneſs,</hi> ſuch as loſes us that ſupreme happineſs of Reſt, and ſecurity of Mind in a freedom from ill Apprehenſions and Suſpicions; and ſuch as muſt draw on, neceſſarily, that contrary habit of Mind which cauſes us to live in terrors of Mankind, and of all credited, or but

ſuſpected ſuperior Powers: from which fears we are by innocence and good conſciouſneſs ſo much deliver'd, and by that means plac'd in ſuch ſecurity and eaſe. If there be no farther Conſcience than this, if there be no Conſcience at all from ſenſe of deformity in moral Ill, and conſequently no natural Affection; then is the Mind fartheſt of all from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at eaſe, by being (as it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be, when natural Affection is loſt) in the horrideſt ſtate of Savageneſs, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and unnatural Paſſion. If there be indeed farther Conſcience, as from a ſenſe of moral Deformity and Excellence, then there being certainly no durable or conſiſtent ſelf-approbation from any thing beſides what is of Virtue; there is ground of conſtant ſelf-accuſation or diſlike from whatſoever is contrary to, or is a defect in natural Affection: as on the other ſide, there is ground of thorow ſelf-approbation, joy and contentment, whereſoever there is integrity of Life, and adherence to natural and ſound Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>THIS alſo is to be conſider'd, that when any one by an immorality or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice offends his Conſcience, and goes againſt natural Affection, or ſenſe of Right and Wrong; he cannot poſſibly ſee a reaſon in himſelf, why he ſhould
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59040:69"/>
not be carried further into all manner of Villany, or why he ſhould not eſteem himſelf as a perſon liable and open to all Crime and Wickedneſs, even that which is as yet unknown to him. And this is a reproach which a Mind muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity make to it ſelf upon the leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Conſcience, and where any thing is committed in contradiction to a ſenſe of Right and Wrong, that is, of an amiableneſs or deformity in moral Actions.</p>
                  <p>AS for that other part of Conſcience, <hi>viz.</hi> the ill remembrance or ill reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of what is unreaſonably done, and in prejudice of Intereſt or Happineſs:</hi> This muſt follow ſtill and have effect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever any action has given occaſion to ſenſe of Deformity contracted by Crime and Injuſtice: or where there is not the ground of any ſuch ſenſe; yet there muſt follow ſtill an ill Conſcience from ſenſe of ill Merit with reſpect to Men, and to the Deity. Or tho there be a poſſibility (which is hard to ſuppoſe) of excluding for ever all thoughts or ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of any ſuperior Powers, yet it is impoſſible but that an almoſt total defect in natural Affection, which no diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation can long conceal, muſt occaſion a ſenſible loſs to us in the confidence and truſt of men, and conſequently in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59040:69"/>
and Happineſs. And the ſenſe of this great diſadvantage is what can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail to occur to us, when we ſee (as we muſt be forc'd to do with envy) the better and more grateful terms of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Truſt, Love and Eſteem, on which thoſe who have not renounc'd their good and natural Affection, live with the reſt of Mankind. Where natural Affection therefore is not; yet by Immorality, happening through want of ſuch Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there muſt be diſturbance from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of this ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>ſenſe of what is committed unwiſely, and contrary to Intereſt and Safety:</hi> and this too, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any ſecurity in which men may live againſt the apprehenſions of a ſuperior and animadverting Power.</p>
                  <p>FROM all this we may conclude, that a MIND <hi>and Reaſon, well at eaſe, orderly, reconcilable with it ſelf, and of good retroſpect or reflection</hi> (on which, and on a TEMPER ſuch as we have ſpoken of, all thoſe mental Pleaſures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enumerated do in a great degree depend, and are founded) <hi>is owing to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and good Affection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SO that if the chiefeſt Happineſs be from the mental Pleaſures, and from <hi>the conſtanteſt ſucceſſion or ſeries of ſuch in Life;</hi> and that the chiefeſt mental Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are ſuch as we have treated of, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59040:70"/>
are founded in natural Affection; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>To have the natural Affections, is to have the chiefeſt enjoyment, poſſeſſion, and happineſs of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW as to the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and the ſatisfactions belonging to Senſe; it is evident, that they cannot poſſibly have their effect, or be of any valuable or delightful enjoyment, but by the means of natural and ſocial Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>IF from the higheſt voluptuouſneſs in eating or in drinking, the circumſtances of a Table and Companions were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn; ſo that all poſſible means of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying theſe delights in fellowſhip, all occaſion for ſocial feeling or Affection were deny'd; there would be hardly any Pleaſure remaining that were worth acceptance, even in the opinion of the moſt debauch'd themſelves: and if there are any of thoſe Senſualiſts who can be ſenſual by themſelves, who can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to take theſe ſatisfactions when perfectly alone, and can indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſame manner, and eat and drink with the ſame reliſh <hi>then</hi> as at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeaſon; there is no body who thinks the Pleaſure of theſe perſons to be very refin'd, or that they are ſo much as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of enjoying it, ſo as to be reckon'd upon as men of Pleaſure. The very
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59040:70"/>
notion of a <hi>Debauch</hi> (which is a ſally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that can be imagin'd of Pleaſure and Voluptuouſneſs) carries with it an apprehenſion of reference to Society, or to a Gang, or ſomething of Fellowſhip: it may be call'd a <hi>Surfeit or Exceſs of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking,</hi> but hardly a <hi>Debauch</hi> of that kind, when the exceſs was taken ſeparately, out of Society or reach of People: and one that uſes himſelf in this way, is often call'd a <hi>Sot,</hi> but never a <hi>Debauchee.</hi> The Courtezans, and even the commoneſt of Women, who live by proſtitution, know very well how neceſſary it is, that every one whom they entertain with their Beauty, ſhould believe that there are ſatisfactions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal, and that Pleaſures are as well <hi>given</hi> as <hi>receiv'd:</hi> and were the imagination of this to be wholly taken away, there are hardly any of the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort of Mankind who would not think the remaining Pleaſure to be groſs and ſordid, and of very imperfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. Who is there that can well, or long enjoy any thing when alone, and abſtracted perfectly even in his very Mind and Thought, from any thing of Society? Who is there that on thoſe terms is not ſoon cloy'd by any ſenſual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and that is not uneaſy with his Pleaſure, however exquiſit it be, of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59040:71"/>
till ſuch time as he has found a way to impart it, and make it <hi>truly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant</hi> to him, by communicating his Joy, and ſharing it at leaſt with ſome <hi>one</hi> ſingle perſon? Let men imagin what they pleaſe; let them ſuppoſe or believe themſelves ever ſo ſelfiſh; or deſire ever ſo much to follow the dictates of ſuch a Principle, and to bring Nature under reſtraint; Nature will break out, and in agonies, diſquiets, and a diſtemper'd ſtate, demonſtrate evidently the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſuch violence, the abſurdity of ſuch a device, and the puniſhment which belongs to ſuch a monſtrous and horrid endeavor.</p>
                  <p>THUS, therefore, not only the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Mind depend on natural Affection; but even the <hi>pleaſures</hi> too of <hi>the Body</hi> do in ſo far depend, that where natural Affection is not, they not only loſe their force, but are in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into diſturbance, uneaſineſs and diſguſt: ſo as that the matter which ſhould feed joy, contentment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, feeds rather diſcontent and ſower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and breeds a nauſeating, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and reſtleſs diſpoſition, by reaſon of the abſolute incapacity in any thing ſenſual to pleaſe, or give any laſting or thorow contentment, where it is not mixt with any thing of affable, kind, or ſocial Affection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:59040:71"/>AND thus both with reſpect to <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> enjoyment, and to the enjoyments of <hi>Senſe</hi> alſo; TO HAVE THE NATU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL AFFECTIONS, IS TO HAVE THE CHIEFEST SATISFACTION AND HAPPINESS OF LIFE.</p>
                  <p>NOW on the other ſide, THAT TO WANT THE SAME NATURAL AFFECTIONS IS TO BE CHIEF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY MISERABLE, appears firſt from the loſs it implies both of the <hi>mental</hi> and <hi>bodily Pleaſures;</hi> and alſo from its carrying with it the horrideſt of pains, thoſe of the Mind: of which ſort if (by what ſhall further be prov'd) thoſe deriv'd from unnatural and horrid Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections appear to be the very worſt; it will follow that ſince (according to what has bin prov'd already) <hi>unnatural</hi> and horrid <hi>Affection is and muſt ever be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to the loſs of natural and good;</hi> that therefore <hi>to want natural and good Affection, is certainly to incar the greateſt of Torments and Diſeaſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT, before we conclude as to this of natural Affection, we may add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in general, of the BALANCE <hi>of the Affection</hi> (of which we gave ſome hint before) and by this endeavor to demonſtrate how that <hi>for want of a due proportion or balance in natural Affection, a Creature is at a loſs and uneaſy, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb'd,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59040:72"/>
and ill affected in his other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THERE is no body who has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd ever ſo little the nature of the ſenſible part, the Soul or Mind, but knows that in the ſame manner as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out action, motion and employment, the Body languiſhes and is oppreſs'd, its Nouriſhment grows the matter and food of Diſeaſe, the Spirits unconſum'd help to conſume the Body, and Nature as it were preys upon it ſelf; ſo alſo that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and living part, <hi>the Soul or Mind,</hi> wanting its proper and natural exerciſe, is burden'd, and diſeas'd; and its Thoughts and Paſſions being unnaturally witheld from their due Objects, turn againſt it ſelf, and create the higheſt impatience. For the Mind or Soul, which more than the Body requires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation and exerciſe, cannot be but in a ſtate of Feeling or Paſſion, of ſome kind, and under ſome certain Affection or other: if not under ſuch Affection as may fitly employ it in proportionable and fit ſubject; yet however under ſuch as will make it a burden, diſeaſe and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>IN BRUTES, and ſuch as have not the uſe of Reaſon or Reflection (at leaſt not after the manner which Mankind has) it is ſo order'd in Nature, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59040:72"/>
their daily ſearch after Food, their application and intention towards the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of their own immediate ſupport, or towards the affairs of their Kind, almoſt their whole time is taken up, and they fail not to find full imployment for their Paſſion, according to that degree of agitation and vigor to which they are fitted, and which their Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. If it happens that any one of theſe be taken out of a natural and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious ſtate, to be plac'd in the midſt of Eaſe, and of a Plenty furniſhing abundantly to all his Appetites and Wants; it proves, that as his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are luxuriant, his Temper and Paſſions grow ſo too; and that coming to have theſe accommodations at a cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rate, with reſpect to Labor and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, than was intended him by Nature, he is made to pay dearer for it in another ſenſe, by loſing the good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his Temper and Paſſions, and the orderlineſs of his Kind or Species.</p>
                  <p>IT happens with <hi>Mankind,</hi> that ſome by neceſſity are ty'd to Labor, whilſt others are provided for in an abundance of all things at the expence of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of the reſt. Now, if amongſt thoſe of this eaſy ſort, there be not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of fit and proper Imployment rais'd in the room of what is wanting
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59040:73"/>
by ſuch a vacancy from common Labor and Toil; if there be not an applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſome ſort of work, ſuch as has a good and honeſt end in Society, as Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Sciences, Arts, Husbandry, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or privat Oeconomy, or the like; but that there be a ſettled Idleneſs, Supineſs, and a relax'd and diſſolute State; it muſt needs produce (as is always ſeen) a total diſorder of the Paſſions, and muſt break out in the ſtrangeſt irregularities imaginable. It is not thus with thoſe who are taken up in honeſt and due Imployment, and have bin well inur'd to it, as amongſt the induſtrious ſort of common People; where it is rare to meet with any inſtances of thoſe irregularities of Affection that are known in Courts and where Idleneſs reigns. Neither may it be improper here, to remark what many have done in advantage of Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Application; that where a Perſon neceſſitated from his youth to a Life of the moſt laborious ſort, has on a ſudden chang'd his circumſtances and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich, he has found in himſelf the uneaſineſs and ill operation of that Eaſe and Reſt he ſo much wiſh'd for, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other proper imployment to turn himſelf to, he has again betaken himſelf to that Life out of choice, to which before be was only driven and neceſſitated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:59040:73"/>THERE is no need of going about by farther Inſtances, and Argument, to prove, <hi>that as motion and exerciſe is of abſolute neceſſity to the good ſtate and welfare of the</hi> BODY; ſo <hi>it is to that of</hi> THE MIND AND AFFECTIONATE PART.</p>
                  <p>NOW Nature having (as we ſee evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in Creatures) made it ſo great a part of the natural imployment and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Mind and Paſſion, to be applied and bent towards the Species: and having ſuted and fram'd the reſt of the Paſſions, the whole Conſtitution and Oeconomy of the Creature to this; it cannot but follow of conſequence, that where this ſocial Bent and Affection is wanting, the Mind and paſſionat Part muſt ſuffer much by the want of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſure to create to themſelves <hi>unuſual and unnatural</hi> exerciſe, where they are cut off from ſuch as is <hi>natural and good.</hi> And thus in the room of ſocial and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affection, new and unnatural ones muſt be rais'd, and all Order and Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy be thus deſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p>IT is to have a very imperfect idea of the Order of Nature in the formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtructure of Animals, to think that ſo great a <hi>Principle,</hi> ſo fundamental a Part as that of natural Affection in the Soul, ſhould be poſſibly loſt or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd without mighty diſorder, cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59040:74"/>
and injury to the Creature. In the ſtructure of the Body, where all is ſo aptly adjuſted, there is not any of all thoſe which are call'd the noble or principal Parts, that can be wounded or hurt without the immediat diſorder and ſufferance of the whole Body. Nor is this otherwiſe in the ſtructure of the Paſſions and Affections, which are with equal art and exactneſs ſuted and fram'd to one another, to every different Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and different Sex; ſince we ſee <hi>the Whole</hi> ſo nicely built, that the barely extending of one Paſſion but a little too far, or the continuance of it too long, is able to overturn all, and bring irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable ruin and miſery, by Diſtraction. How is it poſſible, therefore, that in a Syſtem ſuch as this, a principle of Life and Motion ſo great as that of natural Affection, ſo interwove with all the other Faculties, and ſuted to the other Motions within, ſhould poſſibly be injur'd or loſt, without the ſufferance and ruin of the inward Part, and a total intanglement, torture, and perplexity of inward Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? We ſee in the example of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, how a ſmall bodily alteration has an effect upon the Paſſions, ſo as to take away thoſe Appetites and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are the proper ones of the Sex, and how great a diſorder this breeds;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59040:74"/>
how <hi>Man</hi> himſelf no leſs than other creatures, is render'd by it unſound, imperfect, deform'd, and miſerably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his Paſſions and Affections as well as in outward figure; how impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of mind, and how weak, untoward and wretched in his whole ſtate. It is the ſame thing when without any change in the bodily Organs, and only by the force of unnatural Education, Practice, or Uſe, any natural Paſſions are remov'd which are of the Oeconomy and Order of the Creature. A man effeminatly bred and us'd, tho not an Eunuch, nor by any Metamorphoſis chang'd into Woman, yet becomes a kind of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in part, and is the ſame disfigur'd creature as to his Paſſions and inward Compoſure, as that other ſort of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and creature of neither Sex. Who is there that can think of any creature that becomes degenerate, and loſes any principal Feeling or Paſſion which is of the character of his Species (as of a Lion that ſhould loſe his Courage, a Bee his Induſtry, a Turtle his tender, and as it were <hi>conjugal</hi> Affection) without having the idea of an untoward imperfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of a Creature that for his own ſake had better not <hi>be?</hi> Can any one think either of a Male that paſſes into any of the Paſſions or Affections proper
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59040:75"/>
only to the Female; or of a Female that loſes the proper and peculiar ſoftneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Sex, and becomes Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine, without being offended, and without judging very readily, that as there is a different order of Life, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent oeconomy, different capacities of Pleaſure, and enjoyments of Life; ſo there is a different order ſet, and oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of Paſſions aſſign'd in the ſame manner to the one, different from the other? For, where the Faculties, the Habitudes or Affections belonging to the Male, are join'd to other Affections which are proper only to the Female; this being diſagreeable, prepoſterous, and of diſturbance to the ſmooth and regular courſe of the Paſſions, muſt be of neceſſity a torment and diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>NOW if for any Animal, even of the brutiſh kind, to loſe any one of thoſe Affections proper to his Species and to the character of his Kind, or of his Sex only, be of ſo great an injury to him; what muſt it be for <hi>Man</hi> to loſe that ſenſe and feeling which is proper to him <hi>as a man;</hi> which is his proper Character, his Make and Genius? What muſt it be for Man (whoſe dependence on, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Society is yet greater than in any of thoſe other Creatures) to loſe any thing of that natural Affection by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59040:75"/>
which he is carried on to the good of his Species and Society, and of which paſſion he has naturally ſo much more than other creatures, that he, of any other, can leaſt bear Solitude or an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſocial Enjoyment which he is ſtill ſeeking after, and if long depriv'd of, is hardly able to endure his Being? Nor is any thing more apparent than that there is naturally in every one ſuch a degree of ſocial Affection as neceſſitates and drives him to ſeek the Familiarity and Friendſhip of others, amongſt whom he may let looſe a Paſſion which wants to be employ'd, and which when it is ſuppreſs'd, creates a ſadneſs, dejection and melancholy in the Mind, as great as is on the contrary that healing and enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy it brings when acting at its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and with full ſcope; as at that time we may ſee particularly when the Heart is open'd, and the ſecrets of the Breaſt unfolded to a Boſom-friend. This we ſee confirm'd in perſons of the moſt elevated Stations, in Princes, Monarchs, and thoſe who ſeem by their condition to be above ordinary human Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and to affect a ſtrangeneſs and diſtance with Mankind. For altho the wiſer and better ſort are perhaps out of a jealouſy rejected by them, as not fitted for their intimacy or ſecret converſe;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59040:76"/>
yet there are thoſe ſubſtituted in the room, who tho they may have the leaſt merit of any, and are perhaps the moſt vile and contemptible of men; yet ſerve however to that end of Friendſhip, and are ſo much the ſubjects of a Kindneſs and ſocial Affection in theſe great ones, that for <hi>theſe</hi> we can ſee them often in pain and in concern; in <hi>theſe</hi> they eaſily confide; to <hi>theſe</hi> they can with pleaſure be open, free, kind, ſuccorable and bountiful, as rejoycing and taking de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, having no intention or aim beyond it, and their intereſt (in reſpect of Policy) often ſtanding contrary to it. In Perſons of but an ordinary good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, no better than what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the generality of Mankind, it is diſcernable how much they are preſs'd with this neceſſity of entertaining Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and familiar Commerce, and how much theſe ſocial Affections want (if I may ſay ſo) their <hi>daily exerciſe</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</hi> How heavy dos Life grow when without it? And how plain is it, that after a long abſence, and a ſort of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence in this way, after a baniſhment from the company of near Friends, and a diſuſe of Society but for a ſmall time, the Mind is in diſtreſs, the Temper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compos'd; and that no ſooner is the man reſtor'd to the means of his former En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59040:76"/>
but he takes new Pleaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives additional Delight, and enjoys more than before the freedom, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and all thoſe circumſtances of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commerce, and of an inward Society from which he was ſeparated?</p>
                  <p>AND thus it may appear how much natural Affection is predominant in us; how it is inwardly joined to us, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in our Natures; how interwove with our other Paſſions, and how eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the regular motion and courſe of all our Affections, on which our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſelf-enjoyment ſo immediatly depends.</p>
                  <p>THUS much as to the Syſtem and Conſtitution of the inward part, and as to that natural BALANCE <hi>of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;</hi> which may not be thought (we hope) ſo odd or unjuſtifiable a way of ſpeaking, after what has bin ſaid.</p>
                  <p>AS to both thoſe <hi>Ills</hi> which follow the ill balance and defect of natural Affection, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>enlargement and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the ſelfiſh Paſſions;</hi> and <hi>the growth of the unnatural and horrid ones;</hi> how and in what degree theſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are miſerable, we come to ſpeak in what follows upon each of thoſe heads, which make the ſecond and third part of this Examination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59040:77"/>AND thus it appears, that <hi>As</hi> TO HAVE THE NATURAL AND GOOD AFFECTIONS IS OF THE CHIEF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EST ENJOYMENT OF LIFE; <hi>So</hi> TO WANT THEM IS OF THE HIGHEST DISORDER AND MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERY.</p>
                  <p>II. WE are now to prove, THAT BY HAVING THE SELF-PASSIONS TOO INTENSE OR STRONG, A CREATURE IS MISERABLE.</p>
                  <p>WE have already conſider'd in ſome meaſure of the Paſſions and Affections of this kind, as they are good and uſeful for the Creature, with reſpect to his privat Intereſt and ſelf-Oeconomy. Now <hi>theſe,</hi> if they are moderate and in a natural degree, are no ways inconſiſtent with the effects or right operation of natural Affection; which will prevail ſtill where it ought, and in every fit occaſion take place of any of thoſe other Affections whilſt thus moderate, and make them to be no obſtructions: For thus in a Creature who has a natural affection towards its young, the Affections towards privat good or ſafety, tho abiding ſtill in the Creature, are yet no hindrance to his operation towards public Good, or good of his Kind, even where Sufferings and Violences are to be undergon, and Life
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59040:77"/>
it ſelf comes in queſtion: And this is <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a right Balance and Proportion.</hi> But if the Paſſions of this kind toward privat Good, or the Regards to privat Good are exceſſive and beyond a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree; then is this Operation hindred, and the effects of natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards public Good prevented: and thus is <hi>the Balance broken,</hi> and <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy deſtroy'd.</hi> Therefore if it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd conducing to the Intereſt of any Creature, to have theſe ſelf-Paſſions thus violently ſtrong, and the Balance to be after this manner; then it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Intereſt reſolutely to go againſt thoſe natural Affections. But if (as we think it will appear) it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be for the intereſt of a Creature to have his ſelf-Paſſions thus ſtrong or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſo as to make this <hi>ill Balance;</hi> then it muſt be always at his own diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and not according to his intereſt, to go contrary to natural Affection, through that which we call ſelf-Love.</p>
                  <p>IF there were any of theſe ſelf-Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which for the good and happineſs of the Creature might be ſet in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to natural Affection, and deſerv'd a degree of ſtrength able to over-balance it; THE DESIRE AND LOVE OF LIFE would be the moſt likely. But it may be found perhaps that there is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59040:78"/>
no Paſſion which (by having ſo much allow'd to it) is the occaſion of more Diſorder and Miſery.</p>
                  <p>THERE is nothing more certain, or that is more univerſally conſented to and confeſs'd by every one, than this; <hi>That Life may ſometimes be even a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune and miſery;</hi> and that nothing can be more deſirable than to lay it down and withdraw from under the heavy burden. To cauſe, or any way inforce the continuance of Life in Creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to a certain extremity, is eſteem'd the greateſt Cruelty: and even there where any religious Faith forbids, as a thing heinous and ſinful, that any one ſhould be his own reliever; ſtill, if by any fortunat accident Death offers of <hi>it ſelf,</hi> it is embrac'd as highly welcom, and as a Bleſſing. And on this account the neareſt Friends and Relations often rejoice at the releaſe of one entirely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd. even tho he himſelf may have bin of ſo weak a mind as to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd Death, and endeavor'd earneſtly the prolongment of his own uneligible and wretched State.</p>
                  <p>SINCE Life therefore may frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove a Misfortune and Miſery, and that even naturally it becomes ſo by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only prolong'd till it reaches the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of old Age; and ſince there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59040:78"/>
more commonly known than the inſtances of Life overvalu'd, where, out of an eager deſire of Life, men purchaſe it at an overrate, and at ſuch a coſt as hardly any Life can be thought worth; it follows evidently, that that Paſſion or Affection <hi>of love of Life,</hi> and <hi>abhorrence or dread of Death,</hi> if it be over great and exceedingly prevalent, and over balancing in the Temper of any Creature, muſt be the means of carrying him directly againſt his own intereſt and good, and muſt make him in occaſions, ſuch as are of the laſt importance, to become the greateſt enemy to himſelf that can be, and neceſſitate him to act as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>BUT in the next place: tho it were always the intereſt and good of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by all courſes and means whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at any price or at any rate, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Life;</hi> yet according to this, it is not for the intereſt of a Creature to have this Paſſion over great: for thus it will be <hi>ineffectual,</hi> and not conducing to its end. Various inſtances need not be given: for what is there better known, than that at all times an exceſſive fear betrays to danger, inſtead of ſaving from it; and that it is impoſſible for any one to do the leaſt thing ſerviceably or well for his own preſervation, or in his own defence, when ſtrongly preſs'd with ſuch
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59040:79"/>
a Paſſion: inſomuch, that on all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Emergences, <hi>Courage</hi> is that which chiefly ſaves, whilſt <hi>Cowardice</hi> robs us of the means of ſafety, and not only deprives us of our defenſive Faculties, and hinders us from acting as we ſhould do to that end of our defence; but even runs us into the mouth of Ruin, and makes us meet that evil which we ſcarce needed to have ſhun'd?</p>
                  <p>AND now tho in neither of theſe ſenſes it could be call'd an Ill, to have the Affection of this ſort thus ſtrong and prevalent; yet the Affection it ſelf, when in this degree predominant in any one, muſt be the cauſe of Miſery, if it be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to have a thorow Cowardice, and to feel thoſe horrors that are proper to the character of one who lives under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant dread of Death. For, in a rational and reflecting Creature (to whom the thoughts and imagination of Death are continually in ſome manner or another preſented) an inherent Paſſion of this ſort muſt be the occaſion of the greateſt Agonies and Torments, ſuch as muſt enter at all times into the pleaſanteſt parts of Life, ſo as to corrupt and poiſon all Enjoyment and Conſent. And thus by reaſon of this Paſſion alone, ſuch a Life as this, if inwardly and cloſely view'd, would be found to be one of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59040:79"/>
the moſt miſerable, tho attended with all other Circumſtances that ſhould in all appearance make it happy. But when we add to this the meanneſſes and baſe condeſcenſions occaſion'd by ſuch a fear of Death, and which neceſſarily follow from ſuch an eager deſire of retaining Life; when we conſider how we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas'd and ſham'd by it, when driven to actions which we cannot view but with diſlike; when the Life we thus cheriſh, is by this means grown to be of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing reflection, ſulli'd, deform'd, and forc'd by degrees into ſtill greater crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and perplexity; in this caſe I think there is no body ever ſo little ingenuous but feels that <hi>Life</hi> ſits heavily upon us, and is worn uneaſily: whilſt all that is kind and ſocial, the chief pleaſure and good of Life, is for the ſake of Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd and given up, and things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, for which nothing in Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides can make amends.</p>
                  <p>IN ſhort, Is there any thing more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable than the condition of a thorow timorous Nature, where the terror of dying is always a cloſe and preſſing Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? And what Fortune, what outward State ever ſo ſecure, can deliver from this? To what is not ſuch a one neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and driven, who lives under a more than ordinary fear of this ſort? What
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59040:80"/>
torturing and endleſs work is ſtill grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>his</hi> hands, who out of an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs to retain Life at any rate, renders it ſo much the more expos'd, as he is forc'd more and more into thoſe indirect courſes upon which ſuch a Paſſion runs him? On the other <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is there any one who will not eſteem the life of a Perſon more eaſy towards this ſubject, to be a Life capable infinitly of greater Happineſs and Enjoyment? Is not the very conſciouſneſs and feeling it ſelf of ſuch an Eaſe and Indifference as this, an infinit ſatisfaction in a world of occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? And is not the effect of it an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and heightning to our pleaſures, and to the enjoyments we take in Life; as the contrary Paſſion is by its effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the pleaſures of Life, and an allay and bitterneſs amidſt all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd of that ſort?</p>
                  <p>AND thus therefore, upon the whole, it ſeems evident, <hi>That to have that Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> DESIRE AND LOVE OF LIFE, or ABHORRENCE OF DEATH, <hi>too intenſe and beyond a certain degree, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the intereſt, good and ſafety of a Creature,</hi> and <hi>is oppoſit to the Happineſs he injoys in Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN the ſame manner as this paſſion of <hi>Fear</hi> (under a certain degree) is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſelf-preſervation, and to the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59040:80"/>
of what is deſtructive; ſo is there another Paſſion as preſervative to us, and as uſeful to our ſafety, by aſſiſting us not <hi>to fly,</hi> but to repel Injury, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Violence when offer'd. It is by this that a Creature offering an injury, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd from it, as knowing by the very ſigns which accompany this Paſſion whilſt it is riſing and gathering ſtrength, that the Injury will not go with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And it is this Paſſion which, when violence is actually us'd, aſſiſts us more effectually to ſtruggle againſt it, and adds a force to us, both in ſupporting it, and in returning it on the Inflicter. For thus, as Rage and Deſpair increaſe, a Creature grows ſtill more and more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; and being urg'd to the greateſt extremity, finds a degree of ſtrength and boldneſs unknown till then, and which had not riſen but through the height of Provocation. As to this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therefore of ANGER (for I know no other word for it) tho its immediat aim be indeed <hi>the Ill</hi> or Puniſhment only of <hi>another,</hi> and not <hi>the good of ſelf;</hi> yet it is plainly one of thoſe Paſſions (of which we are now diſcourſing) that tend to the advantage and intereſt of the ſelf-Syſtem, the Animal himſelf: ſince a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of that Paſſion (whether that degree be properly call'd Anger or no,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59040:81"/>
it matters not) is moſt certainly requiſit in the Creature for his performance even of the better ſort of moral Actions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tending to the good of Society, or to his own preſervation and defence. For, who can reſolutely enough divide from, or reſiſt ill and deteſtable men; or who can fight either ſingly againſt a privat enemy, or for the public againſt a public one, without feeling in ſome meaſure, and being <hi>arm'd</hi> as it were with a certain degree of this Paſſion? But, on the other ſide, there is hardly any need that we ſhould explain how miſchievous and deſtructive Anger is, if it be what we commonly mean by that word; if it be ſuch as denominates <hi>an angry Temper,</hi> and be either haſty, raſh, and violent in the inſtant of provocation only; or if it be of that kind which imprints it ſelf deeply, and for a long ſeaſon, and cauſes Revenge, and a vindicative Bent and Reſolution. What can be a ſorer or deeper wound, a cloſer grief, or more ſenſible miſery, than to be agitated by this fierce Paſſion, and carry this ſting within? And what wonder is it that ſo much is done out of Revenge, and in the fury of Anger, when the relief and ſatisfaction found in that indulgence is really the aſſwaging of the moſt tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Grief and preſſing ſenſation of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59040:81"/>
Miſery; which being remov'd, or for a while alleviated or abated, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the Deſire in the ill of another, leaves behind it (as a rack new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quitted) the perception of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Comfort, and an overflowing of ſoft and pleaſing Senſation? From hence are thoſe untoward delights of perverſneſs, and of an habitual froward, envenom'd and malignant Diſpoſition acting at its liberty: for this is <hi>a perpetual aſſwaging of Anger perpetually kindled, and always renewing;</hi> which is the ſame as to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually ſtung, and ſtill curing of the Sore. Thus a thorow home Revenge being rais'd once to a high pitch, reſts not till it attains its end; and that attain'd, is eaſy and repoſes: making the ſucceeding Eaſe and Relief to be by ſo much more enjoy'd as the preceding Anguiſh and incumbent Pain was of long duration, and of bittereſt impatience. And certainly if amongſt Lovers, and in the language of Gallantry, the ſucceſs of ardent Love is call'd the <hi>aſſwaging of a Pain;</hi> this muſt be by far yet, more juſtly term'd ſo. And ſurely, however pleaſing that other pain may be ſaid to be, <hi>this</hi> can be <hi>no pleaſing</hi> one, nor can be any other than ſound and thorow wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, a grating and diſguſtful feeling, without the leaſt mixture of any thing ſoft or flattering.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:59040:82"/>TO ſpeak any further of this Paſſion of Anger; to ſhew the ill effects of it as to our Selves, our Minds and Bodies, our Condition, and Circumſtances of Life with thoſe around us; or to ſhew on the other ſide, the good effects as well as happy feeling of a mild condeſcending Temper, eaſy of contentment, ſuch as not eaſily takes offence, and eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives; to ſhew how much this is ſutable to Intereſt, to Health and Contentment, to eaſy and pleaſant Living; and how much the contrary is embroiling, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, expoſing, and of perpetual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance, inconvenience and misfortune, would be I imagin needleſs. What has bin ſaid, may be enough to make this be underſtood, <hi>That to be ſubject to ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Anger of any kind, as we have bin mentioning, is to ſuffer under a worſe ſort of Diſeaſe, and to be ſubject to no ſmall Miſery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WE are now to ſpeak concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſelf-Paſſions that are of the Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Creature, as <hi>love</hi> or appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to Nouriſhment; <hi>love</hi> of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for thoſe Conveniences by which we are well provided for and maintain'd; love and deſire of Reputation, Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Power of ſome kind, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our Welfare, good Eſtabliſhment and Condition of living. Now theſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59040:82"/>
affections of Deſire or Appetite towards what is ſelf-advantageous, and of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good, if they are <hi>moderate</hi> and in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bounds, are ſuch as are not blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by being any ways injurious to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Life, or a hinderance to Virtue: but being <hi>in an extreme degree,</hi> they become <hi>Luxury, Avarice, Ambition,</hi> and are known vitious and ill with reſpect to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. How it is that they are ill alſo with reſpect to the privat Perſon, and are <hi>his</hi> loſs and injury as well as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's, we may thus conſider. As firſt in that of LUXURY.</p>
                  <p>WERE it true (as has bin prov'd the contrary) that the moſt conſiderable Pleaſures were ſuch as came in by the ſenſe; and were it true alſo that theſe Pleaſures of the ſenſe lay in ſuch certain outward things capable and ſure to yield always a due and certain portion of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure according to their degree and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it would then follow, that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way to procure Happineſs would be barely to procure largely of theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to which Happineſs and Pleaſure were thus annexed; and by uſing or conſuming the moſt of theſe, make ſure of moſt enjoyment. But in what ſenſe ſoever it be that this is call'd <hi>to live,</hi> and <hi>to live faſt,</hi> as if this were to make the moſt of Life; it will hardly be found
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59040:83"/>
that the inward Faculties (ſuch as are the cauſe that any thing of pleaſure is conceiv'd) are able to keep pace with theſe outward ſupplies. And if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſpoſition and aptneſs from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be not concurring, it will be in vain that theſe Subjects are thus heap'd on, and multiply'd with eager intention and deſire. Now if thoſe inward diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (ſuch as of a Stomach towards nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment) be diſorder'd, overturn'd, and ruin'd by exceſs, then is there no longer the ſame enjoyment to be receiv'd from any thing; but all is in a manner ruin'd, and the capacity of real Pleaſure loſt, whilſt that which remains is rather a ſore and a diſeaſe: as may be obſerv'd in thoſe who have gain'd a conſtant nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeating, tho with a cravingneſs of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; or who have contracted a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, eager, and inſatiable thirſt. But how much better dos Nature, that has ſo well and eaſily provided for our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, dictate alſo and preſcribe to us for the enjoyment of it? and who by quitting Nature e'er made advancement or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd in Pleaſure? Was it ever known of any one, long us'd and accuſtom'd to an active Life, and to Exerciſe beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Health, and a kindly vigorous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, that having then experienc'd the gratefulneſs of Food, even of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59040:83"/>
kind; it ever came into his thought, upon a following change of Life and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, to compare or bring in competition the Pleaſures receiv'd from all thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies of Luxury, and of a continual ſolicited and forc'd Appetite, with thoſe former remember'd ſatisfactions of a homely and common Diet, prepar'd by chearful and wholſom Labor, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by due Abſtinence, and a ſutable kind and natural Appetite? On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, Has any thing bin more known, than the inſtances of People bred to a Life and Diet juſt the contrary, us'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to wait, but to prevent Appetite, and accuſtom'd to contend with an almoſt perpetual Society; who when by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or choice they came to fall into that other more natural courſe of Life, or but for a while (as on a journey, or a day of hunting) came to experience once the ſatisfaction had from the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Food, have afterwards with freedom own'd, that it was then that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the greateſt contentment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of that ſort, and ſuch as was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly above what aroſe from all thoſe ſtudi'd Pleaſures of variety and exceſs? It is plain, that by preſſing on and urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature thus, and by forcing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Appetite and Senſe, the keeneſs and edg of thoſe natural Senſations are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59040:84"/>
by degrees loſt: and tho by vice and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the ſame things may be ſought after with equal violence as before; tho the impatience of being without them may be greater and greater; yet the joy in having them is leſſen'd and brought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to nothing. The accompanying <hi>Palls</hi> and Nauſeautings which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intervene, are of the worſt and moſt hateful ſenſation that can be; and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is there at laſt any thing taſted whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free from ſomething of this ill reliſh and untoward feeling: So that inſtead of a conſtant and flowing delight to be reckon'd upon as belonging to this State; <hi>the State it ſelf</hi> is a perpetual Sickneſs or Infirmity, a corruption of Pleaſure, and cannot ſo much as admit of any thorow kind, natural, and agreeable ſenſation, even of the very ſort of thoſe it ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſeeks and aſpires to with ſuch ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs.</p>
                  <p>AS to the Conſequences of ſuch a pernicious greedineſs, and exceſſive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire towards Indulgence of this ſort; how fatal to the <hi>Body,</hi> and to the health and vigor of the manly Frame; how ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous by Diſeaſes, ſuch as are the moſt tormenting, and of the acuteſt pain and longeſt duration; all this needs ſcarce to be repeated: Nor how on the other ſide, the reverſe of this, <hi>a temperate
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59040:84"/>
Life,</hi> and <hi>Deſires moderated,</hi> afford every thing ſo happily contrary, by making Life ſo much more laſting, vigorous, and ſo infinitly more delightful, and of more pleaſing inward ſenſation and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feeling, proper always to that full healthineſs of a temperate State; as a contrary <hi>Torpor</hi> and heavy wearydneſs is proper to a debauch'd State, and is ſpread ſtill through the Senſes of one uſed to continual exceſs.</p>
                  <p>AS to the Conſequences <hi>with reſpect to the Mind,</hi> the difference here between Temperance and Intemperance; which of the two is the moſt thriving ſtate for the Mind, and which injurious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, is ſuperfluous to mention. Nor needs it be told, that as there is a vigor and alacrity gain'd to the Mind by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, ſo in the very <hi>practice</hi> of what is thus beneficial both to the Body and Mind, and advantageous ſo many other ways beſides, there is a peculiar Joy and Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>THE Conſequences <hi>as to Intereſt</hi> are plain enough. The miſery of ſuch a ſtate of impotence and unforbearance, whilſt it ſubjects us to the loweſt and meaneſt carriage and dependence, as well as to all profuſion, to all irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and extravagance of Conduct; the Injuries too, which even knowingly they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59040:85"/>
do themſelves, who out of an impotence of this ſort, and an impoſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, forbear not what even they themſelves declare they know to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to them; all this, and more of this nature is obvious enough. And from leſs than what has bin ſaid, it would be eaſy to conclude, <hi>That to have this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent love, this luxurious and high deſire towards the ſort of pleaſure mention'd, is to be highly inconvenienc'd and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd as to Intereſt, happineſs of Life, and enjoyment of real Pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW as to thoſe other exceſſes of the ſelf-Paſſions, ſuch as mention'd, as of regard towards the outward conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of Life (which in an extreme degree is <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> or <hi>Avarice)</hi> and that of inclination and good liking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what is of Reputation and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (of which the extreme is <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Vanity)</hi> how far the firſt of theſe A COVETING OR AVARITIOUS TEMPER is miſerable, needs not that one ſhould go about to explain. Who is there that knows not how little a Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>that</hi> is, which is agreed by all to be ſufficient for a man's ſingle uſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience? And how much may even this be reduc'd ſtill, and brought into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower compaſs, if all ſuperfluity being cut off, Temperance and a natural Life
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59040:85"/>
were follow'd with near that applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and earneſtneſs that Sumptuouſneſs and Luxury is practis'd by ſome, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di'd as an Art or Science? Now where Temperance is found thus advantageous, and the Practice as well as the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it ſo pleaſing and happy, there is little need to mention any thing of the miſeries attending thoſe covetous and eager deſires after things that have no bounds or rule, as being out of Nature, beyond which there can be no limits or moderation ſet to Deſire. For where ſhall we once ſtop when we are over this, when we are no longer contain'd within the bounds of Nature? How ſhall we any way fix or aſcertain a thing wholly unnatural and unreaſonable? Or what method or regulation ſhall we ſet to Exceſs or exorbitant Fancy, in adding Expence to Expence, or Poſſeſſion to Poſſeſſion? Hence that natural reſtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of coveting and eager Minds, in whatever ſtate or degree of Fortune they are plac'd; there being no thorow or real ſatisfaction, but a kind of natural inſatiableneſs belonging to this condition, whence it comes that Injoyment is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd: ſince it is impoſſible that there ſhould be any <hi>real enjoyment</hi> but of what is in conſequence of natural and juſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. Nor do we readily call that an
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59040:86"/>
                     <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of Wealth or of Honor, when through Covetouſneſs or Ambition, the Deſire is ſtill forwards, and reſts not as ſatisfi'd with its gains. But of this vice of Covetouſneſs, and the miſery of it (eſpecially of that ſort which is <hi>mere A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice</hi>) there is enough ſaid in the world; and in our common way of ſpeaking, <hi>a covetous</hi> and <hi>a miſerable</hi> Temper has often but one and the ſame meaning.</p>
                  <p>NEITHER is there leſs known or ſaid as to the ills of that other aſpiring Temper, and the ſelf-torments of a ſwoln PRIDE and AMBITION; which would be indeed but little felt in the World, if thoſe Paſſions were as much fought againſt and controul'd <hi>within,</hi> as they are condemn'd <hi>abroad,</hi> and own'd by every body to be unfortunat and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting. But when one conſiders the eaſe, happineſs, and the thouſand ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and ſecurities which attend a ſatisfied Temper, a free and eaſy Spirit, ſuch as can be accommodated on eaſy terms, is fitted to Society and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and can ſute it ſelf with any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable circumſtances; it will not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary any further to ſuggeſt the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and good of Moderation, and the miſchief and ſelf-injury of immoderat Deſires, and of a Mind that covets ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly Fame, Honor, Superiority, or Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:59040:86"/>THIS too is obvious in this place, that as the Deſires of this kind are rais'd and become impatient, ſo the averſions and fears of the contrary ſide grow in proportion ſtrong and violent, and the Temper more ſubject to apprehenſions from all events, and more uncapable of bearing the leaſt repulſe or ordinary loſs or diſappointment. And thus all quiet, reſt and ſecurity <hi>as to what is future,</hi> and all peace, contentedneſs and eaſe <hi>as to what is preſent,</hi> is forfeited by having Deſires of this kind, and by having Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites thus ſwelling and immoderat.</p>
                  <p>THERE is a Temper which is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſider'd as in oppoſition to theſe eager and aſpiring Aims of which we have been ſpeaking; not that it excludes the Paſſions either of Covetouſneſs or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, but that it is the hindrance of their Effects; and that by ſoothing of the Mind, and ſoftning it into an EXCES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIVE LOVE OF REST AND IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOLENCE, it makes the attempts of thoſe Paſſions to be impracticable, and renders the difficulties of their painful and laborious courſe towards Wealth and Honors to be inſuperable. Now tho an inclination towards Eaſe, a love of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate repoſe and reſt from Action, be as natural and uſeful to us as that inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we have towards Sleep; and that to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59040:87"/>
want ſuch an inclination would be in the ſame manner an Ill, as if we had not at proper times a ſtrong and preſſing incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſleep; yet notwithſtanding this, an exceſſive love of Reſt, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted hatred and averſion towards Action or Employment, muſt be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injurious, and be a diſeaſe in the Mind equal to that of a Lethargy in the Body, and no leſs deſtructive of it by keeping it in a perpetual dulneſs and <hi>in-action,</hi> than the other, by keeping it in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſlumber. How much this of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Exerciſe is neceſſary for the Body, let it be judg'd by the difference we find in the Conſtitutions that are accuſtom'd, and thoſe that are wholly ſtrangers to it; and by the different Health and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion which Labor and due Exerciſe create, in compariſon with that habit of Body which we ſee conſequent to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd ſtate of Indolence and Reſt. It is pleaſing to obſerve what eager and impatient appetite towards Exerciſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has given to Youth of all kinds, in that deſire of Play, which is no other than the inſtigation or incitement of Nature to ſuch an extraordinary motion of the Body as is at that time chiefly requiſit. Afterwards, when grown up, and no longer in their Parents but their own care; when the ſubjects of labor increaſe,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59040:87"/>
and ſelf-defence, ſelf-maintenance, ſearch of Food, and Venery, the conſequent charge of the young, and other Affairs begin to give them Imployment in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance; then is Eaſe and Quiet more injoy'd, and love of Reſt increas'd, as Toil and Buſineſs increaſe, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and eagerneſs of Youth abates. But where through a corruption of Nature, Sloth and Lazineſs is ingendred: where it is contracted as a Habit that ſlackens and enervates the Mind, and infeebles, and as it were diſſolves the Body; it is not only ruinous of the body's Health, and deſtructive in the end, <hi>or by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; but the immediate feeling</hi> of it, and the ſenſation it ſelf becomes no other than a lingring, drooping Pain and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Oppreſſion: it being impoſſible this way ever to feel (as thoſe who live naturally) either the ſprightly joy of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and manly Exerciſe, or the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Refreſhment, and the Pleaſures of a natural and wholſom Reſt after due Labor and Imployment. So that in the room of the Pleaſures of a double kind that are thus parted with, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing gain'd but a dull and heavy feeling more weighty and tireſom than any La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor whatſoever; a ſort of languiſhing Diſeaſe prejudicial to all other enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a vigorous and healthy Senſe,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59040:88"/>
and injurious both to the Body and to the Mind: in which latter it is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of worſe diſturbance, and of a more immediate ſpreading Corruption; for however the Body may hold out, it is impoſſible that the Mind in which the Diſtemper is ſeated, can eſcape without an immediate Affliction and Diſorder. The Habit begets a tediouſneſs and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety which infects the whole Temper, and is the occaſion of converting this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Reſt into an unhappy ſort of activity, ſuch as that of vexatiouſneſs, ill humor, and a preying active Spleen. And in the ſame manner as in the Body, where no Labor or natural Exerciſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us'd, the Spirits that want their due imployment prey upon the Body, and find work for themſelves in a deſtructive way; ſo in a Mind unexercis'd, and which languiſhes and faints for want of due action, the Paſſions which ſhould have an equal and apt Imployment, and be taken up in a ſettled Application to ſome ſit work and buſineſs in Life, being thus cut off from their courſe of action, find work themſelves, and turning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, raiſe diſquiet in the Mind, and an eagerneſs and irritation in the Temper, which becomes looſen'd towards Paſſion, is render'd more impotent, more inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Moderation, and like prepar'd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59040:88"/>
fuel, is made apt to take fire by the leaſt ſpark. Thus therefore by reaſon of the injuries that this Habit brings both to the Body and to the Mind, and to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and real Eaſe of both; it is plain, <hi>That to have this overgreat inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Reſt, this ſlothful, ſoft or effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Temper, averſe to Labor and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to have an unavoidable miſchief and attendent plague.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AS to <hi>Intereſt,</hi> how far it is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, how wretched that ſtate is, which by this habit a man is placed in towards all the circumſtances and affairs of Life, when at any time he is call'd to action; how ſubjected he muſt be to all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences wanting to himſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the aſſiſtance of others; whilſt being unfit for all offices and duties of Society, he yet of any other perſon moſt needs the help of <hi>Society,</hi> as being leaſt able to aſſiſt or ſupport <hi>himſelf;</hi> all this is obvious, and need not to be explained.</p>
                  <p>THERE remains ſtill one Paſſion more to ſpeak of, which yet we can ſcarcely call <hi>a ſelf-paſſion,</hi> ſince the ſole end of it is the good and advantage of the Kind. But whereas all other ſocial or natural Affections are join'd <hi>only</hi> with a mental Pleaſure, and ſounded in a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Love <hi>only;</hi> this has more added to it, and is join'd with a pleaſure of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59040:89"/>
Senſe, and a neceſſity in ſome degree of indulging the Appetite which is towards it, for the eaſe and welfare of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And tho the neceſſity be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute here, as in the caſes of eating, drinking, reſt and ſleep; yet to abſtain wholly from the uſe of VENERY (which is <hi>that</hi> we are ſpeaking of) can hardly be without the ſufferance of the Body in ſome degree: nor can the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Conſtitution be abſolutely avoided, without the aſſiſtance of Art, and a method and rule of Living, as is obſervable even in the Female Sex; where notwithſtanding the toil and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance of breeding and bearing the young, the natural conſequences are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſe to the Conſtitution from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing totally witheld, and never ſerving to that uſe and deſign of Nature, tho through ſo much Labor and Fatigue. Such concern, therefore, and care has Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhewn for the ſupport and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the ſeveral Species, that by an Indigence and a kind of Neceſſity which we are thus caſt in, it is made an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Self-intereſt to us, with reſpect to our bodily ſtate, to work towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of our Kind. The Paſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which carries us to this ſervice and good to our Species, is made as it were <hi>a Self-paſſion,</hi> and is accompanied not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59040:89"/>
with an affection of kindneſs and love towards the Female, but with a deſire of ſelf-eaſe, and towards what is of uſe to the privat animal Nature, and a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and indulgence of Senſe.</p>
                  <p>NOW whether or no it be the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and good of the Animal to have this indigence and need beyond a natural and ordinary degree, and to have this Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite towards Venery more eager, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and more extended than of courſe it uſually is in Nature, where no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional incitement or provocation is uſed; this is what we may conſider.</p>
                  <p>HAVING ſaid already ſo much concerning <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>unnatural Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite</hi> above, there needs leſs to be ſaid in this place. If it be allow'd that to all other Pleaſures there is a meaſure of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite belonging, which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded but with prejudice to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even in his very capacity of enjoying Pleaſure: and if to have either a ravenous Appetite, ſuch as is a Diſeaſe, and has a peculiar name; or to have that other ſort of exorbitant Appetite (no leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call'd <hi>a Diſeaſe</hi>) which we ſee in the Luxurious, be both of them unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and of prejudice even to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry right enjoyment of the Pleaſures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from thoſe Senſes, it will hardly be thought that there is no limit, bound,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59040:90"/>
or certain meaſure of this other Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite towards Venery: as if this were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of Nature, and might extend to Infinite, and ſtill be the occaſion of greater and greater Pleaſure; which is too great an abſurdity to go about to confute. There are other ſorts of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Senſations and eager Incitements of Fleſh, which we accidentally ſometimes experience in our ſelves, and which are acceptable perhaps whilſt in a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; but which as they increaſe, grow intolerable. Even Laughter provok'd by Titillation, grows an exceſſive pain, tho it retains ſtill in a great degree the ſame features of delight and pleaſure. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho in the caſe of that particular kind of Itch which belongs to a Diſtemper that has its name from that effect, there are ſome found ſo ſenſually inclin'd, that they eſteem the continual allaying of that Ardor, however eager and fierce, to be acceptable and delightful, yet it would hardly be reputed ſo amongſt the more refin'd ſort, even of thoſe who make ſenſual Pleaſure a ſtudy. Now if there be a certain height, a certain pitch or degree of <hi>the other Ardor,</hi> which by being further advanc'd, is ſo much leſs conſiſtent with the pleaſure of that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and is rather a ſort of rage and ſury (like that which is rais'd by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59040:90"/>
poiſonous Medicaments and Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Luſt;) and ſince there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſtopping <hi>ſomewhere,</hi> and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Boundary, where can that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be done but where regard is had to Nature, beyond which there is no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or rule of things? Now Nature may be known from that which we ſee of the natural ſtate of Creatures, and of Man, when unprejudiced by unnatural provocation and youthful incitements of a vicious Education. Where it happens that we ſee any one bred to a natural Life, inured to honeſt induſtry and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and unaccuſtom'd to any thing immoderate or intemperate; it appears al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that ſuch a one as this, when at full age, has his deſires and inclinations of this ſort at command, and no ways enflam'd, till by force upon himſelf, and by giving into debauch and exceſs, he ſtrains and widens his Appetite to a new and unnatural degree. But if ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes are never us'd, the Deſires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves in their juſt limits. But when we reflect upon what is cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to almoſt all the Youth of human kind, eſpecially of thoſe who are above the laboring ſort, and at what early years they are familiariz'd to the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of this Paſſion; when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider to what Obſcenities the ears of our
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59040:91"/>
Youth are accuſtom'd; how their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are vitiated, and every day fed; and what practices are us'd to urge and precipitate Nature; we need not find it ſtrange that men are ſo corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their Appetites ſo exaſperated and enflam'd to ſuch a degree beyond all natural temperature. All other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world are for their orderli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this, a reproach to Man; ſince they, of what kind ſoever they are, have regular and proportion'd Appetites, and have the uſe of Venery according to fit and proper Seaſons and Subjects; whilſt Man alone knows neither ſeaſon, nor bound, nor fitneſs of Subject, but breaks into all horridneſs of unnatural and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Luſts, regarding neither Sex nor Species (tho of this latter the Inſtances are leſs common:) and all this through that inflammation of the Deſire and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, which, being ſwell'd beyond a natural ſize, cannot be anſwer'd by plain and natural means. So that neither ought it to be thought ſtrange, if what has bin ſaid in relation to that of Meats and Drinks, be ſaid to hold good, and be the ſame in this: and that altho ſuch an abandon'd indulgence as this is ſure to bring a greater indigence and need on the Body, and fix a greater luſt and craving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the mind; yet this is ſo far from
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59040:91"/>
reſembling natural Appetite (which by being greater, is the occaſion ſtill of greater Pleaſure) that the more theſe exceſſive Deſires are thus encreas'd, and the unnatural Appetite fomented, the leſs is there of a real pleaſant Senſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the more mixture there is of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. For thus, as we have ſhewn already, a Senſation which ſeems to hold all of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> often by a ſmall and almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible extenſion runs into <hi>Pain,</hi> and grows inſufferable. So nearly bordering and related are theſe <hi>two</hi> things, even ſo as to be almoſt confounded with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which yet are really ſo diſtinct, and in appearance ſo very contrary. But on the other ſide therefore, by due abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and more moderate uſe, the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſpoken of is much clearer, and more enjoy'd. So that were both theſe Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be compar'd, that of a virtuous Courſe which belong'd to one who liv'd a natural and regular Life, and that of a vicious Courſe which belong'd to one who was relax'd and diſſolute; there is no queſtion but it would be pronounc'd in favor of the former, without regard to Conſequences, and with reſpect only to the very pleaſure of Senſe perceiv'd from hence: For it would be found, that a Man thus ſuperior to his Appetites of this kind, had yet no leſs a ſhare of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59040:92"/>
from them in that more ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe, nor leſs pleaſurable enjoyment in the whole, than he who liv'd in a manner only in the ſervice of theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and who indulging the moſt that could be to this Senſe, and ſeeking a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſupport in it, had nothing elſe to do but to force and ſolicit Nature to the higheſt degree, and ſtruggle againſt a perpetual Satiety, and againſt the heavy and dull intervals of a ſurfeited Senſe, and of a Mind and Body unnaturally held, and as it were benum'd, and droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this impriſonment and reſtraint from other natural Action. As for the other Sex; altho there be leſs of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated feeling experienc'd perhaps in them, yet they having once abandon'd themſelves, are capable of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy and deſire of change, as being weari'd of the preſent. But it is enough to ſay of this Sex, that having once for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken modeſty, and given ſcope to their Deſire and Appetite, beyond a duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd temperat and honeſt way, they grow inſatiable and monſtrous, and fall into a ſtate which even they themſelves, till grown into it, deteſt and think horrid.</p>
                  <p>AS to the Conſequences of this Vice with reſpect to <hi>the Body</hi> (the health and conſtitution of which is ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd, and ſo often wholly deſtroy'd
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59040:92"/>
by it) there is no need to mention any thing.</p>
                  <p>THE Injuries it dos to <hi>the Mind,</hi> tho leſs notic'd, are yet in proportion much greater than thoſe which the Body ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. The prejudice to the Parts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, the wretched waſt of time, the effeminacy, ſloth, ſupineſs engender'd; the diſorder, looſneſs, and impotence of a thouſand Paſſions, through ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation and enervating of the Mind; all theſe are the effects of this Vice, and are apparent when but reflected on.</p>
                  <p>NOR is it leſs apparent how much is ſuffer'd <hi>as to Intereſt,</hi> and to what mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipli'd Inconveniences he is ſubject, who is under the power of ſuch a Paſſion as this. What irregularity of Life, and diſturbance of Affairs; what Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, War, and Contention muſt he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, who is thus addicted, and who has this temper to ſuch exceſs, as to be a Rage poſſeſſing him, and ruling his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct? What truſt or dependence is there on one of ſuch a Character and Fame? And how muſt ſuch a Perſon ſtand with reſpect to Friends, Relations, the public and general Society of Mankind, in an ordinary way of living and converſing? On the other ſide; how fair and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending is the contrary character and habit of Virtue and Continence? How
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59040:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
advantageous to all Oeconomy, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of privat and public Affairs, in all the duties and offices of Friendſhip, and of a civil Life? How promotive of Society, and conducing to all eaſe, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, commodious and happy living?</p>
                  <p>THUS have we conſider'd of thoſe which we may call <hi>ſelf-Paſſions;</hi> and what the effect is of having them beyond a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat degree; which when they once exceed, when once grown imperious and high, are the occaſion that a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is mean and low, are the ground of that which we call <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> ſo much deteſted in Creatures. Tho yet it be the misfortune of ſome men, in their way of reaſoning upon theſe Subjects, not to reckon upon ſuch Selfiſhneſs as a real ill, or a misfortune, except only ſo far as it happens to be known and mark'd, as a juſt object of peoples aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and of the contemt and hatred of mankind; not as if in it ſelf it did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any miſery or diſeaſe: whereas there can be nothing ſo miſerable in it ſelf, and ſo wretched in its Conſequence, as to be thus impotent in temper, thus maſter'd by paſſion, and to ſerve ſuch a ſlavery to things of ſuch mean and wretched de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and from the contemt of which the greateſt ſatisfaction and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enjoyment ariſes, and all generoſity and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59040:93"/>
magnanimity depends. It is by ſuch a ſlavery as this that we loſe at laſt all true Eſteem both with our ſelves and others; that we loſe all Character, Authority and Reſpect; that we diſagree and are at perpetual variance with our ſelves as we alternatly ſerve and ſubmit to theſe oppoſit Affections, ſo inconſiſtent with one another, and ſo utterly irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and it is by this that we loſe even the faculties of our Minds, which can never be ſo inlarg'd, and in ſuch a way of improvement towards Knowledg, as in conjunction with Temperance, where there is a conſtant attention and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Reaſon practiſed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd; and where, in the ſame manner as the Body by good uſe is fitted to its proper exerciſe, ſo the Mind is render'd apt and diſpos'd by right Diſciplin and Rule to its proper Exerciſes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                  <p>BUT beſides what we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd of the privat Ill and ſelf-Injury of every ſuch ſelf-Paſſion <hi>in particular;</hi> all theſe irregular and vitious Affections have this neceſſary effect <hi>in general,</hi> that they are <hi>ruinous alſo of the natural Affections,</hi> and by making them give place, by long ſuppreſſing and controling them, muſt at length ſink and deſtroy them. As in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed who is there that knows not, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59040:94"/>
is not ready to own, that a Creature who is in a way of growing every day more ſelfiſh, and of having thoſe Paſſions ſtill in a higher degree, is in a certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing way of growing more and more unnatural, unkind, unaffectionate, and more out of all friendly and ſocial Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Who knows not that by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſelfiſhneſs, and of that ſubtilty and feignedneſs of carriage which it brings along with it, the candor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of our Natures, the eaſe and freedom of our Minds muſt be forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all truſt and confidence in others, familiarity, inwardneſs, and heartineſs with others muſt be in a manner loſt; and ſuſpicions, jealouſies, hatred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſucceed, and be in the room? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a Creature us'd to Reflection, who by an ill uſe of Reaſon confirms himſelf in ſelfiſhneſs, and who in a ſettled man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is come to think it to be his good not to allay or correct, but to indulge and ſatisfy ſuch Appetites as theſe, muſt by certain conſequence induſtriouſly ſtrive to ſilence and check his natural and good Affections, thoſe that would carry him to the good of his Kind, and of Society, againſt the intereſt which he conceives he has elſewhere and in a contrary way. And this muſt work to the ſubverſion of all good Affection in him, and to the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59040:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
forming of a profligate, inhuman and ſavage Nature. Now if theſe Paſſions, beſides what other ill they are the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of, are withal the occaſion and means of deſtroying and looſening the natural Affections; then, by what has bin prov'd before, they muſt be the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain means of loſing us the chief and beſt enjoyment of Life, and conſequently too (as has bin prov'd) of making us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur thoſe horrid and unnatural Paſſions, and that ſavageneſs of Temper which makes the greateſt of Miſeries and the moſt wretched State, as we are going in this next place to make appear.</p>
                  <p>SO that we have ſeen thus, how that by a wrong <hi>balance</hi> in the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this ſort, and BY HAVING THESE SELF-AFFECTIONS TOO INTENSE OR STRONG, A CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE IS MISERABLE.</p>
                  <p>III. THE Paſſions that are now left to ſpeak of, are thoſe that carry nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a public nor a privat good, and are founded neither in any advantage to the Species nor to the Self-ſyſtem: for were there no ſuch Paſſions as theſe, what then could be the meaning of THAT UNNATURAL AND BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAROUS DELIGHT IN BEHOLD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING TORMENTS, and in viewing thoſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59040:95"/>
ſpectacles of Horror with that ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and joy which is ſometimes known, and which has bin the reigning Paſſion of many Tyrants, and barbarous Nations? To ſee the ſufferance of an Enemy with cruel delight, may be from the height of Anger, Revenge, Fear, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Self-paſſions: but to delight in the torture and pain of other Creatures indifferently, of Slaves, of ſuch as are unknown; to feed upon Death and dying Agonies; this has nothing in it account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the way we have bin ſpeaking, but is wholly unnatural, as being of a kind of which not the leaſt degree can be ſaid to aim at, or tend to the good or intereſt of the particular Creature, and much leſs of the Species, or of Society.</p>
                  <p>THERE is another Affection near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related to this, which is a gay and frolicſom Delight in what is injurious to others; a ſort of WANTON MIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHIEVOUSNESS and Pleaſure in what is deſtructive; a Paſſion which inſtead of being reſtrain'd, is uſually incourag'd in Children: ſo that it is no wonder if the effects of it are very unfortunatly felt in the World. For I think it will be hard for any one to give a reaſon why the ſame Temper that was wont to delight in diſorder and ravage when in a Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, ſhould not afterwards find delight
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59040:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in other diſturbances and imbroils, and be the author of as much miſchief in privat Families, amongſt Friends, and in the Public. But of this Paſſion there is no foundation in Nature according to that ſenſe above explain'd.</p>
                  <p>MALICE or ILL-WILL, ſuch as is grounded on no ſelf-conſideration, and where there is no ſubject of Anger or Jealouſy, nor nothing to provoke or cauſe ſuch a deſire of doing ill to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this alſo is of that kind of Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>ENVY too, when it is ſuch as ariſes from the Proſperity or Happineſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creature no ways interfering with ours, is alſo of this kind of Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>THERE is alſo amongſt theſe, a ſort of HATRED OF MANKIND AND SOCIETY; a Paſſion which has bin known perfectly reigning in ſome men, and has had a peculiar <note n="*" place="margin">Miſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropia.</note> name given it.</p>
                  <p>WE may add likewiſe to the number of theſe, all thoſe Paſſions which are rais'd from SUPERSTITION (as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd before) and from the cuſtom and uſage of barbarous Countries; all which are too horrid and odious in themſelves to need any proof of their being miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>THERE might be other Paſſions nam'd, as that of BESTIALITY, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59040:96"/>
of another ſort of perverſion of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Appetite within our own Species; which are both of them in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unnatural: of the misfortune of which depravity of Appetite we need not ſpeak, after what has bin already ſaid on that ſubject.</p>
                  <p>SUCH as theſe are the only Paſſions we can ſtrictly call <hi>unnatural,</hi> tho there are others which are indeed ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the common bent of any Self-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that tho they may have their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation thence, and be deriv'd from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of thoſe combin'd; yet they ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all ordinary Appetite of that kind, and are ſo directly oppoſit to all natural Affection, that they are called and may be reckon'd <hi>unnatural</hi> and monſtrous: for inſtance, ſuch an ENORMOUS PRIDE or AMBITION, as that which would willingly leave nothing eminent, nothing free, nothing proſperous in the World beſides; ſuch an ANGER as would ſacrifice every thing to it ſelf; ſuch a REVENGE as is never to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd, nor ever ſatisfied but with the greateſt Cruelties; ſuch an INVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERACY and RANCOR as ſeeks, as it were, occaſion to exert it ſelf, and lays hold of the leaſt ſubject, ſo as often to make the weight of that malevolent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion fall even upon thoſe who are mere
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59040:96"/>
objects of Pity and Compaſſion. Theſe are in that other ſenſe <hi>unnatural:</hi> and of theſe therefore we may ſpeak in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with thoſe others, ſince they are ſuch as join with thoſe to make up that horrid and monſtrous State above deſcrib'd.</p>
                  <p>IT may be ſaid here, that theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, unnatural as they are, carry ſtill a ſort of pleaſure with them; and that however barbarous a Pleaſure it be, yet ſtill it is a pleaſure and ſatisfaction which is found in that of Pride, of Tyranny, of Revenge, of Malice, or of Cruelty exerted. Now if it be poſſible in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that any one can feel a barbarous or malitious Joy of this ſort but as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the perfecteſt of Tortures (that of a rancorous and malignant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) then may this perhaps be call'd Pleaſure and Enjoyment, like thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Body which depend ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome preceding uneaſineſs. But if to love, and to be kind, to have natural Affection, Complacency, Good-will, be in its own nature Happineſs; and be as it were <hi>original Joy and Delight,</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on no preceding pain or uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs perceptible, and as operating to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Joy only; and that on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, Hatred, Animoſity and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, be always <hi>original Miſery and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,</hi>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:59040:97"/>
always operating to Ill, and never producing any ſatisfaction, but as that Torture and Inflammation is as it were cool'd and reſpited by ſomething that looks like ſucceſs in the fulfilling of the horrid deſire and monſtrous Appetite at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this Affection; then is the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Delight improperly call'd Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or Pleaſure; or if it muſt be call'd ſo, it is of the ſame nature in the Mind, as that pleaſure in the Body which (as we had occaſion to ſay before) is owing to Racks, Wheels, and other engins of Torture, or to the acuteſt Diſeaſes which admit of ſudden intervals. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtrong therefore theſe Pleaſures may be ſaid to be, they do but the more imply the miſery of that State which produces them. For as the cruelleſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily pains do by intervals of Aſſwage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, produce the higheſt of that ſort of bodily Pleaſure thence rais'd; ſo the fierceſt and moſt raging torments of this ſort in a Mind, are thoſe which by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moments of Relief, afford the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of thoſe ſeeming mental Injoyments. If thoſe who know but little of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward diſpoſition, and who are moſt eaſy in their Temper, find themſelves however but too ſenſible of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to them in a way of Diſgrace or Injury; if even theſe better Tempers
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59040:97"/>
are acquainted with the heavy diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances which ſmall occaſions are apt to give; if they know the weighty preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of an ill Humor (tho ſuch as comes but ſeldom) and the ill moments that are paſſed when the Temper is thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, fretted, or ever ſo little gall'd or diſeas'd; if this be in reality ſo great a ſore, and ſo great a part of thorow Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; after what rate then muſt <hi>they</hi> be miſerable who hardly know any better hours in Life, and who for the moſt part are agitated by a more active Spleen, a cloſer, bitterer Malignancy and paſſion of Hatred? How lively muſt be the ſenſe of every thwarting and controling Accident? How great muſt be the ſhocks of Diſappointment, the ſtings of Affront, the gripes and gnawings of a working Antipathy and ſtrong Hatred, at either the <hi>real</hi> or <hi>fancied</hi> preſence of the Objects that give offence? Nor can it therefore be wondred at, if to ſuch Perſons as theſe who are thus oppreſſed, thus agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and wrought, it ſeems a high and exquiſit Delight to appeaſe and allay for the while theſe furious and rough Motions, by an indulgence of their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Miſchief and Revenge.</p>
                  <p>BUT now are we come to that which is eaſieſt of proof, that which indeed ſcarce needs an Explanation; for who is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59040:98"/>
there but knows that to hate, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, to be enrag'd, to carry Bitterneſs and Malice, is to <hi>ſuffer?</hi> This it is which we properly call <hi>Diſpleaſure;</hi> and to conceive Hatred or Diſpleaſure, is all one as to conceive Pain, Anxiety, Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Whoſoever has ill meaning, and an inclination or appetite to do hurt, it is through hatred thus conceiv'd, and through brooding paſſions of this ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kind. Now whoever hates, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is angry, or feels rancor, is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, diſtreſs'd, aggriev'd; this cannot be otherwiſe in its own nature. So that whoever has ill will, and is carried to the injury, harm or ſufferance of others, ſuffers within himſelf, and carries a wound within: and where the Paſſions of this horrid kind are deeply infixt, there the Heart is ulcerated, the Wound kept open and not cured; and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rideſt of Tortures are thus made perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
                  <p>NOW as to one who has in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner loſt all what we call <hi>Nature,</hi> and who has theſe horrid Affections; how ſuch a one as this muſt ſtand towards the Society of Mankind, and how he feels himſelf in it, as conſcious of his Affections towards others, and of what the Affections of others muſt be towards him, this is eaſily conceiv'd. What en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59040:98"/>
or what reſt is there for him who is not conſcious of the merited Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or Love of any human Soul; but on the contrary is conſcious of merited Hatred, not only from every fellow-Creature, but from every thing in the univerſal Nature? What ground of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and deſpair? what foundation of fear and continual apprehenſion from Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and from ſuperior Powers, when ever any ſuch are credited, or but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected? How thorow and deep muſt that Melancholy be, where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſoftning or pleaſing from the ſide of Friendſhip to allay or divert it when once riſen; no flattering view or proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of that chearful and reviving ſort, not ſo much as from the fancy or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of kindneſs or affection from any part; but where every thing around is gaſtly and horrid, every thing in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance hoſtile, and, as it were, <hi>bent</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a privat and ſingle being, who is divided from, and at war with the reſt of Nature, in a diſagreement and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with every thing, and with the Order and Government of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe? 'Tis thus at laſt that a Mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Wilderneſs where all is laid waſte, every thing fair and goodly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, and nothing extant but what is diſmal and horrid. Now if any thing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59040:99"/>
that but looks like deſert, or that feels like baniſhment or expulſion from human Commerce, be ſo heavy to bear; what muſt it be to be thus eſtranged from Mankind, and to be after this manner in a Deſert, and in the horrideſt of Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, even when in the midſt of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and to live with Mankind as with a foren Species, and as with thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are moſt remote from Man, and ſuch as he has the moſt cauſe to fear? Were we to form a Hell in our Imaginations, we could by nothing ſo well repreſent it, as by thoſe Terrors, Deſpondences, and Horrors which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this dark ſtate of a Mind revolted from Nature, in no concord or unity with any thing, but every way deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; viewing its own deformity and diſagreement; and as conſcious of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ill merit, ſo conſcious of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally merited hatred, and puniſhment accordingly due, and ever to be expected from every hand.</p>
                  <p>AND thus therefore it appears that the greateſt of Miſeries is <hi>that State</hi> which is conſequent to the loſs of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affection; and THAT TO HAVE THOSE HORRID, MONSTROUS, AND UNNATURAL AFFECTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS, IS TO BE MISERABLE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE.</p>

                  <p>THUS have we endeavour'd to prove what was propos'd in the beginning. And ſince in the common underſtood ſenſe of Vice and Illneſs, no one can be vicious or ill, but either,</p>
                  <p>1. BY the deficiency or weakneſs of natural Affections;</p>
                  <p>2. OR by the violence of ſelfiſh ones;</p>
                  <p>3. OR by having thoſe unnatural ones that carry to no end either in the privat or public Syſtem:</p>
                  <p>IT muſt follow that if each of theſe are pernicious and deſtructive to the Creature, inſomuch that his completeſt ſtate of Miſery is made from hence; TO BE ILL OR VITIOUS, IS, AND MUST BE EVER, TO BE MISERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE AND UNHAPPY.</p>
                  <p>AND ſince every vitious Action muſt more or leſs in proportion help towards this Miſchief and Self-ill, it muſt follow, THAT EVERY VITIOUS ACTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON MUST BE OF SELF-ILL, AND NEVER BUT BE TO THE INJURY AND SUFFERANCE OF THE CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE.</p>
                  <p>FOR, whatſoever is committed or done, that either goes immediatly <hi>to the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59040:100"/>
impairing of the unnatural Affections;</hi> or <hi>to the promoting of the unnatural ones;</hi> or <hi>to the widening and extending of the ſelf-Paſſions,</hi> by an encouragement of thoſe Luſts which overturn all order of Life, and are as much enemies to the eaſe and pleaſure of the Body, as to that of the Mind; this muſt ever be eſteemed inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and againſt the greateſt Intereſt which a Creature can poſſibly have. For how can there be an indulgence of thoſe irregular Appetites, without a greater inflammation of them? And how can ſuch an Inflammation work, but to the diſorder of the Soul, and to the corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſound and natural Enjoyment, <hi>even in a way of Senſe,</hi> as well as to the corruption of the Affections, the diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Temper, and the diſtortion, rack and miſery of the Mind? Which way therefore can it be ſaid, that any one <hi>thorow ſelf-Intereſt</hi> can act either viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly or unſociably; ſince to do any thing through an imagination of ſelf-Intereſt or Pleaſure, that is contrary to natural or ſocial Affection, or out of the juſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of natural Appetite and ſelf-Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is and muſt be of ſelf-Injury, to that degree as has bin ſhewn?</p>
                  <p>THUS have we computed, in the beſt manner we were able, the Good and Intereſt of Mankind, by enumerating
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59040:100"/>
and caſting up all thoſe Particulars from whence, as by way of Addition or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, that Sum or general Account of Man's Intereſt or Happineſs in Life, is either ſwell'd or diminiſh'd: ſo that the method here taken may perhaps for this reaſon be call'd a ſort of <hi>Moral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetic,</hi> and be ſaid to have an evidence as great as may be found in Numbers, and equal to Mathematical Demonſtration. For it ſeems to us, that there has not bin any degree of certainty wanting in what has bin ſaid concerning the preferable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the mental Pleaſures to ſenſual; and even of the ſenſual ones accompani'd with good Affection, and under a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and right uſe, to thoſe ſenſual ones that are no ways reſtrain'd, and are ſupported by nothing ſocial or affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. Nor is that (as we conceive) leſs juſt and real, which has bin ſaid of the united Structure and Fabric of the Mind, and of thoſe Paſſions which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Temper or Soul, and on which its happineſs or miſery ſo immediatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. It has bin ſhewn, that in this Conſtitution the impairing of any one part muſt go to the diſorder and ruin of other parts, and of the whole, through the neceſſary <hi>connexion</hi> and <hi>balance</hi> of the Affections; that thoſe very Paſſions through which men are vitious, are of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59040:101"/>
themſelves a Torment and Diſeaſe; and that whatſoever is done that is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>ill,</hi> muſt be of ill conſciouſneſs, and muſt in proportion, as the Act is ill, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and corrupt ſocial Affection and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, and deſtroy both the capacity of kind Affection, and the conſciouſneſs of meriting any ſuch: ſo that neither can we in a manner participate thus in Joy or Happineſs with others, or receive ſatisfaction from the expreſſed kindneſs and love of others; on which however the greateſt of all our Pleaſures are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If this be ſo, and that the ſtate which is conſequent to this defection, and which immediatly ſucceeds to the loſs or ruin of natural Affection and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, be a ſtate of all others the moſt horrid, oppreſſive, and miſerable; then it will appear, <hi>that to yield or conſent to any thing ill or immoral, is a breach of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and leads to the greateſt Ills:</hi> And that on the other ſide, <hi>Every thing that is an improvement of Virtue, and that is eſtabliſhing to right Affection and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is an advancement of Intereſt, and leads to the greateſt and moſt ſolid happineſs and enjoyment of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THUS the Wiſdom of what rules, and is FIRST and CHIEF <hi>in Nature,</hi> has made it to be according to the <hi>privat Intereſt and Good</hi> of every Creature, to work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59040:101"/>
the <hi>general Good;</hi> which if that Creature ceaſes to promote, and to be uſeful to, he in ſo far ceaſes to be kind and uſeful to himſelf, and is his own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, as being no longer good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf than whilſt he is ſuch as to be good alſo to Society, and to that <hi>whole</hi> of which he is <hi>a part.</hi> So that VIRTUE, which of all Excellences and Beauties is the chiefeſt and moſt amiable; <hi>that</hi> which is the Prop and Ornament of human Affairs, which upholds Societies, maintains Union, Friendſhip and Correſpondence amongſt men; <hi>that</hi> by which Countries, as well as privat Families, flouriſh and are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; and for want of which every thing comly, conſpicuous, great, and worthy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Mankind, muſt periſh and go to ruin; <hi>that ſingle Quality,</hi> thus glorious in its effects, and of this good to all Society, and to Mankind <hi>in general,</hi> is, after this manner, equally a Happineſs and a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to each Creature in <hi>particular</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing it, and is <hi>that</hi> by which alone Man can be happy, and without which he can never but be miſerable.</p>
                  <p>AND THUS VIRTUE IS THE GOOD, AND VICE THE ILL OF EVERY ONE.</p>
