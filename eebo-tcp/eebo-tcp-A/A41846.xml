         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS the name of the precious
Author (who now enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what he then aspired
to, when he preached these
following Sermons) will, no doubt,
ingratiat them to thee, so we are
perswaded, that the divine Subjects
here treated upon, when perused by
thee, whose serious design is to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="tcp:65886:4"/>
and aspire to what is here pressed,
may not only prove effectual to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
thy esteem of the worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and thy respects to his Works;
but also may highly advance thy soul,
in thy begun work of mortification
of sin, of dying to the world, and of
having the world crucified to thee,
that so thou may possess thy soul in
patience, and sit down as a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one, in every state whatsoever,
good or bad, letting patience have
its perfect work. O! how timely hath
the Lord begun with the blessed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
to make him not only acquainted
in his own experience as a Scholar,
with the hardest lessons of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
but also to make him a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Preacher of the spiritual and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
method of learning these so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricat
lessons, and of the advantages
of studying, or disadvantages by
the neglect of the study of them.
<pb facs="tcp:65886:4"/>
This we dare say, that in perusing of
them, thou shalt find him a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who (if he were alive) needed
not to be ashamed, nor affraid of thy
censure, if thou be a real student
in these spiritual duties thy self.
For these two or three things (as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
perfections in a youth) are most
remarkable in him. First, that from
the speculations and metaphysical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
of Schools, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly,
as it were, rapt, not only
into the contemplation, but also soul
experiencing and powerful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the most mysterious points of
Christian profession and practice.
Secondly, that in the handling of
these mysteries, he was free of all
youthly vanity and affectation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
literature, (though he had
more then common abilities therein)
<hi>and having renounced the hidden
things of dishonesty, not walking
<pb facs="tcp:65886:5"/>
in crafinesse, nor handling the word
of God deceitfully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he preached
the Word of God, not as the word
of man, but as the Word of God,
commending himself to every mans
conscience in the sight of God.</hi>
Thirdly, that he was gifted of God
with such plainnesse of speech, and
with such an open door of utterance,
in delivering these mysteries, that
he did out stripe and over-reach ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those who entered into the Lords
Vineyard long before him, the <hi>Lord</hi>
verifying that in him which is,
2 <hi>Cor. 3. 17. Where the Spirit of
the Lord is, there is liberty.</hi> All
which singularities and eminencies
of a spiritual Preacher, to have been
his special mercy from the Lord, to
fit him to be eminently a burning
and shining light, for the space of
about two years in our Western cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
is manifest from what of his
<pb facs="tcp:65886:5"/>
Works have already come forth to the
view of the world, and doth now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appear by these excellent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Sermons, upon these two most
necessary, but little studied and lesse
practised points of Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<hi>viz. Mortification of lusts,</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual Contentment,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heretofore Printed. Wherein
the zealous servant of God endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
to awaken this secure gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
unto the study of these so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and necessary duties, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before us the necessity of these
duties, and the advantages attending
the study of them, and the prejudices
and disadvantages accompanying the
neglecters of the saids duties: As
also, to encourage and strengthen in
the way, all such as have begun the
spiritual conflict against sin, and are
aiming at perfection in the study of
spiritual contentment. He not only
<pb facs="tcp:65886:6"/>
presseth the duties, but also pointeth
out the right means whereby a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may be helped to attain at last,
victory over his lusts, and to sit down
contentedly with <hi>Jonah</hi> under
the shadow of his Gourd, <hi>Jon.</hi> 3. 6.
And be satisfied with <hi>Elijah</hi> to hide
himself by the brook <hi>Cherith,</hi> and to
drink of the brook, and to have the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
to feed him there, <hi>I King.</hi> 17.
3, 4. And to say with <hi>David</hi> in an
universal resignation of himself to
the will of God, 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 26.
Behold, here am I, let him do to
me as seemeth good unto him:</hi> And
withall thou shalt find intermixed,
soul-reviving and comforting reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
of the most pressing soul-exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
accompanying such as seriously
set about these so much soul-concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
duties, of sins mortification and
spiritual contentment under every
lot. That thou may read with that
<pb facs="tcp:65886:6"/>
same affection that the holy Author
preached, and reap the same blessing
which was with much prayer wrestled
for by him to his hearers, wherein
he was not unheard, is the earnest
prayer of his soul to God, who is</p>

of God was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down upon us, then
our blessed <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi>
in the infinite depth of
his unsearchable love
and compassion to self-destroying
sinners, cryed forth with a loud
voice, that justice might hold the hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And as that ram sacrificed for <hi>Isaac,</hi> so was
he willingly content to be <hi>caught in a thicket,</hi>
and to become a spotlesse and everlasting
sacrifice for sinners. He was content to be
bruised, that so we might passe free, and his
Fathers hand might be turned upon the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65886:8"/>
little ones. But, notwithstanding <hi>he hath
died for our sins, and risen for our righteousness,</hi>
yet hath he given to all his followers a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
warfare to accomplish, so that they
should be continually taken up in contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>against principalities and powers, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
wickednesses in high places;</hi> or, as the
words are rendered by some, we conceive
more appositely, <hi>in heavenly things.</hi> And
certainly, there is no discharge in this war,
neither any interruption while we are
on this side of Eternity: We confesse,
God might easily have served an Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
on all our spiritual enemies, that
they should no more oppose themselves
against a believer after Justification, but
<hi>He</hi> in the depth of his unsearchable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and, we may say likewise, infinit
love towards his own, hath so contrived
their way to heaven, that thorow many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
and tribulations in our spiritual
warfare, we must enter there; It is much
indeed for a Christian to die a victor after
warre, though not a triumpher; that must
come after death, and the trophies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of our victory, shall then be fully
given to us, when our feet shall stand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the gates of the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and when
we shall receive these two glorious and
everlasting badges of our victory, <hi>a crown
set upon our head,</hi> having this written upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65886:8"/>
it, <hi>It endureth for ever;</hi> A motto which
could never be engraven upon any Crown
here below; and a <hi>Palm put in our hands;</hi>
and then indeed shall we sing, as those
that divide the spoil, when we have led
captivity captive, and fitten down upon a
Throne which is established for ever. And
we conceive, much divine reflection and
holy contemplation upon that precious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of reward, and that high and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
pitch of dignity unto which
belivers and overcomers are to be advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
would make us with much cheerfulness
and alacrity undergo this spiritual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.
And yet all our triumphing is not
suspended, till our war be ended; believe
me, there is more real joy in the victory
and vanquishing of one lust, yea more
divine satisfaction, in a serious pursute and
contending with them, though with very
small successe to our apprehension, than in
the actuall enjoyment and fruition of all
thy lusts. Thou may hide sin under thy
tongue, and have it pleasant to thy taste,
yet at last it shall be as the gall of asps,
and the poison of dragons. O! put on so
much holy generosity and spiritual ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that though Satan should offer unto
thee all the Kingdoms of the world, that
thou may fall down and worship him,
thou mayest cry forth in holy zeal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65886:9"/>
                  <hi>Get the hehind me Sathan;</hi> O!
that deceitfull oratory and malitious guile
wherewith he ensnareth immortal souls,
and brings them into subjection. O! but
the depths of Satan are subtile and great;
And he is a man of understanding that can
draw them out, and not be ignorant of his
devices; and except we be helped by the
candle of the Lord that discovereth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts of the belly, to know these
mysterious subtilties of him, whose name
is <hi>A deceiver,</hi> they will remain still riddles
and mysteries to us.</p>
               <p>But since we are compassed about <hi>with
this body of death,</hi> and <hi>there is a law in our
members rebelling against the law of our minde,</hi>
we should be much in groaning for the day
of our redemption, when the lawfull cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
may be delivered, and the prey taken
from the mighty, and that blessed decree
may come forth, <hi>O prisoners of hope, go forth
and shew your selves.</hi> We are afraid that
the Christians of this generation, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
a cessation of armes, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
a treaty of peace with their lusts,
and a league not only offensive, but (shall
I adde this) even defensive; not only,
that we shall offend our lusts, but shall
defend them: and if once we have sealed
this treaty and agreement with our Idols,
what can they require more at our hands?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65886:9"/>
We conceive, we may sadly allude unto
that word, that there is not one amongst
fourty thousand in <hi>Israel,</hi> with whom
there is a spear and sheild seen in contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this holy warfare. O! can such a
delusion as this overtake you, that ye can
be an overcomer without fighting; is your
strength greater then those that have gone
before you, that you think you can accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
this war in one day, and pursue
your enemies till ye overtake and consume
them? O! when shall that day be, when
we shall be groaning forth dayly this
mournfull dittay, <hi>O wretched man that</hi> I <hi>am,
who shall deliver me from this body of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the words we conceive first, there is
a sweet and pleasant emphasis in that word
(<hi>me</hi>) speaking so much, that if infinite
power and grace were capable of any limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and there could be any bounds
fixed to it, <hi>Paul</hi> did conceive he was the
bounds and limits of infinite power and
grace; if there were an impossibility for
grace to save any sinner, it should be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for grace to have saved him who was
<hi>the chiefest of sinners, and lesse then the least
of all Saints.</hi> And if each Christian did
look upon himself as the greatest debter
to the Justice of God, his debt to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
grace of God should appear more
singular.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65886:10"/>
Secondly, we may perceive, that a
Christians happinesse, doth consist in a
sweet exchange of dominion and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Once sin doth <hi>reign in his mortal
body,</hi> and he is under the dominion of his
lusts, but then grace doth step in, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auctorats
and dethrones the former King,
and doth reign in the temple of our heart.
This is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. last, and that is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
word which is there, <hi>that grace
may reign,</hi> the word in the original doth
signifie so much, <hi>that grace may play the
King,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and this fulnesse of
graces dominion, is that, the Apostle
would be at here. And certainly, there
is no repentance of this exchange of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
There is much noise and rumour of
complaints amongst people in these dayes
of the exchange of governments, from one
species of government to another, we shall
leave these debates unto men who desire to
exercise their spirits about them: but sure
we are of this, that those who are given up
to this change, shall have it passe as most
legitimat and lawfull, by the divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
both of angels, and of the
souls of just men now made perfect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the way that <hi>Paul</hi> taketh here
to propose his complaint under the strong
prevalency of the body of death, by way of
question <hi>who shall deliver me?</hi> doth not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65886:10"/>
import any hesitation about his perswasion
of certainty, that he at last should sing a
song of triumph over his lusts; but only
that it would be among the richest and the
most singular monuments and trophies of
the victorie of <hi>Christ,</hi> to save him. <hi>Paul</hi>
did (no doubt) conceive that amongst
all the royall monuments of <hi>Christs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
that should be, as it were, hanged
about the walls of that higher and glorious
palace, <hi>Paul</hi> should be put in the highest
place, as having least merit to bring him
there, (if there could be any merit at all)
and most love and grace.</p>
               <p>Now to come more particulary to the
words, after <hi>Paul</hi> hath most divinely, set
forth that woful opposition and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that was betwixt the unrenewed part
and the renewed, and what strong domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sin had over him he doth in these words
breath out a sweet desire to be delivered,
not only from his actual corruption, but
from his original guilt, which here he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>the body of this death,</hi> not only because
corruption is a thing which may be easily
discerned and known to us, it being (so to
speak) a thing which may fall under the
object of our sight, being no spirit but a
body; but also because of these great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of corruptions that flow from that
root of original sin, it having so many
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65886:11"/>
different members and parts which are
so diversified and so compleat, that they
may make up a body, which body if it be
intertained, shall certainly bring and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
death. So when he is under the
strong convictions of his guilt, and hath
had a compleat discovery of himself, you
may see his exercise holden forth in these
words, <hi>O wretched man,</hi> the word in the
original <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifieth one that is
wearied with troublesome and continual
combats, with little apparent successe, and
this doth certainly import that he was a
man, much and continually taken up in
wrestling against his corruptions, and
endeavouring to bring them unto subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto the obedience of <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ye may see likewayes in these words,
the way that <hi>Paul</hi> took to overcome his
lusts, he was much in the exercise of
prayer; for the words that we have read
are indeed a short and pathetick prayer. I
conceive that word which is recorded in
Isa. 38. 14. <hi>O Lord, I am oppressed, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
for me,</hi> is a sweet paraphrase upon
these words.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, You may see his great and
principal suit to have been, <hi>deliverance from
this body of death:</hi> this captive exile was
hastning to be delivered, and looking out at
the windowes of his Prison-house, waiting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65886:11"/>
till the Jaylor should come and open the
doors, and take his chains and fetters from
off his feet: We confesse these shall not be
fully taken off, till we shal be passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the door of our everlasting rest, and
then that woful and sad complaint shall
take his everlasting adiew and farewell;
for if we may speak so, the burial place of
sin is before the door of our eternal rest, it
then ceaseth to be, when we begin more
eminently to have a beeing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But may we
not be ashamed and blush, that we are not
more in uttering those inexpressible sighs
and groans of the spirit, under the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our sinfulnesse, since this holy man,
who had, no doubt, attained unto a great
length in mortification, who had <hi>plucked
out many right eyes,</hi> and <hi>cut off many right
hands,</hi> and oft times returned victor after
war, was so much in groaning under his
corruption. O! but we have inverted
strangely the way to heaven! I conceive
practical Antinomianisme is an Epidemick
error in these dayes: Many think that it is
below a regenerat man to mourn, and
to sit down and lament over the body of
death; we know not what it is <hi>to make our
bed to swim with tears,</hi> and to be <hi>bedewing
the way to Zion, when our faces are thither ward;</hi>
ye conceive that it is a lesson to be practis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and learned by those in a lower classe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65886:12"/>
and those who are learning (so to speak)
the Rudiments of Christianity, and not to
be exercised by those, who are now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
unto the high classe of Christianity,
that being, (as it were in our apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
a degrading of your selves from that
pitch of perfection unto which in your
imagination you have attained: but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, it is a work not below the eldest
Christian, nor above the youngest believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and the more one be old in reality in
Religion, this work will alwayes be new
in their practice. I shall only give you
that divine counsel of a holy man, who
desired Christians to set about the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of their lusts, as though they had
never been taken up in that duty before;
each day to set about to mortifie, not as
a proficient, but as a beginner, who hath
never made any progresse in that blessed
work.</p>
               <p>Now in speaking upon <hi>Pauls</hi> exercise,
which is here holden forth, that he was
continually exercised in wrestling against
those corruptions, and that body of death
that was in him; we need not stand long
to prove that it is the duty of a Christian
to be so exercised and taken up; there is
somewhat of that implyed in that word,
<hi>Act.</hi> 24. 16. And it is more clearly pressed,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3: 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 13. and, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65886:12"/>
And, no doubt, if a Christian did reflect
more upon the nature of sin, and consider
that by it, difformity with God is increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and precious conformity with him lost;
and, did we take up sin in its wofull effects,
that it worketh death, and involveth us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the curse of <hi>a living God,</hi> we would be
more constant in this spiritual warfare.
O! but Christians thorow want of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of these, are much disinabled to
<hi>stand fast to that liherty wherewith Christ hath
made them free, and oft-times entangled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
again with the yoke of bondage:</hi> So that
I conceive if <hi>God</hi> were coming to give a
name to the Christians of this generation,
he might call us, <hi>Isfachar,</hi> because we do
now croutch down under two burdens,
and are become servants unto tribute; and
even those that are more refined and tender
in their walk in those dayes, he might call
them <hi>Reuben,</hi> because they are unstable as
water, which marreth their excellency.</p>
               <p>But that which first we shall speak to is,
how the wrestlings of a natural man
against the body of death, and those cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
that are within him, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from the wrestlings of one that
is really godly.</p>
               <p>And first we conceive, that it is without
debate and controversie, that a man altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unregenerate, by natures light may be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65886:13"/>
put on to mortifie (if so we may speak)
and contradict those sins, which are most
sensual and grosse; natures light including
an antipathy and detestation of those
things within it self; though we confesse,
thorow the depravement of our nature,
those sins, which fall under the sphere of
natures mortification, are now abridged
unto a small sum, it being not now refined
and clear, as it was when man was in the
estate of innocence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another sort may, from some
common qualification, oppose some sins,
as those that are of more heroick and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
spirits, will have detestation against
covetousnesse and other sins of that nature,
and so in some sense may endeavour the
mortification of these things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the same may a natural man
do, by such a conviction of the holy
Ghost, as is but a common work of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
he may be put on to mortifie these sins
that are more visible, and some what grosse
in their nature, as is clear from the practice
of those who cleanse the outside of the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and studies to have an outward confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
unto the law of God, notwithstanding
of that inward and secret antipathy, against
the strictnesse of his law; yea more, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
man who hath some predominant
evil, may endeavour and will atempt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65886:13"/>
to wrestle against that sin, which is in a
direct line of opposition against it; as one
that is given to that vice of covetousnesse,
he will study to mortifie that vice of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality,
those being two opposit vices.
Now from all these we may conclude, that
upon every opposition which we use
against our corruptions: it is not safe to
infer, that we are really ingaged in this
spiritual warfare; it being, we think another
thing then the most part of us do imagine
it to be: And we confesse, it is a difficulty
even to attain that length of endeavour in
mortification, which the natural man by
these things which we have spoken may
attain to. But for the difference betwixt
their debates, the first is this; that a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and unregenerat man, doth mainly
wrestle against these sins, that are outward
and more grosse, and not so much against
those sins that are inward, and falls not
under the eye of man: we do not deny
but a natural man may wrestle against
vain thoughts, and have some small oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
against the stirring of corruption
within his own bosome, but we conceive,
that there are these two secret sins which a
natural man is not at all taken up in wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
against, at least very little, <hi>viz.</hi> his
<hi>original corruption,</hi> and his <hi>unbelief;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
one that is really godly, is much taken
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65886:14"/>
up in bearing down these. <hi>Paul</hi> is here
taken up in wrestling against his original
sin; and <hi>David,</hi> Ps. 51. 5. compared with
<hi>ver.</hi> 2. and 7. is likewise taken up in wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
against it; and that good man that is
recorded in the Gospel, who cryed forth,
<hi>Lord I believe, help my unbelief,</hi> was much
taken up in wrestling against his unbelief;
and, <hi>David,</hi> Ps. 77. from the beginning to
the I0. verse and forward: and certainly,
one that never was taken up in wrestling
against these two (at least in some small
measure and degree) he may hesitate much
whether or not he was ever seriously engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this holy warfare. O! but if many
that passe under the notion of Professors
were posed, when they did enter into the
lists with original corruption, there are
many who without breach of truth might
say, they never knew what it was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
against it: And this certainly speaks
forth much of our ignorance of original
guilt; And believe me, there is more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
unto the Image of God in original
sin, then in a thousand actual outbreak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
And it is but in vain for a Christian
to attempt the mortification and cutting off
of branches, till once he study to pluck up
the root, which doth bear <hi>wormwood and
gall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:65886:14"/>
A second difference is this, a natural man
wrestleth against his corruptions, rather
because they bring him under the stroak of
the justice of God, than because they are
contrary to the holinesse of God: Hence
is it that the most part of a natural mans
wrestling is, when he is under affliction;
somewhat of which is pointed out, <hi>Ps.</hi> 78.
34, 35. Now this difference is clear in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
and <hi>Paul,</hi> who made the holinesse of
God, the great topicks and common place
whence they did produce all their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for contradicting sin, as <hi>Paul</hi> in this
Chapter, and <hi>Ioseph</hi> in that precious sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<hi>Shall I do this, and sin against God?</hi>
but <hi>Cain,</hi> who was a man cut off from the
right hand of the Lord, had another prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of contradicting and wrestling against
his lusts, <hi>My punishment is greater then I can
bear,</hi> Gen. 4. 13. And hence is it that a
natural man doth never oppose sin, as it is
a cause to interrupt fellowship and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, or from that divine
principle of Christs love constraining him:
O! but the principle of a natural man wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
against corruption, be selfish and low!
and if there were not a hell, and a place of
torment, natural men would take a latitude
to themselves not to mortifie sin. But sure
it argues a divine and heroick spirit, and
most suteable to them, <hi>who have Christ in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65886:15"/>
them their hope of glory,</hi> that though there
were neither any regard or remuneration
of their obedience, neither any punishment
of their disobedience, yet simple desire to
please God, and not to profane his holinsse
which he loveth, doth tye them to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
I may confidently say, that these
who never knew what it was to have that
threefold cord, and that precious triple
chain, binding them to obedience, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
them to mortifie their lusts, to wit,
<hi>the holinesse of God, the fear to interrupt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
and fellowship with him,</hi> and <hi>the love
of Christ,</hi> they may question whether or not
ever they were seriously engaged in this
holy warfare: But withall we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but the fear of punishment is likewise
a most divine principle of mortification,
in its own place; but except there be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
higher, it is not to build upon.</p>
               <p>The third difference is this, that a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
man studieth more to restrain sin, then
to mortifie it; for he is a man that resteth
satisfied with the restraint of the actings
of sin, though there be no mortification of
that vicious inclination which is in the
man: this is clear in <hi>Haman.</hi> Esth. 3. 5.
in <hi>Saul.</hi> 1 Sam, 24. 16, 17. and following
verses compared with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 2. and in
the Scribes and Pharisees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 25.
But, the mortification that the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65886:15"/>
quireth is of a higher nature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24.
where we are commanded <hi>to crucifie the flesh
with the affections and lusts;</hi> not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the acts, but to mortifie the habits:
we confesse it is a difficulty to determine
the difference betwixt the restraint of sin,
and mortifying of sin, and this maketh
it the more difficult, that sins which are
really mortified, sometimes a Christian may
be overtaken to commit, which I conceive
seldome or never holds of sins that are more
gross, but holds oft-times of sins that are of
a lower nature and degree. Yet, these
things may a little point forth the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
first, a Christian who hath sin mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
is filled with much divine joy and
satisfaction in the mortifying of it, which
we conceive partly doth proceed from this,
that a Christian, when he is honoured to
mortifie a lust, he ordinarily then receives
the intimation of his peace and interest in
God, in a more lively and spiritual way.
And, secondly, because at that time also
he doth receive much precious and sweet
communion with God, his soul then is in
life; somewhat of this is pointed out to
us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. and, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with vers. 25. Thirdly, the difference
may be known by this, that when a man
hath been much in the exercise of fasting
and prayer for the mortifying of such a lust
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65886:16"/>
and idol, and hath not attained to this with
great facility, there is great appearance that
upon the desisting of tentation, and the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his spirit to commit such a thing,
such a lust is mortified, and not restrained
only; there is somewhat of this pointed
forth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 20, 21. where it is said,
that power of casting out of devils goeth
not forth but by fasting and prayer. We
conceive the place is principally to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
concerning the faith of miracles,
though by proportion and analogy it may
hold of sanctifying faith: O! our lusts in
these dayes do rather go out, then are cast
out; they rather die to us then we to them.
Fourthly, the frame of spirit which we have
after mortifying of a lust, may let us see
whether it be a real work, or only some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
for a time; a man that doth attain
such a length, as really to mortifie and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
any lust, is much taken up in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of praise, <hi>Rom. 7. 25. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 55,
56, 57. he is under conviction of his duty
to blesse the Lord though he is also convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of an impossibility of blessing him as
he ought to be: but we think, when lusts
are restrained only, and not mortified, the
man is not so much taken up in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of praise. O! what heavenly Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
and Songs of praise have the Saints
penned unto the unsearchable and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65886:16"/>
grace of <hi>Christ,</hi> when they have
been enabled to overcome, and crucifie a
lust, <hi>Their souls have been enditing a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
concerning the praises of the King, their
tongue hath been as the pen of a ready writer.</hi>
And this may, lastly, point out the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
Sins that are mortified do not for
the most part presently recur so, as to obtain
victory over the Christian; we confesse,
Sathan, to weaken our confidence, may
assault us with tentations to commit that
iniquity, that so we may be brought to call
in question our real and spiritual victory
over it: but if lusts be only restrained, it
cannot be long away form obtaining vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory:
this is clear from <hi>Esth.</hi> 4, 10. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the following verses, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
from 1 <hi>Sam. 24. 16, 17. &amp;c.</hi> compared
with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26, 2.</p>
               <p>The fourth difference; a natural man is
not constant in his wrestling against his
corruptions, but takes it by fits and starts,
either when he is under affliction, or some
other sad occurrence that doth befall him,
or through some sharp and sudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of a commonly enlightened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
but he that is really taken up in
this spiritual warfare, hath a constancy in
maintaining of it, at least in his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:
this is clear from <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 16. and
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. and indeed that wofull inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65886:17"/>
that we have in this spiritual warfare
doth evidence our little real engagment
in the work. Are there not many here,
who can interrupt the warfare many
weeks, and yet not be much under either
the discovery of their losse, or under any
impression of sorrow because of it? Sure
if this were believed, that there may be
more lost in one day, than can be gained
in many, we would endeavour to be more
constant. O! but grace is a tender thing,
and we ought to keep it <hi>as the apple of our
eye.</hi> Alace, there are but too many, who
slacken their endeavour against sin, and
will ly idle many dayes, and yet are ready
to think, that when they please, they can
shake themselves of their lusts as at other
times; but to these we shall only say this,
beware lest that dispensation once meet
you, that when ye shall begin to shake
your selves of your lusts and of your bands,
your strength shall be gone from you, and
then your enemies shall lead you captive,
and put out your two eyes. O! but some
times our corruptions get such advantage
over us, that we may say, <hi>Vidio meliora
proboque, deteriora sequor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth difference, they go not about
this warfare from a right principle, which
the Christian doth, the one wrestles in
their own strength, but the other resting
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65886:17"/>
upon the strength of <hi>Iehovah, that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
strength,</hi> this is pointed at, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13.
there is a command, that a wrestling Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
studies alwayes to obey: a Christian
uses much that precious divinity of <hi>David,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 45, 46. when they go to war.
And alace there are many that are living
under the apprehension of this warfare, who
in the day of their accompts, we fear shall
be found never really to have entered in the
lists <hi>with principalities and powers and spiritual
wickednesse.</hi> And it is no wonder that
many of us be foiled by the hand of our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
we not having sitten down first
when we engaged, to consult, whether we
with our ten thousand, were able to meet
him that came against us with his twenty
thousand, we engaged without the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of difficulty, and so no wonder we
be overcome without much difficulty. Now
examine your selves, by these, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
you be engaged in this spiritual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
               <p>Now that which, secondly, we shall
speak to, shall be, to those advantages
that a Christian may have by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
taken up in this spiritual warfare.
The first advantage is this, it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way to obtain victory over these
lusts and Idols, wherewith we are beset:
we conceive it is no wonder that this be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65886:18"/>
the great and general complaint of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in these dayes, that they are led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
by the hand of their iniquities, and
that the voice and noise of the spoiler is so
much heard with them, because they are
not taken up in a constant debating and
contending with sin; there is somewhat
of this pointed out to us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 5. where
though that promise be principally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the reward of an overcomer,
when he shall be above, that <hi>he shall be
clothed in white,</hi> yet we think it may include
this, that a man that is in the way, and
constant exercise of overcoming, shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to much divine conformity with
God, and much divine difformity with
the world: and to those who are much
discouraged with their little successe and
apparent victory in this warre, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of their constancy in debate with
their lusts, we shall only speak that for
their comfort by way of allusion, which is
Dan. 7. 12. <hi>Their dominion shall be taken
from them, but their lives be prolonged for a
season and time:</hi> the dominion of your lusts
shall be taken away, though their lives
may be prolonged for your exercise and
dependence on him for a short time and
season: ye may have tribulation in this
spiritual warfare <hi>ten dayes,</hi> but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of this that the day is coming;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65886:18"/>
when ye shall sit down upon a Throne,
after ye have overcome, as <hi>Christ</hi> also did
sit down, after he had overcome; once ve
shall stand and defend the field when all
your lusts shall flee as chaff before the
wind: albeit oftimes our discouragement
speaks that word which <hi>Saul</hi> spake to <hi>David,</hi>
1 Sam. 17. 33. (when we are to wrestle
with the devil) <hi>thou art not able to go against
this Philistine to fight with him, for thou art
but a youth, and he a man of warre from his
youth:</hi> yet a Christian ought to answer,
<hi>through God</hi> I <hi>shall do valiantly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is the way to attain much
divine consolation, as is clear, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, 17.
<hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat
the hidden Manna,</hi> which is (as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
in part, he shall have of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations
of the holy Ghost, though it be
principally understood of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> O!
what a divine contentment and unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
solace of mind doth a Christian at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
by intertaining a constant enimity
against his lusts. I am perswaded that that
which doth interrupt a Christains peace
much, is the interruption of that holy and
divine enimity, which we ought to have
against sin; believe me, there is more
real satisfaction to be found in one dayes
serious debate against sin, then in having
an eternity of enjoyment of the most flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65886:19"/>
pleasures in the world: ye <hi>may sow
in tears</hi> in this warfare, but <hi>ye shall only
reap in joy:</hi> the first part may be true of the
men of the world, in their pursuits after
their pleasures, they do sow in tears; but it
was never yet heard nor left upon record,
that they did reap in joy; there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a correspondence betwixt their seed-time,
and their harvest; but there is a
divine transmutation and disproportion
betwixt the seed-time of a Christian and
his harvest, unspeakable joy can spring
off the root of their most bitter sorrows.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is an excellent way to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the faith of our interest in God, this
is clear from <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. where <hi>Christ</hi>
giveth this promise to the overcomers, that
he will give them <hi>a new name,</hi> which hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth their adoption and interest in
him, which no man can know, but he
that receiveth it; and certainly there is
nothing that over-clouds a Christians
hope so much, nor darkneth his interest,
as an intermission in this holy warfare. Yea
more particularly he attaineth to the most
certain perswasion of his victory over his
corruptions: there is somewhat of this
pointed out, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 7. 8. I <hi>have fought
the good fight of faith,</hi> and hence he doth
infer, that there is laid <hi>up for him a crown
of righteousnesse,</hi> which doth certainly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65886:19"/>
import and include in its bosome, that
<hi>Paul</hi> upon his constant endeavour to
wrestle against corruption, did attain to
much certainty of overcoming. I think
it is altogether impossible for a Christian,
intermitting this holy warfare, to intertain
any divine or assured perswasion, that there
is a blessed issue and period unto his
warfare. And we think it is from this, that
of times his own cry out, <hi>who can stand before
the children of Anak,</hi> and do conclude to
make to themselves a Captain, and go
back unto Egypt: though we think, that
if we were constant in this, we would be
taught, not only to intertain a holy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
of them, but likewayes a divine cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of overcoming. I think a Christian
hath not only that advantage by being
constant in this warfare, that he is
brought to an assured perswasion that he
shall overcome, but likewise doth most
sweetly conclude, that the strength of their
corruption is gone, therefore they may go
up and war with them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by maintaining this warfare, a
Christian gets much experience; by it he
attains to much distinct apprehension of
the deceitfulnesse of him, who is <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
of the brethren.</hi> We are perswaded,
that these who are constant in this warfare,
can speak most to those singular subtilties
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65886:20"/>
of Sathan, and can most distinctly fathom
these deep devices of his; as likewayes,
they can most take up the unsearchable
deceitfulnesse of their own heart: and
there is, no doubt, no small advantage in
the taking up of these two, both that we
may be provoked unto self-diffidence, as
likewayes to have our confidence and hope
much reposed upon <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is
<hi>the Captain of our salvation,</hi> that we may
be constrained in that day when the blast
of the terrible one, is as a blast against the
wall, and when the archer doth shoot at
us, and grievously wound us, to go
unto him, whose name is <hi>an everlasting
strength,</hi> that so by his strength we may
be inabled to overcome.</p>
               <p>That which thirdly we shall speak to,
shall be, what is the reason Christians
do obtain so small victory in this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
warfare: and in this, we shall not
only speak to these morall and culpable
causes, why Christians do not obtain
much victory, but we shall likewayes speak
a little, to these divine and precious ends
that God hath in denying victory to his
own, who in some small measure are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
a constant enimity against their
corruption. And as for the first, it doth
proceed from too much self-conceit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
opinion of their own strength;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65886:20"/>
I am perswaded, that that which made <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
so uncapable to resist the tentations of
denying <hi>Christ,</hi> did much proceed from
that word which is <hi>Matth. 26. 33. Though
all men should be offended because of him, yet
he would never be offended.</hi> Therefore we
think, that the first and most excellent way
to obtain victory is, to be dwelling under
the apprehensions of our own weaknesse
to overcome, that holy and divine paradox
being alwayes made true, that <hi>when we
are weak, then are we strong:</hi> and we may
enter into the lists with our corruptions,
having no confidence in the flesh, but desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the name of the <hi>God of Israel</hi> to
wrestle with the strongest <hi>Goliah</hi> that
we meet with. O! but humility is a
most sweet and strong armour, wherewith
a Christian ought to be clothed, when he
goeth to war: he must walk in that holy
fear, which may be consistent with faith,
and entertain so much faith, and spiritual
confidence, as may not altogether cut off
holy fear.</p>
               <p>There is a second cause, which is, too
much intanglement with the pleasures, and
affairs of the world: It is impossible for
one who is taken up in the continual noise
and buz of things here below, to be
an overcomer; hence <hi>Paul</hi> presseth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 4. that <hi>no man that warreth ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65886:21"/>
himself with the affairs of this life, that
he may please him who hath chosen him to be
a souldier;</hi> and that word, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 25. He
that striveth for the mastery must be temperate
in all things.</hi> O! oft-times through the
deceitfulnesse of the world and pleasures
thereof, we are led captive by the hand of
our iniquities, and do fall before our
enemies. I know nothing so suitable and
helpfull for a Christian to overcome, then
to be denyed to these three cardinal and
fundamental temptations, by which Sathan
standeth to allure us, which are <hi>the lust of
the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of
life;</hi> that our eye may not take in, any
sweet or pleasant representations of the
transient vanities of the world, neither may
our sensual appetite be taken with the taste
of these bitter and most soure delights, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may be ambitious in the enjoyment,
and actual possession of them.</p>
               <p>There is a third cause, which is, that
we are not taken up in the exercise of
watchfulnesse: this is certain that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of this grace, hath most divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
for the overcoming of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41. and
<hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 38. That ought to be the great
Motto of a Christian souldier, which
ought to be engraven upon his armes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Watch:</hi> Watchfulnesse is not only effectual
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65886:21"/>
for overcoming in this respect, that it doth
discover unto us our temptations, when
they begin to assail us, but likewise it takes
up both the subtilty and strength of our
temptations, as likewise it taketh up the
weaknesse and inability in the Christian
to resist that temptation; and if those three
be attained, seldom or never is a Christian
much foiled by the hand of his iniquities,
therefore that which I would say to a
Christian souldier, I would say unto all,
<hi>Watch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a fourth cause, which is, that
we are not much taken up in the exercise of
secret prayer, prayer being indeed that noble
and spiritual weapon by which Christians
do overcome, as is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41.
and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. where <hi>Paul,</hi> when <hi>a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of satan was buffeting him,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
<hi>to beseech the Lord thrice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> a practice
much unknown by the most part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
who know not what it is <hi>to pray
without ceasing,</hi> when they are tempted
much without interruption. I think of all
the weapons that almost a Christian tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to resist temptation, this is the most
effectual; for when <hi>Sathan</hi> seeth that a
Christian improves the temptation so much
for his own advantage, as to make it an
errand to go to God, then he desists and
gives over to contend: I confesse a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65886:22"/>
may in so far glory in his infirmities,
as they give him an occasion to converse
more frequently with <hi>God,</hi> O! but had
we spent more of our time in conversing
with <hi>God,</hi> when we were alone, we
might have attained many sweet trophies,
and fruits of our victory, which now we
have only in hope and expectation.</p>
               <p>There is fifth cause, which is, that we
are not much taken up in the exercise of
Faith, which is that general peece of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
that <hi>Paul</hi> doth prescribe unto the
Christian, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Above all things, taking
the shield of faith, whereby ye shall be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked:</hi> there is
that sweet note of commendation put upon
this armour, that there is no temptation
a Christian can meet with, but through
the exercise of Faith, he may be able to
overcome it: hence <hi>Paul</hi> saith, ye shall
be able to quench <hi>all</hi> the fiery darts of the
<hi>Devil:</hi> This peece of armour is not only
defensive, but we may say, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
it is offensive likewayes: now Faith
helps a Christian to overcome his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and corruptions, wherewith he is
assaulted, not only by laying hold on the
infinit strength of him who is <hi>the Captain of
Salvation;</hi> but likewayes, Faith is that
grace which hath the most subtile and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
eye in taking up the strength of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65886:22"/>
O! but a man much in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Faith, is a man that can passe a most
accurat sentence upon his lusts and Idols
wherewith he doth rencounter: there is
nothing impossible to the believing man:
and I think, if there be any grace by
which a Christian doth ascend most to a
divine similitude unto the omnipotency of
<hi>God,</hi> it is by the grace of Faith: hereby
is the Christians power most intended.
O! but Faith will make those that are
weak, strong: Therefore we would desire
you to be exercising your confidence upon
him, who is that <hi>munition of rocks,</hi> that so
through him ye may overcome, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
through the word of your testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>This lastly may be a cause, that after
some small victory over our lusts, we are
ordinarily entangled with security, not
knowing what it is to make the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over one lust, a sweet provocation to
the overcoming of another. I think (if
we may allude unto that word which is,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 37) it ought much to be the
practice of a Christian, <hi>to pursue his enemies
till he overtake them, and never to return again
till they be consumed,</hi> that by the strength
of him who <hi>is Iehovah,</hi> we may <hi>run thorow
a troup,</hi> and by <hi>our God we may leap over a
wall.</hi> O! but constant exercise in this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65886:23"/>
war, never proclaiming a cessation of
armes, would make a speedy riddance
of all our adversaries; <hi>he</hi> then <hi>should teach
our hands to warre,</hi> and <hi>by our armes a bow
of steel might be broken.</hi> I think that which
made <hi>David</hi> so little successfull over his lusts
after some small victory, was his security:
as likewayes in <hi>Peter.</hi> There is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
in this war till death, and then we
shall receive our everlasting arriers for all
our toil.</p>
               <p>Now to the second, those divine ends
that <hi>the Lord</hi> hath in this, why Christians
do not attain victory over their lusts,
though in some small measure endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
constancy in war; it doth either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from this, that <hi>God</hi> knowes that we
can better improve a wrestling estate than
an overcoming estate, while we are here
below; we can better dispense with war,
than we can with victory. Therefore,
while we are traveling thorow this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
he doth still keep us in exercise
with serpents and scorpions: or it doth
much proceed from this, that we may be
kept in a constant dependence upon <hi>God,</hi>
and may intertain a holy and constant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with him: It is certain, that if
we were not constrained to walk with
God, through a principle of necessity, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
would we walk with him through a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65886:23"/>
principle of a Duty, or from a principle
of love: for it is obvious to a Christian
upon his secret search, that we walk most
with <hi>God,</hi> when we stand most in need
of him: It doth likewise proceed from
this, that we may be kept humble while
we are here below, and that we may not
be exalted above measure; as also, that
the grace and power of our <hi>blessed Lord
Iesus,</hi> in helping us to overcome, may be
rendered more conspicuous and evident,
this being the great stage in which <hi>Christs</hi>
power doth most eminently act and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
over our weaknesse, and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of these insuperable difficulties,
wherewith we are beset and oft overcome.</p>
               <p>Now to shut up our discourse, we shall
desire, that once ye may give up your
names unto <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to fight under
his royal banner, and believe me, though
your corruptions were never so strong,
yet at last he shall overcome them, the
certainty whereof is made out unto you
by this, that your blessed <hi>head, hath led
captivity captive,</hi> and <hi>is now exalted at the
right hand of Majesty on high:</hi> and the hope
and expectation of that blessed issue may
make you rejoyce <hi>with joy unspeakable and
full of glory.</hi>

to behold the invisible Church,
and those that are expectants of heaven,
which is that woman clothed and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with that spotlesse and beautifull righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
of a crucified Saviour, which
is pointed out, by her being clothed with
the Sun, and to be regulat by the Doctrine
of the twelve Apostles, which are indeed
those precious Stars that will bring us unto
the place where <hi>Christ</hi> lyes, and will sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conduct us unto him; and withall to
have that great Idol under our feet, <hi>the
world,</hi> the divine emblem of which is the
Moon, because it is subject to many vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situdes
and changes, and hath most different
and contrary aspects: though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that if many Christians were to be
painted, we might fix the Moon upon their
head, for they use not the world as their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65886:24"/>
servant, but as their Master; Mortification
is an exercise that doth not sute with flesh
and blood, it is a hard saying to a man
settled upon the dregs of nature, and yet
incorporate in that old stock: O! but it is
sad Divinity to many, that except one die
with Christ, they cannot reign with him,
we must win to the fellowship of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
and be conformable unto his
death, before we attain to the resurrection
from the dead: we love to divide those
things that <hi>God</hi> hath conjoyned, to take
<hi>Christ</hi> for righteousnesse and salvation, but
not for a King and for sanctification: And
if it was an evidence unto wise <hi>Solomon,</hi>
that she was not the mother of the childe,
who pleaded for the division of it, so it
may be supposed, that he who will not
take whole <hi>Christ,</hi> but would have him
divided, is not one that is predestinated
to the adoption of children: we confesse
there are many that love Christs coat,
rather than his graces, and if they pursue
after those, it is more after those graces
that are adorning then saving: And we
conceive that there are these three graces
that a hypocrite doth most pursue after;
there is the grace of prayer, the grace of
knowledge, and the grace of humility, and
of the last we may say, a hypocrite may
endeavour to personat it, but there is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65886:25"/>
alwayes within his bosome some convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this little attainment: it is impossible
for a hypocrite to think himself nothing;
and, O! that we could once attain to that
precious length of Christianity, as to be
entertaining a holy oblivion of our attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and a sanctified memory of our
imperfections; that the former may be
written, as it were in the sand, and the
latter might be engraven in the fleshly
tables of our heart, and kept constantly
upon record: we confess there is not much
of our leaf that withers in these dayes,
but much of our fruit withers and decayes:
O! is not man become so brutish and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that he may be sent unto the beasts
of the field to be instructed of that which
is his duty: <hi>Solomon</hi> makes mention of four
beasts upon the earth which are little and
exceeding wise, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.
all which may teach us some spiritual
doctrine; first there are the Ants, who
may teach us that grace of divine prudence,
and Christian policy, in laying hold on
our occasions and opportunities, who
though they be not a strong people, yet
provide their meat in summer; and no
doubt, we should be fighting with our
spiritual enemies, while it is the day, for
the night cometh wherein no man can
fight: actions done in season, addes a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65886:25"/>
great deal of luster and perfection to
them, every thing being beautifull in
its season: Secondly, there are the conies,
who may teach us that grace of deny all,
to distrust our own strength, and in the
day of straits to run unto him who is that
<hi>Munition of rocks,</hi> when the blast of the
terrible one, is as a storm against a wall;
for they being a feeble people, make their
houses in the rocks; And no doubt, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme
and Idolatrie are the two great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of mortification, too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in our selves, which is Idolatrie,
and our too much diffidence in God, which
is our Atheisme. Moreover, we may go
to the locusts, which would teach us that
primitive grace of unity, who though
they want a King, yet go forth by bands:
and lastly, we may go to the spider, which
may teach us that grace of spiritual mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse,
and of aspiring after those sublime
and excellent things of God, for they are
in Kings places: and, O! to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
with heaven, and those things that
are above: this would make us to distaste
these lower springs, and they would be to
us as the waters of Marah.</p>
               <p>But to come more particularly to the
words, you have many precious things
concerning Mortification holden forth,
which is that precious and cardinal grace
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65886:26"/>
of which we intend at this time to speak;
you have the infinit advantage of this grace
held forth, to wit, that such do meet with
divine intimation of their interest in Christ,
and that they are Christs, which is indeed
the high elevation of a Christian: And
this is clear from the words, that such an
one may from this gather, that his name
was written in the ancient and precious
records of heaven: And, no doubt, little
divine wrestling with our corruptions,
makes us to have the extract of our peace
so often withdrawn to our sense: there is
this held forth concerning it, the extensive
nature of mortification, that a Christian
ought not only to mortifie the flesh, which
is original sin, which is so called, not
only because of that wofull knot of amity
and affection that is betwixt us and our
lusts, hence that word, <hi>no man ever hated
his own flesh;</hi> O! those invisible knots
of union that are betwixt us and our lusts;
but it is so called, because sin hath conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat
the whole man, so that <hi>from the
crown of the head to the sole of the foot,</hi> there
is nothing that is not defiled, as likewayes,
because during our abode in those tents
of mortality, we must have this wofull
and sad companion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable
and unalterable decree of heaven
that during our time of Minority, we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65886:26"/>
should have that bad associat; but more,
a Christian should mortifie his affections,
which are his predominant lusts, to which
our affections are so much joyned, and
our soul doth so much go out after; as
also his lusts, which are the first motions
and risings of corruption within one, and
withall may comprehend the eschewing
the first shadows and appearances of evil,
<hi>Prov. 4. 14, 15. Enter not into the path of the
wicked, and go not in the way of evil men,
avoid it, passe not by it, turn from it, and
passe away:</hi> our mortification should be als
much of our invisible Idols, as our visible
lusts.</p>
               <p>There is this likewayes held forth, the
difficulty and painfulnesse of this work
under this notion of <hi>Crucifying,</hi> which was
one of the most painfull deaths: we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that there are many who are of that
mans humour, who wallowing upon the
grasse, cryed forth, <hi>utinam hoc esset labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare:</hi>
there is, no doubt, more difficulty
in this then we apprehend, we must not
ly in the bed of ease, if we intend to be
mortifying Christians, we must wrestle
as princes with God, till we prevail; the
longsomnesse of this work is also pointed
at, under the notion of crucifying, it being
a longsome death: we cannot ordinarily
fight and triumph in one day; that ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65886:27"/>
letter of <hi>Cesars</hi> will not hold here, <hi>Veni,
Vidi, Vici;</hi> we must die mortifying and
strugling with our corruptions, and when
one of our feet is within the borders of
eternity, to be sighing out that lamentation,
<hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. You have
also the intensive nature of mortification,
that a Christian should be content with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the death of his lusts, which is
held forth in that word, <hi>crucifie.</hi> O! to
bind our self with a holy oath and vow,
not to dwell in much contentment, till we
have gotten the life of our predominant
lust: we must not give our idols quarter
upon the most plausible and fairest termes
of subjection, otherwayes, if ye do, I shall
not say that word which the Prophet spake
to <hi>Ahab,</hi> that <hi>your life shall go for his;</hi> but sure
I am that confederacy shall be broken, and
likely not without many sorrows to your
spirits. There is lastly, the certainty of
this victory held forth in that word, <hi>they
have crucified;</hi> it is here in the preterite time,
as it were already accomplished and
brought to passe; and no doubt, this may
make us to rejoyce <hi>with joy unspeakable and
full of glory,</hi> that once we shall have a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
song put in our mouth.</p>
               <p>Now before we shall speak unto any
of these, we shall speak to some few things
as previous to be known: We shall not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65886:27"/>
dwell long in pointing out the nature of
Mortification; we conceive it thus. It is
a divine quality of the immortal soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the efficacy and vertue of <hi>Christs</hi>
death, whereby the strength of sin is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
and its dominion taken away, so
that we should not totally nor with full
consent yield our self unto that iron-yoke
of our iniquity: Neither shall we stand
long to prove that it is your duty to be
much in the practice of this duty: It is
clear not only from <hi>Col. 3. 5. Mortifie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your members which are upon the earth,</hi>
but also from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15, 16. and, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
7. 1. it ought to be our great design and
aim to bring all those things in subjection,
which stand in opposition to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
and it is the noble prerogative of those
young men, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 13, 14. that they
have overcome that wicked one, and hath
in some measure trodden Sathan under their
feet.</p>
               <p>But we shall speak a little unto this, first,
whether or not a Christian can fall again
to the committing of that sin which once
they have mortified and repented for, and
withall hath received an act of pardon?
We conceive indeed (so far as we know)
there can be no explicit proof given of such
a case in Scripture, that ever any of those
that were heirs of the grace of life, did fall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65886:28"/>
into that sin which they had once morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and repented for: but however, we
are confident to averre, that it is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with a gracious estate, which we
conceive is clear, not only from his names,
but from his promises and from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
doth not that name, that he is <hi>a
healer of our back-slidings,</hi> and <hi>the repairer
of our breaches,</hi> and that name, <hi>he will
multiply to pardon,</hi> speak out that a Saints
relapsing into a mortified sin, doth not
put him without hope, <hi>Is. 55. 7. Hos.</hi> 14. 4,
but that he may have confidence that he
shall not die but live, and declare the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
works of the Lord, though <hi>God</hi> may
speak that word to him, which <hi>Absalom</hi>
spake to <hi>Hushai, Is this thy kindnesse to thy
friend:</hi> and withall, do not his promises
speak this, <hi>Ier. 3. 22. I will heal your back-slidings;</hi>
and do not his commands speak
it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 1. 12. 14. 22. how often is back-sliding
Israel exhorted to return, and he
who imposed that commandement upon
us, to forgive our brother untill seventy
and seven times, if he return and repent,
will not his bowels be moved within
him, towards a back-sliding heifer? But
withall, to provoke you to beware of that
sin, to sin after repentance and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we shall propose these things. First,
such a sin doth creat and beget much hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65886:28"/>
and stupidity of heart, so that <hi>our own
back-slidings do reprove us,</hi> and become
not only our sin, but our punishment;
and when <hi>God hath spoken peace to us, should
we again turn to folly?</hi> Secondly, there is
this to disswade you, that such Apostacy
as this, makes a Christian to losse the sense
and comfortable assurance of their Interest,
so that sometimes they will be even razing,
as it were, the foundations: O! but
backsliders in heart are filled with the
fruit of their own way, and are made to
walk <hi>in darknesse and to have no light:</hi>
it is much for a Christian to keep fast his
hands, when after this manner, he hath
lost his feet.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, such an one doth ordinarily
give much reins, and much liberty to his
corruptions; that is indeed, their year of
Jubilee and release, as is clear from <hi>Ier.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.
where these two are joyned: and may not
the nature and aggravating circumstances
of that sin, make you to eschew it? is it
not a sinning against light? is it not a
sinning against God, after he hath appeared
unto you twise? So that this may be the
manner of your bemoaning your self, If it
had been an enemy that had thus done,
O Lord, thou mightest have born it, but
that it should be one, whom thou didst
condescend to make thy familiar, and to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65886:29"/>
take sweet counsel together with, that
hath lift up his heel against thee; this no
doubt is an iniquity of deep dye; and
we shall only say this, that it is imprinted
upon the effigie of godly <hi>Iudah, Gen.</hi> 38. 26.
that after his first fall with <hi>Tamar,</hi> he <hi>knew
her again no more:</hi> And, no doubt, it were
your advantage to obey that counsel, <hi>let
him that standeth take heed lest he fall..</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that which secondly we would
speak to is, to propose something to you,
by which you may know your growth in
Mortification, since there are many that
delude themselves in this, supposing that
their lusts are really mortified, when they
are but sleeping, and that they are really
cast out, when they only go out for a
season: those are they that <hi>are pure in their
own eyes, and yet are not cleansed from their
iniquity.</hi> And before we shall speak any
thing to this, we would have you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
these things. First, that there may
be a growth of leafes, where there is not
much growth of fruit; a plentifull measure
of profession, and yet much barrennesse
in practice; there are some whose leaf doth
not wither, though their fruit doth much
decay, who have many specious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
and yet cannot say that the root
of the matter is with them; and with all
we would say, that there may be some real
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65886:29"/>
growth to the fruit, when there is not much
growth to the root, so that though we spread
forth our branches, yet we do not cast forth
our root as <hi>Lebanon;</hi> we grow sometimes
more in prayer, and knowledge, and joy
of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> then in mortification
and humility, though there be a promise
for both their growthes, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 5. 6. Now
there is this secondly, that we would have
you knowing, that there is a divine neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
for Christians to grow somewhat in
all the graces of the Spirit, and <hi>to bring
forth fruits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even in old age,</hi> to be advancing
in Mortification, to be ascending up in a
divine conformity with God, till we shall
be made like unto him: we confesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
there are some sad interruptions, when
we almost forget that we were purged
from our old sins; And this necessity of
growth, appears not only from this, that
<hi>Christ</hi> is the head of believers, and they
his members; this similitude the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
useth twise to expresse Christians
growth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. <hi>Col,</hi> 2. 10. and no
doubt, since <hi>Christ</hi> is the head, and we
the members, we must grow till there be
a divine conformity and resemblance
betwixt us and our head; and are not we
predestinate unto this divine and noble end,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. and must not we purifie our
selves, and endeavour to wash our selves
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65886:30"/>
from our spots, through that precious
bloud of sprinkling, that <hi>we may be holy,
as he who hath called us, is holy.</hi> And more,
this is one end of that fulnesse, which was
communicat unto <hi>Iesus Christ our precious
head,</hi> ever <hi>to make us compleat,</hi> Col. 2. 9, 10.
And as his fulnesse is for our growth,
so our growth is for the making up of
his fulnesse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 23. Mystical <hi>Christ</hi>
will not be compleat, till once all his
Members grow up <hi>to the stature of the
fulnesse of Iesus Christ,</hi> and so from that,
there is such an invisible knot of union
and supernatural relation betwixt us and
<hi>Christ,</hi> that a Christian must grow, and
if once the first draughts and imperfect
lineaments of <hi>Christs</hi> image be engraven
on our soul, he will bring it unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
since this is his noble prerogative,
that his work is perfect. There is this also
that speaks a necessity of a Christians
growth in mortification, and all the graces
of the spirit, that the faithfulnesse of all the
persons of the blessed Trinity, is engaged
for this, and is laid in pawn: it is clear
that the faithfulnesse of the first person of
the blessed Trinity is laid in pledge, from
<hi>Psal. 92. 14, 15. they shall still bring forth
fruit in old age, to shew that the Lord is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi>
or faithfull: which we conceive doth
relate to that promise made by the <hi>Father</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65886:30"/>
to the <hi>Son,</hi> in that ancient and eternal
transaction, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10. And is not the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of the <hi>Son</hi> laid in pledge, is not
this commandement of the <hi>Father</hi> laid upon
him, <hi>that of all that are given to him, he
should losse none, but raise them up at the last
day,</hi> Joh. 6. 39, 40. so that as <hi>Christ</hi> must
be answerable to his charge, he must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
all the gifted ones unto the <hi>Father,</hi>
which presupposeth their growth in grace,
and their being <hi>made meet for the inheritance
of the Saints in light:</hi> and is not the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the third person of the blessed Trinity
likewayes ingaged in this? in that it is his
great work, to apply <hi>Christs</hi> purchase, to
reveal unto us the whole minde of <hi>God,</hi> and
to communicate all things that are needful
for us to know, and to guide us in all truth
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 13. And if this be his work, will
he not accomplish it, and bring it unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?
all which great works that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to do, have that
sweet and precious result, <hi>growth in grace.</hi>
There is this thirdly, that we would have
you knowing, that there are some graces
of the Spirit, of whose growth, before we
can judge, there must be a time allotted;
grace is not like the grasse of the field,
which groweth in a night, and perisheth
in a night: it is a woful practice among
many, they begin to search their growth,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65886:31"/>
before they have well begun to grow: we
would rather counsel you to grow, then to
search your growth; though it is indeed a
Christians duty to take notice, <hi>to go up
early to the vineyards, to see if the vine flourish,
whether the tender grape appear, and the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats
bud forth;</hi> this is clear from <hi>Cant.</hi>
7. 12. and from <hi>Psal.</hi> 63 8. where <hi>David</hi>
taketh notice, not only of his following
after <hi>God,</hi> but that his soul did follow hard
after him: but if in this we may allude, we
shall say this unto you, <hi>Iudge nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time,</hi> let your graces grow before
you judge of their growth. And there is
this lastly that we would say, that growing
in grace and the fruits of the Spirit, is a
mystery that is more taken up by faith,
then by sense; we must grow by Faith, and
by Faith we will best discern, especially
under desertion, and when we are walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under a cloud, and <hi>Christ</hi> carves out
bitter things unto us: we confesse indeed,
when we are dandled upon his knee, and
our cup of divine consolations is running
over, and he covereth to us a table in the
wildernesse, then our growth may be
known by sense.</p>
               <p>But as to the question we proposed, we
shall give you these evidences of your
growth in Mortification: There is this
first, those are admitted to read their names
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65886:31"/>
in those ancient and precious Records of
heaven, and to know that they were engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon his heart, before ever the corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of the world was laid; this is clear
from <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. and, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. and the
ground of it is this, that those who are
wrestling as Princes with their lusts, and
enduring the heat of the day, he lets them
see a sight of the crown, and of that eternal
felicity, that so they may endure that good
fight of faith, and persevere to the end, that
they may obtain that crown of life. And
there is this ground of it also, because such
are much in the exercise of those two car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
and architectonick graces of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>faith</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> by which much divine
familiarity and fellowship with God is
attained, and so faith doth increase with
the increase of God.</p>
               <p>There is this second evidence, when our
lusts have not such power to disturb us in
holy duties, as in prayer, hearing and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating;
if you have dispossessed those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
things, and can go about those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
with a great deal of more divine sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and composednesse of spirit; but if
this be wanting, it is an evidence of no
great growth in Mortification, as is is clear
from <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 11. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. And
we conceive, that this is an evidence of
growth in Mortification upon those two
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65886:32"/>
grounds; First, A Christian that is much
a victor in this blessed warfare, is oft-times
under the dreadful impressions of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and Holinesse of <hi>God,</hi> by which those
sinful stirrings and motions of his heart are
much abated; by reason of his terrour, he
cannot endure himself to be <hi>with the fool
in the ends of the earth,</hi> because such a one
hath power over his spirit and rules over it,
so that he is not like a city broken down
and without walls. O! but it is much
for one, to subject all his thoughts to the
obedience of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to have nothing
within him that lifts up the heel against
the knowledge and excellency of <hi>Iesus
Christ:</hi> and by the way, it is a wofull and
irrational evil, that we lodge Christ in our
face, and in our mouth, we speak of him,
and seem to love him, but we lodge idols
in our heart, that glorious and excellent
Mansion, which should be kept for that
excellent guest, that <hi>immortal King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
who is the light of the higher House.</p>
               <p>There is this third evidence of growth, to
be much in exalting and magnifying of
<hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and lifting up of that burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
stone of his praise; this was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Pauls</hi> growth in Mortification,
<hi>Rom. 7. 25. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 56, 57, 58. O! but
one that hath really tasted of that noble
thing, mortifying and pardoning grace,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65886:32"/>
their soul will esteem <hi>Christ</hi> matchlesse, and
a divine necessity of speaking out his praise
and setting him on high, will lye upon
them: There are two special times, when
Christians are put to a divine <hi>non-plus</hi>
in speaking out his praise, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to cry out that word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 1.
<hi>Praise waiteth for thee,</hi> (or is silent) that is,
it cannot be expressed. There is that time,
when a Christian is caught up, as it were,
unto the third heavens, and hath some
eminent discoveries of God, then they are
constrained to cry out, <hi>exalt thy self, O Lord;</hi>
their thoughts are so high of him, that there
can be no expressions found sutable unto
his worth; And we confesse indeed, it is
hard, if not impossible, to commit any hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole
in commending of him. And there
is that second time, when Christians are
able to turn the battle to the gate, and in
some measure are enabled to conquer their
spiritual enemies; then are they put to this,
who can exalt him who is by infinit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
exalted above our blessing and praise?
Sometimes a Christian is put to that
spiritual posture and heavenly frame, that
he cannot make language of his thoughts
of <hi>Christ,</hi> that though his heart could
indite a good matter concerning the King,
yet his tongue cannot be the pen of a ready
writer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:65886:33"/>
There is a fourth evidence of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
growth, when a Christian hath more
spiritual discoveries and insight unto his
corruptions, and is more wrestling against
them: and we would have you consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these two things; 1. That discovery of
bosome and invisible lusts, is that which
we mainly take to be meant in this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and wrestling against them; and
there is this secondly, that all our victories
over our lusts, should increase our anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
against sin, and make us to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
till once we shall obtain a compleat
victory, and shall have accomplished our
warfare.</p>
               <p>There is a fifth evidence of our growth,
when the remembrance of our former lusts
and Idols, do not provoke desires, after the
enjoyment of those things again, but rather
doth provoke the exercise of sorrowes, that
ever that should have been our lot, to have
been under the dominion of such lusts and
Idols: O! but there are many, to whom
remembrance of their lusts will provoke
their affections, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 19. 21. and this
speaks much strength of love, that the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of his Idols, should so much inflame
him, and gain his affections; O! but
looking upon our old sins with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionat
eye, speaks little growth in morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:65886:33"/>
There is this last evidence of our growth,
our high and majestick thoughts of Christ
and his Word, for if once our humours be
purged out, we shall then <hi>as new born
babes, desire the sincere milk of the word;</hi>
and I am perswaded, that as one doth
obtain successe in this precious warfare, he
doth ascend in his spiritual conception of
<hi>Christ;</hi> such an one is endeavouring that
evangelick and heavenly captivity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
to have them all confined unto
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that precious and excellent
object: O! but one sight of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
in his matchless and transcendent comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to behold that divine contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,
harmony and conjunction of all
spiritual graces that are in him, would it
not provoke us to cast away our Idols
to the Moles and to the Batts, and should
not they losse their beautifull hue and
image? O! but eternally to contemplat
that infinit Majesty that is in him, sweetly
contemperat with his lowlinesse, so that
we may say, there is both Majestick low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
and lowly majesty in him, to see
likewayes his infinite highnesse, and his
matchlesse condescendency, to see his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Soveraignty, and his unparallel'd
humility, those things if once they were
attained, might make us to cry out, <hi>who
would not love thee, O King of Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:65886:34"/>
Now that which we shall lastly speak to
shall be this, to show unto you those
things that speak and prove our soul-union
and heart-conjunction with our Idols, that
so we may be provoked to the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them; There is this first, that we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
our Idols after frequent convictions
of the disadvantages of them, that after
they have been seen in their own native
collours, yet we dandle them upon our
knee, like that word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 10. and
that, <hi>Ier. 50. 38. they are mad upon their
Idols,</hi> demented in their pursuits after them;
and no doubt this speaks a most unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
frame, and one filled with the love
of his Idols. There is this secondly, that
speak it, our imbracing of our Idols upon
small tentations, like that, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 2, 3.
there are some tentations of our lusts to
gain our affections, and some to gain our
judgment; and to sin without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of some great advantage, or some
solacing delight or pleasure, speaks us most
strongly united to our lusts. There is this
thirdly, that speaks it, that infinite toyl and
labour that we expose our selves to, to
satisfie our lusts; you will see it <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2.
where <hi>Solomon</hi> making pleasure and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
joy his Idol, is put to much toyl to
satisfie it: and believe it, it is more easie to
mortifie your lusts, then to satisfie them, for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65886:34"/>
that is impossible work: our Idols have
two daughters that still cry, <hi>Give, Give:</hi> our
Idols are like the grave, the barren womb,
the earth that is not filled with water, and
the fire, who never cry, <hi>It is enough:</hi> our
Idols have two attendants, <hi>Impatience,</hi> and
<hi>diligence;</hi> we will weary our selves in the
fire, to obtain satisfaction to our lusts;
and if we do not attain it, we will curse
our King, and look upward. There is
this fourthly, that speaks our soul-union
to our Idols, and it is imbracing of them,
after application of threatnings, against
those who should imbrace that sin; and
yet, to commit this sin with lifted up hand,
is indeed, to sport with the justice of
<hi>God,</hi> or rather to put a bill of defiance
in his hand, supposing that we are above
the reach of his justice and power. And
there is this fifthly, that speaks it, our
killing of convictions, which tend to the
discovery of the sinfulnesse of sin, and
pressing upon us those duties, by which
we attain to the Mortification of them; and
is it not certain, that we kill our convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the birth, and makes them to prove
abortive? Love to our Idols is that which
kills our convictions, and our killing of
our convictions, is the mother of our love
to our Idols: And there is this, lastly, that
speaks our soul-union with our Idols; those
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65886:35"/>
anxious sorrows when we misse the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Idols, we are then ready to
cry out, <hi>It is better for me to die then to live:</hi>
and oft-times, when our Idols are taken
from us, and are laid in the grave, our
living lusts sit down, and lament over
the grave of our buried Idols, crying forth,
<hi>Ah, my Lord.</hi> And since there are such
invisible, and wofull knots of union
betwixt us and our Idols, we should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to have all these knots loosed, and
to have our soul united unto him, by those
two precious and golden chains of <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Love,</hi> and to have our hearts a <hi>Bethel,</hi>
a house for God, and a temple for the
holy Ghost; and not a <hi>Bethaven,</hi> a house
of Idols, and a cage for all unclean birds,
that our spirits may be mansions for that
<hi>eternal Spirit,</hi> and he may have an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
power over us, and a negative voice
in conducting us to heaven.</p>

               <p>MOrtification is that precious
duty imposed upon man, not
only by the law of Nature, but
by the royal and excellent law
of Grace. Doth not the law and light of
nature instruct man thus, it is better to
kill then to be killed; and certainly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a Christian be the ruin of his iniquities,
iniquity shall certainly be his ruine; we
shall either sing a song of triumph over
our lusts, or our lusts shall sing a song of
triumph over us; and doth not that royal
law of liberty and grace enforce this upon
us, while it desireth, that <hi>we should crucifie
our members which are upon the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and be
aspiring after a divine conformity with
the Image of the invisible God; Though
we conceive, there be some, that if they
would retire themselves a little to behold
those subtile and invisible actings of the
mystery of iniquity within them and those
deep devices of Sathan, and how many
strange Lords, beside <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65886:36"/>
dominion over them; they might be
constrained to put in their <hi>amen</hi> unto that
truth, that <hi>it is more easie for a camel to
passe thorow the eye of a needle, then for such
unmortified Christians,</hi> as many of us are,
<hi>to enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> It is better
for us to dwell in the house of mourning,
then in the house of mirth, and we may
say of much of the carnal joy that is
amongst us, <hi>Such laughter is mad, and
such mirth what doth it?</hi> we may wish
for some retired cottage in the wildernesse,
where we may go aside, and spend our
seventy years in the bitternesse of our soul,
and account it marvelous loving kindnesse,
if we shall obtain hope in our end: It is
without all debate, that the general and
universal evil of our dayes is, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are so little in the exercise of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
grace of Mortification; we think,
we take a greater latitude in our way to
heaven, than that cloud of witnesses
which went before us, did adventure to
take: and it is certain, that if one from the
dead were admitted to write Commentars
upon the disadvantages of satisfying the
lusts of the flesh, they would point forth
marvelous hurt and infinit losse in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
any of those; as likwayes, if any
from above were admitted to write upon
the advantages <hi>of crucifying the flesh with the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65886:36"/>
affections and lusts thereof,</hi> what precious
commendation might they give to those
that are exercised in those low, but exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
works of Mortification? Believe me
this is most certain, that it is easier to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
your lusts, than to satisfie them: for
we conceive, that such an one who is
spending his precious time in the satisfying
of his lusts, doth spend his time betwixt
these three, the impatiency of his lusts,
which still cry forth, <hi>give, give;</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
and weaknesse of the means he
hath to satisfie such lusts, and the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the impossibility of satisfying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable
desires, and infinit lusts of sin:
anxiety and sorrow are the constant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
of a man that is not studying to
crucifie his lusts and affections: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if we may allude to that word,
<hi>Jer. 48. 10. Cursed be he that keepeth back
his sword from blood,</hi> he is cursed, that
doth not endeavour to crucifie and bring
low the <hi>seven abominations of his heart,</hi>
that we may with <hi>Naphtali</hi> and <hi>Zebulun,</hi>
jeopard our lives unto death in the high
places of the field, and that there might
be none of our lusts to cry forth within us,
<hi>the bitternesse of death is past;</hi> but may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to cut them in peeces before the
Lord. We conceive, this work of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
is the most pleasant exercise of a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65886:37"/>
Christian, if not in its own nature, yet in
its fruits and effects.</p>
               <p>Now before we shall speak any thing
unto those things which we proposed to
speak of at the last occasion, we shall speak
a little to this, what is the reason that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
resolutions and purposes to quite such
a predominant lust, and to forsake such an
idol, do oft-times evanish without any
fruit? All these cords of divine resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by which they bind themselves, are but
as tow and flax before the fire of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they decreeing many things which are
not established: And we confesse, this is
so incident an evil unto his own, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they are resolved in nothing so much
as this, to resolve no more; they in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
give over the duty of resolution, because
they are so short-coming in the duty of
performance: And we conceive, that this
is occasioned either through this, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
do not resolve upon the strength of a
Mediator, or if they do resolve upon his
strength, they are not much in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it for the bringing low of such an
iniquity. And we conceive, this was the
ground that <hi>Peters</hi> resolutions were brought
so much low, and were blasted; and this
is somewhat pointed at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>lsa.</hi> 40. 30. 31.
where it is said <hi>ev<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the youths shall faint and
be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall;</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:65886:37"/>
the greatest natural abilities which might
help men to run and not be weary, and the
most promising evidences from themselves,
shall fail and be blasted; but (as it is in
the 31. <hi>v.) they that wait upon the Lord, shall
renew their strength,</hi> even those who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
to their own strength. And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that there are these two great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Christianity, first, to resolve so as
being convinced of this, that we are not
able, as of our selves, to think one good
thought: And, secondly, which is a little
more mysterious, to believe that <hi>Christs</hi>
strength laid hold on by faith, is as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
for the crucifying such a lust, as
if it were our own proper strength and
excellency: certainly, one that hath once
swallowed this camel of Christianity, needs
not strain at the lower gants of it: we
would only say this by the way, study
to flee comparative resolutions, for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
these are much blasted, as was clear
in <hi>Peter though all shall forsake thee, yet I will
not:</hi> study to be positive in your resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but beware of comparisons.</p>
               <p>This is likewayes occasioned through
this, that ordinarily they determine the
mortifying of such a lust rather with their
light than with their affections; as it is
sometimes the exercise of a Christian, when
he goeth to prayer for the mortifying of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65886:38"/>
such a lust, his light prayeth more than
his affections; and sometimes it falls out,
that when light and judgment is praying
for the mortifying of such an Idol, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
as it were, entereth a protestation
against the granting of such a desire, and
in a manner saith, <hi>Lord mortifie not such a
lust.</hi> This we conceive was the case and
practice of those who are made mention of,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 4, 5. who came to enquire of the
Lord, having their Idols in their heart:
we may put our idols from our minde,
but have our idols in our heart, when we
come to seek the mortification of them;
and we would only say this unto you,
when ye begin to resolve, study to have
your souls under a divine impression of the
sinfulnesse of such a lust, as likewayes
under the infinite disadvantage of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such a lust: we conceive, that the
ordinary time of a Christians resolution is,
when they are blessed with the dew of
heaven, and are admitted to taste of his
sweetnesse; And oft-times Christians reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
are rather according to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
frame, than according to that which
probably will be their frame ere long: And
this is the occasion that Christians who are
big in their resolutions, are often short and
defective in their performances; or else we
conceive it to be occasioned through Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65886:38"/>
being too much given to sloathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and that wofull idol of self-indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
they resolve fair, but do not take
pains to accomplish their vows; This is
clearly pointed at, not only, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 4.
where it is said, <hi>The sluggard desireth, but
he hath nothing</hi> but more clearly, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21. 25.
<hi>The desire of the sluggard stayeth him,</hi> and
the reason is subjoyned, <hi>because his hands
refuse to labour:</hi> it is most certain, that
except a Christian be diligent, he can never
be a mortifying Christian; Mortification
is not attained with ease, we must travel in
pain, and have the pangs of the new-birth
before <hi>Christ be formed in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there is this lastly, which doth occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
it, Christians do not propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a sublime and divine end in mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their lusts; and certainly we conceive,
this is the most ordinary and incident case
unto his own, we either propose this end
in mortifying of our lusts, that we may
have somewhat whereof to glory, and to
make mention of our righteousnesse, <hi>even
of ours only;</hi> or else we propose this carnal
end, of studying to have a name continually
amongst the living in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> lest that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
mystery of iniquity that is within us
be engraven on our fore-heads; and I think
certainly, that name may be engraven
upon many professors in this age, which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65886:39"/>
                  <hi>Iude</hi> giveth them, vers 12. of his Epistle, he
calleth them <hi>twise dead,</hi> that is, not only
dead in reality, but that through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of sin, they had even lost any name
of living they likewayes had, so that it
was also evanished and gone away. I am
perswaded, that were we known each one to
another, as we are known to him, <hi>who hath
those seven eyes that run too and fro through
the earth,</hi> no doubt, we should wonder at
the boldnesse of our hope: and laugh at
the strength of our delusions.</p>
               <p>Now that which first we proposed to
speak of from the words was this, the
advantage which a Christian hath by the
mortifying of his lusts, and being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unally
exercised in this precious warfare;
and (as we cleared at the last occasion)
the advantage of a Mortifying Christian
was this, ordinarily such a Christian doth
live under the impression of his interest in
<hi>God,</hi> he is admitted to read his name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the book of life: now this is clear
from <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. where he saith, <hi>to him
that overcometh,</hi> who is in the way of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming,
<hi>will I give a white stone, and in the
stone a new name written, which no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
saving he that receiveth it:</hi> as likewayes
from <hi>Rev. 2. 11. he that overcometh shall not
be hurt of the second death:</hi> as also from
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. where these two are sweetly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65886:39"/>
conjoyned and linked together: and it
must certainly be so, that a mortifying
Christian is one that liveth under the divine
impression of his interest in <hi>God,</hi> not only
because of this, that one who is not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
his lusts, as it were, doth darken
his hope and obscure his evidence; every
dayes intermission of mortification, being
(as it were) a score drawn through the
extract of our peace with God, so that in
processe of time that precious extract of
peace becometh illegible unto us. And we
shall say this, that a Christian who can
keep the faith of his interest, without the
exercise of Mortification, may suspect
the reality of such assurance: mortification
and assurance die and live together, are
weak and strong together: But likewayes
it must be so, because of this, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<hi>God</hi> rewardeth a mortifying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
with the intimation of his peace, he
takes them in unto the eternal purposes of
his heart, and the secrets of his counsel,
and lets him see his name written in the
records of heaven, lest he should faint in
the day of adversity, and so prove his
strength to be but small: did ye never
know what such a thing as this meant, that
when ye were most serious in the exercise
of Mortification, ye were admitted to
behold that precious and everlasting hope?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65886:40"/>
There is this second advantage that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hath by being continually exercised
in this blessed warfare, and it is this, Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is that grace which keeps all the
graces of the spirit in action and exercise;
it is that superior wheel, at the motion of
which, all the inferior wheels do move;
and if we may so speak, Mortification is
this, its all the graces of the spirit combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in one, and exercising themselves in one
divine act; <hi>Faith</hi> is exercised by a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
Christian, not only in this, in
drawing furniture from <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> who is
our head, but likewayes, in that it is that
defensive peece of armour, (it being called
<hi>the shield of Faith</hi>) by which we quench
the fiery darts of the Devil: this war will
not proceed with much advantage, if faith
be out of the field: So also the grace of <hi>hope</hi>
is exercised by a Mortifying Christian, for
this is its exercise in this blessed warfare,
to hold up the crown of immortal glory in
its right hand, with this motto engraven
upon it, <hi>he that persevereth to the end shall be
saved, and obtain this crown of life,</hi> which
is the great encouragment of a Christian
in this exercise: Likewayes, the grace of
<hi>watchfulnesse</hi> is exercised in this blessed
warfare: for watchfulnesse (if so we may
speak) is the centinel of the Christian,
that standeth upon the watch-tower, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65886:40"/>
giveth warning unto a Christian of the
motions of his adversary; watchfulnesse
warneth us when first corruption begins
to stirre: So the grace of <hi>love</hi> is much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in this blessed warfare; for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
where he beholds that divine and
unsearchable compassion of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
which he exerciseth towards it, in uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it under its straits, that when the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
shoot at him, and do grievously
wound him, that yet his bow should abide
in its strength, this makes the grace of love
to burn and live within a Christian. And
lastly, the grace of <hi>Prayer</hi> is much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in this blessed warfare, for when
faith begins to die, and hope begins to
losse its courage, when watchfulnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to sleep, and love begins to be remisse,
and to wax cold, then prayer as a flying
Cherub, doth go to the Captain of our
salvation, and desireth that he might help
them in the day of their need: prayer is
the sweet correspondent of the Christian
betwixt heaven and earth; <hi>prayer</hi> stayeth
upon the Mount with <hi>Christ,</hi> when <hi>faith</hi>
and <hi>watchfulnesse</hi> are in the field with our
corruptions and lusts that are in us: and
we shall only say this by the way, I know
not whether a Christian be more obliged to
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> for justification than for sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
but we conceive it is better to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65886:41"/>
conjoyn those together, than to compare
them one with another.</p>
               <p>There is this third advantage that a
Mortifying Christian hath, such a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
doth most ordinarily meet with most
divine solace and intimate communion and
fellowship with <hi>God;</hi> such a Christian is
admitted to taste of the honey out of the
rock, and to be satisfied with the finest of
the wheat. Would ye know the reason why
you have not been in heaven these many
dayes? it is this, ye have not been fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these many dayes. Now this this clear
from <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. where that promise is
given to the mortifying Christian, that
<hi>he shall taste of the hidden manna,</hi> which is
the sweetnesse of <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> as likewayes,
<hi>Rom. 8. 13. If ye through the spirit mortifie the
deeds of the flesh, ye shall live:</hi> as also,
<hi>Rom. 7. 24. vers.</hi> compared with 25. where
wrestling <hi>Paul</hi> doth receive songs of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
praise put in his mouth: would ye
know the person that is admitted to sing
one of the songs of <hi>Zion,</hi> while he is in a
strange land? it is the Mortifying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:
for when he is in the pursute of his
enemies, he is then admitted to put out his
singer and taste of the honey, that his eyes
may be enlightened. There is a mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
that is pleaded for by many in these
dayes, whose highest advancement in this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65886:41"/>
precious grace doth not consist in that
which it is, in knowing and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of, and mourning over sin; but
this is their Mortification, that one should
be dead to the sense and conviction of sin:
we shall passe no other verdict upon such
Antinomian Mortification as this, but only
this, it is indeed the Mortification of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
it is a crucifying of repentance and
holinesse, it is a killing of the new man
within a Christian, as likewayes a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the old-man in its lusts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
this Mortification is no other thing
but Sathan transformed in an angel of
light, and this is a peece of that new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
which is so much preached in these
dayes, which if an angel should bring
from heaven, we ought not to believe it:
this is no new light, but old darknesse co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over with the vail of a glistering
light. O! study to be much under the
impression of the bitternesse of sin, that so
ye may taste of the consolations of the <hi>holy
Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this fourth advantage that a
Christian hath by being continually exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in this warfare, which is, that such
a Christian hath distinct and perfect disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
not only of the deceitfulnesse of his
own heart, but also of the subtility of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and sin that doth assault him: a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65886:42"/>
mortifying Christian is a most experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Christian: this is clear all along,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. where wrestling <hi>Paul</hi> hath so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
discoveries of himself, as he saith,
there being a law in his members rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
against the law of his minde, and
bringing him into subjection. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
there is much precious advantage
that redounds unto the Christian by being
convinced of the deceitfulness of his own
heart, and of that mystery of iniquity that
is within him, for such a Christian doth
attain to the exercise of the grace of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
for when he beholdeth himself as in a
glasse, he cryeth forth, <hi>Wo is me, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done:</hi>
I think it is in some sense lawfull
for Christians to practice much of <hi>Peters</hi>
divinity, which he had, <hi>Luk. 5. 8. Depart
from me, for I am a sinful man;</hi> not that it was
well argued by him, but it spake forth the
high apprehensions he had of the holiness
of God, and the low apprehensions he
had of himself: as likewise, such a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is much denyed to his own strength,
and so is necessitat to go unto one, on
whom his strength is laid, as likewise such
a Christian is much in the exercise of the
grace of watchfulnesse; he is not ignorant
of the devices of Sathan, which make him
to stand continually upon his guard, lest
he be overtaken with the snare of the
devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:65886:42"/>
There is this fifth advantage that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hath by being much in the exercise
of mortification, he doth attain to much
divine conformity with God, and is made
a partaker of the divine nature, of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Majesty: this is clear from, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 5.
where that promise, <hi>I will cloath him in
white,</hi> is in a part accomplished to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
even while he is in this valley of
tears. And certainly, this is the compend
and sweet epitome of all Christian advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
to be made like unto the Majesty of
God; and it is not a conformity unto
him for a day but such a mortifying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
is most constant in keeping the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
lineaments, and spiritual characters
of that precious image undefaced in him;
as it is promised, <hi>Rev. 3. 12. Him that
overcometh, I will make a pillar in the
temple of my God, and he shall go no
more out:</hi> And certainly that promise of
stability, is in a part accomplished to a
Christian, even while he is here below:
what could a Christian desire more then
this, to be admitted to partake of the
image of the invisible God, and to be
made like unto him?</p>
               <p>There is this last advantage that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hath, by being continually exercised
in this precious work of mortification, such
an one hath his antipathy and hatred
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65886:43"/>
against sin much increased: would you
know the Christian that liveth under the
impression of the sinfulnesse of sin? it is
the mortifying Christian. I think that
vain distinction which Papists have, of
mortal and venial sins, Christians in their
practice do much allow and commend;
there are some sins seems venial to them,
which to commit and exercise, they take a
latitude to themselves, as may be clear in
this, a Christian will without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
if he be not tender, commit such
things as are not consistent with the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of grace within him; he needs no
other toleration but this, to have this made
out to him that there is a consistency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
such a lust, and the living and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
nature of grace within him: but, no
doubt, if we argued right, we should be
provoked to desist from sin, even from the
disadvantages that attend the pursuing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any lust.</p>
               <p>Now that which we shall speak to next,
shall be this, what disadvantages a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hath by an interruption of this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
warfare, and not being much taken up
in the exercise of Mortification. If this
question were proposed to many, when
they did last set some hours apart to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
their sins? the most part should be put
to a <hi>non-plus,</hi> not knowing the last time
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65886:43"/>
when they were exercised in this precious
warfare. And I would only say this, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
that can interrupt the work of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
for some weeks together, may
either suspect that grace is groaning within
him, with the groanings of a deadly
wounded man; or else that he is not at all
begotten unto a lively hope, there is no
forloffe nor discharge in this warfare, but
we must fight till once the one foot be
within that place of everlasting delight.</p>
               <p>There is this second disadvantage that
attendeth a Christian who interrupteth this
warfare, ordinarily such a one doth contract
much hardnesse and impenitency of heart;
this was clear in the practice of <hi>David,</hi> who
when once he intermitted this war, could
write a letter to the killing of godly <hi>Uriah,</hi>
and no mention of smiting of heart: This
is certainly a constant attendant of one
who is not mortifying himself, he maketh
his heart <hi>die as a stone within him:</hi> the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
Christian keeps this holy Zeal
within him, <hi>he hateth the garments spotted
with the flesh:</hi> would ye read the original
and rise of hardnesse of heart in these
dayes amongst us? It is this, Christians
are not much in the exercise of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
And I believe the Gospel hath been
preached nigh six thousand years, and it is
much to be debated, if ever misbelief, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65886:44"/>
hardnesse of heart were so universal diseases
among Christians as in these dayes: we
think to win to heaven by gueste, which
maketh us so little intend this blessed work.</p>
               <p>There is this third disadvantage, that
a Christian meets with, by the intermission
of this warfare, and it is this, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
such a Christian hath his lusts most
reigning and living within him: Sin will
gather more strength, by the interruption
of one dayes exercise of Mortification, than
ye can prevail over, by wrestling with it
many dayes: This is that subtil dexterity
of sin, it can recruit it self in few hours with
much ease; and certainly, if ye be not
constant in this warfare, it is like ye will
not sing many songs of triumph over your
lusts: he must be constant in this fight,
who would be a triumpher in the fight:
how long is it since ye set up an <hi>Eben-ezer</hi>
to God, saying, <hi>hitherto to hath be helped me?</hi>
and when did ye set up trophies and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of your victory? We think the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of this age, leave sewest and least
trophies of their victory in the way to
heaven, as ever any that went before them.</p>
               <p>There is this fourth disadvantage which
a Christian hath, by the intermission of
this warfare, and it is this, that ordinarily
such a Christian liveth without sight of
return, and overcoming at the last: A
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65886:44"/>
Christian who interrupteth this exercise of
mortification, fighteth as we speak, with
a doubtful war, not having determined
whether the fight shall be in his favour or
not; there is somewhat of this pointed
out in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. where <hi>Paul</hi> fighting
in an agony, as the word importeth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth
himself that he shall have that
crown of righteousnesse, which is the
sutable reward of a conquering Christian:
and believe me, I know not what shall
afford a Christian, more Christian peace
and consolation than this, to believe, that
<hi>be shall put all enemies under his feet, and
make them his footstool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this fifth disadvantage, that a
Christian interrupting the exercise of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
hath, and it is this, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
such a one, when he is passing thorow
the first and second gates of death, and
when he is to render up an account of his
stewardship, hath least perswasion of his
interest in God. Would ye know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why Christians die with so little faith
of evidence? it is this, they have not been
much in the exercise of Mortification;
certainly, the conviction of short-coming
in this duty, and the apprehension of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and of approaching judgement, are
two sweet companions together: I think,
next to Justification and Faith in <hi>Iesus
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65886:45"/>
Christ,</hi> which is the hinge of all our conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
a Christian hath most peace in the
work of Mortification, in the day when
he shall be standing upon that utmost
line betwixt time and eternity. O! what
consolation had old <hi>Paul,</hi> when he spake
these words, when he was ready to be
dissolved, <hi>I have fought the good fight of faith;</hi>
I doubt much, if ever <hi>Paul</hi> sang a song of
praise upon a higher key, than when he
sung that song, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. I have fought
the good fight of faith: Pauls</hi> heart was half
transported, when he did reflect upon this,
that all his lusts were dying and killed at
his feet,</p>
               <p>And there is this last disadvantage that
attends a Christian, who interrupts this
warfare, that ordinarily such a one is much
blasted of God, in the exercise of other
graces; yea more, he is blasted in the
exercise of gifts; these two losses will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a Christian who interrupts this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
and certainly, if a Christian be
blasted in grace, and be not blasted in gifts,
it is one of the sorest stroaks that can befall
him; for ordinarily, it is a pillow sewed
under out arm-holls, which maketh us
pursue sin without fear: this is secretly
hinted at, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2. 9. where that which
made <hi>Solomon</hi> rove after his Idols, was this,
<hi>Also my wisdom remained with me:</hi> he was
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65886:45"/>
as wise a man now, as he was before. And
certainly, when gifts are vigorous, and
graces not, they may sit down and lament
over themselves <hi>seven nights and seven
dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we shall shut up our discourse at
this time: we shall only speak a little to
this, what may be spoken for consolation
to those who are somewhat serious in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing
this warfare, and yet have
not sensible advantage, nor successe over
their lusts, who have been toiling all night,
and yet have catched nothing; And we
conceive, that God doth ordinarily propose
to a tender Christian these three divine
ends, by carving out to them such a lot,
first that he may be kept in a constant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with the Throne of grace; he,
in a manner, wounds us in our leg, that
we may not wander much abroad from his
Throne: and certainly, Christians may
be convinced of this, that if they had their
will in Mortifying, they would not be
much in corresponding; which may be
demonstrat unto you thus, because that
which provoketh one to converse with
God, is rather a principle of necessity, than a
principle of love: a Christian will go six
times to prayer, yea many times, from a
principle of necessity, before he go twise
from a principle of love and delight.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65886:46"/>
Secondly, That the Christians faith may be
put to trials and exercised, whether or not
we will believe and rest upon him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that we see not Mortification
growing within us: we confesse, our
little advancement in Mortification, is the
foundation of misbelief: and certainly, to
his own, God hath this design, even the
trial of their grace, whether or not they
will believe and <hi>hope against hope.</hi>
Thirdly, The Lord doth it, because he
knoweth that a Christian can better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his little advancement in Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than he can improve his great success;
believe me it is certain, that in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
advancement in grace, it is more
difficulty to bear it, than to bear his little
advancement and progresse in grace; and
the great reason and occasion of it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
ordinarily pride and arrogancy do
blossom and spring off this precious root of
grace; for what doth decrease to a Christian
of the lust of the eye, and of the flesh, seems
to accrease to the pride of life; for as the one
seemeth to go down, the other doth ascend
and go up. And to you who never knew
what this exercise of Prayer and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
meant, (are there not many here who
never knew what it was to have any
change in their life?) We would only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this unto you, did ye never know
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65886:46"/>
what it was to be under the impression of
the sinfulnesse of sin? or, did you ever know
what it was to water your coutch with
tears, under the impression of it? like that
word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 3. where <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>When
I kept silence, my bones waxed old, through my
roaring all the day long.</hi> That word <hi>roaring</hi>
speaks forth not only this, that sometimes
a Christian doth rather mourn as a beast,
than complain as a man, (<hi>roaring</hi> being
the voice of a beast) but likewayes speaks
forth this, that sometimes Christians are
under such an exercise, that the open field
is a more fit place for them, then the secret
retirements of their most quiet chambers.
<hi>David</hi> was forced to roar as a beast, when
the bones which are the pillars of his
house, were waxing old and mouldering
within him: certainly the day is coming,
when ye who never knew what it was to
crucifie a lust, <hi>Christ</hi> shall crucifie you
upon that crosse of everlasting pain, when
he shall treade you in the win-presse of
the indignation of the most High, when he
shall make the arrowes of his indignation
sharp upon you; ye who will not quite
sin, sin shall once be your eternal compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
and when Christ hath been inviting
you so often to quite such lusts, and ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
so often an negative answer to him,
this will be the sentence, which shall <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:65886:47"/>
past upon you, <hi>Be it unto you, even as you
will, they are joyned to Idols, let them alone;</hi>
and certainly, when Christ ceaseth to be a
reprover, that man is in a sad and desperat
estate. O! that ye might once fight this
good fight of faith: your scent doth remain
with many of you; are there not many
here who never knew what it was to
spend an hour in secret wrestling and
debating with their lusts? The strong man
keeps the house, and so all is at peace with
them, there is no going out, nor coming
in at the gates of their city, but peace is as
it were, exactors of that house, and those
bear sway within it. O! cursed be that
peace which shall end in everlasting warre
with God. Would ye know the exercise
and case of those who are in everlasting
chains? We can represent it under nothing
so fit as this, it is infinit justice and infinit
omnipotency, wresting and crushing
finit and sinfull man; sometimes the pestil
of divine wrath coming down upon one
part of his body, and at another time upon
another; they are now living an endlesse
life of death, and are spending their dayes
in a dying life, they shall be eternally
dying, and yet never able to die. Are there
not some of you, who are so joyned to
your Idols, that if <hi>Dives</hi> shonld come from
hell and preach this text to you, <hi>Crucifie your
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65886:47"/>
lusts,</hi> ye would stop your ears at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
exhortation. Ye may hide sin under
your tongue, but be preswaded, that at
last it shall be in your belly as the poison of
Asps, and as the venome of Dragons. And
we would leave this advice and counsel
upon Christians, who have begun this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
warfare, <hi>stand fast to the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Christ hath made you free, and be not
entangled again into that yoke of bondage.</hi> Sin
is a yoke that neither we nor our fathers
were able to bear; and we desire you to
meditate upon this advice, Study to be as
much in mortification, and in the exercise
of this duty, as if ye were to obtain salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by works; but withall, study to be as
much denied unto those things, and to
have as low an esteem of your selves, as if
ye were bound to do nothing, or had done
nothing at all: study to work as one that
is a legalist indeed, and one who desires
to maintain good works, but study self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial,
as one that hath fied for refuge unto
that blessed hope that is set before you.
<hi>Christ</hi> is standing at the end of the walk of
a Mortifying Christian, with a crown in
his right hand, and he desireth us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe
unto the end; that we may obtain
that immortal <hi>crown:</hi> one day with precious
<hi>Christ,</hi> shall be an infinite recompense of
all our toil; and the more exercise of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65886:48"/>
mortification you are put to, heaven
will be more sweet and delightsome unto
you.</p>

               <p>SUch is that universal stupidity and
hardnesse of heart that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the professors of this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that if <hi>Christ</hi> should come from
heaven and read over unto us the compleat
rol of our iniquities, and show unto us these
records, in which all our wanderings are
written, the most part of us would not be
much affected, not much in the exercise of
sorrow. No doubt, it is easier for a camel
to passe thorow the eye of a needle, than
for stupid Christians, such as we are, to
enter into the Kingdom of <hi>God.</hi> It is one
of the mysteries of his overcoming grace,
that he hath not broken these two preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
staffes of beauty and bands amongst
us, that he hath not broken the covenant of
his peace, and ceased to entertain so near
a relation betwixt himself and us. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
it is a mystery of his love, that we
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65886:48"/>
are not made eternal monuments of the
justice of <hi>God,</hi> and this Motto engraven
upon us, <hi>behold these that made not God their
refuge: God</hi> is glorious in the exercise of
all his holy attributes, but in none more,
than in the exercise of his patience and
long-suffering toward us; and in a manner
he darkeneth the glory of his justice, and
casteth a vail over his spotlesse holinesse,
that the exercise of the attribute of patience
and long-suffering, may be rendered more
conspicuous. I only pose you with this
question, is not mortification a mystery
unto your practice? Can such a delusion as
this overtake you, that ye shall reign with
<hi>Christ,</hi> though your lusts reign with you as
long as ye are here? It is certain ye know,
that mortification is that precious exercise
in which ye ought to be taken up: and I
conceive, that there is only this difference
betwixt sinning against Light, and that
unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost,
that the sinning against Light, is a sinning
against the common work of the spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your understanding, but the sin against
the Holy Ghost, is a sin against the <hi>common</hi>
work of the spirit upon the affections: and
no doubt, there is a near bordering betwixt
these two, it is the first step to it, by which
ye go up and ascend unto the acting of this
sin. It is a faithful saying (saith the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65886:49"/>
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>) that <hi>if we die with Christ, we
shall also reign with him;</hi> and we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
say, It is a faithful saying, that if
we be not with Christ, and be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
unto him in his suffering, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be conformed unto him, in the power
of his resurrection: ye are all willing to
take <hi>Christ</hi> as a <hi>Iustifier</hi> and as a <hi>Saviour,</hi>
but unwilling to take him as a <hi>Sanctifier</hi>
and as a <hi>Prince:</hi> but know this, that the
gifts of this spotlesse Lamb, are so sweetly
linked together, that they were like his own
coat that was upon his body, which was
without seam that could not be divided:
and so except the whole gifts of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
fall unto us by divine lot, we can have no
part nor portion therein: This Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the compend of Christianity; and
certainly, a Christian reading these words,
he may stand amazed and be ashamed at
his own stupidity, that interest in <hi>Christ</hi>
should be connected with such a degree of
Mortification, though we conceive, there
be many who take to themselves the name
of Christians, that never knew what it was
to exercise themselves in Mortification.</p>
               <p>I shall only (before I speak to that
which mainly we intend to speak to) press
this grace of Mortification upon you by
these things. First, This may enforce this
duty of Mortification of lusts, because it is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65886:49"/>
impossible for one to satisfie their lusts, let
them accomplish never so diligent a search
to find satisfaction to them; therefore ye
would be undeceived and convinced of that
delusion, ye conceive that if your lusts had
their desire, they would be satisfied, but
that is most clearly held forth to be false,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 29, 30. where it is said of their
lusts, <hi>they got their hearts desire,</hi> and the
word that is subjoyned, <hi>yet were they not
estranged from their lusts.</hi> Let a covetous
man suppose this with himself, that upon
the having of so many thousands in the
world, his lust of covetousnesse would be
satisfied, but <hi>Iob</hi> doth refute this, chap. 20.
22. saying, <hi>in the fulnesse of his sufficiency,
he shall be in straits:</hi> It is easier to mortifie
your lusts, then to satisfie them. And this
secondly we would say, that though ye
hide sin under your tongue, and though it
be sweet unto you yet know, that the day
is approaching when it shall be in your
bowels, as the gall of Alpes, and as the
poyson of Dragons: know this for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
that the momentany pleasures of sin
which they afford unto you are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be compared with that eternal
weight of unsupportable misery that shall
be inflicted upon you. O! but it is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
sight to behold <hi>a living God</hi> entring
eternally in the lists with a poor sinfull sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65886:50"/>
to have omnipotency and justice fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against the dust of his feet. There is
this lastly which we would say, not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
your selves constantly in this precious
work of Mortification, doth interrupt
much precious fellowship, that you might
have with <hi>Christ;</hi> ye that are tasting of
the sweetnesse of sin, cannot taste of the
sweetnesse of heaven: this is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13.
where mortifiers have that promise, that
<hi>they shall live.</hi> And I shall only say this
by the way, we conceive it to be a question
that is difficult to determine, whether it be
more for the advantage of one that is under
any predominant lust, to have the objects
upon which it seeds withdrawn, or to have
them furnished, to feed upon: as for
instance, if one be under the woful predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
of pride, it is a question whether
the want of occasion to exercise and feed
that lust, be better, or to have it; proud
<hi>Achitophel,</hi> when he wanted the objects
upon which pride doth feed, he will go and
strangle himself; and when we have them
furnished unto us, what secret Idolatry,
what desperat Atheism do we commit in
the secret temples of our heart, and in the
chambers of our Imagry? Mortifie more,
or ye shall pray lesse.</p>
               <p>Now that which we intend mainly to
speak to, is that second thing which we
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65886:50"/>
poposed concerning Mortification, from
these words, and it was the extent of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
that they did not only crucifie
their predominant lusts, which are here
called <hi>affections,</hi> because they are Idols, and
these are linked together by that passion of
love; but likewayes they ought to mortifie
the first motions and stirrings of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and all occasions to it, which are here
called <hi>lusts:</hi> but moreover, one that is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
mortifier, must mortifie original sin,
which is here called <hi>the flesh,</hi> as oft-times it
hath that name in Scripture, an exercise
which is unknown to many, if not unto all:
we think original sin but a <hi>Zoar,</hi> and it is
hard indeed, to be convinced of the sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of original sin, and to take it up in its
native collours. Now in speaking upon the
work of Mortification of original sin, we
shall not insist long upon this, that it is the
duty of a Christian to be exercised in the
crucifying of this sin, it is clear from, <hi>Coll.</hi>
3. 5. where we are commanded to mortifie
<hi>our members;</hi> and it is clear from the practice
of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I
am, who shall deliver me from this body of death?</hi>
there is a strong Emphasis in the word <hi>me,</hi>
as if <hi>Paul</hi> would have said, if infinit grace
can have bounds, then, no doubt, sinful
<hi>Paul</hi> is the bounds fixed to it.</p>
               <p>We shall for more clear speaking to this,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65886:51"/>
first, speak a little unto this, what is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin; and we conceive, that it stands
in these, original sin is the imputation of
that transgression of <hi>Adam</hi> unto us; for he
being a common and representative person,
we fell in his falling, and did stand in his
standing, but likewayes original sin doth
comprehend this, want of original righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
man not being created after that
noble pattern and divine Idea, <hi>the Image of
God;</hi> man now carrieth but the image of
<hi>God</hi> in his wisdom and in his omnipotency,
but while he was in his primitive estate, he
did carry an impression of the holinesse of
<hi>God:</hi> as likewayes original sin doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
this, a proneness to the committing
of all evil, as also an ineptitude and unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for the doing of any good, and this is
that which we are all by nature. The first
part of original sin is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12.
and 14. verses. And the rest may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from many places of Scripture, but is
comprehended in that one word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1.
<hi>We were dead in sins and trespasses:</hi> one can
no more move in the acting of any spiritual
good, than if he were one altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
life</p>
               <p>We shall secondly speak a little to those
advantages that a Christian may have, by
being convinced of original sin: I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is most
certain, that a Christian is lesse convinced
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65886:51"/>
of original corruption, than he is of any
actual transgression almost that doth befal
him; and (as we were speaking) the
reason of it doth proceed partly from this,
that a Christian taketh not up the sinfulness
of original sin, though it be a sin having
more in it, than is in twenty, yea an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
actual transgressions: or else it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from this, that Christians are not
convinced what influence original sin hath
upon all the outward actings of iniquity;
it is that fruitful womb that doth alwayes
bear twins, and is never barren; it is that
root that doth dayly bring forth worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
and gall: or else it doth proceed
from this, that we think that original sin
is not our own, and that we are not so
guilty, as if indeed we had eaten this cursed
Apple.</p>
               <p>But as to the advantages of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of original corruption, we conceive
that there is this first advantage, That it is
impossible for any to have high thoughts of
<hi>Iesus Christs</hi> love, and of the offer of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
except he be convinced of original sin:
Would ye know the reason why <hi>Christ</hi> hath
so small an esteem among you? it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of this, ye are not convinced of your
original corruption: this is somewhat
pointed at, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. verses, where
the Apostle heighteneth the love of <hi>Christ</hi> in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65886:52"/>
dying for us, he pitches upon this to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it, our original corruption, that <hi>we
were sinners and without strength.</hi> O! what a
mystery is the condescending grace of <hi>Christ</hi>
unto a sinner believing original corruption;
it is as it were, the foundation upon which
all our esteem doth arise and spring: there is
somewhat of this likewayes pointed at,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24 compared with vers. 25. where
<hi>Paul</hi> beginning to commend free grace, his
song doth arise to the highest key, because
he hath been convinced of <hi>this body of
death that dwelleth within him.</hi> I would
only say this, if you would learn this divine
lesson of putting a high accompt upon
<hi>Christ,</hi> study original corruption much.</p>
               <p>There is this second advantage that a
Christian hath from the conviction of it,
and it is this, it doth exceedingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the omnipotency of his grace in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
corruption, when ye are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of this sin: when was it that <hi>Paul</hi> had
the highest accompt of the omnipotency
of the grace of <hi>Christ?</hi> was it not when he
was forced to cry forth, <hi>O! wretched man
that I am, who shall deliver me from this body
of death?</hi> And this is certainly pointed at,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. where the quickening vertue of
grace, is commended from this, the object
upon which it is exercised, <hi>ye that were
dead in in sins and trespasses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:65886:52"/>
There is this third advantage, that floweth
from conviction of original sin, and it is
this. It is a compendious way to keep the
Christian under the exercise of humility,
under the highest attainments of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or under the highest attainments of
communion and fellowship with God.
Would ye know the reason why we are so
easily puffed up under some small successe,
or some small familiarity with <hi>Christ?</hi> It is
want of reflect thoughts upon original
corruption that is within us: Therefore I
would prescribe this to Christians under
their highest advancement by grace, to sit
down and seriously reflect upon that which
they are by nature, <hi>that their father is an
Amorite, and their Mother an Hittite,</hi> and
the rock from whence they are hewn, may
preach humility to them; this is clear,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. where <hi>Paul</hi> under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of original sin, calleth himself a
<hi>wretched man,</hi> and is clear also from the
9. vers. of that Chapter, where when once
original sin is discovered, <hi>he died</hi> in his
own apprehensions: if we were in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of this more, the wind of the
wildernesse would not bind us up in her
wings, till our substance were dissolved.</p>
               <p>There is a fourth advantage a Christian
hath from the conviction of original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and it is this, it keepeth the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65886:53"/>
Christian under the deepest impression of
the sinfulnesse of sin. I confesse, that is
one of the greatest mysteries of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
to have our soul constantly under
the impression of the sinfulness of sin, which
we conceive, is impossible to be attained
without solid conviction of original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
this is somewhat hinted at, <hi>Rom.</hi>
7. 13. when <hi>Paul</hi> once by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
having original sin discovered, sin
became unto him <hi>exceeding sinful:</hi> and the
reason why original sin discovered, hath
such influence upon this, is because ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
we conceive, that the actings of sin
do not proceed from our selves, but from
<hi>that deceiver of the brethren,</hi> which <hi>Iames</hi>
doth abundantly refute, for when a man
is tempted, <hi>he is entised by his lusts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this fifth advantage that a
Christian hath by being convinced of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin; It is an excellent way to keep
the Christian under a most watchful and
fearing frame: such language would not
been heard out of a <hi>Hazaels</hi> mouth, <hi>Am I a
dog to commit this</hi> if he had been convinced
of original sin; but because he was a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to this, his presumption led him above
that which was indeed within him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when one is convinced of their prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to act iniquity, of their want of that
conformity with God, they remember to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65886:53"/>
stand upon their watch-tower lest they be
ensnared: this is most clearly pointed at,
I <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. last, where <hi>Paul</hi> is put to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
I <hi>bear down my body, and bring it into
subjection;</hi> and the reason is subjoyned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was possessed with a holy jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of himself, and entertained a divine sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion,
which was consistent with the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of hope. I know nothing to make a
Christian watch over his own heart so
much as this: to see that spawn of iniquity
which is within him, to behold that fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
mother of iniquity which never was
declared barren, and never shall be, till sin
shall be no more within his own.</p>
               <p>There is this fixth advantage a Christian
hath, by being convinced of original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
It is that which will keep the
soul under the highest estimation of <hi>Christ,</hi>
and will make the grace of love to burn
most vigorously within a Christian: O!
but when one shall reflect upon these two,
the spotlesse <hi>holinesse of Christ,</hi> that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
purity of that precious Lamb, and
shall again descend to reflect upon these
mysteries of iniquitiy which are within
himself, it is no wonder that sometimes he
be put to use <hi>Peters</hi> divinity, to cry forth,
<hi>Depart from me, for I am a sinful man;</hi> but
when he improveth the sight most fully,
his case is, to have his soul transported, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65886:54"/>
as it were, in a holy extasie of love, toward
that precious and matchless One.</p>
               <p>And there is this last advantage that a
a Christian hath by being convinced of
original sin, It is that which putteth a
Christian to a holy diffidence in his own
strength, and maketh him to be much in
the employment of the strength of him
whose name is <hi>Iehovah.</hi> What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that Christians commit a breach of that
first Command, so much trusting to their
own strength, and not making mention of
<hi>his righteousnesse,</hi> and laying hold upon <hi>his
strength, even upon his only?</hi> It is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we do not dwell under the constant
impression of original corruption. We
conceive it is as great a mystery to mens
judgement, as it is a mystery to their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
to mortifie it. What made <hi>Paul</hi> so
much to cry forth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. to disclaim
his own ability, and <hi>ver.</hi> 23. was it not
the conviction of original sin which was
within him?</p>
               <p>Now that which we shall secondly speak
unto, shall be this, to presse a little upon
you the necessity of the mortification of
original sin: and we conceive these things
point out its necessity; first this, That
all mortification is in vain, and as the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the air, untill once original corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be mortified: What is all your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65886:54"/>
without this? it is, as it were,
the lopping off of the branches, while the
root doth remain intire, it is a damning up
of the streams, while the fountain is still
running; and no doubt, that mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will easily grow vain: you must once
mortifie this which is the mother of sin.
And we would only say this by the way,
that under correction, we conceive, that
original sin is not, nor cannot well be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in the body, but only is to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in the members, that is, we must study
to mortifie such a part of original sin, to
mortifie some living lusts, which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us, and to be groaning under the rest;
for we conceive, it is hard to take up the
whole body of original sin, and to make
that the subject of mortification, or to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over it.</p>
               <p>There is this secondly, which speaks
forth the necessity of Mortification of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sin, it is that which is an undeniable
evidence of a Christian, to be taken up in
the mortifying of this sin; for we conceive it
to be impossible for a hypocrite to attain to
such a length, as to study the real mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of original corruption: It was the
practice of these two holy men, the Apostle
<hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 24. and of <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 51. 5.
where they sit down to lament over the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
which was within them. And the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65886:55"/>
reason why the mortification of original
sin, is an undenyable character and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a Christian is, not only from this,
that one that setteth about the mortification
of original sin, is a Christian that hath
most distinct discoveries of himself, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
some discoveries of the holinesse and
spotlesnesse of God. It is hard to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of original sin by the light of nature,
if at all, for to us it is a question, if he can
be, which the Apostle seemeth to intimate,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. Saying, <hi>I had not known lust,
except the Lord had said, Thou shalt not
covet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this, thirdly, which speaks forth
the necessity of the mortification of original
corruption, that all the duties that proceed
from a Christian, are exceeding defiled and
polluted, except he endeavour the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of this sin: for this was a paradox
to the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> chap. 3. 11. <hi>That a
fountain at one place shall send forth bitter wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and sweet:</hi> and till the fountain of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
be removed, it is probably to be
conceived, that all the actings of duty by
us shall be exceedingly polluted. O! but
when original sin lyes without the stroak
of a Christians mortification, his duties
will not ascend with acceptance upon his
Altar.</p>
               <p>And there is this fourthly which pleads
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65886:55"/>
the necessity of the Mortification of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sin, that it is that sin which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
war against the grace of God in
a Christian: would you know why grace
is in such a languishing estate? it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the power of original sin. We
conceive this, that the opposition of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sin to the advancement of grace, is more
invisible, and the opposition of actual cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
unto the actings of grace, is more
visible and obvious; but certainly that
which doth intangle a Christian in his
walk, and maketh him not to ascend as
pillars of smoak from this present wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
is <hi>that original sin;</hi> this is clear from
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. and, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. Where <hi>the
spirit warreth against the flesh, and the flesh
against the spirit, and these two are contrary
one to another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that which thirdly, we shall speak
upon the mortification of original sin,
shall be this, what is the way how a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may be convinced and brought unto
the spiritual impression of original sin?
And certainly we conceive, that if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
shall exercise himself in these three,
he may attain to some spiritual convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this sin. First, let him be much in
the exercise of self-examination, and when
he shall reflect upon himself, he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the invisible motions of iniquity unto
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65886:56"/>
every sin that hath been named among
the Gentiles: who is so great a stranger
unto his own heart, but if he will reflect
upon it, may sometimes see the stirrings
of unknown (almost) corruptions?
which speaketh that aloud to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
that there is a fountain and spring
within him, that would send forth such
bitter waters, except they were graciously
restrained.</p>
               <p>There is this secondly, by which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may be brought to the conviction of
original sin, and it is, to be much in the
exercise of the study of the spirituality of
the law, which was the way that <hi>Paul</hi>
attained to the conviction of original sin,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. It is that compendious cut, by
which one may behold that holinesse of
<hi>God</hi> who imposeth a command not only to
desist from the actings of sin, but to desist
also from the first motions and lusts of sin.</p>
               <p>There is this lastly, a Christian would
be much in the exercise of prayer, for that
spirit who convinceth the world of sin,
that what you do not know as of your
selves, he who is the great convincer
of the world, may imprint those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
upon your souls, which may
make you sit down and bewail your
selves, in the bitternesse of your spirit.
And we shall at this time shut up our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65886:56"/>
only we would say to these who
are entertaining this holy warfare against
their corruptions, that they would not be
much discouraged, though they see not
sensible victory: you must know that
sin must be with you while you have a
being: we may certainly allude unto that
word, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 12. and may say, that the
dominion of your sins shall be taken
a way, though their lives shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
for a time and for a season. As
likewayes we would say this for your
encouragment, who have your corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
stirring most within you, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
Sathan when he is in the way to
remove, then stirreth and acteth most;
as it is observed, that the last beating of
the pulse in a dying man is most strong, so
the beating of corruption, when it is
going to be cast out, may be most violent.
And we shall only give the reason, why
Christians are not much affected with
this, that the day is coming when once
they shall prevail over their corruptions,
and shall tread Sathan under their feet;
why the feet of those who bring such glad
tyding are not beautiful upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains?
And we conceive that it doth
either proceed from this, that Christians
are not seriously engaged in this holy war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
for that is most certain, that if you
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65886:57"/>
were fighting day by day, then the hope
of victory, and of a blessed issue would
be as glad tyding; from a far country, and
should be as cold water unto a thirsty soul,
that though your hope were deferred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
your hearts were sick, yet the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of your desires should be sweet
to your souls: or else it doth proceed from
this, that Christians do not believe this
truth, that there is an issue and period of
their fight; if once you could be brought
this length to seal this truth, that that
victory shall be once heard in heaven,
<hi>Speak comfortably to Ierusalem, for her war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
is accomplished,</hi> if we may allude unto
these words; or if a Christian be seriously
debating with his lusts, and hath also the
faith of this truth in some measure, then it
doth proceed lastly from this, want of the
distinct perswasions of our interest, and
want of the assurance of our peace with
him; for as long as a Christian is under
debate concerning his eternal rest, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be much affected with joy, under
the declaration of these means, that
there is a period of their fight, and that
they who have <hi>been made partakers of the
first resurrection, over them the second death
shall have no power.</hi> O! what a blessed
day suppose ye shall that be, when your
feet shall stand within the gate of the new
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65886:57"/>
Jerusalem, when you shall receive these
two precious badges and eternal trophies
of your victory, <hi>a crown put upon your head,</hi>
of infinit more value than all material
crowns, and <hi>a palm put in your hand.</hi> We
conceive, it is impossible to determine,
what joy will accrue to a Christian upon
the reflect thoughts of this, that he hath
trode Sathan under his feet, and hath bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the head of him, who hath so oft bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his heel: And as for those who are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
(as the most part of us are) unto this
spiritual warfare, be convinced of this,
that within threescore and fewer years,
God shall enter into an eternal warfare
with you, where there shall be no cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of armes, neither shall there be any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption.
It is better to fight with your
lusts, than to fight with <hi>a living and eternal
God,</hi> when he shall declare himself to be
your opposite and enemy. Man once was
made perfect, but he did find out many
inventions, and amongst all those inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he found that accursed one, how there
might be a separation betwixt him and
the <hi>living God;</hi> and except <hi>He</hi> whose name
is <hi>Prudence,</hi> and hath found out the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of many witty inventions, had found
out that precious invention of reconciling
sinners unto God, we should have been
<hi>Magor Missabib,</hi> terrors to our selves. O!
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65886:58"/>
that you might be perswaded once to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with your lusts, that ye may endure
the heat of the day, and the cold of the
night, in wrestling against sin; know this,
that <hi>sin goeth not out, but by fasting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi>
it is so straitly united unto us, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
for a camel to passe thorow the eye of
a needle, than for many of us to mortifie
our corruptions. We shall shut up all
that we would say in this one word, be
perswaded of this, that the day is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
and near at hand, when our
<hi>blessed Lord Iesus</hi> shall come with ten
thousands of his Saints: what if this
were the day (O unmortified sinners!)
that ye should behold that white Throne
Fixed in the clouds, and ye should have a
summons given into your hands without
continuation of dayes, to appear before
his Tribunal? What could ye answer
when ye are reproved? Would not si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and confession be your best desence?
Certainly there is an eternal curse to be
pronunced against those who do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
themselves unto this precious act of
Godlinesse, of <hi>crucifying the flesh, with the
lusts and affections thereof.</hi> There is a law
of death over your head, and there is a
law of sin, which is within your hearts,
and ye shall be eternally subjects unto
these two Laws, except <hi>the Law of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of life do make you free.</hi>

               <p>THe walk of a Christian, who
hath <hi>Christ</hi> in him <hi>the hope
of glory,</hi> is most sublime, and it
being from spiritual principles,
for spiritual ends, is also according to a
spiritual rule. The walk of a Christian
is from <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love in Iesus Christ,</hi> as
that predominant principle; nay more,
from the spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> living in the soul
of a Christian by faith, and dwelling in
it by love, which is that <hi>primum mobile,</hi>
and first wheel of all its motions; as
likewise, it is for a spiritual end, it being
<hi>for the glory of God,</hi> and to subordinate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this, their own salvation and advantage:
they are not like <hi>Ephraim, empty vines bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth fruit unto themselves,</hi> but it is their
design to make <hi>Christ all,</hi> and themselves
nothing, though it be natural unto a man
to <hi>deifie</hi> himself, and to make himself the
first <hi>Alpha</hi> of his actings, and the last <hi>Ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi>
of all his performances: as likewise,
it is according to a spiritual rule, it being
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65886:59"/>
conformed unto that precious <hi>word of life,</hi>
which is perfect in it self, and leadeth man
unto perfection. But this is a lamentation,
and shall be for a lamentation, that we love
to take such a liberty to our selves, and such
a latitude in our way and walk to heaven.
There is much fear and complaint amongst
many, for the losse of their civil liberties,
and that they are detained captives in their
own land by the hand of straingers, but
there is a captivity and bondage that is
lesse lamented, and yet more intolerable,
and that is, the bondage of <hi>sin and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
that though we should expire and
spend seventy years (which is one of the
utmost lines of our life) under this cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
yet we should not cry forth, <hi>Return
our captivity, as the rivers of the south.</hi> Are
there not many amongst us, who ly with
as much contentment under the bonds of
their sin, and fetters of their iniquity, as
if they were chains of Gold, and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of fine gold? Mortification is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
unto our practice: That which was
a paradox to <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>a man should find
his enemy and yet keep him alive,</hi> that para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
is often commited in these dayes,
when we do not study to crucifie the lusts
and affections of our hearts. I think,
Christians in these dayes, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon those unmortified corruptions
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65886:59"/>
that are within them, must be constrained
to cry forth, that all their hope doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in this, <hi>that a living dog is better than a
dead lyon,</hi> and that their confidence is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
upon this, that yet they are within
this side of eternity. We love singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in opinion, but hate singularity in
practice, though the one, no doubt, is much
more commendable than the other. May
we not wish for two moneths, wherein
we may go unto the mountains and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
our virginity, that we have not been
espoused unto that precious and excellent
one <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and that we have not
been endeavouring to conform our selves
unto his blessed and precious image? We
confesse this may be a mystery to many
every day, that they are not eternal monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the justice and indignation of
<hi>God,</hi> and that somewhat of <hi>Cains</hi> divinity
doth not possesse our hearts, that <hi>whosoever
shall find us, shall kill us.</hi> We would only
say this, that ye would be as much in the
exercise of the mortification of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
lusts, as ye are in the exercise of the
mortification of your visible lusts and
iniquities.</p>
               <p>At the last occasion that we spoke upon
these words, we told you that the second
thing that was held forth concerning Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
was the extent of it, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65886:60"/>
ought to mortifie not only original
corruption, but also his predominant lusts,
and the first motions and occasions unto
sin. Concerning the mortification of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin, we have spoken somewhat, and
shall insist no further: only we would say
this, that we laid down this as a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that original sin could not be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in its body, but only was to be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in its members, and the ground of this
assertion we conceived to be this, because
it is impossible for a Christian to take up
original sin in its body, as is clear from
<hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 9. where it is said, <hi>that the heart
is deceitful above all things, and desperatly
wicked, who can know it?</hi> It is above the
reach of any man to fathom and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the deceitfulnesse of his own heart.
It is a mystery that was never unfolded,
and as long as we are within time, cannot
be unfolded. We would only say this,
that a Christian who is convinced of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin, that there is the spawn and seed
of every imaginable corruption within
him will be much in the magnifying of
restraining grace, and will sit down, and
pen a song of praise unto the unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
grace of <hi>Christ;</hi> who hath redeemed
them. I confesse, that which makes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
have so much to do with pardoning
grace, which was <hi>Davids</hi> practice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:65886:60"/>
25. 32. We may call original sin <hi>Gad,</hi> for
after, it cometh forth a <hi>Troup, chorus vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
a troup of vices; it is that fruitful
womb that doth alwayes bear <hi>Twins.</hi> And
we conceive, that Christians who are so
called, ought to be much in the study of
original sin. It is a wonder, that we
walk with such woful contentment to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and to that imagined happinesse which
we suppose to have: can such a delusion
as this overtake you, that you can <hi>reap in
joy,</hi> who never did <hi>sew in tears,</hi> and that
you can return, bringing <hi>sheaves in your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,</hi>
who never went forth bearing <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
seed?</hi> we think to climb to heaven by
that short ladder of presumption: I would
say it, and wishes that you may consider
it, we are affraid that there shall be many
woful and sad disappointments of many
of our hopes, and we shall be constrained
to reject our confidence: we separat those
things which <hi>God</hi> hath conjoyned, we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pursue for holinesse without justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or else we pursue for justification
without holinesse.</p>
               <p>Now in speaking upon the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of predominant lusts, which are here
called <hi>affections,</hi> because the spirit of a
Christian, and of any, are most strongly
united unto these, we shall not insist to
prove this unto you, that it is the duty of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65886:61"/>
a Christian, or of any, to mortifie their
predominant lusts, it is clear from <hi>Matth:</hi>
18. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. Where we are commended <hi>to
pluck out our right eye, if it offend us,</hi> the
meaning of which is this, that if we had a
lust as dear to us as our right eye, if it hurt
and offend us, we should pluck it out; and
from <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 45. and 47. and from <hi>Coll.</hi>
3. 5. where we are commanded to <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
our inordinat affections.</hi> Neither
shall we insist much upon that distinction
of predominant lusts, that there are some
predominant lusts, which are more pure
and refined, which ordinarily passe under
the notion and vail of vertue, as pride,
when it is mixed with prudence in its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
passeth under the vail of generosity,
and highness of spirit and prodigality
when it is not sensual and brutish, passeth
under the notion of mortification to the
world; and Sathan in tempting people to
the acting of these predominant lusts, doth
not only study to gain the affections, but
likewayes studieth to gain our light and
our judgement unto the acting of these
things: There are some predominant lusts
which are more grosse; the sinfulness of
which is more easily discerned, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
in tempting people to the acting of
these lusts, studieth mainly to gain the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which in so far gaineth the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65886:61"/>
as it sets about to devise and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
upon the way, how such predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
lusts may be effectuat and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.
O! but the mind of man will
plot subtil iniquity, and the affection and
heart will execute the plottings of the
minde, with greatest carefulness and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity.</p>
               <p>Now that which first we shall speak
upon the work of mortification of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
lusts, shall be this, what are these
disadvantages that a Christian hath by
not studying to mortifie and crucifie his
predominant lusts, but giving way and
concession to them to live.</p>
               <p>The first disadvantage we conceive to
be this, that a Christian who is not much
in the mortification of his predominant
lusts, doth hinder much of that precious
fellowship and divine familiarity which
should be betwixt <hi>God</hi> and him; the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
way to the King of our lusts to live,
separats friends, and that word is true, <hi>that
a brother offended is harder to be won, than
the bars of a strong castle.</hi> Now this is
clear from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 5. where it is said,
<hi>They are estranged from me by their idols:</hi>
as likewise, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. of that chapter, <hi>Every
one that separateth himself, whether of Israel
or of a stranger, and setteth up idols in his
heart.</hi> Separation from <hi>God,</hi> and that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65886:62"/>
woful idolatry, are two inseparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions:
as likewise, it is clear from
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 10. where these are conjoyned
again; and <hi>Isa. 59. 2. Your iniquities have
separated betwixt you and me.</hi> And I would
only say this, that a Christian who can to
his apprehension, find some sweetness and
enjoyment of <hi>God,</hi> without the exercise of
mortification may question much the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his enjoyment: And it is certain,
that the entertaining of predominant lusts,
doth exceedingly interrupt communion
and fellowship with <hi>God.</hi> not only because
of this, that predominant lusts, when they
are in exercise, do exceedingly weaken a
Christian in diligence, and in his zeal and
servency in going about these duties, by
which communion with <hi>God</hi> is attained:
Some folks predominant lusts have gotten
such advantage over them, that they will
almost cease to pray without conviction,
or if they be convinced, their convictions
will suddenly evanish: but also because of
this, that when a predominant lust is in
its vigorous exercise, then a Christian
loseth much of the impression of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of communion and fellowship with
<hi>Christ.</hi> O! but <hi>Christ</hi> might live long
in heaven, ere we give him a visit; we
think we could be happy without him,
and that is but an imaginary delusion of
our lying lusts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:65886:62"/>
There is this second disadvantage that a
Christian hath by not studying to crucify
his predominant lusts, and it this, that
such a Christian doth not receive any
return of prayer, and God doth deny to
him the answer of his desires. This is
clear from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 31. where he saith,
<hi>Do ye pollute your selves with your Idols, and
come and enquire at me? As I live, saith the
Lord, I will not be enquired of by you.</hi> And
this was the divinity of that blind man,
<hi>Ioh. 9. 31. God heareth not sinners:</hi> And
it was the divinity of <hi>David,</hi> Ps. 66. <hi>If</hi> I
<hi>regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear
my prayer:</hi> and most clearly, <hi>Is.</hi> 59. 2.
where their iniquities doth cause him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to hear their sutes. O! but there are
many Inhibitions served in heaven against
the Professors of this generation, that they
should pray and not be heard, and should
cry and yet not have accesse: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is no wonder, that such prayers
as we present unto God, while our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
lusts are in exercise, be not
heard; we pray to God with such indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency
and formality, as in a manner,
we turn over our prayers unto a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to salute God with in the morning,
and to take our farewell of him at night;
we know not much more use of many of
our prayers, and hence it is that he denyeth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65886:63"/>
to us the answer of them. I would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speak this to you, let Christians hearts
first speak the words which they are to
speak in prayer, and then let their words
speak their heart, that their heart may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
that which is the matter of their
desires.</p>
               <p>There is this third disadvantage that
a Christian hath by entertaining his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
lusts, and it is this, it doth
excedingly interrupt a Christians motion
unto heaven: how far have you gone
these many dayes, or these many years?
the motion of Christians is retrograde
in these dayes, they go backward, but
do not go on from strength to strength.
O! that we might give obedience to that
command, which is, <hi>Heb. 2. 4. Let us
lay aside every weight and sin that doth beset
us, and run with patience the race that is set
before us;</hi> more Mortification would
make more motion towards heaven then
we do attain to.</p>
               <p>There is this fourth disadvantage that a
Christian hath by entertaining his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
lusts, and it is this, that when
predominant lust is not mortified, then any
corruption that is within you, will easily
be discovered in the day of trial; the <hi>Lord</hi>
oft-times taketh that revenge upon many,
that because they would not mortifie at
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65886:63"/>
home, he will write their iniquities in
legible letters upon their foreheads, that
those that run may read them: and if
Christians believed this more, that God
may be provoked to write your lusts
that are not mortified, in capital letters
upon your forehead, it might provoke
you more to be in this exercise: This is
clear, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 36. compared with 37. ver.
where their entertaining of their Idols, is
threatned with this curse, <hi>that he will
discover their nakednesse, and make the shame
thereof to appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this fifth disadvantage that a
Christian hath by it, and it is this; that
in the day, when he shall be passing
thorow the valley of the shadow of death,
and shall be looking long and endlesse
eternity in the face, then a predominant
lust unmortified will be ill company, and
will raise a storm within the conscience,
which will not easily be appeased: There
are not many of us fit for eternity, neither
do we live as though we were dayly to
die. If you would walk with peace
thorow the first and second gates of death,
study the Mortification of your lusts:
O! but at the singing of that trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
song, <hi>O death where is thy sting? and
O grave where is thy victory?</hi> shall not the
soul be fraughted with divine consolation
and unspeakable joy?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:65886:64"/>
There is this last disadvantage that
waits upon the Christian, and it is this,
that such a one doth exceedingly marre
all the performances which he goeth
about, and (as it were) leaveth a
print of his hands upon these most holy
and excellent duties. A Christian who
hath a predominant lust, and is not
studying to mortifie it, his gifts prayes
more than his grace: as likewayes, he
is more in seeking the approbation of
men, than the praise of <hi>God:</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
that doth not study to mortifie
his lusts, he is more in seeking the
ornaments of Christianity, then the
substance of it: I think, the vitals
and essentialls of Christianity are much
exhausted and spent; and there are
some few bones left, rather the picture
and anatomy of a Christian, than really
such a one; As likewayes there is this,
one who doth not study to mortifie his
predominant lusts, he will not make
conscience of obeying the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of faith; And this likewayes waits
on him, much hardness and impenitency
of heart. O! but oft-times through
the deceitfulnesse of sin, our heart becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as a stone within us, and we are
delivered unto the hands of our iniquities.</p>
               <p>Now that which secondly, we shall
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65886:64"/>
speak to, upon the Mortification of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
lusts, shall be this, what is that
profound subtilty and desperate deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that Sathan useth in tempting people
to the acting of their predominant lusts: we
have six thousand years experience, that
he is a lyer, and a murtherer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
though we believe the flatteries of
sin, as though our iniquities were of
good report and of known integrity
that never did deceive: and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that Sathans subtilty doth appear
in these, first, his subtilty doth appear
in this, that ordinarily when a Christian,
or any is in a most secure and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
frame, then Sathan acts and tempts a
Christian to the acting of his predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
lust, when <hi>Christ</hi> is away, than he
doth assail; this is most clearly pointed
at, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 31. compared with 33. vers.
where <hi>christ saith</hi> to <hi>Peter, Sathan bath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to sift thee as wheat;</hi> and if ye will
read the 33. vers. ye will behold <hi>Peters</hi>
frame, that he was in a high string of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
<hi>though all men should forsake thee,
yet I will not do it:</hi> as likewise it is clear
from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. where when <hi>David</hi>
was lying upon his bed, and walking
upon the roof of his house, then is he
tempted to the acting of the sin of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
Sathan studieth to catch his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65886:65"/>
especially at that time, when we
are most prone to embrace, and most
unapt to resist; therefore it should be a
Christians endeavour to exercise watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
and to stand upon his watch
tower.</p>
               <p>There is this secondly wherein his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
doth appear, that ordinarily he doth
propose the imaginary advantage of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
of such a lust, and doth affect our
affections with the pleasure of it, but
doth not make mention of the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and infinit hurt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that doth appear and
come from such a lust: this was clear in
his first temptation with our first father,
he makes mention of this. <hi>If thou eat of
the forbidden fruit, thou shalt be as God,</hi>
but no mention made of this, that he
should be <hi>a sinner:</hi> and most clearly in
<hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 8. where Sathan showeth unto
that holy and spotlesse one, <hi>all the Kingdoms
of the world, with the glory of them,</hi> and
these things he promised to give <hi>Christ,</hi>
and shewed him the glory of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the world, but did not shew to
him, the vexation and toil of these king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
and no doubt, the one is much more
then the other: The hook wherewith
he studieth to take us, is varnished over
with the bait of imaginary dignity, with
transient pleasures, and with passing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65886:65"/>
O! that we were wise as serpents,
to know the depths of Sathan, that we
might not be ensnared, nor taken by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisments.</p>
               <p>There is this thirdly wherein it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that ordinarily he studieth either
to extenuate the sinfulnesse of sin, that a
Christian may be brought to call this
but a <hi>Zoar;</hi> or else he studieth to prove
the consistency betwixt such a sin, and
the reality of the grace of God: and
when once a Christian is brought to such
a length, as to debate the reality of the
grace of Gods consistency, with the
acting of such a lust, they are near a
fall, for then they cry forth, <hi>Master,
pardon me when I shall bow my knee in the
house of Rimmon, and when my Master lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon my hand:</hi> they then take an
indulgence and a latitude to themselves,
to commit that iniquity.</p>
               <p>There is this fourthly wherein his
subtilty doth appear, that oft-times he
will restrain the temptations to the acting
of your predominant lusts, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the objects of them, that either
you may be put off your watch, or,
which is more ordinary, that lusts may
take life, when the object of lust is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn:
And that is most certain, that
lust oft-times groweth most when there
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65886:66"/>
are fewest temptations to assail it; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the absence of our Idols, our love to
these things doth increase; a lusting
<hi>Amnon</hi> will wax lean every day, when he
wants the object whereupon to feed.</p>
               <p>There is this fifthly wherein his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
doth eminently appear, that ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he will tempt people to the acting of
these sins, that are introductive, and
bring on the acting of their predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
lusts: he will tempt one that is
given to uncleannesse, to pride, idleness,
fulnesse of bread: And certainly one
who is given to the evil of pride, he will
tempt him to the smaller actings of these
sins, that so he may ascend by degrees: he
will study to seise upon the out-forts of the
soul, that so he may gain the affections:
he will break the Covenant that we have
made with our eyes, that so we may
break the Covenant that we have made
with our heart.</p>
               <p>There is this lastly, wherein his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
doth appear, that ordinarily he will
tempt people to the acting of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
lust under the vail of vertue,
and things commendable, as, he will
tempt one to Covetousness, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that they may be capacitate to be
charitable to the poor, and may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to these who want in their generation:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65886:66"/>
he will tempt one to sin, as is clear,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 6. that the grace of <hi>Christ</hi> may
be more conspicuous in pardoning them:
he tempted <hi>Christ</hi> to presumption under
the vail of faith, as is clear <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 6.
<hi>If thou be the Son of God, cast thy self down,</hi>
and the ground he giveth is, <hi>For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
He shall give his Angels charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thee, &amp;c.</hi> And likewayes he
tempts many to the acting of Misbelief,
under the vail of humility, knowledge,
and distinct apprehensions of God.</p>
               <p>That which thirdly we shall speak to,
shall be, to give you some evidences
whether or not ye have attained unto the
mortification of your predominant lusts,
and whether indeed you have sung a
song of triumph over them, and having
spoken somewhat of this before, we shall
not insist much upon it: only we would
say these three things, 1. That a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
that can reflect upon lusts which he
supposeth to be mortified with delight,
and want of the exercise of grief, may
suspect the reality of his mortification.
O! but one that can meditate upon his
predominant lust which he supposed
was mortified, and yet not be constrained
to cover himself with ashes, and to put
fackcloth upon his lions, may cry forth,
<hi>Miserere mei, have pity upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:65886:67"/>
And there is this second evidence that
your predominant lust is not mortified,
when you are not sedulous and carefull
to. eshew all things that lead unto the
acting of that predominant sin: If ye be
not giving obedience unto that command,
1. <hi>Thess. 5. 22. Abstain from all appearance
of evil,</hi> you may question the reality of
your Mortification. It is an excellent
practice of a Christian, to be as much
under the impression of the sinfulness of
predominant lust and sin, after it is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
and to be as much in pursuing it,
as when it is in its vigorous exercise and
life with you.</p>
               <p>And there is this lastly, which may
evidence it, and it is, when one can upon
suitable and convenient occasions of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such a predominant sin, have their
lust set on fire, and endeavour to act it,
they may question the reality of their
Mortification. I know the great bond
which restraineth many from the acting
of their predominant lust, is not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the <hi>holiness of God,</hi> but the
want of secrecy: O! but if we had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy,
we would not mourn much for
these sins which we commit in secret,
neither would we be much in desisting
from the acting of these things, unto
which our lust doth lead us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was
<pb facs="tcp:65886:67"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65886:68"/>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:65886:68"/>
certainly a commendable practice of one,
who being tempted unto the sin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,
did condescend to satisfie the
desire of one that did pursue her, upon this
condition, that he would bring her unto a
place where nothing should behold her;
which he attempting to do, and bringing
her to the most retired imaginable place,
she then most piously uttered forth these
words, <hi>doth not God behold us?</hi> which words
had influence upon him to whom they
were spoken, that he desisted from further
prosecuting such woful and carnal designs.
O! but the apprehension of the omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of God, would keep us much to
the crucifying of our most predominant
lust.</p>
               <p>We shall shut up our discourse at this
time, only we shall say a little unto those
who are guilty of that predominant lust of
<hi>Covetousness,</hi> which we conceive, is not
only a predominant lust, but an universal
lust: <hi>Sin</hi> is an universal <hi>King</hi> over the
most absolute Monarch, and over every
one that sits upon the dung-hill. And we
conceive that <hi>covetousness</hi> is one of <hi>Sins</hi>
greatest <hi>Princes,</hi> acting under this absolute
Monarch, and having manyest subjects.
And we would only propose these things,
by which you may be helped to mortifie
such a lust and idol. O! meditate much
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65886:69"/>
upon the disadvantages attending this
idol of covetousness; we conceive the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages
thereof are clearly pointed
forth, 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 6. 9. 10, where the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> enumerateth four disadvantages of
that sin of covetousnesse. 1. That it is that
which maketh <hi>people erre from the faith,</hi>
2. <hi>It drowneth them in destruction and perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
3. <hi>It is the root of all evil.</hi> And lastly
<hi>It pierceth them through with many sorrowes.</hi>
And for those <hi>whose god is the world,</hi> we
would only propose this consideration to
them, which we conceive hath most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon such, be perswaded of this,
that <hi>covetousnesse</hi> will abbreviat and shorten
your life, as is clear, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 3. where
this is one property of this <hi>idol of covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that it shall eat up your flesh as it were
fire.</hi> It is not an unsensible cutting short of
your life, but most sensibly it will abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat,
and bring you in the midst of your
dayes to your long and everlasting home.
And there is this disadvantage of it also,
that <hi>covetousness</hi> is that sin, which doth most
directly commit a breach of the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>Thou shalt have no other gods before
me,</hi> as is clear <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. where this sin of
covetousnesse is called Idolatry, <hi>and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
which is Idolatry.</hi> And certainly,
what are those things that you pursue
after, but white and yellow dust and gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65886:69"/>
clay? the excellency of which we
conceive, doth consist as much (in the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of men) in the rarity of these
things, as in any intrinsical and internal
worth and excellency: And how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
a thing riches and the world is,
doth not this speak it, that when there is
abundance of these things, they become
contemptible? as is clear from that word,
that <hi>Solomon made silver as stones in the streets
of Ierusalem;</hi> which doth not only speak
out this, the abundance of these things in
his dayes, but likewayes it speaketh forth
this, that abundance of these things mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them contemptible, and moveth us to
undervalue them; And that which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
hath, <hi>Prov. 23. 5. Why settest thou thy
heart on that which is not, for riches take to
themselves wings and flee away:</hi> e're long
the world shall either leave you, or you
shall leave the world.</p>
               <p>Now we shall desire to shut up our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with this, that ye would seriously
intend the mortification of your lusts, and
that ye would be much in the imployment
of the spirit of <hi>Christ: Christ</hi> hath killed the
damning power of sin, and hath promised
to us the Spirit of Mortification, by which
we may kill the dominion of sin: And
certainly, a Christian ought to act so in
dependance upon the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> as if
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65886:70"/>
they were meer patients and instruments
under his hand: but with all we conceive,
that in respect of activity and endeavours,
a Christian ought to act so, as if he acted
independently from him, and did act all
himself; but withall in respect of self-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
he ought so to act, as if he acted nothing
at all, but the Spirit acted alone in him,
and therefore should cry forth, after he
hath done all, that <hi>he is but an unprofitable
servant:</hi> O! that ye would be perswaded
seriously to ponder and ballance these
things, that except ye be the ruine of your
iniquities, iniquity shall certainly be your
ruine, and ye know not how long it is
unto that day when that decree shall be
past in heaven against you, <hi>they are joyned
to their Idols, let them alone.</hi> I shall only
say that word which <hi>Iohn</hi> hath in his

               </epigraph>
               <p>IT is an unchangeable and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
decrce of heaven which cannot
be repealed, <hi>that the wages of sin is
death,</hi> and, <hi>that which a man soweth, that
shall be also reap;</hi> Though we conceive,
there are many that are possessed with
this imaginary delusion, <hi>that though they
adde drunkennesse to thirst,</hi> and do daily
taste of that forbidden fruit, yet at last
they shall obtain a place to walk in,
amongst those that stand by: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that there is a possible union of
pure Religion and undefiled, and the
want of Mortification; though we think
that religion without mortification, is
nothing else but the mortification of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and <hi>the crucifying of Christ afresh.</hi>
Are there not many here, who in stead of
<hi>traveling in birth, untill Christ be formed
in them,</hi> are traveling in birth, till they
bring forth iniquity, and till the Image
of that old man be fully framed in them.
Now there is this that we would have
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65886:71"/>
you know, and wish, that it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
upon the fleshly tables of your
heart, as with a pen of iron, and the
point of a diamond, that there are two
Tribunals, upon which <hi>God</hi> doth sit to
judge; there is a Tribunal of Justice
where all the sentences past, are pure,
unmixed wrath, without all tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or mixture of mercy; And before this
Tribunal, all flesh must once appear, and
receive that dreadful sentence of eternal
separation from the Majesty of the Lord,
and, if you do well, you must say <hi>Amen</hi>
unto the equity of that sentence: But
know this for your consolation, that this
is not his last word; know that that
Justice Court is but subordinat, and there
is another higher, unto which we may
appeal, to have that sentence of Justice
sweetly repealed. And is not this one
mysterious depth of infinite love, that
<hi>Grace</hi> should declare them righteous,
whom Justice hath condemned, and yet
leave no imputation upon the Justice of
God? that <hi>love</hi> should sweetly reduce
decreets of Justice, and declare them in
law to be void and null? this is the law
of love. And is not this a mystery of
infinit love, that that which is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for man, <hi>to justifie the wicked,</hi>
should be love and Justice in God, <hi>to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65886:71"/>
Iustifie the ungodly?</hi> And is not this a
wonder, that though <hi>there be no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to them that are in Christ Iesus,</hi> yet
there should be many things condemnable
in them, and that divine love should
make such an abstraction, as to make a
separation betwixt many things that are
condemnable, and condemnation? <hi>Iustice
and judgment are the habitation of his throne,
yet mercy and truth go before it,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nearest sinners, to make ready their
way, that they may speak with Justice.
There is this that we would have you
know, that in the accomplishment of this
work of mortification, (of which we
have been speaking at many occasions)
a Christian hath that same power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
unto him for the overcoming
of his temptations, which <hi>Christ</hi> had in the
overcoming of principalities and powers <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
this is clear, <hi>Eph.</hi> 19, 20. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
sometimes when a Christian doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon those living and strong corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that are within him, he will have
much of that fear which <hi>Elisha's</hi> servant
had, who cryed out, <hi>Master what shall
we do?</hi> but if our eyes were opened, we
should see that there are more for us, nor
against us: put on much of that divine
generosity of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (if we may allude
unto it in this combate of saith) <hi>Shoulds
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65886:72"/>
such a one as I flee?</hi> however, keep a midst
betwixt discouragment, and anxious
Misbelief: And I would only give Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
who are indeed ingaged in this
holy warfare, that counsel which <hi>Ahab</hi>
gave to <hi>Benhadad, 1 King. 20. 11. Let not
him that putteth on his armour, boast as he
that putteth it off,</hi> let confident faith be
mixed with holy fear, that there may be
a sweet mixture of these two. And there
is this which we would speak to you,
that there is a difference betwixt the grant
and gift of pardon, and the intimation
of pardon unto a Christian: yea more,
there is a difference betwixt the intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of pardon, even for a sin mortified
and repented for, and the divine appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it: this is clear by comparing
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 13. with <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. where
<hi>Nathan saith</hi> to <hi>David, thine iniquities are
blotted out, and they sin is taken away.</hi> There
is both the grant of pardon, and the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of it, and yet he himself, <hi>Psa.</hi> 51.
prayeth for the application of pardon;
pardon was not applied, though it was
intimated: and this would speak this to
us, that we would not alwayes conclude
from the want of the sensible convictions
of pardon, the want of the grant of
pardon.</p>
               <p>But now to come to that at which we
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65886:72"/>
left at the last occasion, which was the
extent of Mortification, that a Christian
ought not only to mortifie original sin,
but his predominant lusts also, with all
the motions and occasions unto the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these sins. Concerning the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of original sin, which is here
called <hi>the flesh,</hi> we have spoken already,
and have spoken somewhat concerning
the mortification of predominant lusts
and presumptuous sins; It is turned now
to be an improper expression, to make
mention of a predominant grace that
should stand in opposition to predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
lusts: I would only say this, that
under the law, there is no expresse men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made for any sacrifice for presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sins, unto which the <hi>Apostile</hi> doth
allude, <hi>Heb. 10. 26. If a man sin wilfully
after he hath received the knowledge of the
truth, their remaineth no more sacrifice for
sin,</hi> And certainly this may make us
astonished to entertain our predominant
sins, and our presumptuous iniquities, to
entertain them so, as not to debate and
wrestle with them, for they turn not unto
presumptuous sins, except we go such a
length: therefore we should be much, in
presenting that supplication, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 13.
<hi>Keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins,
let them not have dominion over me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:65886:73"/>
Now that which we shall speak to
first, shall be this, what are the most
effectual and spiritual means, by which
a Christian may be helped to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of his predominant lusts? And
before we speak of them, we shall only
say this, that this generation desireth
rather to know what to do, then to do and
practice what they know: we think to
win to heaven by knowledge; though
we confesse we will not win to heaven
without it, yet there is more requisit in a
Christian.</p>
               <p>The first way how a Christian will
be helped to mortifie his predominant
lusts, is this, for a Christian to be much
in the exercise of secret prayer. And I
would say this, he is a blessed Christian
who ever won to the mortification of the
least strength of a lust by publick prayer,
whether more publick, or in families,
or with society: pride and self-seeking,
is that Caterpillar and worm that eats up
the fruit of these addresses unto <hi>God;</hi> but
if you were much in secret prayer alone,
it would be a compendious way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the mortification of your lusts,
that when a Messenger of Sathan buffets
you, ye may go to the Throne thrife and
beseech the <hi>Lord,</hi> that this evil may depart
from you, this is clear, not only, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65886:73"/>
where amongst all the rest of the spiritual
armour of a Christian, prayer is made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of; <hi>Pray with all prayer and manner of
supplication:</hi> it is clear, <hi>Iam. 5. 17. If any
man be afflicted, let him pray.</hi> and, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. 8.
the words that we were speaking just
now. O! whether is that <hi>washing of our
bed with tears,</hi> and that presenting of
supplications <hi>with sighs and groans that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be expressed,</hi> now gone? There are
few Christians, but can make language
of their grief, whose grief of heart goes
never to such a length, as they may cry
forth, <hi>I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</hi>
He were indeed a Phoenix of his time,
who could without lying to the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> say, that his bones were waxing
old through his roaring all the day; and
we would only say to such, that are not
endeavouring after this, you shall go
down to your graves, having your bones
full of the sins of your youth.</p>
               <p>There is this second mean that we
would speak to, That a Christian would
be much in the exercise of the grace of
watchfulnesse: This is clear from <hi>Luke.</hi> 21.
near the close, and from <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41.
<hi>Watch and pray, lest ye enter into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And certainly, watchfulnesse is a
most requisit peece of armour, that <hi>after
we have done all, we may stand;</hi> not only
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65886:74"/>
because watchfulnesse is that which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth
unto a Christian his weaknesse
and inability, for a Christian to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of this, it is his strength, as is
clear from 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 10. When I am weak,
then am I strong:</hi> this is a paradox to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but no mystery to grace; but also
because watchfulnesse is a most effectual
mean to discover to a Christian, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
and profound deceitfulnesse of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
which maketh him to be much
in watching over his own heart: watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
likewayes is that grace, which
discovereth unto a Christian, the formal
and remisse actings of grace in this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
combat: when faith beginneth to die,
and hope beginneth to languish, and
love and zeal beginneth to wax cold,
then watchfulnesse giveth warning to
prayer, that it may go to seek strength for
those that were languishing: As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
watchfulnesse is requisit, because
it discovereth unto a Christian, the first
motions of his adversaries, and when
first he beginneth to stir, which, no
doubt, is a great advantage, And more,
watchfulnesse discovereth unto a Christian,
that advantage which he hath over his
lusts, which doth exceedingly encourage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
him to go on in this spiritual warfare.</p>
               <p>There is this thirdly which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65886:74"/>
that a Christian would be much in
the meditation upon the sufferings,
death, and love of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> I know
not (to a tender Christian) a more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
mean to Mortifie his affections
and lusts, then this, this is clear that it is
so, not only from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. where
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The love of Christ did constrain
him, because we thus judge, that if one died
for all, then were all dead, that we should
henceforth no more live to our self.</hi> And
<hi>Peter</hi> presseth this, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with ver. 20. <hi>Be ye holy as he is holy:</hi>
and he subjoineth the reason of it, <hi>for ye
are bought with a price, even with the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
blood of Iesus Christ:</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1, 2.
he presseth the doctrine of Mortification
from this, that <hi>Christ</hi> was crucified in the
flesh: and it is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 26. 3.
where the great argument which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<hi>David</hi> to pursue after sincerity,
was this, <hi>for the love of God is alwayes
before my eyes.</hi> And is not this a sweet
portraicture, alwayes to contemplat and
behold, to look upon love, <hi>untill ye be
changed into that same Image from glory to
glory.</hi> And certainly <hi>Christs</hi> death and
love must have a most effectual influence
upon this: Can one read these words,
<hi>he swat drops of blood;</hi> and that word,
<hi>If it be possible, let this cup depart from me.</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:65886:75"/>
Can you read these words and not be
provoked to hate sin with a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred?
Can ye love that which crucified
<hi>Christ,</hi> and brought him so low? If such
a supposition had been possible, that all
that were sinners had been standing round
about the crosse, in the day that <hi>Christ</hi>
was hanged up betwixt heaven and earth,
in the day that his precious body was
dropping down drops of blood, might
not ye have said, O! what a thing must
that be which we call sin, that hath
brought him so low? And may not the
reflect thoughts upon the love of <hi>Christ,</hi>
provoke you to this, that if <hi>Christ</hi> hath
so far condescended unto you, ought not
ye to please him, and give obedience
to his Commandments? Who would
dispute the commands of such a One?
And it is certain, that if we would me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
on these things till we wondered,
and wonder till we loved, no doubt,
it should perswade you to be endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mortification of your lusts. <hi>Christs</hi>
death hath not only a moral influence
(of which we have spoken) but it hath
a physical influence also upon the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of sin: for <hi>we are bought</hi> (saith
the Apostle <hi>Peter, 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 20,) <hi>with a price
from our vain conversation: Christ</hi> hath cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
the damning power of sin, and hath
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65886:75"/>
purchased this gift, the Spirit of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
to crucifie the dominion of sin.</p>
               <p>There is this fourthly which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
that a Christian under debates with
lusts, be much in the exercise of the grace
of faith: It is a most insensible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
help to our apprehension: we
think faith is a help, when all things are
desperat. And therefore we judge pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
a more suitable help to sense and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension;
therefore a Christian under the
prevailing of his corruptions, will be
more in the imployment of the grace of
prayer, than in the imployment of the
grace of faith; though we may say this
to the advantage of the grace of faith,
that it hath a most effectual and most
divine influence for the crucifying of
lusts: if so we may speak, faith is that
that cometh nearest <hi>himself;</hi> for faith,
(as it is spoken of it) hath a kind of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency,
as it is said, <hi>all things are
possible for those that believe.</hi> Now this is
clear not only from 1 <hi>Ioh. 5. 5. This is our
victory, whereby we overcome the world,
even our faith:</hi> and it is clear from <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 16.
<hi>Above all things take ye the shield of faith,
by which you may quench the fiery darts of
the Devil.</hi> And certainly had we so much
faith, <hi>as a grain of mustard seed,</hi> we
might say to every mountain that is in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65886:76"/>
our way, <hi>be removed, and hurled unto
the midst of the sea, and it should obey
us.</hi> We shall clear the influence of faith
in the mortifying of corruption, not only
in this, that the grace of faith, discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unto a Christian that super-eminent
and precious excellency of Jesus Christ,
at the appearance of which, the glory
and luster of our Idols do disappear.
We think our Idols are like stars, that
in the night do appear, and seem beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
creatures, but when once that <hi>Sun,</hi>
even <hi>the Sun of righteousnesse</hi> doth arise,
then their glory is not seen, neither can
they be beheld. Saw you never such
a sight of him, that constrained you
to cry forth, <hi>what have I to do any more
with Idols?</hi> If such a supposition were
possible, that any idol should get entrance
above it should get no entertainment there:
for they are upheld by an infinit strength
that cannot fail: As likewayes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of faith may be cleared in this,
that it is that grace, that doth lay hold
upon the promises, by which and thorow
which, strength from <hi>the head</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
unto the combatant: As for
example, when a believer is wrestling
with his lusts, faith layeth hold upon
the promise of help, and by it, layeth
hold on <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65886:76"/>
Promiser. As likewayes the influence
of Faith may be cleared in this, Faith is
that grace, which discovereth to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<hi>that crown and recompense of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
one sight and view of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
love and z<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al take fire, and maketh
them <hi>to tread upon the high places of the earth,</hi>
that when the Archers shoot at them, and
do grievously wound them; yet their bow
doth abide in its strength.</p>
               <p>There is this mean likewayes, by which
a Christian would mortifie his predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
lusts, and it is this, that he would
be much in entertaining the grace of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
<hi>Ioseph</hi>-like to cry forth, when
temptation doth assail him, <hi>Shall I do this
and sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against God.</hi> I am perswaded that
sin not resisted in its motions, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
hardness; And likewayes we may
say, that sin resisted in its beginnings,
doth bring forth the grace of tendernesse, in
a most effectual and eminent way.</p>
               <p>And there is this mean likewayes
which is requisit, that a Christian be
much in the apprehension of death, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and eternity: these three much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
upon, would make us affraid to
sin. I think a Christian never walketh
as he ought, till he walk so, as if each
moment next to that wherein he liveth,
he had the expectation of appearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65886:77"/>
the judgement seat of <hi>Christ.</hi> O!
but it would be a sad despensation to
many, to have this day a summonds
without continuation of dayes, to appear
before that dreadful and terrible tribunal
of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> when the books shall be
opened, wherein your wanderings are
written, and the books of your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
shall be opened, that shall say <hi>Amen</hi>
to every thing that is recorded within the
volume of these books: this is clear from
<hi>Act. 17. 30. 31. He hath commanded all men
every where to repent,</hi> and the argument en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
it is, because <hi>he hath appointed a
day, in which he will judge the world by
this man Iesus Christ:</hi> as likewayes it is
clear in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 9. where <hi>Solomon</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
by way of holy Ironie (for so the
scope is) young men not to take their
pleasures in the morning of their time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
for all these things <hi>God should bring
them to judgement.</hi> And we wish that
that <hi>memento,</hi> which did alwayes walk
with a holy man, might walk with you,
and sound in your ears, <hi>Awake, and come
to judgement,</hi> that it may be that which
may regulate your walk. I shall not say
much, but beware to entertain your lusts,
lest judgement overtake you, the stones
of the wall of this house shall bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against you in the day of the <hi>Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:65886:77"/>
that ye have been invited to flee from the
wrath to come, and have refused the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
offers of a crucified Saviour. We
would obrest and beseech you, that, if
there be a heaven, if there be a <hi>God,</hi> if
there be an eternity, which are most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and infallible, if there be a hell, and
everlasting separation from the presence
of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and if you have precious and
immortal souls, that you would tender
your own salvation, and speak much of
<hi>Peters</hi> divinity, <hi>pity your selves,</hi> for you
are destroying your selves through the
want of knowledge, and if we may say it,
hell is enlarging it self wide for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of many of the inhabitants of this
place, and of many that live in this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
who are destitute and void of the
grace of the living <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that which secondly we shall
speak to shall be this, what are the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
and tokens of this, when lust hath
dominion over one? And we shall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
point out the evidences of lust, when it
hath dominion? And we conceive, this
first may evidence it, when one wins to
such a length, as they can commit sin
with delight, and with greediness, when
it is pleasure to them to go after the heart
of their detestable things, then sin hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over one: as it is clear, sin hath
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65886:78"/>
dominion over those made mention of,
2 <hi>Pet. 2. 13. They account it pleasure to riot
in the day time,</hi> and are sporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their own deceivings; such
fools, as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaketh of, <hi>making a mock
at sin:</hi> and likewayes it is clear of those
that are made mention of, <hi>Eph. 4. 19. They
commit iniquity with greedinesse,</hi> and as the
Prophet speaketh in another place, <hi>their
hearts are mad upon their Idols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this secondly which may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it, and it is this, when one sinneth
with his predominant lust without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
or if they be convinced, their
convictions do suddenly evanish, like those
made mention of, <hi>Ier. 6. 15. Were they
ashamed, when they had committed abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
nay, they were not at all ashamed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could they blush:</hi> They had won to
such a length in impiety, that not only
they would not do it, but they could not
do it: and that same is made mention of,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 8. 12. It is clear likewayes, Jer. 3. 3.
<hi>Thou hadst a whores forehead, thou refusedst
to be ashamed;</hi> and from <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 20.
Where the adulterous woman saith, that
<hi>she hath done no wickednesse.</hi> When you are
brought unto such a length of impiety,
then know that you have yielded your
selves servants unto unrighteousness for a
time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:65886:78"/>
There is this which may evidence it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
and it is this, when one can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
iniquity upon small temptations, yea,
upon none at all: this did prove that that
sin of adultery had some dominion over
<hi>David,</hi> when he did commit it upon so
small or no temptation; for this is brought
in to aggravat it, 2 <hi>Sam. 12. 8. I gave thee
thy Masters wives into thy bosome:</hi> and it is
most emphatically aggravat, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. 7. one
poor man should have had one ewe lamb,
and yet he had so many, and that yet he
should pursue after that: And most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Isa. 5. 18 Wo unto them that draw iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with
a cart-rope:</hi> the meaning of these words
we conceive it to be this, that they did most
violently, without any allurement or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement,
pursue after the heart of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
things: certainly, those may sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
themselves, that upon the first presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of an idol, they presently bow
down their heads and worship it.</p>
               <p>There is this likewayes which may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it, and it is this, when one notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the convictions of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of <hi>God</hi> that doth behold them,
will commit such an iniquity: no doubt,
then sin is brought unto a most damnable
and most attrocious height: then sin had
dominion over <hi>Er,</hi> Gen. 38, 7. <hi>He did
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65886:79"/>
evil in the sight of the Lord:</hi> the meaning
of which word we conceive to be this,
that he did the evil, notwithstanding he
was convinced of the omniscience and
all seeing eye of <hi>God:</hi> And it is recorded
of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 King. 21, 20. <hi>He sold himself
to commit iniquity in the sight of the Lord,</hi>
when notwithstanding he knew that he
had <hi>seven eyes that ran to and fro through
the earth,</hi> yet he did act these abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>And there is this lastly, that doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it, when one doth sin with much
deliberation and advice, they are not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hailed
by their temptations and lusts, and
they sit down in counsel to consult how
such a thing may be effectuate: then had
iniquity dominion over those that are
made mention of, <hi>Mic. 2. 1. Wo to them
that devise iniquity upon their beds,</hi> that sit
down deliberatly in the silent seasons of
the night to contrive the mischievous plots
of their hearts: and we would only say
to such, read the 3. or 4. <hi>vers.</hi> of that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
where <hi>God</hi> saith in a sweet and just
opposition, in regard of their devising of
iniquity; <hi>Behold</hi> (saith he) <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
against this people:</hi> God will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratly
and with much indignation, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
those that sin deliberatly, and it is
clear from, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:65886:79"/>
Now we shall shut up our discourse at
this time, only we would speak a little
unto this, why <hi>God</hi> doth sometimes think
fit to expose his own unto some dominion
of their lusts? It was a notable and most
true saying of a heathen, <hi>As many vices, as
many masters,</hi> for every lust is a master;
and we may say, every lust hath a servant,
and some have ten thousand waiting on:
And we conceive when a Christian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
to establish his own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
then he is in hazard to be given up
for a time unto the dominion of his sin:
this is clear, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 13. If he trust to
his own righteousness, and commit ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
and there may be this reason of
it, that they may know to distinguish,
betwixt the yoke of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the yoke
and bondage of sin, as it is pointed at,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 47, 48. And we conceive this
may be a reason of it, because <hi>God</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
to magnifie the glory of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
grace, by delivering them
from the door of the pit, when this song
shall be sung, <hi>This my Son was dead, and is
alive, and was lost, and is found:</hi> this is the
song of restoring grace, after grace hath
once prevented the Christian.</p>
               <p>Now we will desire you seriously to
intend this precious work of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
the most part of us are idol-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65886:80"/>
we have hands, and we do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
we have eyes and we see not,
and we have feet and we walk not: And
certainly, that practice and maxime of
<hi>Matchiavel</hi> is much practised amongst us,
he thought it was advantagious to have
the possession of religion, and of vertue
but he thought it dangerous to have the
reality of religion: there are many that
desire to be clothed with the coat of
<hi>Christ,</hi> that never desired conformity
with <hi>Christ</hi> in the inward man: And we
think if <hi>Christ</hi> were to come down from
heaven, he might preach this to many of
us, <hi>Betrayest thou the son of man with a kisse?</hi>
There are many that I am sure have a
lower spirit then <hi>Iudas,</hi> that would
sell <hi>Christ</hi> at a lower rate then thirty
peeces of silver: O! eternity, eternity,
<hi>what shall you do in the day of desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when your visitation shall come from
a far? where shall you flee for help? and
where shall you leave your glory?</hi> I shall
shut up all that I have to say with this
the wrath of that living, but contemptible
stone, that was cut out of the Mountains,
shall be more intollerable then the weight
of mountains and hills. Therefore the
reprobats rather choise to be under the
weight of hills and mountains, then to
be under the weight of this living Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65886:80"/>
but so much despised. Will you not
imbrace him? may not angels laugh at
your folly, and have you in holy derisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
the triumph is above, and it is not
long before his own shall cry forth, <hi>It is
finished.</hi> And no doubt, if we were much
in the exercise of faith, we should easily
accomplish this warfare: we may call
Faith <hi>Eliezer,</hi> of whom it is reported,
that he did so pursue his enemies, that
the people returned to gather up the spoils.
Love, prayer, and joy, will eternally sit
down and reap the sweet fruits of the
victory of Faith. Now to him that can
make you overcome thorow the blood
of the Lamb, and the word of your testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
we desire to give praise.</p>

There are some s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> habituat to
sin, (if <hi>God</hi> do not prevent them) the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65886:81"/>
last act they shall commit in this stage
of the world, shall be an act of iniquity,
and they shall breath out their last, in
departing from that <hi>invisible Majesty.</hi>
There are some that though they live
seventy years, they shall not have this
to say, of one day of all their life, that
they have devoted and given it to <hi>God.</hi>
Mortification is a mystery to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but much more a mystery to our
practice: It is a wonder that many of us
are not distracted, and that much of
<hi>Cains</hi> divinity doth not possesse us, that
<hi>whosoever shall find us by the way, shall kill
us.</hi> However, unto those who make
any conscience of this duty, we would
say these two things; 1. Ye may yeeld
unto the premisses and assertions of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
which they draw from the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your sin over you, but deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
of misbelief: This was the
practice of <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 65. 3. there is the
assertion of misbelief in the first words,
<hi>Iniquities prevail over me,</hi> but he denyes
that conclusion which we draw from it,
<hi>that we are reprobats;</hi> but faith doth sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
subjoyn, <hi>As for our transgressions, thou
wilt purge them away.</hi> This is bad
Logick to deny the conclusion, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
divinity: And secondly, we would
say this to you, that ye may with a great
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65886:82"/>
deal of liberty, make use of the dominion
of your iniquity, as an argument to plead
with <hi>God</hi> for pardon, according to that
famous prayer of <hi>Davids, Psal. 25. 11. For
thy names sake, O Lord, pardon mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
for it is great.</hi> And we would say
likewayes, that <hi>God</hi> maketh use of the
iniquities of the children of men, as an
argument to provoke himself unto mercy,
and even those iniquities, which before
he hath made use of, as an argument of
Justice. It is strange to parallel and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
these two places, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. with
<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 21. where the reason that <hi>God</hi>
giveth of the destruction of the world is
this, because that <hi>every imagination of the
thoughts of the heart of man, is only evi<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
continually:</hi> and yet, chap. 8. 21. he giveth
this as a ground, why he would curse
the world no more for mans sake, because
saith he, <hi>the imagination of mans heart i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

evil from his youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we told you at the last occasion
we spoke on these words, when we wa<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
speaking upon the second thing of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
which was the extent of it, tha<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
a Christian should not only mortifie ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin, which is here called <hi>flesh,</hi> bu<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
likewayes, he should mortifie his predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
idols, which are here called <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;</hi>
and of these two we have spoken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:65886:82"/>
There is this likewise in the extent of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
that a Christian should mortifie
the first motions and tentations unto sin,
which are here called <hi>lusts.</hi> And for
clearing what we shall speak upon this;
we conceive, that the first motions of sin
do comprehend these two: first, that a
Christian should study to mortifie the
first tentations he meets with unto acting,
or embracing of any particular lust.
And secondly, that a Christian should
study to avoid all appearances of evil, by
which he may be brought to the acting
of that sin. We shall not stand long to
prove that it is the duty of a Christian
to do the first; it is clear not only from
<hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 7. where we are commanded <hi>to
resist the devil,</hi> which comprehendeth
even the resisting of the first motions of
sin, as likewayes from 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 9. Whom
resist, stedfast in the faith;</hi> but likewayes
it is clear from the practice of <hi>David,
Psal,</hi> 56. 3. where when misbelief began
to stir, he put faith in exercise, <hi>What time</hi>
(saith he) <hi>I am afraid, I will trust in thee.</hi>
And it is clear from the practice of <hi>Paul,</hi>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. where there was a messenger
of Sathan given to buffer him, he went
and <hi>beseeched the Lord thrise.</hi> Neither shall
we stand to prove, that it is the duty of
a Christian to flee the appearances of evil,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:65886:83"/>
It is clear, not only from <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 30.
where it is said, thou shalt not <hi>enquire
how the Nations serve their gods:</hi> ye may
suppose there was no iniquity in this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
yet because it was the appearance of
evil, <hi>God</hi> did sorbid it: as likewayes
from <hi>Deut. 25. 13. 14. Thou shalt not have
in thy bagg, diverse weights, a great and a
small; thou shalt not have in thine house di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
measures, a great and a small:</hi> it might
be supposed, that the having of these
things when not used, was not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but the very having of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was an appearance of evil, it was
desired to be eshewed: and that remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
place, <hi>Prov. 5. 8. Come not nigh the
door of her house, who is a whore:</hi> and
that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 3. where the people are
commanded, even to forget the names of
Idols. And from <hi>Iude 21. to hate the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
spotted with the flesh:</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 19
where it is forbidden for <hi>a judge to take a
gift,</hi> not that there is iniquity in this, but
because it is an appearance of evil, lest
he should pervert judgment, it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
               <p>Now that which first we shall speak
to upon this, that a Christian should
flee the first motions and appearances of
sin, shall be this: to propose some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
unto you, that may inforce
this duty more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:65886:83"/>
The first consideration that we propose
is this, that iniquity when it is resisted
in its first motions, is most easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
and overcome; when sin is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in its birth, it is killed with the greatest
facility and easiness: and certainly, when
we delay the mortifying of our lusts, and
resists not the devil, it is no wonder that
we are led captive by the hand of our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities:
It was an ancient saying worthy
to be practised, resist the beginning of
evil, for the remedy is ever more difficult
in the close, then in the beginning. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
we would give Christians these
two directions for this consideration.
1. After by the power of grace, ye have
overcome the first motions of sin, do not
give over your watch, nor sit down in
carnal confidence, for he will again assail
you, even after you have overcome: It
is a remarkable word that is annexed to
the close of <hi>Christs</hi> temptations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 13.
where, after Sathan was foiled most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably,
it is said, <hi>he departed from
him for a season;</hi> he had a mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
though he was overcome. 2. We
say this, that most ordinarily the resisting
of the motions of sin, and overcoming
of them, if they be not improven with
humility, it is the fore-runner of some sad
stroak from the hand of the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:65886:84"/>
There is this second consideration that
we would propose for inviting of you to
resist the first motions of sin, and it is this,
a Christian that maketh conscience of this
duty, ordinarily he is blessed with most
divine and precious enjoyments of <hi>Iesus
Christ:</hi> let a Christian try this by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and when first sin doth assail them,
if they will make conscience to resist it,
the dew of heaven shall come down and
ly upon their branch, that their glory
may be fresh in them, and they shall be
constrained to put up an <hi>Eben-ezer</hi> unto
<hi>God,</hi> and to cry forth, <hi>hitherto hath the Lord
helped us;</hi> this is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13.
<hi>If ye through the Spirit shall mortifie the deeds
of the flesh, ye shall live;</hi> and clear likewise
from <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. Where, to the man that
is in the way of overcoming, <hi>Christ will
give him the hidden Manna:</hi> And certainly,
we think, if we may make allusion to these
words, that curse is accomplished in these
dayes, <hi>I will make the heavens brasse, and
the earth iron.</hi> There are some upon whom
it hath not rained these three years and six
moneths, but are become as the bottle in
the smoak, the marrow of whose bones is
consumed.</p>
               <p>There is this third consideration that we
would propose, and it is this, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of the motions and first stirrings of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65886:84"/>
corruption, is the way to get the soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a most divine impression of the sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of sin: when was it that the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> cried forth, <hi>O wretched man that</hi> I <hi>am?</hi>
was it not, when there was a law in his
minde, wrestling against the law of his
members? When he was the greatest
wrestler, then did sin appear out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
sinful unto him. I confess, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
which Papists do so much
adore, <hi>of venial and mortal sins, I</hi> think
Christians in their practice do make much
use of. Are ther not many sins, which
ye account venial, and writeth this name
upon their forehead, this is a <hi>zoar,</hi> a little
thing, and ye desire to be pardoned, when
ye bow your knee in the house of <hi>Rimmon,</hi>
if ye go no further: but certainly, the way
to bring the soul to a divine loathing of all
sin, is to be resisting the first motions of
it.</p>
               <p>There is this first consideration, that
resisting of the first motions of sin, is that
which keeps the grace of faith much in
exercise, especially in an hour of trial and
of temptation. I think, there is nothing
that will darken a Christians evidence so
much as this, the conviction of this, that
there was never a sin did assail them, that
was resisted in its first motions and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
I confess, I think a bad conscience,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65886:85"/>
is the mother of misbelief, which the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
doth clearly point at, 1. <hi>Tim. 3. 9. Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
(saith he) <hi>the mystery of faith in a pure
conscience,</hi> as if he would have said, that
divine and precious guest <hi>Faith,</hi> can lodge
in no dwelling but a pure and undefiled
conscience: And to make this clear, that
the resisting of the motions and first stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of sin, have influence to preserve
faith in exercise, see <hi>Rev. 2. 17. To him that
overcometh,</hi> that is in the way of overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>I will give him a new name;</hi> he shall
know that his name is written in these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
records of heaven, and that before
the morning stars did sing for joy, e're
ever the corner stone of the world was
laid, he was engraven upon the heart of
precious ones, in indelible letters which
cannot be blotted out: As also it is clear
from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. compared with 8. and 1.
<hi>verse:</hi> when was it that <hi>Paul</hi> cried forth,
<hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in
Christ Iesus?</hi> was it not then, when he
was wrestling against corruptions?</p>
               <p>And there is this last consideration,
which we shall propose to enforce this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and it is this, that not resisting sin in
its first motions, doth ordinarily creat and
bring to passe much hardnesse and stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of heart, when we silence our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
with laziness, and answer our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65886:85"/>
with this, <hi>I have put off my coat, how
shall I put it on?</hi> I shall say to such, it is a
bad omen and sign that God is upon his
way to cease to be such a reprover unto
you: I confesse, there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
sinning against light, and sinning
with light; and we conceive that there are
many guilty of the one, that are not guilty
of the other: However, if once ye shall
come this length, as when temptation doth
assail you, to make a covenant of peace
and agreement with it, ye may expect, if
you go to heaven, you shall be safe, but
so as by fire: and we confesse there are
some whose consciences may bear them
record, that they never knew what it was
to resist the first motions and stirrings of
corruption. It is a lesson of so high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it would need explication unto
them: And think ye that ye can attain
unto that living and precious hope, who
never knew to wrestle with sin, and with
your corruptions? is such a delusion as this
amongst you, that ye can reign, though
ye fight not, and triumph though ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not? ye may reign to your own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
as kings without <hi>Christ</hi> this
way, but shall never reign as kings with
him, if ye do not study to mortify your lusts.</p>
               <p>That which secondly we shall speak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, shall be this, what is the reason that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65886:86"/>
Christians do not resist sin in its first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and stirrings within them? And we
conceive, that it doth either proceed from
this, that Christians are not much in the
exercise of the grace of watchfulness. I
think temptations seises oft-times upon a
Christians affections before they be a war,
hence it is, that when the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> is
prescribing this direction of resisting the
motions of sin, he requireth this as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
duty, that they should be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
1 <hi>Pet. 5. 8, 9. Be vigilant,</hi> and then, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him, stedfast in the faith:</hi> when once a
Christian hath given over his watch, he
is a prey unto his lusts: we may certainly
say of him, that he is a city broken down &amp;
without walls, that doth not exercise the
grace of watchfulness. Or else it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from this, that Christians are not in
a divine and spiritual frame to resist temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
when they are first assailed with
them. We confesse, our spirits oft-times
are so loadened with the pleasure of a
world, and are so much taken up with the
passing delights of a transient world, that
when temptations do come; we do easily
condescend to imbrace them: hence it is
that the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> when he is passing
this exhortation upon these to whom he
writeth, <hi>resist the Devil,</hi> he subjoyneth this
in the 9. <hi>vers.</hi> as a concomitant duty, <hi>draw
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65886:86"/>
near to God,</hi> as if he would have said, If
temptations find you at a distance with
<hi>God,</hi> then ye may cry forth, <hi>have pity on
me;</hi> for ye are a prey, if ye be not found
within sight of him, and if your hearts do
not study to walk in the sight of his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
face. As likewayes, <hi>Peter</hi> doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
this, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 8. 9. Be sober</hi> and then,
<hi>resist him stedfast in the faith:</hi> and more
clearly it is pointed at, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41.
<hi>Watch, and pray, left ye enter into temptation.</hi>
And I would only say this unto you, it
is a most high and divine walk alwayes
to be living within sight of <hi>God,</hi> that when
ye go down to the grave, ye may have
this to say, I am now to change my place,
but not to change my company; heaven
may be to you but a precious passing and
transition unto a more constant and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
enjoyment of <hi>God:</hi> Or else it doth
proceed from this, that Christians when
they are first assailed with the motions and
stirrings of corruptions, they dow not do
violence to their own flesh. I consesse
these two Idols, which are dependant one
upon another, that idol of <hi>Self,</hi> and that
idol of <hi>Ease,</hi> they are the cut-throats of a
Christians diligence, and are the great
occasion, why we do not overcome,
<hi>through the word of our testimony, and by the
blood of the Lamb;</hi> Think ye that it is an
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65886:87"/>
easie thing to overcome temptations? I
confesse, those that are not acquainted
with it, may probably say it, but this
is certain, that such kind goeth not
forth, but by fasting and prayer. It cost
<hi>Christ</hi> much toil to liberat you from the
guilt of sin, and it will cost you much toil
to liberat your selves from the filth of sin.
And there is this lastly from which it
proceeds, that Christians do not mortifie
sin, in its first stirrings and motions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not living under an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the sinfulness of sin. We conceive,
that oft-times when temptations do assail
us, we think, <hi>departing from God</hi> a dispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
evil, and that which easily we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
pardon for: I would prescribe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, as one of the greatest mysteries of
Christianity, and blessed, blessed is he
eternally that hath win to it, and it is this,
to be living constantly under a divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the sinfulness of sin, that ye may
take it up, in its nature, and in its effects,
I think, if one should come from the dead,
having the chains of everlasting wrath,
wreathed about his feet, and the sheckles
of the fury of the <hi>Lord,</hi> wreathed about
his hands, and should preach to you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the nature of sin, and how dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
a thing it is, there are many who
would not take heed much to such
doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:65886:87"/>
Now that which thirdly we proposed
to speak to from these words was, the
difficulty to attain to Mortification, which
we conceive, was held forth under that
word <hi>Crucify;</hi> which doth import, that
Mortification is a longsome work, as
crucifying was a longsome death: as
likewayes it doth import, that Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
was a painful work, as crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was one of the most painful deaths:
And like wayes it holds forth the intensive
nature of Mortification, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
should study not to be content until
he did kill corruption: And concerning
these three we shall speak together:
And we shall point out the difficulty of
attaining to Mortification in these things.
Is there not this which points out the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of it, that there is a woful unity of
affection betwixt us and our lusts, they
are dear to us as the right eye, and our
right hand, and right foot: And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
to convince you of that unity that
is betwixt you and your lusts, I think
that expression which ordinarily ye use,
when one is reproving you for your
passion, or for your swearing, may
suffice; ye will answer, what aileth you
at me? which doth speak this, that you
say, your lusts and you are one. And I
confesse <hi>Paul</hi> hath an expression like this,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65886:88"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 7, 8. I <hi>know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that in me dwelleth
no good thing.</hi> There are two
<hi>me's</hi> in a Christian; there is a spiritual
and a refined <hi>Me,</hi> there is a carnal and a
wicked <hi>Me,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> doth distinguish
them in that verse, <hi>I know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that
in me dwelleth no good thing:</hi> and yet he
subjoyneth, <hi>In me to will that is present,</hi>
which is one good thing. And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that word is accomplished in <hi>Me,
They are joyned to their idols, let them alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is that secondly which pointeth
out the difficulty of Mortification, and
it is the strength of those lusts that are
within us, we think the Scripture is so
abundant in pointing out the strength
of sin, that we need not speak much to
it: there is that expression, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2.
which is a most strange word, it is there
called <hi>the law of sin and of death:</hi> as it were,
sin pleads for as much subjection from
us, as if we were tyed by law to obey it:
And in that verse, there is a sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of laws, <hi>the law of the spirit of
life, hath made me free from the law of sin
and of death.</hi> If so we may speak, there
is, in a manner, one decree and statute
of heaven declaring another to be null;
for it was a law in heaven, that we should
be under death, because we were under
sin; but behold, here is a posterior law
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65886:88"/>
that doth sweetly reduce this prior law,
and it is, <hi>the law of the Spirit of life.</hi> As
likewayes, that expression pointeth forth
the strength of corruption, which is
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. where he saith, we are to
fight for <hi>the pulling down of strong holds,</hi> as
it were, sin fortifieth it self within our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some:
and we confesse, if this were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
we should study to mortify our
corruptions with a great deal of more
pains and constancy. There is this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
which pointeth it out, and it is,
the deceitfulnesse of our lusts, and the
subtilty which they vent in their deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of us; which is clear from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<hi>Iam. 1. 14. When a man,</hi> (saith
he) <hi>is drawn away, and entised of his lusts:</hi>
the word there that is rendered <hi>entised,</hi> is
taken from the fishers, who deceive the
silly fishes, with an apparent bait of
pleasure. We confesse, these two are the
great obstrucions of a Christians pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
to heaven, there are temptations
of fear, and there are temptations from
advantage: which two, if they were
removed, we might with greater facility
overcome our lusts, and sing a song of
triumph over our Idols: oft-times that
expression is recorded, <hi>the deceitfulness of
sin:</hi> we confesse, if this were believed,
we would use a more divine and holy
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65886:89"/>
prudence, least we should be ensnared.
And to shut up our discourse upon Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
upon which we have been
speaking so long; we shall only speak a
little to obviat any mistake that may be
about the difficulty of any Mortification,
which shall include that which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to speak upon; which was the
certainty of overcoming.</p>
               <p>And that which first we would say
unto you is this; Be perswaded of this,
that there is more divine satisfaction in
the resisting of your lusts, and wrestling
against them, then there is in the actual
fruition of them all: that word of <hi>Solomons,
Stollen waters are sweet,</hi> saith the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
woman, but at last they shall be
convinced of the contrary: and that
word which he speaketh, <hi>Bread of deceit
is pleasant to the mouth, but he knoweth not,
that the dead are there, &amp;c.</hi> And we think
the <hi>Apostle</hi> sweetly chydeth the Romans
concerning this thing, <hi>What fruit have
you of those things, whereof you are now
ashamed?</hi> it is sad to think upon that
woful disappointment that many shall
meet with.</p>
               <p>There is this which we would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
say, that there is a divine cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of a Christians overcoming, let the
difficulties be never so many, and (O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65886:89"/>
in the Lord) are not these glad
tidings from a far country, and may be
as cold water to a thirsty mans soul, that
a Christian shall once overcome: And
I confesse there are these four things, that
speak the certainty of a Christians
overcoming: 1. The faithfulnesse, and
the love of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is laid in pawn
for our overcoming, which is clear from
that <hi>Joh. 6. 39. And this is the fathers
will which hath sent me, that of all which he
hath given me,</hi> I <hi>should losse nothing but should
raise it up again at the last day:</hi> And we
confesse, this is certain, it is more of
<hi>Christs</hi> concernment that a believer should
overcome, then it is of his own. O!
what songs to the faithfulnesse of <hi>Christ,</hi>
what songs to his love shall be sung that
day, when the precious troup of his Saints,
shall return from the day of judgment,
and that general infare shall be of all
those that have been begotten unto a lively
hope, when they shall convey <hi>Christ</hi>
home, through the ports of the <hi>new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
every one having a harp of God
in his hand, and shall cry forth, <hi>Halelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jab<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Halelujab to him that sitteth upon the
Throne, and to the lamb for ever and ever:</hi>
that song shall have no period; though
it have a beginning.</p>

forth their certainty of overcoming,
<hi>Christ</hi> hath overcome, and therefore a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
shall overcome. It was the sweet
divinity of the Apostle <hi>Paul, Heh.</hi> 2. 9, 10.
there is a promise (saith he) that all
things shall be put under our feet, but
we see not that promise accomplished,
saith he: I see one thing accomplished,
which is a pledge of it, I see <hi>Iesus Christ,
for the suffering of death, crowned with
glory and with Majesty: Christ</hi> is in heaven,
and he must be there: and that word
<hi>John</hi> 16. last, <hi>Be of good cheer,</hi> saith
he, <hi>for I have overcome the world;</hi> which
is a pledge and certain token, that ye
shall once overcome.</p>
               <p>There is this likewayes which points
forth their certainty of overcoming, that
that same power which was exercised in
bringing <hi>Christ</hi> from death, and in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to overcome principalities and
powers, is communicate to believers to
make them overcome; as it is clear from
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20. where it is said, <hi>That
power that wrought mightily in Christ to raise
him from the dead, doth also work in those
that believe.</hi> O! Christians, heirs of
the grace of life, believe this, that Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
is ingaged on your behalf; and
have you not learned that first point of
the Creed, that <hi>there is nothing-impossible
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65886:94"/>
to God;</hi> and so when you are constrained
sometimes to cry out, <hi>Who shall stand
before the children of Anak:</hi> Content your
selves with this, that there is nothing too
hard for him.</p>
               <p>And there is this lastly, which points
it out, that divine and invisible knot of
union that is betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
Is <hi>Christ</hi> above? the members must
follow; for ye know, though <hi>Christ</hi>
be the fulness of the Saints, yet the Saints
are the fulness of <hi>Christ:</hi> there is a sweet
mutual fulfilling and accomplishing each
one of another: know ye not that word,
<hi>that where I am, there they may be also:</hi>
I think of all the words that <hi>Christ</hi> ever
spoke to the <hi>Father,</hi> that word was the
most imperious and commanding-like
word which he hath, <hi>Joh. 17. 24. I will</hi>
(saith he) <hi>that those that thou hast given
me, be where I am.</hi> It was not his prayer
which came that length, he willed it,
and would not be contradicted: And
certainly there is nothing that may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
you in the our of trial so much as
this, <hi>Christ</hi> is upon his way to relieve you,
and ye are upon your way of overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And I shall only say that word,
which ought to be your practice, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
5. 18. <hi>Whosoever is born of God sinneth not,
and that wicked one toucheth him not:</hi> That
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65886:95"/>
ordinary expression which you have
you should not rub cloths with him, not
touch him. And to those that are walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the broad paths of sin, I shall only
speak that to you which is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 22.
<hi>His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall
drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</hi> Your
eyes and your taste shall be satisfied; and
that word which is vers. 30. <hi>he shall be
preserved to the day of destruction,</hi> or as the
word in the original, <hi>he shall be reserved
to the day of wrath:</hi> as it were, there shall
be a combination of wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and justice
that shall seise upon you. Now to him
who is upon his way, who shall come
and will not carry, and whose reward is
with him, we desire to give praise.</p>

exchange of affections, a
soul dying in its affections and
respects to all things, that are
here below; and living and advancing in
its desires toward him, who is that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and universal good. It ought to be
that arch-plot, and great design, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65886:95"/>
Christians ought to promove, to attain to
that original unity, which once was in
mans affections towards <hi>God:</hi> O! what
blessedness did <hi>Adam</hi> enjoy, while he did
stand in that estate wherein he was creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he having a blessed harmony of all his
affections toward <hi>God,</hi> and likewayes
there being a most divine correspondence
and blessed familiarity betwixt heaven
and earth, betwixt him who fitteth on the
Throne, and the foot-stool: but that was
most eminently verified, that <hi>man being in
honour, did not abide.</hi> O! what anxious
and perplexing thoughts had poor <hi>Adam,</hi>
no doubt, some hours after his fall, when
he did reflect upon that which was once
his condition, and did compare it with
that which was now his lot: might not
he take up that lamentation over himself,
<hi>Man in his best estate is altogether vanity;</hi>
And likewayes he might have that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
taken up of himself, <hi>How art thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</hi>
Now, man by lossing that blessed
unity that was in his affections, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
a woful and infinit diversity in his
affections towards these things that are
here below: so that those affections which
did once sweetly run in one channel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>God,</hi> are now divided and separated
in many channels, toward those things
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65886:96"/>
that are below him: And there is nothing
beneath the <hi>Son,</hi> that leadeth captive so
many of our desires as the <hi>World:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it were your advantage to be crucified
to the world, and to have the world cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
to you: that you may discover, that
endlesse vanity, and unspeakable vexation
of spirit, that is in all things that are here:
The world is a perfect compend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
epitom of all misery: <hi>God</hi> himself is
that compend of all blessednesse, so that
there is nothing that we can take up under
this, but it is most eminently in him. It
is a duty which is much undervalued in
these dayes, Christians to be promoving
in that blessed work of having themselves
crucified to the world, and having the
world crucified to them: O! how suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
is it for those who are heirs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants
of that blessed hope and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enjoyment of being with <hi>God,</hi> who is
the Judge of all flesh, and with <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
who is the Mediator of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and with the innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of holy Angels, and to be made heirs
and co-heirs with <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Is it not
below you to be much taken up in your
vain and anxiouspursuits afterthose things
that are here below: The objects of the
desires of your immortal spirits ought to
be more high than things below; and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65886:96"/>
ought to be more divine than things hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane;
your affections ought to <hi>be ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as pillaes of smoak,</hi> and ye should be
breathing after that blessed day when there
shall be a confinement of all your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on him. We have at some occasions
spoken unto you, of the grace of humility,
and of the grace of love, the one teaching
us to undervalue our self, the other teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to value <hi>God:</hi> And had you been
much taken up in the spiritual and living
exercise of those, there should not have
been much difficulty to perswade you at
this time. We shall not insist long in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
what Mortification is; It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and blessed endeavour of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
to remove out of his way all those
impediments, that do interrupt the exercise
of love; As likewayes, it is that which
entertaineth a constant and perpetual an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
and holy indignation against eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, thorow which his conformity
with <hi>God,</hi> and that perfect likeness and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>litude
with his Maker, might be in any
way impaired. Mortification doth not
consist in those unconstant and unequal
exercises of mortifying our lusts, it consists
not in those violent flashes of holy zeal
and indignation against our iniquities; for
though that indignation be violent for its
time, yet it doth quickly evanish and pass
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65886:97"/>
away: but that grace of Mortification
must be a constant and dayly exercise;
We will solace our selves in the chambers
of our imagry, by beholding our idols
pourtrayed up the wall, we will study
to receive satisfaction in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
when we cannot receive satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the actual fruition of them: Such
is likewayes the woful desperatness of the
hearts of the children of men, that when
<hi>God</hi> hath put a worm to the root of that
gourd, under the shadow of which, we
used to solace our selves, we cry forth
from a discontented humor, <hi>It is better for
us to die then to live:</hi> O! there are many
here, to whom it would be death to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
their idols; their idols and they are
pleasant in their lives, and they desire
not to be divided in their deaths. 3. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
doth not consist in that partial
and divided way of mortifying our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
we taking vengeance upon
some of our lusts, but with <hi>Saul,</hi> spare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it who is the <hi>King. Naaman the
Syrian</hi> must have an indulgence of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his knee in the house of <hi>Rimmon: Lot</hi>
must plead for the sparing of <hi>Zoar,</hi> that
small thing: and so when we are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that work of Mortification, we plead
for the sparing of these things, which
we call <hi>Zoars,</hi> these small, but our Master-corruptions.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65886:97"/>
Certainly that evangelick
Mortification which is required of us,
doth not consist in this, for we must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
an universal separation betwixt us
and all our idols, we must cast away all
our idols to the moles and to the batts, and
<hi>we must defile the covering of them, and
he alone must be the cover of our eyes:</hi>
He never knew what the grace of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
meant, who never set about the
accomplishment of the ruine of that great
and master-idol which domineereth over
him: And we conceive, that the best
and most solid way of knowing our
growth in Mortification, is by reflecting
upon the decay of these idols, which are
our predominants; other sins which
affail us may decay, and their strength
wax weak, and yet mortification not be
on the growing hand, for there are many
of our lusts, that rather die by concession,
then by constraint; there are many of
our idols that rather go out of us, then
are cast out.</p>
               <p>Now the first thing that a Christian
ought to endeavour to mortifie is, his
love to the the world, which was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of this holy man: In the words he
pointeth out unto us that way, wherein
he did attain this compleat and spiritual
Mortification to the world, holden forth
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65886:98"/>
to us in these words, <hi>by whom,</hi> which
doth relate unto <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is made
mention of in the words going before: or,
as the words may be rendered, <hi>by which</hi>
I <hi>am crucified to the world,</hi> and so they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
unto the cross of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Now
under this notion of <hi>being crucified,</hi> he doth
certainly hold forth unto us, that great
difficulty that is in accomplishing the
work of Mortification; And under this
name of <hi>being crucified,</hi> he holdeth forth
unto us, the longsomnesse of the time that
we must spend, before we can attain
compleat Mortification, <hi>Crucifying</hi> being
one of the most lent and slow of all violent
deaths; Mortification is not a work of
one day, it will cost us many dayes and
years, before we shall crush the head of
him, who hath so oft-times crushed our
heel, before that blessed promise shall be
fulfilled, that <hi>all things shall be put in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
unto us:</hi> Sin doth most easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
us, and take possession of us, but
it is not easily dispossessed; for except
we had the infinit strength of him who
is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> we might sit down, and
close our hands, and never mint to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
these Idols, under whose subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we are: This word of <hi>being cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
doth likewayes hold forth the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and uneasiness of this work of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65886:98"/>
Mortification, <hi>Crucifying</hi> being a death,
amongst all violent deaths, one of the
most bitter: we must certainly be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
to our ease, before we can be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
to our lusts, we must travel in birth,
before the grace of Mortification can be
formed in us. It is a wofull evil in these
dayes, that the most part of people walk
under this apprehension, that there is
not much difficulty to Mortifie their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
but it is a token, that they
never knew what it was to mortifie
them, who never knew the difficulty of
Mortification.</p>
               <p>The third thing that is holden forth
under this name of <hi>being crucified</hi> is, that
woful reluctancy and indisposition of
spirit, which we have to this blessed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Mortifying our corruptions;
we have as great unwillingnesse unto it,
as though we were to go to subject our
selves to some violent death. O! how
is vanity and corruption joyned to the
spirits of the sons of men: how loth are
we to have that wofull and accursed
union betwixt us and our lusts dissolved?
O! how many Orators and Procurators
within our selves have we to plead for
this, <hi>the sparing of our lusts:</hi> we may be
perswaded of this, that if we be not the
ruine of our iniquity, iniquity shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65886:99"/>
be our ruine. O! how may we blush
and be confounded seven dayes, that
we should be so loth to have a separation
betwixt us and these things, by which
our distance with <hi>God</hi> and estrangement
from him, is so much increased: this
vanity is unspeakable, that we should be
so averse from that wherein our eternal
blessedness dothly, in having that wofull
band, which we have wreathed about
our own necks, taken off by the blessed
and everlasting hands of him who hath
died and risen again, to accomplish this
blessed design.</p>
               <p>Lastly, under this word of <hi>being cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
is held forth unto us that compleat
and spiritual Mortification to the world,
that this holy man attained to, he was as
one dead to these things: he was not
much exercised in joy in having the
world, neither was he exercised in grief,
by wanting the things of the world, he
was a man dead, which could not be
moved by any of these things: We do
not say so, that <hi>Paul</hi> was altogether a
Stoick, without all passions of grief
and sorrow, or of joy, but we only say
this, that he did not grieve for the want
of the world, as those who have no hope;
neither did he so joy in having the
world, as those who have not a more
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65886:99"/>
divine and high spring of consolation, he
was cloathed with a holy indifferency,
and a blessed neutrality in having or
wanting these things; it was none of
<hi>Pauls</hi> desires to have the world, he had
learned that divine and excellent art of
being content with every estate of life:
he knew not what it was to murmur;
And it were certainly much our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
to be provoked to jealousie, when
we reflect upon the practice of this holy
man. I conceive, that if all that are
here would examine themselves, by how
many degrees their Mortification to the
world, doth come short of this, they
might sit down and conclude with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they are yet to begin to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie;
yea, there are many here, to whom
we may say, that they are so far from
being clothed with a holy indifferency
in having the things of the world, that
they are clothed with that woful and
indispensible necessity in pursuing after
these things: this is the language of the
most part, <hi>Give, give,</hi> men hurrying
themselves in multitudes of hopes, and of
fears, and of expectations, and likewayes
an infinit number of desires; And what
is the end and result of all these things,
but <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that you may be helped to attain
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65886:100"/>
this concerning-duty, to be mortified to
the world, we shall propose these things
unto you: The first is this, be much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up in a holy contemplation and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
beholding of these unsearchable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
that are in <hi>God.</hi> If once the foul
of the creature were elevated to behold
him, there should not be much difficulty,
to be mortified to the world: were we
once admitted to draw by a lap of the
vail, and behold that uncreated glory and
unexpressible Majesty that is treasured
up in him, Mortification should be no
great difficulty unto us: this is clearly
held forth here, for <hi>Paul</hi> doth tell by
whom he had this grace of Mortification,
it was by beholding <hi>that pleasant plant of
renown Jesus Christ.</hi> This is clear like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Who is he that overcometh
the world, but he that believeth that Iesus
Christ is the Son of God?</hi> Did we once
believe that fundamental Article of
faith, that he who was crucified upon
the tree, was the real <hi>Son of God,</hi> we
should most easily win to this concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
duty of Mortification. We may
reduce all the causes of our little growth
in this blessed work, to that woful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<hi>of God,</hi> wherewith the most part of
us are clothed: were there a door opened
to us in heaven, and were we in the spirit
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65886:100"/>
to behold him who sits upon the Throne,
whose countenance is like a Sardine stone,
and about whose Throne there is that rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow;
could we penetrat thorow these vails,
wherewith both he and we are covered,
we being cloathed with the vail of our
ignorance, and likewayes with the vail
of our impurity; and he being cloathed
with these two most glorious vails, the
vail of his unsearchableness, and the
vail of that wonderful and unexpressible
Majesty that is in him, the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
the judgement, and the other
confounding the affections, so that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and judgment in a manner is put
to a none-exercise, and both of these do
sweetly resolve in that blessed one act of
admiration. We need not speak much
to the commendation of those unto you,
who were never acqainted with him,
that so ye might be perswaded to forsake
your old lovers; We shall only say this,
silence and admiration they speak least,
and yet speak most: there is more divine
Oratory in holy silence, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
expressions in blessed admiration,
than all our inventions could reach: what
can man speak of him who is that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
and incomprehensible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty?
This may appear a paradox to you,
that silence should speak, and admiration

commend: but it is no paradox, when
the object of our commendation, is by
infinit degrees exalted above our blessing
and our practice. O! men of the world,
will you once be perswaded to make that
blessed divorce betwixt you and your
idols, that there may be an everlasting
conjunction betwixt <hi>God</hi> and you: O! if
ye had so much divine understanding, as
to judge of things according to their real
worth, <hi>He alone should be exalted in that
day:</hi> Come and see and behold what
i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>finit sweetnesse is treasured up in him,
those springs wherewith ye delight your
selves, shall ere long dry up; but <hi>he</hi> is that
high and infinit spring, which alwayes
floweth out, and yet is not impaired.</p>
               <p>The second thing whereby we may
attain to this bless<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d duty of Mortification
to the world, is this, by reflecting how
passing &amp; transient those things are, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the sons of men use to solace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<hi>Paul</hi> doth presse Mortification
to the world from this consideration,
1 <hi>Cor. 7. 31. The fashion of this world pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
away:</hi> the word is most emphatick,
this <hi>Schema</hi> and representation of the
world or this stage play of the world,
it passeth away; therefore, <hi>let those that
rejoyce he as though they rejoyced not, and be
careful for nothing:</hi> this is clear, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 17.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65886:105"/>
and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. did we solidly believe
how changable those enjoyments of the
world were, would we hurry our selves
so much in our pursuits after them?
Those who are listed up in their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
this day, may be thrust down low
the next day: <hi>Ioh,</hi> who was a man
enriched in many things, yet a few dayes,
yea, we may say, a few hours made a
sad and strange exchange: We may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that, with great assurance of truth,
<hi>Surely man at his best estate is altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi>
that word that is there (<hi>at his best
estate</hi>) may be rendered thus, <hi>man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he stand: Etiamsi constitutus,</hi> in
your most fixed and settled condition in
the world: his is the Emblem and Motto of
your state <hi>vanity,</hi> most subject to change:
and why should you weary your selves
in the fire for that which is very vanity?</p>
               <p>The third thing by which ye may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this duty of Mortification, is to be
much taken up in the consideration of
the brevity of your life: I suppose, that
if we were walking more in the house of
mourning, and were believing that truth,
<hi>that it is appointed for man once to die,</hi>
and that shortly, we must be brought
home unto that unchangeable estate of
life; O! how would this allay us in our
pursuits? I think this were a little water,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65886:106"/>
which we might mix with our wine, when
there is greatest confidence of Creature
contentments: left the foam of this wine
should distemper our head, we may
mix it with this water, <hi>the brevity of
our life.</hi> It is a sweet subject for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
when we are most high, to be
much in the consideration of this, that
within a few dayes we shall be most low.
What is your life but a vapour, which
doth quickly evanish, and doth but
appear for a little? Suppose the whole
Creation should stay with you during all
your time, yet how short should your
enjoyment be? what is mans life, but a
hand-breadth, these four finger-breadths,
which is one of the least of all geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
measures; there is morning, forenoon,
afternoon, and night, all which do
amount to a day? there is infancy,
youth, manhood, and old age, and those
do quickly evanish and passe away. How
many are hurried into eternity, in the
first step of their dayes, in their infancy?
And again, how many in their youth?
and we have frequent experience, that
many in their manhood, and in the
flour of their age, that sentence cometh
forth, <hi>Return ye children of men:</hi> and there
is not one amongst an hundred, that
do attain to that utmost period that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65886:106"/>
nature doth allow; and what though ye
did live fourscore of years, which is the
utmost period that nature hath allowed,
yet doth your time quickly evanish and
flee away? Why should you solace
your selves with those things that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eternally remain with you? when
ye go down to the grave, you can take
nothing of these things with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for in
all points as you came, so shall ye go,
and what profite is there that ye have
laboured for the wind?</p>
               <p>The fourth thing whereby we may be
helped to attain this, is this, Be much
in the mortifying of those corruptions
which cannot be entertained, but by
intertaining also this woful corruption of
covetousnesse: there are some corruptions,
which have so near affinity to, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
dependance upon, this sin, that
if these be not crushed, we cannot attain
to this duty of Mortification, there is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality
and pride,</hi> these two grand enemies,
to the accomplishment of this blessed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
and we would begin to crush these,
before we can begin to accomplish this.</p>
               <p>There is another way which is this,
be much taken up in the reflecting upon
that blessed hope, and that grace which
shall be brought unto you at the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Iesus Christ. Peter</hi> presseth sobriety to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65886:107"/>
all things here below, by this arguments,
1 <hi>Pet. 1. 13. Be sober,</hi> and he giveth this
reason of it, <hi>for the grace that shall be
brought unto you at the revelation of Iesus
Christ:</hi> O! were we much taken up in
beholding that blessed estate of life, which
the souls of just men made perfect shall
have with <hi>God,</hi> where we shall enjoy, and
yet not loath: there shall be an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conjunction betwixt desire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of him who is the person belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so that it thinks never to receive sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
all it doth receive, is more to
provoke its appetite, then to satisfie its
desire.</p>
               <p>There is a last, which is this, be much
in the consideration of that day, when
all the families of the earth shall appear
before him <hi>in the valley of decision.</hi> This
indeed would help us, to much mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to these things of the world, as is
clear from <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 9. had we the faith
of that day engraven upon our spirits,
that we must render an account of our
wayes, O! how wary should we be
in ingaging with vanity? I think the
great cause why sin hath so universal a
dominion over the sons of men is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we do not solidly believe that there
is such a day approaching, when we
shall appear before the judgement seat
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65886:107"/>
of him, who shall judge not after the
seeing of the eye, nor shall reprove after
the hearing of the ear, but shall judge
righteous judgment: The terror of the
Lord would certainly perswade us, if we
did believe this. O! what a holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnesse
should we have in walking
after the paths of our idols.</p>
               <p>Now we shall shut up our discourse
with this, be perswaded once to begin
that work of mortification, and especially
in mortifying your love to the world: he
that returneth victor after war with his
idols, we may call him <hi>Ioseph,</hi> for he
shall be as a <hi>fruitful bough whose
branches run over the wall.</hi> If once
you spoil that grand and arch-rebel,
who doth so much oppose you, in a
manner, you should stand alone and
sing a triumph, they should flee when
none pursueth; <hi>and we ought be strong as
a lyon, and who should rouse us up?</hi>

mystery of Christianity, <hi>to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with every estate, wherein he was
placed,</hi> that did bring him down
from that high pinacle of his excellency,
and did degrade him from that primitive
glory, wherewith he was cloathed, for
he not being content with that precious
and excellent lot, wherein <hi>God</hi> had placed
him, but coveting after a more noble and
excellent Beeing, he came exceedingly
short of this design. And such is the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
and woful frame of spirit, wherewith
men are possessed, that they can fancy no
blessedness in what they are, but imagine
a great blessednesse to be in what they are
not; hence is it that men do covet the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65886:108"/>
lot of others, and are dissatisfied with
their own estate and condition: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the affections of men while they are
living under these sphears which are in
perpetual motion, can never be satisfied,
nor be at rest: which was the observation
of that master of experiences. <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 20.
<hi>Hell and destruction are never full, so the eyes
of man are never satisfied;</hi> and as he saith,
<hi>Eccles. 1. 8. The eye is not satisfied with
seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing:</hi> And
we may likewayes adde, that the heart is
not satisfied with the enjoying; And it
is certainly thorow the deceitfuness of the
spirit of man, and that invisible root of
pride, that every lot and condition of life
is subject to satiety and loathing: pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
men do envy the greatnesse of Princes,
and Princes do envy the quiet repose of
privat men, though they will not descend
nor reduce themselves unto that estate,
but do alwayes fear that, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they are constrained to desire: And
believe me, a Christians sitting down
seriously, to contemplat and view what
an infinit multitude of hopes, fears and
desires the spirit of man is possessed with;
as likewayes to behold how that <hi>vanity
and vexation of spirit,</hi> is engraven upon the
choisest lot that a Christian can meet with
here, he may be provoked to look out
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65886:109"/>
at the windows of his prison-house, and
long for that precious day, when <hi>Christ
should be as a roe, or as a young hinde coming
over the mountains of Bether,</hi> waiting to
be exalted to that precious and excellent
estate of life, where there shall be neither
loathing nor longing: <hi>Abel</hi> who hath
been the first possessor of heaven of all the
house and family of <hi>Adam,</hi> and hath
dwelt in it near six thousand years, yet
there is not in him the least inclination or
motion to change or alter his estate; there
is no loathing in heaven nor desire to
flit there; And, believe me, this divine
mystery of contentment with every lot and
condition, in which a Christian is placed,
is not easily attained. O! what repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
hath the unmortified spirit of man
to the dispensations of <hi>God,</hi> in regulating
his lot and estate, which doth alone speak
forth the <hi>Atheisme</hi> of our heart: for it is,
as it were, man proposing a model, and
form unto <hi>God,</hi> how he should rule and
govern the world. I think Christians are
as much subject to the fashion of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and pride as any. It was a noble
saying of one; in the commendation of
victory over a mans self, <hi>Tunc omnia
regna tenebis, cum poteris rex esse tui,</hi> ye shall
then be made a possessor of all kingdoms,
when ye shall be made a ruler and king
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65886:109"/>
of your self. And no doubt, one that
is once mortified to this passion of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
he may dwell upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Ararat</hi> in the midst of all the
revolutions, and changes that are here
below; such a Christian may sweetly
contemplat the overturning of Estates
and Common-wealths, and may patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endure every lot that doth befall him,
and possesse his soul in patience: And
certainly, if men knew but this one thing,
that the whole circumference of the earth,
is but one point of the Universe, and that
all time that hath been, is, or shall be, is
but one instant, in comparison of eternity:
and what is man but a part of that point?
and what is his life but a small part of
that instant? And why then should
man anxiously complain, to spend a part
of a moment in enduring the most anxious
and sad things that can befall him? And,
(as <hi>Christ</hi> doth most divinely speak) <hi>Can
a man by taking thought, adde one cubit to
his stature?</hi> what poor advantage hath a
man by his discontentment and sorrow,
if it be not to render himself more
miserable? we may say of heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindednesse
and of contentment, they
are like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Twins, that live and
die together, they are two sweet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
that alwayes go along together,
and cannot be divided.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:65886:110"/>
But to descend a little more to the
words, you have <hi>Paul</hi> in them obviating
any misconstruction, that the <hi>Philippians</hi>
might have of his joy, which he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in the former <hi>verse,</hi> as if he had been
one that was coveting great things for
himself, or desiring to be great in the
world, no, saith he, <hi>I speak not these
things because of want,</hi> which formerly
I had, and is now made up, for, saith he,
<hi>I have learned in every estate that I am, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to be content.</hi> There is no lot, saith
<hi>Paul,</hi> but I can patiently endure it, and
can with a divine complacency carry my
self under it; And this he proveth in the
1 2. <hi>verse, I know</hi> saith he, <hi>how to be debas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
I am instructed in this divine art, how
to walk soberly under debasement, and I
<hi>know,</hi> saith he, <hi>how to abound:</hi> I am not
one that is puft up with a prosperous lot
in the world: And least this assertion of
<hi>Pauls</hi> should seem to be a boasting beyond
his line, and of being exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
he doth sweetly subjoyn that humble
assertion, <hi>I can do all things through Christ
that strengtheneth me;</hi> As if he would have
said, do not mistake me, or conceive me
under a more divine and high notion then
ye ought, for I am but a poor and sinful
man, who can do nothing of my self, but as
I am over-acted by a divine and supreme
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65886:110"/>
hand. I am enabled to triumph over the
most adverse and sinistrous lot, that can
befal me.</p>
               <p>The words which we have read, in the
original they are most significant and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick;
that word which is here render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Content, is All sufficient,</hi> and so the words
may sweetly run thus, <hi>I have learned in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
estate wherein</hi> I <hi>am, to be all-sufficient,</hi> of
which that word, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14. 14. Is a sweet
commentary, <hi>The back-slider in heart shall be
filled with the fruit of his own way, but a godly
man shall be satisfied from himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> In a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
there is a well-spring of everlasting
consolation with in the Christian, which
maketh him endure every anxious lot.
And no doubt, that word <hi>I have learned,</hi>
doth both speak the difficulty of attaining
this mystery of divine contentment, as
likewayes it speaketh out that ignorance
of this divine and noble end, wherewith
<hi>Paul</hi> was once possessed: I was once, saith
he, as rude as any in the knowledge of
this thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but now through the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
&amp; wisdom of <hi>God,</hi> I am made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the knowledge of these things. And
that word <hi>in every estate,</hi> doth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commend that great pitch of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
unto which <hi>Paul</hi> had attained, there
was no lot that could befal him wrong;
And we shall only say this by the way,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65886:111"/>
continuance of affliction is one of the
greatest occasions of impatience that is
imaginable. A Christian, when first he
meets with a cross, may be provoked to
salute it, and embrace it but if it be length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
out upon him, then he cryeth forth,
<hi>hast thou found me, O thou mine enemy?</hi> and
then beginneth to call in question the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kindness of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to complain,
<hi>that he hath shut up his mercies in everlasting
forgetfulnesse;</hi> though we may say, in the
day that a Christian shall be passing <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the valley of the shadow of death,</hi> he
shall be sweetly convinced of his impatiency,
when a Christian shall be constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to engrave that Motto upon the door
of his everlasting rest <hi>he hath done all things
well:</hi> What thoughts will ye have of
these risings and debatings of spirit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ye have been possessed? We may
imagine and not without some ground,
that a great part of eternity shall be spent
in interrogations, <hi>Christ</hi> shall interrogate
us, if we laked any thing while we were
here below, and we shall be constrained
to answer, <hi>nothing,</hi> even in that day when
he sent us forth without scrip; or money,
or without sandals or any thing, and
those that did belong to us, we shall be
constrained, to subscribe to the <hi>infinit wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God,</hi> in regulating of our lot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:65886:111"/>
Now in speaking upon this divine qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and duty of divine contentment,
(which we conceive, is a duty most requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
in these dayes) we shall not insist long
in pointing out what this divine grace of
contentment is, but we conceive, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
not only this, a sweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
frame of spirit, under every anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
lot and dispensation with which we
meet, of which that word is a commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 3. where it is said of <hi>Aaron,</hi>
when his sons were cut off, <hi>He held his
peace,</hi> and that word, <hi>Psal. 62. 1. Truly
my soul waiteth upon the Lord:</hi> But the
words in the original are this, <hi>Truly my
soul be thou silent unto God,</hi> as they are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in the margine of the book, as if he
would have said, do not fret nor be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted,
because of any thing that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
out unto thee.</p>
               <p>But likewayes this grace and duty of
contentment includeth, a holy complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey,
and sweet serenity and calmness of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
under every lot, of which that word is
a commentary. <hi>Jam. 1. 2. Count it all joy
when you fall into diverse temptations,</hi> and
that word, <hi>Rom. 5. 3. We glory in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Neither shall we dwell long upon
this, to prove that it is the duty of a
Christian to be content with every estate
wherein God shall put him: This is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65886:112"/>
clear, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 8. Having food and raiment
let us therewith be content:</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5.
<hi>Be content with these things that you have</hi>
and <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 7. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 14. And we
may say, if a Christian made the world
but his servant, little would content him,
but if once he make the world his master,
and lord of his affections, then his desires
will be infinit, and cannot at all be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
We shall not long stand to inveigh
against that too much addictedness of
man to those passing and transient vanities
of the world: we conceive there are these
three things, which men do most earnestly
covet, there is pleasure, riches, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
And certainly, these are below an
immortal spirit, to fix their desires upon
them: would ye have <hi>Solomons</hi> verdict of
riches, O ye that trust in uncertain riches,
ye have it sweetly in, <hi>Prov. 23. 5. Wilt thou
set thine eyes upon that which is not?</hi> In a
manner, riches they have not a being, for
<hi>they take wings to themselves and they flee
away,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth most sweetly speak,
<hi>Eccles. 5. 11. If riches increase, what profit</hi>
(saith he) <hi>is there to the owner thereof,
save to be beholder of them with their eyes:</hi>
all that the owner of riches hath is, the
seeing of them, which a man, who is a
passer by may likewayes have, though he
be not a possessor of them. And hence is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65886:112"/>
that word, <hi>L. k.</hi> 14. where the man desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be excused for not coming to Christ;
saith of himself, <hi>I have bought a piece of
ground and must needs go see it;</hi> all his
enjoyment of it was comprehended in that
one poor thing, <hi>to behold it;</hi> And as for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and glory, which, spirits that are
more refined, and are not so wedded to
the things of a world, pursue after, I would
only have them knowing that one word,
<hi>Psal. 62. 9. Men of high degree are a lie, and
men of low degree are vanity:</hi> as if he would
have said, any preheminency that one
hath, that hath an excellent lot in the
world above a poor one, doth consist in
this, the one is a vanity, and the other is
a lying vanity, speaking somewhat to be
in him, which is not really in him; and
that word, <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 23. where, speaking
of <hi>Bernice,</hi> that came in with great pomp
and glory unto the Senat-house, the word
that is there rendered <hi>pomp and glory</hi> is this,
he came in with a great fantasie <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
with a great show and
image, without any thing in reality: And
as for pleasures of the world, with which
these epicurean spirits of the world are so
much besotted, know that verdict of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
which he hath of these things. <hi>Vanity
of vanities, and all things are vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of spirit:</hi> And what can the man do
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65886:113"/>
that cometh after the king? If <hi>Solomon</hi>
found no more, no doubt, none that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
after him, can find any more.</p>
               <p>But that which we shall speak to first
upon this, shall be, what are the causes
and principles from whence the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
of one doth flow, under any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
or sad lot that doth befal him? And
we conceive that it either doth proceed
from this, a Christian not being much in
the exercise of selt-examination, as it is
clear from that word, <hi>Psal. 4. 4. Examine
your selves upon your bed and be still,</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so much, that the compendious way
unto submission and contentment under
any lot, is to be much in self-examination:
And certainly self-examination hath much
influence upon contentment under every
lot, because such a one doth most accuratly
take up these imperfections and blemishes
that are in him, so in stead of complaining,
he is constrained to wonder and cry forth,
<hi>Why should a living man complain,</hi> a man for
the punishment of his sin: likewayes one
that is much in self-examination, is a man
that can take up the intendment of the rod,
as likewayes the advantage of it, and so
he is constrained patiently to bear the rod,
in his youth, and to sit down and adore
the unsearchable wisdom of God in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing
such things to him. That word,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65886:113"/>
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 3. is oft-times verified of us, <hi>the
heart of man perverteth his way,</hi> and then
he fretteth against the <hi>Lord,</hi> when he is
chastened for it. O! but if a Christian
were dwelling much at home, he might
wonder that yet he hath a being in the
world, and is not cut off from the right
hand of the <hi>Lord.</hi> O! bless him eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that ye are not sent away to be reserved
in everlasting chains.</p>
               <p>There is this likewayes that doth occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
discontentment under our lot, and it
is, want of that divine preparation to meet
with every lot that can befal us before it
come. We think a Christian ought to
be general in his resolutions, to bear every
cross that <hi>Christ</hi> will carve out. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there are these two advantages that
a Christian hath of general and universal
resolutions. First he hath this advantage,
that when he is chastened, as it were, in
his goods or any other thing that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to him, he beginneth to sing a song of
praise, because it is not worse with him:
there can no lot befal a man who is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
in his resolutions, but he will have
a song of praise unto God, because of it.
Secondly, he hath this advantage, that
foresight and resolution to meet with any
cross doth exceedingly dispose the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
for meeting with it: we conceive that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65886:114"/>
word which is, <hi>Iob</hi> 3. 25. hath had great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on <hi>Iobs</hi> patience, <hi>for the thing which
I greatly feared, is come upon me:</hi> afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do oft-times surprize us, and so we
faint in the day of adversity, and so prove
our strength to be but small.</p>
               <p>There is this likewayes which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth
our discontentment, and it is this,
that little heavenly mindedness, that is in
a Christian, when he meeteth with his
rod: O! but a Christian sitting down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mount <hi>Pisgah,</hi> to behold that promised
land, might with patience bear his rod:
this is clear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. compared with
<hi>vers.</hi> 17. where <hi>Paul</hi> giveth this reason of
his courage and constancy under his rod,
that he had an eye unto those things that
were eternal: did ye never know what
such a thing meant, as to drown the
thoughts of your present misery, in these
precious depths of eternity, to be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so much in heaven, as might infinitly
solace, yea, and make up all your losses
here. I confess that opinion of the Stoicks,
that did commend apathie and want of
passions unto men, that they should not
be much moved with grief for the want of
any thing, nor be moved with joy for the
having or possessing of any thing, is in some
sense good: hence was it that in some sense
they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> divinely, <hi>nihil boni vel mali ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65886:114"/>
homini, nisi bonus vel malus animus;</hi>
that there was no evil nor good that did
befal man, but only a good and evil minde:
If the heart was in a divine and spiritual
frame, they knew not what any other sad
or anxious lot could do to them.</p>
               <p>There is this likewayes which occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
discontentment, and it is this, the want
of the taking up <hi>God</hi> as the cause and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of those sad evils which befal us;
which if it were once believed, we should
be ashamed to dispute and murmur so
much as we do: this is clear, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.
near the close, that word of <hi>Elies, It is the
Lord, let him do what seemeth him good:</hi> and
that word, <hi>Psal. 39. 9. I was dumb, I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not my mouth,</hi> and this reason is given of
it, <hi>because thou didst it:</hi> and that word,
<hi>Isa. 39. 8. Good is the word of the Lord,</hi>
And certainly the murmurings and repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of our hearts, do speak that grosse
Atheism that dwelleth within us: O! durst
we debate with him who is <hi>Almighty,</hi> or
put him to render an accompt of his ways,
who is that <hi>supream and absolute One?</hi> Is it
sit to be said to such a <hi>Prince</hi> as he is, thou
art ungodly, and to condemn him who is
most just? O! be much in the study of
the soveraignty of <hi>God,</hi> when he, as it
were, doth call as in asolemn assembly, all
your terrors round about.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:65886:115"/>
There is this l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kewayes which doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
it, which is, our little being in the
meditation and serious thoughts of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of our life and of time: If a man knew
that it were but for an hour, or for ten
days that he were to endure tribulation, he
might patiently submit, and bear with his
rod: this is clear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29. compared
with the following verses, where, from
that doctrine that time was short, he doth
infer this exhorration, <hi>let those that weep, be
as though they weeped not,</hi> as if he would
have said, let them not be much moved
with those things, time time will have a
close: Believe me, it is not long before the
small period of time that hath interveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
betwixt eternity before, and eternity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
shall be sweetly swallowed up, and
there shall be nothing but eternity.</p>
               <p>And there is this lastly which doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
our great discontentment, under
our rod, which is, that unmortifedness
and subduedness of spirit: pride being
the great predominant evil, and if we
may allude to that word, <hi>Only by pride
cometh contention;</hi> we may certainly say
it holdeth well here, that only by pride
are these contendings that we have with
<hi>God,</hi> concerning his dispensations towards
us. In sum, it is this, it is impossible for a
Christian not humble, to be content:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65886:115"/>
pride is one of the greatcst opposites unto
divine contentment under any rod that
we meet with: O! but if a Christian
were humble, he might sit in the dust,
and sweetly adore the infinit love and
patience of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we shall in the second place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
some considerations, that may hinder
a Christian, or any other, from being
discontent with any lot that doth befal
them; and the first is this, that there are
many sad and wofull companions of a
Christians discontentment and repyning
against any dispensation of <hi>God,</hi> and we
conceive there is not only this bad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
that a Christian hereby is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed
and unfitted to go about spiritual
duties, especially these two, of <hi>prayer</hi>
and <hi>praise:</hi> It is impossible for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
that is under the exercise of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
to pray or praise; there is
some what of this pointed at, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8.
where this is a qualification of a right
prayer, that he should be without wrath,
not having any murmurings or repynings
within his heart: as likewayes it is clear
concerning praise, <hi>Psal. 57. 7. My heart is
fixed, it is fixed,</hi> which speaketh so much
as this, that praise doth require a divine
and composed frame of spirit: and it is
most certain, that discontentment doth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65886:116"/>
impede prayer, for there are three sweet
ingredients of the exercise of prayer,
which discontentment doth exceedingly
cut off; there is love, fervency, and faith;
which no doubt discontentment doth
abridge; a discontented Christian cannot
be a Christian burning with love; jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
is such a predominant with him, that
love cannot be his exercise: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if prayer do not proceed from the
precious principle of love, it wants that
one arme which it ought to have:
Neither can a Christian exercise faith,
because he hath now, as it were, taken
up so bad an opinion of <hi>God,</hi> that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
repose his confidence not hope in him:
And as for fervency, they are so much in
porring upon their present lot, that they
can as it were, be servent about nothing,
but only in the removal of that. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that let a Christian examine himself,
there is nothing that cuts the neck of
prayer so much as discontent; in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the spirit as it were, is turned bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,
being uncomposed for any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
converse with <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this bad companion likewayes,
which accompanieth discontentment, we
are incapacitat, and rendered altogether
unable to resist temptations, while dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment
is in exercise. It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65886:116"/>
for a Christian to be a Mortifier,
or resister of lust, when discontentment
is once in exercise; And there are these
two evils, that get most marvelous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
under discontentment, and these
are, the predominant lust of such a one,
be what it will, and pride, these two
evils do spring apace: And certainly,
all other lusts do get much victory over
such a one: a Christian may losse more
by one hours discontentment under a
crosse, then he can regain in many
Months, yea on this side of eternity:
And it is no wonder that temptations do
prevail upon such a one, he is off his
watch, and his strength is gone: In a
manner, temptation speaketh that, <hi>Their
strength is gone from them, let us go up and
put them to flight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this bad companion like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
that doth accompany discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
want of tenderness of spirit, and
the losse of it. It is most certain, that there
is nothing that doth cut off tenderness,
so much as discontentment: for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
that is such, is not living under the
impression of the fear or of the love of
the Almighty, which are the two great
principles of tenderness of spirit. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
let one examine. they will find,
that by their anxiety and briterness of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65886:117"/>
spirit, they have made their hearts to die
as a stone within them, and have made
their bands strong upon their spirits.</p>
               <p>And there is this last bad companion
of discontentment, A Christians under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
of all the former mercies which
he hath received, when once a Christian
meeteth with that which contradicteth
his humor, he loseth his esteem of every
thing that formerly hath been bestowed
upon him: There is something of this
pointed at, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. last in <hi>Jacobs</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency
of the losse of <hi>Ioseph;</hi> where he
doth undervalue all his mercies beside;
And it is most clear in that word, <hi>Esth.</hi>
5. 12, 13. where, though it be spoken of
a wicked man, yet by proportion it
holdeth of a Christian, that because
<hi>Mordecai</hi> did not bow his knee, he cried
sorth, concerning all his other mercies,
<hi>they avail me nothing;</hi> he knew not what
it was to put a price upon mercies that he
had received; but because this which
was the great lust of his heart was away,
he did undervalue the rest: And it is
most certain, that there is nothing doth so
highten a Christians disrespect unto the
most precious and excellent things of <hi>God,</hi>
as this of discontent: And this is one
subtilty and device of Sathan, that a
Christian may with greater ease, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65886:117"/>
with lesse conviction do it: They do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
construct their choisest mercies,
to be delusions, and so upon that account
begin to undervalue and misprize them.</p>
               <p>There is this consideration which may
move you to wrestle against discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
It is a character and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mark of a Christian from a Reprobat:
I would have Murmurers seriously to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
upon that sad word, which is in
<hi>Jude. 19. vers.</hi> compared with the 15.
where speaking of Christs coming to
judge and execure vengeance, the first
put in the roll are these, <hi>These are Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers
and complainers:</hi> and that word
1 <hi>Cor. 10, 10. Be not murmurers, as many of
them were; and were destroyed by the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi>
And certainly, it is no wonder that
Murmuring passe under so bad a notion,
not only because it is indeed that sin,
which speaketh out our Atheisme most,
but because it is that sin which doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
most a Christian or any others
desire to be independent, and not in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
unto <hi>God.</hi> In a manner, such
is the woful ambition of our spirit, that
we desire not to depend upon him, but
that we should have our own lot in our
own hand, to carve out unto our selves.
O! we know not what it is to give Christ
a negative vote in the dispensations that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65886:118"/>
do befal us: we love to be co-ordinat
with <hi>God,</hi> and not subordinat to him. O put
a blank in his hand, desire him to fill it
up with what he liketh: Christ doth oft-times
put a blank in a Christians hand, as
in that word, <hi>What will ye that I should do
unto you,</hi> there is <hi>Christs</hi> blank, that he
doth give us, and though thorow our
ignorance we cannot fill it up, it is best to
give it back to himself, that he may fill
it up, with what he listeth.</p>
               <p>There is this consideration also, that
may perswade you to desist from discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment;
It is that sin which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
the accomplishment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
As likewayes it doth interrupt
the exercise of faith upon the promises;
this is clear, <hi>Num.</hi> 14, 27. compared
with 28. where that promise that was
given to them of entering into the land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> they were cut short of it, because of
their murmuring: and it doth interrupt
the exercise of faith upon the promises,
as is clear, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106, 24. compared with
<hi>vers.</hi> 25. where it is said, <hi>they believed
not his word,</hi> and the ground of it is given,
<hi>for they were murmurers:</hi> And it is no
wonder that murmuring interrupt the
exercise of faith upon the promises; for
it is impossible for a murmurer either to
have the faith of the omnipotency of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:65886:118"/>
or to have the faith of his goodness or
love, which are these two precious pillars
of faith upon which it must build it self:
O! but these that begin once to debate
with him, do quickly put faith out of
exercise. And I would have you know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, That there is a discontentment
of judgment, and a discontentment of
the will and affections; and oft-times a
Christian will win over the discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of judgment and reason, when he
cannot mortifie the discontentment of his
will and affections; for the soveraignty
of <hi>God;</hi> and the sinfulness of our nature,
will silence our reason; but, no doubt,
it must be his own immediat hand, that
must silence the murmurings of our will:
this is clear, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 5. where <hi>David</hi> is
convinced of the unreasonableness of his
discontent, and yet he is forced to debate
with his will concerning the quiting of
it.</p>
               <p>There is this consideration likewayes,
which may provoke you to desist from
discontentment under your lot; It is a
most unreasonable evil for a Christian to
be discontent. for as <hi>Christ</hi> speaketh <hi>Math.</hi>
6. 27. What profit have you by taking
thought? Can you add one cubit to your
stature? It is a poor thing, when a man
hath lost his good, to losse his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65886:119"/>
also: what a poor revenge is that
which a man taketh of himself? And
certainly, the unreasonableness of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
under the rod, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear in this, that it hindereth
and interrupteth a Christians seeing of
any mercy that is in the rod, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for a discontented one to take up
mercy in his stroak: but also that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
is the compendious way, for the
prolonging of your strait; and the involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of you in greater miseries and thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms:
As likewayes, impatience doth
heighten and increase the cause of your
bondage, and multiplieth your iniquities:
O! but it is a sweet and excellent study
for a Christian, to endeavour patience
under every lot? And, in a manner,
when we cannot read love in his hand,
nor in his face, because of his frowns and
stroaks, yet by faith to draw aside the
vail, and read love in his heart, and cry
forth, I <hi>know the thoughts of his heart, that
they are thoughts of peace, and not of evil:</hi>
Certainly it is through discontentment,
that we cry forth, <hi>Though his words be as
soft as oil and butter, yet war is in his heart;</hi>
we do change him with contradictions,
betwixt his profession and his purpose.</p>
               <p>And there is this consideration like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
which may deter you from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65886:119"/>
which is this, It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for a Christian to profite by his
rod, while he is discontent: all the time
that a Christian is under the fit of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
he spendeth so much of his time
most prodigally: not imploying it, not
promoving that which is the great design
of the rod, <hi>to take away Sin,</hi> but studying
to involve himself in greater captivity
and bondage, and to subject himself
under the hand of his iniquities. O! that
ye might be perswaded to exercise more
divine contentment under your lot, and
that ye may be more exercised in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating
and beholding those precious and
excellent things that are above. That is
a most remarkable word which <hi>Iacob</hi> had
to <hi>Esau, Gen. 33. 11. I have enough:</hi> the
word in the original is this, <hi>I have all:</hi>
And as Criticks do observe, that word
which <hi>Esau</hi> had in the 8. verse: <hi>I have
enough,</hi> is not that which <hi>Iacob</hi> hath in
the 11. vers, <hi>I have enough;</hi> that though
<hi>Iacob</hi> was a poorer man then <hi>Esau,</hi> yet
<hi>he had all:</hi> Such a Christian as hath <hi>Christ</hi>
for his portion, may sweetly sing, though
I be poor, yet do I possesse all things,
<hi>as having nothing, and yet possessing all things,
as sorrowing, yet alwayes rejoycing</hi> as poor
and yet behold we are rich. It is not
long before that day shall come, <hi>when
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65886:120"/>
Christ shall make up his Iewles,</hi> when there
shall be a clear and most palpable differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
made betwixt the precious and the
vile: Behold he is upon his way, and
therefore do not murmur nor repine: A
Christian must not expect two heavens,
it is enough, if he possesse one, we must
not travel to heaven thorow a bed of roses,
it is not much though we go to heaven
in a fiery chariot, having afflictions and
calamity our companions all alongs the
way: when our feet shall be passing
thorow the thereshold of the door of our
everlasting rest, then our chains shall fall
from our hands, and our fetters from
our feet, then might we lift up our heads
with joy and rejoyce. O! but when
those heavens which you behold shall be
rolled up as a scroll, when those two
great vails, the visible vail of the heavens,
and the invisible vail of iniquity shall
be rent from the top to the bottom, and
we shall have most clear and precious
discoveries <hi>of that noble plant of renown,</hi>
when we shall sit down at the well
head and drink, and forget our misery,
and remember our poverty no more:
let hope evanish unto fruition, and saith
unto possession, and let time sweetly eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
unto eternity.</p>

               <p>IT is an ordinary and usual error and
delusion among Christians, that they
place the exercise of religion in these
duties that are more sublime and
high unto their apprehension, as faith,
hope, and prayer, but undervalue the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of those lower duties as contentment,
mortification to the world, and charity to
the poor, as not being so essentially neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for the being of a Christian. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that if any of you had been a
hearer of the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> when he was
discoursing upon that divine subject,
wherein pure Religion and undefiled did
consist, no doubt, ye would have imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he would have brought forth some
divine and profound thing, in the exercise
of which, pure Religion before <hi>God and
the Father,</hi> did consist: but believe me,
Religion doth more consist in practice,
then in speculation, and more in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
then in refined notions: What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ye of such a definition of pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65886:121"/>
and undefiled, as that which is <hi>Jam.</hi>
1. 27. <hi>Pure religion and undefiled</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in mortification to the world, and in
charity to the poor, those two low under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued
duties. And this may further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
and commend the exercise of these
low and undervalued duties, that in the
day when Christ <hi>shall</hi> appear to judge the
quick and the dead, the ground of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the Saints shall be founded
upon this low and contemptible duty,
<hi>charity to the poor,</hi> and shall be that ground
which is given of that eternal blessedness,
which approbation of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> no
doubt is a confirmation of <hi>Iames</hi> his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
and that which shall be the ground
of the reprobation of the wicked, shall be
the neglect of this low duty, <hi>want of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the poor, and visiting of the fatherless:</hi>
And believe me, in the exercise of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
quality of Christian-contentment,
not a little of religion doth consist: <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, <hi>Godliness with contentment is great gain.</hi>
It is by faith, that a Christian enjoyeth
<hi>God,</hi> it is by love that he enjoyeth his
neighbour, and by contentment that he
enjoyeth himself. We confess, it is a most
mysterious and difficult lesson for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in each lot he is placed in, to be cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
forth, <hi>It is good for me to be here, let me
make a tabernacle here.</hi> Ordinarily we have
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65886:121"/>
strong desires to have the carving out of
our own lo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Solomon</hi> maketh mention <hi>of
three things, that are not satisfied, and of four
things that never say it is enough, the grave,
the barren womb, the earth that is not filled
with water; and the fire.</hi> And we may adde
unto these four, this one fifth, the most
part of men who are unsatisfied in their
lot: It is no wonder that men unlimited
in their desires, meet with great disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
for those that have exorbitant
and excentrick desires, must have great
hopes, as likewayes great disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Therefore it were certainly your
advantage, to be studying to compendize
and abridge your desires after these things
that are here below: for as one spoke well,
he conceived that the greatest riches of a
man did consist in poverty of desires, and
in being content with that lot, wherein
<hi>God</hi> had placed him. There are only these
three things that befala Christian, under
which it is great difficulty for him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to contentment; there is the losse of
his predominant lust and idol, especially
if it be any whit refined and vailed under
the vail and vizard of any vertue, as if one
be given unto the seeking of the applause
of the world there is nothing under which
there is so great a difficulty to exercise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
as in the losing of that applause,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65886:122"/>
our hearts oft-times crying forth, <hi>they have
taken away my gods, and what have</hi> I <hi>more?</hi>
And certainly, oft-times our lusts die unto
us, before we die unto them, which is the
occasion that our living lusts, do sit down
and lament over the graves of our buried
idols, and wisheth that they may awake
and stand up from the dead. And we
shall only say to such, <hi>Wo to you, when all
men shall speak well of you,</hi> which may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
people from pursuing after that idol,
but much more especially that word,
<hi>Ioh. 5. 44. How can ye believe, that seek glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of another;</hi> which words seem to
import an inconsistency betwixt the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of faith, and betwixt the exercise of
pursuit after idols.</p>
               <p>There is this likewayes that befalleth a
Christian, under which it is a great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
for him to attain to contentment,
and that is the continuance and lengthning
forth of any affliction that doth befal him:
Oft-times a Christian, when first he meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with his crosse, will salute and imbrace
it, and will cry forth, <hi>this is a grief, and</hi> I
<hi>must bear it:</hi> but when the threed of our
affliction is spun out unto any length, then
we begin to be discontent and to cry forth,
<hi>hast thou found me, O thou mine enemy?</hi> This
was clear in the exercise of <hi>Iob,</hi> who when
first he met with his crosse, did express di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65886:122"/>
contentment under a most eminent
way, crying forth, <hi>blessed be the Name of
the Lord;</hi> when he was made to possesse
months of vanity, and wearisome nights
were appointed for him, then he cryeth
forth, I <hi>choose strangling and death, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than life.</hi> And we shall only say
to such, be much in the meditation of
that precious and immense hope, and go
up to the top of Mount <hi>Pisgah,</hi> and there
be with <hi>Moses</hi> in the viewing of that land
which is afar'off. As likewayes, study to
seal that divine conclusion, <hi>that he doth all
things well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is this thirdly which befalleth a
Christian, under which he hath a great
difficulty to exercise contentment, which
is, poverty and want in the world. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
who was well acquainted with his
own heart, and knew well his unsuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to bear such a crosse, cryeth forth,
<hi>Prov. 30. 8, 9. Give me not poverty, least</hi> I
<hi>steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</hi> It
is certain, that to exercise faith upon <hi>God,</hi>
for the receipt of common mercies, is more
difficult, then to exercise faith on <hi>God</hi> for
our eternal salvation, and for our interest
in <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> And we conceive, that
the reason why a Christian findeth greater
difficulty, to exercise faith upon <hi>God,</hi> for
the receipt of these common mercies, then
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65886:123"/>
for the receiving of that eardinal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
mercy, <hi>salvation through Iesus
Christ,</hi> to be either this, that faith, when
it is exercised upon the one, most simply
and immediately relyeth upon the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
and faithfulness of <hi>God,</hi> abstracted
from all other props and considerations,
for there, sense and reason doth contradict
the exercise of faith; but when Christians
do exercise faith upon <hi>God</hi> for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and salvation, they ordinarily have
either somewhat of sense or somewhat of
holy reason, that doth under-prop and
help their faith: And this likewayes is
the occasion of it, that not so ordinarily a
Christian is put to the excercise of the one,
as unto the exercise of the other: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, It is no small difficulty, for a
Christian to act confidence upon <hi>God,</hi>
when he is redacted unto a low and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
estate in the world: And we shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say to such who murmure and repine
under such an estate; cast your eyes upon
him who was the the heir of all things, of
whom it is recorded, <hi>that he had not so much
as where to lay his head.</hi> As likewayes, cast
your eyes upon a number of that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cloud of witnesses, who are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the everlasting possession of that
precious and excellent lot, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to wander in dens and caves of the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65886:123"/>
earth, having sheep and goat-skins for
their cloathing. Ye are now in the estate
of your minority, and therefore ye are
rich but in hope and expectation, and
so ye may dispense, though ye be not rich
in possession; though we may say, a
Christian that hath <hi>him who is all in all,</hi>
must of necessity enjoy all and all.</p>
               <p>Now that which we shall further
speak upon this divine quality of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
besides these things which we spoke
at the lost occasion, we shall point out
a little, the difficulty of attaining unto
contentment under every lot and estate
that a Christian falleth in: The difficulty
of it is fully shown in that word, <hi>I have
learned,</hi> as it were, it speaketh so much
as this, once <hi>Paul</hi> was an ignorant of this
mysterious lesson of divine contentment,
but he was instructed by him, who is
that Prince of Pastors, by whom he did
attain to the knowledge of this: and this
speaketh forth the difficulty of it, that a
Christian must be much in self exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and self searching before he can
attain unto contentment: there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of this poninted at, <hi>Psal. 4. 4. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
your selves upon your beds,</hi> and there is
a promise annexed to this, <hi>and ye shall be
still, or be still:</hi> And the influence that self-examination
hath upon this divine qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65886:124"/>
of contentment, may not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in this, that a Christian who i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
like wayes, its influence may be showen in
this, that a Christian who is much in

                  </gap>
most part who live in these dayes.</p>
               <p>This likewayes pointeth forth the dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficulty
of attaining to this duty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65886:124"/>
that a Christian before he can
attain it, must be much in the exercise of
these two cardinal graces, <hi>Faith and love;</hi>
certainly, till once we be studying the
exercise of them, contentment will be at a
low and weak standing with us: And
no doubt, the exercise of faith, not only
in concluding out interest in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
and in sealing that conclusion, that <hi>he</hi> is
<hi>ours,</hi> is most necessary for attaining of
contentment; but likewayes the exercise
of faith for attaining of contentment may
be showen in this, that faith is that grace,
which is the best interpreter of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations
of God: This may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
to the commendation of the grace
of faith, that it knoweth not, what it is to
bring up a bad report upon <hi>God.</hi> And
certainly as long as we consult with these
three bad counsellors, sense, reason, and
misbelief about the dispensations of <hi>God,</hi>
this will be the result of that counsel, to
have sorrow in your heart dayly, but
study to imploy that wise counsellor
<hi>Faith,</hi> which sometimes, because it is so
intelligent a grace, is called <hi>understanding,</hi>
as is clear from <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. Now this is clear,
that faith hath influence upon content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. where <hi>David</hi> from this,
that God had made with him an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65886:125"/>
covenant, he cryeth forth, I am not
much anxious, though other things
should fail, <hi>and though my house should not
he so with God</hi> As likewayes it is clear,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 142. 4, 5. where the exercise of saith
upon this, <hi>that God was his portion,</hi>
made him with patience to submit <hi>though
all refuge should fail him., and though
none upon his right hand, or his left hand
should care for his soul;</hi> As likewayes,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 1. compared with vers. 3. where
he presseth that duty of trusting in <hi>God,</hi>
by which they may obviat the exercise
of discontent and fretting. Love likewayes
no doubt, must be exercised, before a
Christian do attain unto this divine quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of contentment: There are these two
precious properties of love which are
given, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 4, 5. Love endureth long,
and love thinketh no evil,</hi> which, no doubt,
have great influence upon contentment;
we confesse, love sometimes is the most
impatient grace of a Christian, and
sometimes the most patient grace of a
Christian; in a manner, love when it is
in its most vigorous exercise, will endure
more sad afflictions then faith; Faith
sometime will be languishing and giving
over, when love will support and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
it, it being affraid to seal that woful
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65886:125"/>
conclusion, <hi>that he is not ours;</hi> love know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not what it is to intertain, jealous
thoughts of him, who is the lover, <hi>it
thinketh no evil:</hi> And certainly, when the
grace of love is in its vigorous exercise,
it is most tender to act any thing, by
which the person that is loved may be
wronged, or a bad report may be brought
up upon him. A Christian that is united
unto precious <hi>Christ,</hi> by that golden and
invisible chain of his beauty, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
excellency, can with patience
endure the losse of all things beside <hi>Christ;</hi>
love is peremptory in nothing but this,
the enjoyment of the loved: And love is
sorrowful for nothing, but the losse of
him who is loved: he moveth in so high
a sphere, and is so far elevat above all
things that are here below, that in a
manner, he possesseth his soul in patience
in the midst of those revolutions and
changes that are here below; in a manner,
the grace of love doth incorporat a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and doth make him
to dwell in Christ as his mansion and
house, and so he is not much taken up
with those things that are abroad.</p>
               <p>There is this likewayes, which speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth the difficulty of attaining unto
divine contentment, and it is this, a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65886:126"/>
Christian must be much in the exercise of
the grace of Mortification to all these pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and transient vanities of the world;
do not these risings and murmurings of
spirit; speak the little exercise of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
that is amongst us? for if we
were once mortified to the world, we
should then exercise contentment under
every lot: this is clear from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of these two places, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 29.
where <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>I have seen an end of all
perfection,</hi> which speaketh forth that
distinct discovery that he had of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the world: in a manner, he had
it brought within his sight, which is one
of the most unerring senses, compared
with that most remarkable place; which
breaths forth much of divine contentment
in him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 25, 26. where he saith,
<hi>But if he say, I have no delight in thee, behold,
here am</hi> I, <hi>let him do unto me, as seemeth
good unto him.</hi> Here, in a manner, is
<hi>David</hi> making a resignation of his crown,
and seeing an end of the perfection of that
glistering and passing vanity. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
it may be shown from the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leling
of these two places, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14.
where <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, I <hi>am crucified
to the world, and the world is crucified to me;</hi>
in a manner, <hi>Paul</hi> and the world made a
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65886:126"/>
sorrowlesse parting, as two dead men
parting one from another: and the words
that we have read, where he breatheth
forth this divine quality of contentment.
I think certainly, a Christian reflecting
upon the changeableness, inconstancy and
vexation of things here below, will not
be much moved with the losse of them.
It was upon this ground that heathens did
attain unto such a length in this divine
quality of contentment, for they behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that fear and desires were the two
inseparable companions of those that had
most of these fancied delights of the world;
for even those that have the greatest a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
are vexed betwixt these two pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<hi>fear and desire:</hi> fear to losse what
they have attained, and desire to attain
more: We conceive, that it is a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thing that is recorded of <hi>Sesostris</hi> King
of Egypt, who was so ambitious, that he
would needs have his Chariot drawn
with four Kings, one of which had his eye
continually upon the motion of the wheel
of the Chariot, which the King observing,
did ask him the ground why he did so
exercise himself? He did most fitly reply, it
putteth me in mind of the mutability and
changeableness of the things of the world;
for, saith he, the highest part of the wheel
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65886:127"/>
is instantly the lowest part, and the
lowest part of the wheel, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
the highest; which moved that
ambitious Prince to desist from so ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
a practice: And believe me, if ye
would read that inscription upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of all things, <hi>vanity and vexation of
spirit,</hi> ye might easily attain unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
               <p>There is this fourthly which speaketh
forth the difficulty of attaining unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
that a Christian before he win
to it, must necessarily be mortified unto
that innate and connatural idol of pride:
Pride must be once brought low, before
contentment can be attained: We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
discontent and pride have sworn
a covenant of agreement, that they shall
be undivided in their life, and undivided
in death, they are chained together by
an unchangeable chain of amity; and
believe me, it is impossible for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to be discontent, but he must of
necessity be proud; And upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
a Christian that is proud, he must
of necessity be a discontented one; for
there is nothing that is the mother of
contentment so much, as humility, which
moveth, a Christian silently to bear his
yoke, and to sit down, and put his mouth
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65886:127"/>
in the dust, because he hath done it.
In a manner, a humble one, and one
that hath distinct knowledge of his own
basenesse, knoweth not what it is to cry
forth, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> such a one is
much in admiration, and little under
murmuring, much in praise, and little in
complaint.</p>
               <p>There is this lastly, which pointeth
forth the difficulty of it, a Christian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
win to contentment, without he be
much in heavenly mindedness, and have
his spirit in a spiritual and heavenly
frame. There is somewhat of this point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 1. compared with the
2. <hi>vers.</hi> where <hi>Christ</hi> proposing a remedy
unto the discontentment of the Disciples,
<hi>that their souls should not be troubled,</hi>
he doth begin a discourse of heaven, <hi>that
in his Fathers house were many mansions,</hi> and
that they had an interest into it: As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
there is somewhat of this pointed
at, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 25, 26. where to obviat
their taking thought what they should
eat, or what they should drink, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they should be cloathed, he desireth
them <hi>to seek first the Kingdom of God.</hi>
And certainly one that is much taken up
in the contemplation of eternal life, and
who is viewing these precious and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65886:128"/>
delights that are at his right hand,
moveth in a most composed and divine
frame, in a manner, he drowneth the
thoughts of his present miseries, in those
precious depths of eternity; he knoweth
that one moment of the enjoyment of
precious <hi>Christ,</hi> shall fully recompense and
make up all those sorrows that he hath
met with. I know not what shall be
the thoughts of Christians, when that
volumn of the mercies of the <hi>Lord,</hi> shall
be presented unto them, which they have
met with here below: how may they
be filled with admiration to see that book
written within and without, of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
of most singular and precious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of his love.</p>
               <p>We shall secondly speak a little to
provoke you to the pursuit of this divine
quality, and so to these advantages that
a Christian hath by exercising content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
under every lot: We conceive, it
is so excellent a grace, this grace of
contentment, that it is indeed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
of these five graces, faith, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
patience, hope and mortification;
in a manner contentment is the result of
all these graces, exercising themselves in
one; and except those be in a most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
exercise, that absolute content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65886:128"/>
is not easily to be attained: but no
doubt, it must be an excellent thing that
deriveth its pedegree and descent from
so high and excellent things, as those
precious graces of the spirit. But the first
advantage that a Christian hath by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
contentment, under his sadest lot, is
this, it doth advance a Christian unto
most nigh fellowship and correspondence
with <hi>God;</hi> as likewayes a contented one
receiveth most sweet manifestations of the
presence and fellowship of <hi>God</hi> with him
under his cross: It is most certain, that
contentment when it is attained, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
accompanied with most near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and correspondence with him:
there is somewhat of this pointed at,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. Where pressing that doctrine
of contentment, he saith, <hi>the Lord will not
leave you nor forsake you,</hi> which, though
we confess it be principally understood of
his providence yet it may include the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations
of his presence: as likewise that
in <hi>Iam. 4. 7. Humble your selves under his
band,</hi> which he is pressing from this duty
of contentment, <hi>and he shall lift you up:</hi>
And no doubt, that invitation doth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
come to a contented Christian,
<hi>Come unto me from Amana, and from the
top of Shenir, and from the mount Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
Can. 4. 8. <hi>Christ</hi> loveth to dwell
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65886:129"/>
with one that walketh in a composed
and silent frame of spirit: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why a contented Christian enjoyeth
much of God under his crosse, is because
he is much in prayer: It is impossible
for a discontented Christian to pray to
any purpose under his crosse, for he
wanteth that divine qualification that
is required in prayer, <hi>to lift up his hands
without wrath,</hi> the soul is in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
and distempered frame, <hi>it is so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
that it cannot speak;</hi> this is clear
from <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 4. or 5. <hi>vers.</hi> where <hi>David</hi>
had this advantage by his discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<hi>I am so troubled,</hi> (saith he) <hi>that
I cannot speak:</hi> though we conceive
that there is that which is imitable
in <hi>David</hi> in that case, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
when he cannot speak, he may
make this prayer, <hi>I am so troubled that
I cannot speak,</hi> which was <hi>Davids</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in that Psalm. There is this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
advantage that a Christian hath
by the exercise of divine contentment,
the want of it doth exceedingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
and hinder a Christians improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the crosse of his advantage: a
Christian that is discontent cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any advantage by his crosse; there
is somewhat of this pointed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11.
where the peaceable fruits of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65886:129"/>
flow to a Christian that is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
under his crosse, which no doubt
doth take in the divine quality of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
There are these three preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
advantages, that a Christian may
have by his crosse, which discontent doth
exceedingly obstruct, there is the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of humility, the exercise of prayer,
and the exercise of mortification: one
that is discontent, doth obstruct that
great advantage of the crosse, even hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;
he is so much in repining against
the dispensation of <hi>God,</hi> that he cannot
at all sit down, and fold his feet, and
quietly bear his yoke. O! but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
includeth in its bosome much
divine humility: In a manner, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
when he is content, is clothed
with it: discontentment is the mother
of pride, and doth add fuel unto that
fire: discontent doth likewayes obstruct
mortification and conformity with <hi>God,</hi>
which is the precious end of the crosse,
<hi>he doth chastise us, that we may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of his holinesse:</hi> And this is the
fruit of all these things, to take away
your sin. And certainly, a discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christian cannot be a Christian ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up in mortification; yea it is most
certain, that a Christian may losse more
by one hours discontent, then he can
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65886:130"/>
gain in many dayes, yea on this side
of eternity; O! to what a length may
discontent lead one? Likewayes it doth
obstruct the exercise of prayer, which
is a precious end of the crosse, <hi>in their
affliction they will seek me early, and when
my chastening hand is upon them, they will
then pour forth their prayers into my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som:</hi>
but one that is in a distempered
and discontented frame, is incapacitate
to go about this duty of prayer, he is
so much in conversing with his crosse,
that he cannot be much in conversing
with <hi>God:</hi> And that is certainly one
great defect in a Christian, that they
are more taken up in studying the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages
of the crosse, then in study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the advantages of it; the most part
of us, will be Orators like <hi>Cicero</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
our calamities, and in setting
them forth to the full, as it is clear in
<hi>Iob,</hi> who proved a most elegant Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
in setting forth his calamities, but
in the exercise of praise, our tounges
stick to the roof of our mouth, and we
are silent unto <hi>God.</hi> There is this third
advantage that a Christian hath by the
exercise of contentment, it doth obviat
and obstruct many temptations, that a
Christian is lyable unto by his discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65886:130"/>
                  <hi>I</hi> know not any sin in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that hath produced such bad and
woful effects, as that sin of discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
what made <hi>Achitophel</hi> to seek a
cord, and go hang himself, was it not
his discontent? discontent is the mother
of most sad and desperat resolutions;
for we cannot submit unto our crosse,
and therefore we study to extricat our
self out of our crosse, by envolving and
entring our selves into that endless and
unsupportable crosse. Therefore we
would desire you under your afflictions
to study contentment: O! what athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical
thoughts will lodge in the bosom
of one that is discontent: we may see
them clearly in the practice of <hi>David,</hi>
who cryeth forth, under his discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I <hi>have cleansed my heart in vain,
and washed my hands in innocency.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there is nothing that will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the want of the faith of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istency
of a Deity, and that there is not
a <hi>God,</hi> so much as this of discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
There is this fourth advantage
that a Christian hath by his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it maketh the crosse most easie to
a Christian: would you know what is
the greatest ingredient of the heaviness
of any crosse, it is discontent: It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65886:131"/>
by it we make our chain more
heavy and more unsupportable upon
our necks; whileas, if we were study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this divine quality of contentment,
it should abate much of the bitterness
of the crosse: we may say to one that
hath attained to contentment, they may
cry forth, <hi>the bitternesse of death is past,</hi>
and may thus triumph over their crosse,
<hi>O crosse where is thy sting, and O afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where is your victory?</hi> Certainly,
discontent is that which maketh us to
sit down, and cry forth, <hi>my stroak is
heavier then my groaning.</hi> Did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
know what it was to bear your
affliction with much inward joy and
peace of mind, when you had this grace
of contentment?</p>
               <p>There is this advantage likewayes
that a Christian hath by exercising
contentment under his crosse, that he
meeteth with; It is a compendious
way for a Christian to win to an
outgate under his crosse. Would you
know what is the most compendious
way, to have the threed of your
affliction spun out unto a long length?
then study discontentment: But would
you know what is the most spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and compendious way to have
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65886:131"/>
the rod taken off, and to have <hi>God,</hi>
no more to turn about the face of
his Throne? then study content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
In a manner, the crosse hath
gotten and obtained that end and
errand why it was sent, when you
do attain to contentment and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
under it: We may say of the
sin of discontent, that it is a most
irrational and reasonless sin, for you
cannot by your discontent, extricate
your self out of your calamities; all
the advantage that you have by it
is this, to make your bonds strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
upon your spirits, and to have
your fetters and chains lying more
heavily upon you.</p>
               <p>There is this advantage likewayes
that a Christian hath by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of contentment under every rod
that he meeteth with, it is that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
quality of the soul by which a
Christian doth attain to most morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
unto the pleasures and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a world. O! how sweetly
will a contented Christian, under the
losse of things here below, speak to
the dispraise of these fancied images?
It is a poor sight, to behold a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
substance tyed unto shaddows
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65886:132"/>
by these two iron chains of <hi>love
and delight.</hi> Ought we not to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
so much holy ambition and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
generosity, as to undervalue all
things that are below <hi>God,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
below us? In a manner, as
<hi>Ionadab</hi> spoke to <hi>Amnon, 2 Sam.</hi> 13, 4.
<hi>Why art thou, being a kings son, lean
from day to day?</hi> We may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bespeak the heirs of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and those that are begotten by
a lively hope, who being the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of him who is the King of
kings, do you wax lean for the
losse or want of those things that
are here below? Have you not a
kingdom? And why then should you
repine at the losse of these things,
which are but passing and transient
vanities? That which is the
great idol of the world, <hi>silver
and gold,</hi> what is it but more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
dust? It is white and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
clay: And we conceive, that
much of the excellency of it doth
consist in the estimation of men, that
they have so valued it: but one
that hath the assurance of eternal life,
and that <hi>God</hi> is their's, may walk
thorow the wildernesse with joy. We
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65886:132"/>
confesse, it is an evil amongst the
heirs of promise, that they love to
go to heaven thorow a most easie
and pleasant way, they love to walk
to that palace of everlasting rest,
thorow a valley of roses; but we
must not meet with two heavens, it
is abundance, if we have that one
eternal and everlasting heaven. And
as for the cause of discontent under
our crosse, or any calamity that we
meet with, we conceive pride and
want of mortification are those two
catholick and general grounds of all
our discontent and impatiency.</p>
               <p>We shall shut up our discourse
upon this divine quality of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
desiring that men that have
abundance of the world may study
contentment: though this may seem
a paradox unto many, why those
that have enough, should yet be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to pursue after contentment:
We conceive, there are none more
discontent, then those that have the
greatest occasion of contentment;
their desires are so much wedded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
things here below, that that voice
is never heard among them, <hi>It is
enough,</hi> and I <hi>am satisfied:</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65886:133"/>
that may fully confute that
vain opinion that Christians and
others do intertain, that if they had
such a competency of the world,
they would be discontent no more,
but would silently make on in their
way; and that which is the ground
of their discontent is (as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
the want of a competency
of subsistency: I shall only say to
you, that which is recorded of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
who after he had purchased
the possession of the world, he was
so far from attaining to contentment
that (as it is recorded of him)
he sat down and wept, because there
was not another world to purchase.
And believe me, this is most unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
that if you cannot attain to
contentment under your present lot,
it is impossible for you to attain to
contentment when your lot is better;
It is only the delusion of Sathan, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which the evil of your discontent
is vailed.</p>
               <p>But as for those that have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of these worldly goods, we
shall presse this exhortation upon them
which is, <hi>Prov. 23. 4. Labour not to be
rich,</hi> which is a thing that ye will
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65886:133"/>
not easily close with, though certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>riches</hi> (as he there most divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speaketh) <hi>are a thing that is not.</hi>
Now this is most clear that there is
a necessity of pressing these, who have
abundance of the world to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
where <hi>Paul</hi> doth subjoyn in the
following words, I <hi>know</hi> (saith
he) <hi>how to abound.</hi> People might
have imagined, that is no great les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but believe me, it is a great,
if not greater, then the other, which
is that by which we would presse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
to those that are poor in
each lot and estate that they fall in
here below: know this that the day
is coming, when ye shall acknowledge
infinit wisdom in guiding you to
heaven by that way. O give <hi>Christ</hi>
a negative vote in the dispensation
of your lots, and be content to be
regulated by him, <hi>who is that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
counsellor,</hi> who, though he lead
you by a way that ye know not,
yet take <hi>Christs</hi> advice upon implicite
faith, for he knoweth not what it
is to disappoint any of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Study contentment, for that is
heaven brought down to earth: for
what is the happinesse and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65886:134"/>
of those that are above? It
is confined in this one word, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment;</hi>
they have now all anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and all loathing, and all desires
save one, taken away from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
O I what a life must it be to drink
of the rivers of pleasures? Did you
ever know or read of such a river,
the waters whereof were pure delight
and pleasure? when we shall sit down,
and be overjoyed with these consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that shall flow from his face,
when we shall draw forth that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
line and period of eternity, in
having joy and light flowing in, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and praise flowing out: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, the gleanings of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
are better then the vintage of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate;
<hi>Little that a righteous man
hath, is better, then the riches of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wicked,</hi> for it is a messenger of
hope, of that more enduring substance
which <hi>Christ</hi> shall give; And since
it is the exercise of those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are
above, let it be the exercise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of those
that are below, that there may be
a sweet conformity and harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the practice of that higher house,
and the practice of this lower house,
that we may have our souls united
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65886:134"/>
unto him <hi>who is perfumed with all
the powders of the merchant, and whose
garments do smell of myrrhe and aloes.</hi>
Believe this, time shortly is to have
a period, and eternity is to come.
Let a Christian comfort himself in
this, eternity is at hand, when they
shall hear that voice, and truth sealed
by the oath of an Angel, <hi>time shall
be no more:</hi> Let that precious day
come, and let all other dayes passe
away.</p>
