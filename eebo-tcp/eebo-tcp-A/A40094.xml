            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Iames 2.10.</bibl>
For whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one Point, he is guilty of all.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE are several Passages of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> which at the first hearing do sound very harshly, and seem to savour of over-great Severity, that upon due Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are found to have nothing in them,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95575:4"/>
but what is highly Reasonable. To omit others, <hi>this Text</hi> is one of those Passages; and many, no doubt, have been startled at it, and been ready to say as the Disciples of our Saviour did upon another Occasion, <hi>This is an hard saying, who can hear it</hi>? For can this Doctrine be true, that <hi>whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one Point, is guilty of all,</hi> and we be in the mean time dealt with according to the Gentleness and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of a Covenant of Grace? Is this the GOSPEL we talk so much of? Is this the <hi>Glad-Tydings</hi> which our Saviour hath brought us? We find none so <hi>bad,</hi> we read nothing so <hi>sad,</hi> in all the <hi>Old</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>worst</hi> Passage <hi>there</hi> is, and that is <hi>bad enough, Cursed is he that continueth not, in all that is written in the Law to do it.</hi> It is no where <hi>there</hi> said, that <hi>he</hi> who is never so careful to observe the <hi>whole Law,</hi> if he chance to transgress in any <hi>one</hi> Point, shall be look't upon as a Transgressour of <hi>all the</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and dealt with like such a one. That <hi>other</hi> Saying is a very terrible one, but <hi>this</hi> is much <hi>more</hi> terrible.</p>
            <p>If this be so, we may well Repeat <hi>that other Question</hi> of the <hi>Disciples, Who then can be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95575:4"/>
saved? In many things we offend all</hi>; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>who keepeth the whole Law, and yet offends in one Point, be guilty of all,</hi> how Desperate must the Case not onely of the <hi>Generality</hi> needs be, but of every <hi>Individual</hi> Person?</p>
            <p>I must confess that <hi>these Words</hi> may well Confound us, and fill us with Amazement, were they to be understood in the severest Sense they are capable of; but we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they are not so to be understood; and therefore that the fore-mentioned Paraphrase upon them, is by no means a <hi>true</hi> one: And the Context sheweth, that <hi>this</hi> is the plain Meaning of them, <hi>viz. Upon Supposition that a Man were careful to observe all the Laws of God but one, his</hi> living <hi>in the Breach of that</hi> one, <hi>shall be so far from being connived at upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Obedience to all the rest, that he shall be lyable to the Punishment which is due to the Transgression of the</hi> whole Law: That is, the same Punishment for <hi>kind,</hi> not for <hi>degree</hi>; there being nothing more plainly revealed, than that the <hi>more</hi> and the <hi>greater</hi> Sins Men are guilty of, the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>severer</hi> shall be their Punishment. And in saying that such a one shall have the same Punishment for <hi>kind,</hi> I mean that which consisteth in being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95575:5"/>
forever Banished from the Presence of God; and which is called <hi>Eternal Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of this Assertion of our Apostle, <hi>thus</hi> understood, may be fully made to appear by these following Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> He who refuseth Obedience to any <hi>One</hi> of the Divine Laws, may as truly be said to Contemn the Divine Authority, as if he lived in the breach of <hi>all.</hi> Men in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Disobeying any <hi>One</hi> Law, do put as <hi>true</hi> an Affront upon the Law-Giver, tho' not so <hi>High</hi> a one, as they do in Disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>all.</hi> This Reason St. <hi>Iames</hi> gives in the Words next following, for what he affirms in the <hi>Text: For he that said, do not Commit Adultery, said also do not Kill; now if thou Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no Adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a Transgressour of the Law.</hi> That is, it is the <hi>same</hi> Law-Giver who hath forbidden <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Murther</hi>; and His Authority is as truly Contemned in Transgressing <hi>one,</hi> as <hi>both</hi> of these Laws.</p>
            <p>Every <hi>deliberate</hi> Act of Disobedience is flat <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and so for forth a Renouncing of God's <hi>right</hi> to Govern us; It is a <hi>virtual</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of His Authority to Prescribe <hi>any</hi> Laws
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95575:5"/>
to us, and lays a foundation for <hi>Universal</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. For if God Almighty's Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be Disacknowledg'd in any <hi>One</hi> Instance, it may as well be so in <hi>all other.</hi> The <hi>same</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that leads to the Violation of <hi>one</hi> Law, doth Enervate and render invalid <hi>all other</hi> Laws. Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He who <hi>willfully</hi> Disobeys any <hi>One</hi> of the Divine Laws, is no <hi>Sincere</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of any of the rest. For whosoever allows himself in any one Act of Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hath no <hi>True Love</hi> either for God or Goodness; but it is necessary to the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of Obedience, that it proceed from <hi>that</hi> Love which hath both these for its Objects. That it proceed from Love to <hi>God,</hi> and (which is indeed <hi>Materially</hi> the same) Love to <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Goodness</hi> (Or Universal Righteousness, Purity and Benignity) being <hi>that</hi> upon the account of which God Almighty is a <hi>Lovely</hi> Being.</p>
            <p>Now it is Evident, that those who live in any <hi>Disobedience</hi> to God, do not <hi>Love</hi> Him. They love him not according to the <hi>Scripture-Notion</hi> of Loving God; because whatsoever that is for the <hi>sake</hi> of which we can find in our hearts to <hi>Disobey</hi> Him, must needs be valued and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95575:6"/>
Esteemed above Him; And the <hi>Scripture-No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Loving God, is the Esteeming Him above, and Preferring Him before all <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> He who hath <hi>No</hi> true Love for God, may <hi>Obey</hi> Him in many instances, as the poor <hi>Pagans</hi> Worship the <hi>Devil,</hi> out of a <hi>Slavish</hi> Fear and Dread of Him; He may O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him too as a meer Mercenary, I mean, for the good things of <hi>this</hi> Life, and a <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual</hi> kind of Happiness in the <hi>Other</hi>: But <hi>this</hi> Obedience is far from being <hi>Genuine,</hi> or the true <hi>Evangelical</hi> Obedience, as is Easy to shew.</p>
            <p>And again, it is no less apparent, that the Love of <hi>Virtue</hi> and true <hi>Goodness,</hi> is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with harbouring any thing in our breasts that is <hi>contrary</hi> there to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He who lives in disobedience to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>One</hi> Law of God, as he Obeys none <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,</hi> so is he <hi>prepared</hi> to <hi>break</hi> all other Laws, and that in the <hi>grossest</hi> manner, whensoever forceable Temptations may assault him. For if the Divine Authority can't prevail with a Man, to Abstain from <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Sin, how is it to be Expected it should Restrain him from <hi>Other</hi> Sins, when he may happen to be incited to them by <hi>alike</hi> strong and Violent Temptations?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95575:6"/>Such a one may forbear not a <hi>few</hi> sins while he is not <hi>at all,</hi> or not very <hi>violently</hi> set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a tempter; but if God should once suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to be sharply encountred, either from <hi>without</hi> or from <hi>within,</hi> it is not hard to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine what Success such Temptations would have upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hazael</hi> once thought that 'twas impossible he should incurr the Guilt of such horrid Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, as he was <hi>foretold</hi> he would; such as <hi>dashing young Children against the stones,</hi> and <hi>rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up Women with Child</hi>: <hi>What,</hi> replyed he to the Prophet, <hi>Is thy Servant a Dog, that he should do such things?</hi> But <hi>for all</hi> that, when he came into other Circumstances, and so to have such Temptations, as he never before met with, he <hi>was</hi> such a <hi>Dog</hi> as to commit such Barbarities.</p>
            <p>And if we will not be prevailed with, to forsake in Will and Affection <hi>every</hi> Sin, we shall scarcely stick longer at <hi>any</hi> Sin, than our forbearance thereof is consistent with the Satisfaction of that Lust which is <hi>dearest</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>We have <hi>Iudas</hi> also for an Example of <hi>this</hi>: He was doubtless, as to <hi>Outward Appearance,</hi> a very Moral Inoffensive Man; for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would not have given such Scandal, as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95575:7"/>
to have taken him, had he <hi>not</hi> been so, into the Number of his Constant Associates; yet <hi>this</hi> Judas <hi>loving the Bag,</hi> being a secretly-<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous</hi> Wretch, could perswade himself, even <hi>most basely to betray his Blessed Master,</hi> when allured by the Bait of <hi>Gain</hi> to it; and <hi>that</hi> a very <hi>sorry</hi> Bait too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whosoever makes no Conscience of transgressing some <hi>one</hi> Law, as he is <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> to break <hi>all other</hi> upon strong Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so he <hi>actually</hi> disobeys other Laws, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Latitude</hi> of Interpretation which our Lord hath given them; and which <hi>ought</hi> to be given them. Such a one may <hi>tremble</hi> at the Thoughts of breaking those two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adultery, Thou shalt not kill</hi>; but <hi>Lusting in his Heart,</hi> or <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Enemy,</hi> will be <hi>Venial</hi> Sins with him, though his Saviour hath told him, that <hi>these</hi> are Transgressions of those Commandments.</p>
            <p>This Man may <hi>punctually</hi> keep the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> Commandments, as to the shunning of those Sins, which in <hi>express</hi> terms are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by them: He may abhorr to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any other God but <hi>Iehovah</hi>: he may abominate <hi>Graven Images</hi> in the Worship of God; but while he preferreth the World,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95575:7"/>
either the Riches, or Honours, or Pleasures thereof, before God (as whosoever lives in the Allowance of any known Sin <hi>doth</hi>) he is a very <hi>Idolater,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> hath told us.</p>

               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Living in the Breach of but <hi>one</hi> Law, would as truly <hi>Deprave</hi> Mens Natures, and make them <hi>unmeet</hi> for the Enjoyment of God, as living in the Breach of <hi>all.</hi> It would do so as <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really,</hi> though not in the same <hi>degree.</hi> One Sin <hi>allowed,</hi> one Lust <hi>cherished,</hi> robs the Soul of the Divine Image, renders it unlike to God, and consequently makes it uncapable of taking Satisfaction or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in that <hi>Best</hi> of Beings, who is pure <hi>Light,</hi> and in whom is <hi>no Darkness at all.</hi> It is thereby unqualified for the <hi>Heavenly,</hi> and it sinks it down into the <hi>Hellish</hi> State. We say, <hi>One Leak will sink a Ship as sure as a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi>: And, upon this Account, <hi>One</hi> Sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, must needs as certainly ruine our Souls, if we will not part with it, as <hi>never so many.</hi> Our <hi>Four First</hi> Considerations make it highly Reasonable that it should be so, but this <hi>Last</hi> makes it Necessary. Necessary from the very <hi>Nature</hi> of the thing; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor yet <hi>Primarily,</hi> from the <hi>Will</hi> of God.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95575:8"/>
I shall now Present you with Several plain <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi> from what hath been said. As,</p>
            <p n="1">I. THat we ought not to account <hi>any</hi> Sin a Light or a small thing; such a thing as God Almighty will not Concern Himself about: Such a thing as we may <hi>allow</hi> ourselves in, and yet be Objects of the Divine Favour.</p>
            <p>This is Evident from what we have said; or rather is our <hi>Text it self</hi> in other Words.</p>
            <p>But I add, for the farther Clearing of the Truth hereof, that <hi>that</hi> Sin which we are apt to Fancy so Light a matter, is either a Transgression of God's Law or 'tis not; if it be <hi>not,</hi> we may not acknowledge it to be a <hi>Sin</hi>: For <hi>Sin,</hi> as saith the Apostle, <hi>is the Transgression of the Law; and where there is no Law there is no Transgression.</hi> But if it <hi>be</hi> a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the Law, <hi>how</hi> can it be a Light or a Trivial thing? If it be <hi>really</hi> so, then must <hi>God</hi> needs so account it, for <hi>He</hi> judges of things as they <hi>are</hi>; but how can God so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it, when He hath made a <hi>Law</hi> against it? Will His Infinite Wisdom suffer Him to make a Law, which He matters not whether
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95575:8"/>
it be <hi>Observ'd</hi> or no? <hi>Such</hi> a Law would be a very Vain and Needless one, and therefore cannot be of <hi>God's</hi> making. No Wise <hi>Man</hi> would be the Maker of <hi>such</hi> a Law.</p>
            <p>But because <hi>some</hi> Sins are <hi>accounted</hi> small and <hi>others</hi> Great, <hi>this</hi> Distinction is not to be <hi>born,</hi> except we mean, that some Sins are small ones in <hi>Comparison</hi> of others; not that any are <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> and in <hi>themselves</hi> small.</p>
            <p>Indeed Considering Sins <hi>as Transgressions of God's Law,</hi> so all are <hi>alike</hi>; for <hi>one</hi> Sin is not more contrary to the <hi>Law</hi> than <hi>another</hi>: All are as Contrary to the <hi>Law</hi> as <hi>can</hi> be. That <hi>Stoical</hi> Paradox <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>All Sins are Equal, Tully</hi> gives <hi>this</hi> true Explication of: <hi>Parva inquis</hi> Res <hi>est, at Magna</hi> Culpa; <hi>Thou sayest this is but a small</hi> thing, <hi>but I say 'tis a Great</hi> fault: <hi>in quo peccatur, id potest esse aliud alio majus aut minus; That</hi> in <hi>which a Man Offends, may be a greater or a less thing: ipsum autem</hi> Peccare, <hi>quoquo te ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris unum est. But the</hi> Offending (the Sinning) <hi>it self, is ever one and the same thing.</hi> And <hi>this</hi> amounts to what was <hi>now</hi> said, That conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Sins; <hi>as Transgressions of the Divine Laws,</hi> so all are <hi>alike</hi>: But considering them according to various <hi>Circumstances,</hi> some may be <hi>Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> small, or much <hi>less</hi> than others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95575:9"/>Some are committed with less of the <hi>Will</hi> than others; and those, Men fall into upon a Surprize, and before they are aware, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so great in <hi>that</hi> respect, as those which are committed with Deliberation. I mean upon Supposition, that a naughty <hi>Custom</hi> doth not occasion the Inadvertency. There are <hi>those</hi> who profane the Sacred Name of God by rash <hi>Oaths,</hi> and by taking it into their Mouths <hi>lightly</hi> and <hi>wantonly,</hi> and (when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved) profess they were not <hi>aware</hi> they did so: But this is no Extenuation of their Fault, because such insensibility can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from no other Cause, than Mens having acquired a wretched <hi>Habit</hi> of so making bold with and abusing God's Name, through their Minds being void of any awful Sense of His Glorious Majesty.</p>
            <p>Some Sins are committed against less <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> than others; and Sins against greater <hi>actual</hi> Knowledge, or better <hi>Means</hi> of Knowledge, are in <hi>that</hi> respect the <hi>Greater</hi> Sins; and therefore our Lord hath assigned the greater <hi>Punishment</hi> to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.15.</p>
            <p>The greater <hi>Obligations,</hi> and the more <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> Men sin against, the greater are their Sins upon that Account. The more of Disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95575:9"/>
and hateful Ingratitude there is in sins, the more Hainous and Provoking are they.</p>
            <p>Sins are greater or less, according as the <hi>Effects</hi> of them are more or less mischievous. Those which injure our selves <hi>onely,</hi> are not in <hi>that</hi> respect so great, as those which injure our Neighbour together with our selves. And those which are injurious to our Neighbours <hi>Souls,</hi> are the greatest that can be committed against <hi>them.</hi> Those which are mischievous to the <hi>Community</hi> are as <hi>such,</hi> much greater than those which are so only to <hi>Particular</hi> Persons.</p>
            <p>The worse <hi>End</hi> a Man hath in a Sin, the <hi>greater</hi> is it. The more of ill-Nature, and a Vile Devilish Temper is in a Sin, the more <hi>exceedingly Sinful</hi> 'tis.</p>
            <p>Those which are Transgressions of the <hi>Rules of everlasting Righteouss,</hi> are greater as <hi>such,</hi> than those which are onely Transgressions of <hi>Positive</hi> Precepts. The <hi>former</hi> are more <hi>intensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Evil; they are Evil not onely as Violations of a <hi>declared Law,</hi> but there is also Turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Malignity in the <hi>Matter</hi> of them: Which Malignity is the <hi>Reason</hi> of the Law against them. And of <hi>this</hi> Nature are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95575:10"/>
those things which are forbidden in the Gospel of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>And to <hi>these</hi> may be added <hi>other</hi> Instances. But though upon <hi>these</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Accounts, some sins are <hi>less</hi> than others, yet (as hath been sufficiently proved) it is impossible that <hi>any</hi> Sin should be <hi>Simply,</hi> and in <hi>it self</hi> Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>Which, by the way, is a sufficient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of that dangerous Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; That there are a sort of Sins which are Venial <hi>in their own Nature,</hi> and that cannot put us out of God's Favour, tho' committed never so <hi>frequently</hi> or <hi>deliberately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. What hath been said may serve to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Dealing with the <hi>Young Man in the Gospel,</hi> from being too severe. Such as are apt to pass hasty Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Actions of others, without duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Reasons of them, may be apt in reading <hi>that</hi> Story, not only to Pity the young Man, but to <hi>take his Part</hi>: As thinking him too hardly dealt with, in not being accepted for his having Observed the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> even from his Childhood, but having such <hi>father</hi> Terms impos'd upon him, as forced him to go away sorrowful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:95575:10"/>Surely, may such say, our Lord was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly averse to the bestowing of Eternal Life upon <hi>this poor Man.</hi> It is said, <hi>Blessed are they that do his Commandments, for they shall have Right unto the Tree of Life,</hi> but <hi>here</hi> is one who must be <hi>excepted,</hi> since Obedience to the <hi>Whole LAW,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> of so long a standing too, might signifie nothing to the intitling of him thereunto. Nay our Lord did at <hi>first</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate to him, that <hi>keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> should be <hi>all</hi> he would expect from him; for said he, <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments</hi>: But when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that <hi>this</hi> he was not to <hi>begin</hi> to do <hi>now,</hi> but h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d <hi>ever</hi> done it, then was <hi>more</hi> required of him; and that no <hi>less</hi> than the <hi>Selling,</hi> and having sold, the <hi>giving away</hi> his whole Estate; which was very great. It seems as <hi>freely</hi> as <hi>Eternal Life </hi> was offered to Others, <hi>this</hi> Man must <hi>Buy</hi> it, and that with no <hi>less</hi> a Sum, than the Price of <hi>all</hi> he had.</p>
            <p>But we are to take Notice, that our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour designed to <hi>Try</hi> him by <hi>this</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, whether he <hi>really</hi> was, as he <hi>thought</hi> himself, Universally Obedient; and it seem to be such another Command as <hi>that</hi> of God Almighty to His Servant <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95575:11"/>
of his onely Son <hi>Isaac.</hi> But as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by his <hi>readiness</hi> to obey that Command, demonstrated the Sincerity of his Love to God, as God Himself told him, so <hi>this Young Man</hi> by his <hi>Unwillingness</hi> to Obey <hi>this</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, gave as great a Demonstration of his having been nothing <hi>less,</hi> than a sincere Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of all God's Commandments. In short, he was by this Means Convicted of wretched <hi>Covetousness</hi>; in that, as desirous as he was of Eternal Life, he preferred his Temporal Estate before it.</p>
            <p>That our Saviour did not thus treat him out of <hi>Prejudice</hi> to his Person, and with a design to affright him from Him, is plain from what we find in this Narrative, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> relates it. 'Tis said, <hi>Ch.</hi> 10 21. upon his telling him that he had observed all the Commandments <hi>from his Youth,</hi> that <hi>Iesus loved him.</hi> Now it is very Clear from our past Discourse, that there was great <hi>Rèason,</hi> why this <hi>Young Man,</hi> as <hi>good</hi> as he was, should be sent away sorrowful, since he was no <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> For though he was no <hi>Murtherer,</hi> nor <hi>Adulterer,</hi> nor <hi>Thief,</hi> &amp;c. in the <hi>gross</hi> Sense, yet he might be <hi>all these,</hi> according to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Sense and Meaning of the Law; for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95575:11"/>
'tis certain that in <hi>this</hi> sense he was an <hi>Idolater,</hi> in that the <hi>World</hi> lay deepest in his Affections, and was esteemed above <hi>GOD,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. I infer from what hath been said, what a great Weakness it is in any Man to hope for Salvation, because he perceives that there are <hi>many</hi> who are <hi>far greater</hi> Sinners <hi>than</hi> himself, when yet he lives in the wilful Commission of some known <hi>Sins,</hi> or in the wilful Neglect of some known <hi>Duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt there are too many, who because they are not <hi>Drunkards,</hi> nor <hi>Unclean</hi> Persons, nor <hi>Profane Swearers,</hi> &amp;c. as they see Multitudes are, do <hi>fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> all to be well</hi> with them, though they are conscious to themselves of being <hi>faulty,</hi> and that <hi>wilfully</hi> too, in <hi>other</hi> respects. They can possibly <hi>over-reach</hi> their Brother, when they can do it <hi>slyly</hi>; or if they stick at <hi>plain Injustice,</hi> they can do <hi>Hard</hi> things; which will be found another day to be <hi>Unjust</hi> also, and which those know to be so <hi>now,</hi> who take their Measures of Right and Wrong from their Saviour's Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.12. They can make an Idol of the World, are inamoured with either the <hi>Riches,</hi> or <hi>Honours,</hi> or <hi>Pleasures</hi> thereof; if not with <hi>all,</hi> yet with <hi>one</hi> or <hi>other</hi> of these, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95575:12"/>
are with great difficulty drawn to Works of Mercy and Charity.</p>
            <p>Some seem mightily <hi>Devout,</hi> and Zealous for the Duties of the <hi>First Table,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take themselves for good Christians, tho' they are as Remiss in Reference to divers Duties of the <hi>Second.</hi> Others again are seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly very Observant of those of the <hi>Second Table,</hi> are <hi>Sober, Orderly, Governable, good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, quiet and inoffensive Neighbours</hi>; when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they are as Culpable in Relation to the Duties of the <hi>First</hi>: Live under little Sense of God, of their Dependance on Him, and their Obligations to Him: Worship Him with their <hi>Bodies,</hi> when their <hi>Hearts</hi> are far from Him; and content themselves with a meer <hi>External,</hi> tho' not with a meer <hi>Ritual Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why should any of us think our selves in a Good State, because we live not in any of the <hi>Scandalous</hi> Sins? Were not those Laws made to be <hi>Obeyed</hi> which we Break, as well as those we Keep, or at least <hi>think</hi> we Keep? And, if so, how can we Expect God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and live in such Contradiction to His Will? Will you approve of that Servant who wilfully Disobeys <hi>some</hi> of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95575:12"/>
because he observes <hi>others</hi>? No sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>all</hi> Masters will Expect to be in <hi>every</hi> thing obeyed; or at least that their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants should <hi>endeavour</hi> to obey them in all things.</p>
            <p>God will say another day to the Partially Obedient, <hi>These things ought you to have done, and not to have left the other undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>how</hi> came it to be ever imagined, that God will be put off with a <hi>Partiall</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? The mischief is, those who live not in <hi>Open</hi> Sins, the world, not seeing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath a good Opinion of them; and therefore they will please themselves with a Conceit, that God Almighty hath the <hi>same.</hi> Or it may be their own Party will <hi>applaud</hi> those things in them, which are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Praise-worthy. But <hi>let us not be deceived, God is not mocked,</hi> as <hi>men</hi> are; nor will <hi>He</hi> flatter us as <hi>men</hi> do. Let no man deceive us, nor let us deceive <hi>ourselves</hi> with vain words or thoughts; for, for the sake of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Sins we will not <hi>part</hi> with, be they what they will, the wrath of God will fall upon us, except it be diverted by timely Repentance; that is, by timely Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:95575:13"/>Was the <hi>Pharisee</hi> accepted of God, because he could say, <hi>God I thank thee that I am not as other men are, Extortioners, Unjust, Adulterers, or even as this Publican</hi>? We know he was not; for tho' he was free from the Sins of many <hi>others,</hi> yet was he a <hi>Pharisee</hi> still: There were Secret and less Observed Sins, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed himself in; and therefore that <hi>Publican</hi> he so despised, being a true <hi>Penitent, went away Iustified before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. Methinks those who make <hi>none,</hi> or but very <hi>little,</hi> Conscience of their ways, and dare to live in <hi>open</hi> Sins, should not be able to forbear being mightily Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at what hath been said. For as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> saith, <hi>If the Righteous scarcely be saved</hi> (or have such a Portion of Misery in <hi>this</hi> life) <hi>where shall the Wicked and Ungodly appear? We</hi> may say, if those who are <hi>seemingly</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or have a regard to <hi>most</hi> of God's Laws, not heartily Endeavouring to Obey them <hi>all,</hi> shall fall short of Salvation, what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of such as are <hi>apparently,</hi> and in the Eye of the <hi>World,</hi> Wicked and Ungodly? Prophane and Debauched people are <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally</hi> acknowledged to be Objects of the Divine displeasure; and therefore whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95575:13"/>
               <hi>vain</hi> hopes those, who are not guilty of the Crimes which speak men <hi>such,</hi> may have of the goodness of their State, one would presume that <hi>these</hi> could have <hi>no</hi> Temptation to hope well of themselves, while they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue impenitent and Unreformed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some mens Sins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24.</note> saith St. <hi>Paul, are Open before hand, going before to judgment; and some, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after.</hi> Some mens Sins are so Conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that they may be pronounc't to be <hi>in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity,</hi> in <hi>this</hi> life: The Sins of <hi>others</hi> are more <hi>secret,</hi> the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of whom is to be reserved to the Great Day.</p>
            <p>But alas, such is the nature of <hi>Sin,</hi> that the Greatest <hi>Sinners</hi> are <hi>least</hi> Sensible of their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. None shall be more forward than <hi>they,</hi> to perswade themselves of God's Pardon; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if after a <hi>Wretched</hi> life they can but make a <hi>good</hi> End, as the Phrase is; that is, be sorry for their Sins, for fear of Hell, when they can Sin no longer, and Call upon their Saviour at the last Gasp. But if the Hopes of a man who can't be prevailed with, to be intirely Obedient, be Vain and Groundless, then the Hopes of such Sinners as <hi>these,</hi> must needs be (do I say <hi>vain</hi> too? they must be) <hi>Mad</hi> Hopes.</p>

            <p>Seeing God is pleased to assure us of His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thro' the Sacrifice of His Son, so we will do what lyeth in us for the <hi>time to come</hi> to please Him, He is as Gracious to us as we can <hi>Reasonably wish</hi> He would be.

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider how Gracious God hath been to you, in continuing His <hi>Restraining</hi> Grace, whereby you have been kept from <hi>Scandalous</hi> Sins; whereas He hath had most just Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to leave you to <hi>your selves,</hi> in regard of your allowance of <hi>secret</hi> ones. Many fearful Examples there have been of <hi>those</hi> who have been <hi>thus</hi> punish't, for their Hypocrisy and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fast-and-loose with God; Obeying Him in <hi>some</hi> things, and making bold with Him in <hi>others</hi>: And 'tis Gods infinite Mercy that you are not <hi>yet</hi> in the Number of <hi>such</hi> Examples.</p>
            <p>While <hi>any</hi> Corrupt Affection is gratified by us, we are Prepared (as hath been shewed) to Close with the very <hi>worst</hi> of Temptations, when so ever we may be violently assaulted by them. Now it is only the good Providence and Grace of God, which hath <hi>hitherto</hi> kept off such Temptations; and the <hi>Wicked One</hi> not fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most <hi>fiery darts</hi> he hath in his <hi>Quiver</hi> at us, is wholly to be imputed to the Divine Restraints: But how <hi>soon</hi> we may be Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Divine Providence, to the Rage and Fury of that <hi>Roaring Lyon, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up and down seeking to devour us,</hi> we cannot tell; but have Cause still to be expecting so great a Judgment, while we refuse to be <hi>Intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> God's Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95575:15"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let the partially Obedient Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what unaccountable Folly and Madness it is, to Disobey God in <hi>any</hi> thing. What can you say for your selves, why you should obey Him but just <hi>so far?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there not the <hi>same</hi> Reason, why you should be in <hi>every</hi> thing Obedient, that there is, why you should be in <hi>any</hi> thing so? Is it most Reasonable to Obey Him in <hi>some</hi> things, and is it <hi>not so</hi> to Obey Him in <hi>all</hi> things? Can we say that God goes <hi>beyond</hi> His Power in imposing <hi>some</hi> Laws; or that <hi>those</hi> we dislike, are <hi>less</hi> Reasonable than His <hi>other</hi> Laws? Surely we dare not admit <hi>such</hi> a Thought.</p>
            <p>Is it possible then, that we can think it <hi>Fit</hi> or <hi>Tolerable,</hi> that the great Creator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World should be in any thing <hi>Disobeyed?</hi> Such a Worm as <hi>thy self</hi> art high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended with <hi>thy</hi> Servant, when he <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi> disobeys <hi>thee</hi>; and too often when he does so <hi>against</hi> his Will: But is <hi>thy</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over <hi>thy</hi> Servant equal to God Almighty's over <hi>thee?</hi> Are the Obligations in which <hi>he</hi> stands to <hi>thee,</hi> like <hi>those</hi> in which <hi>thou</hi> standest to <hi>God?</hi> Or is there any Comparison between <hi>those</hi> Encouragements, thou art able to give
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95575:16"/>
               <hi>thy</hi> Servant to please <hi>thee,</hi> and <hi>those</hi> which God gives <hi>thee</hi> to please Him? Who would not think himself greatly Affronted, to have <hi>such</hi> Questions seriously put to him?</p>
            <p>And <hi>this</hi> minds me to Entreat you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To Consider what a Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is assured to us, to Encourage us to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. It is called a <hi>Crown of Righteousness,</hi> a <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> and a <hi>Crown of Glory.</hi> There are given to us, for this End, <hi>exceeding great and precious Promises,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls them. A Promise of <hi>seeing God even as He is:</hi> Of <hi>being forever with our Lord Iesus Christ</hi>: Of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Glory which the Father hath given Him</hi>; and of <hi>Partaking too of His own Glory,</hi> and that <hi>to all Eternity</hi>: A Promise that <hi>the Righteous shall shine forth like the Sun in the Kingdom of the Father</hi>: Of their being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Equal with the Glorious Angels</hi>: And of <hi>having their Vile Bodies made like unto Christ</hi>'s most <hi>Glorious Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which, and many other such like, Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses our Lord Confirmed by <hi>Innumerable Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Wonders and Signs</hi>; and <hi>then</hi> Sealed them With <hi>His Blood,</hi> and next, by <hi>His Resurrection from the Dead,</hi> and <hi>Ascension into Heaven</hi>: Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95575:16"/>
He declared He went, as the <hi>Fore-runner</hi> of His Obedient Disciples, <hi>there to prepare a Place for them; that where He is, there they may be also.</hi> And lastly, He Confirmed <hi>these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and precious Promises,</hi> by <hi>sending the Holy Ghost,</hi> according to His Promise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He left the World.</p>
            <p>Now, who can have any worthy Sense of the <hi>Reward</hi> of Obedience, and think <hi>much</hi> of Obeying in any <hi>one</hi> Instance, tho' much <hi>more</hi> were required of him than there is? If the <hi>Apostle</hi> said of the <hi>Sufferings of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Time,</hi> (which were Extraordinary and Prodigious Ones, and especially <hi>those</hi> which <hi>himself</hi> underwent) <hi>that they are not Worthy to be compared with the Glory which shall be revealed in us</hi>; much <hi>more</hi> may this be said of the <hi>Services</hi> of this Life, of <hi>all the Duties</hi> to which our Creator and Redeemer have oblig'd us. And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let it be likewise considered, that, as vastly great as the Reward of Obedience shall be, there is no more required of us under the Gospel Dispensation, than, all things considered, <hi>needs</hi> must. It may with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Assurance be affirmed, that nothing is now commanded, but what is necessary to make
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95575:17"/>
us capable of the Glorious Inheritance pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for us; or doth tend to the better <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling</hi> us for those Duties, which are of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable Necessity to <hi>this</hi> End: And that nothing is Forbidden us, which doth not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>consequentially</hi> tend to make us <hi>unmeet</hi> for that Inheritance. So that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of any one of our Lord's Precepts, is the same thing with finding fault with Him, for designing to make us <hi>such Happy</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Consider also, that the LAWS which are given us, as they are most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, so they are not so <hi>many,</hi> as that we need to be <hi>scared</hi> at them. Many are apt to think, that because the <hi>Bible</hi> is a <hi>Great Book,</hi> the Divine LAWS are almost Numberless. But the <hi>far greater</hi> Part of the Bible consists of <hi>History,</hi> and <hi>Relations of Matters of Fact,</hi> and of <hi>Pious Mens devout Prayers and Praises,</hi> &amp;c. And in the <hi>Preceptive</hi> Part, there are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Laws which are Abrogated, and never concerned <hi>Christians</hi>: And those which are of <hi>Force,</hi> are many of them abundance of times Repeated and Inculcated.</p>
            <p>In short, our whole Duty may be brought into a very <hi>Narrow</hi> Compass. St. <hi>Paul</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95575:17"/>
it to <hi>Three</hi> Heads, <hi>Sobriety, Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Godliness</hi>: And our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> to <hi>Two,</hi> The Love of <hi>God,</hi> and our <hi>Neighbour</hi>; and the particular Instances of each of these, are <hi>easily</hi> and <hi>quickly</hi> learn't. Nay they are generally <hi>written in our Hearts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us; <hi>i.e.</hi> are the plain Dictates of Natural Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Let us farther Consider, that there is so close a Connexion between them all, that Obedience to <hi>one</hi> Law will inable us to obey <hi>another,</hi> and so on: And the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of <hi>one</hi> Duty, will prepare us for <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and make it easie to us. And on the <hi>other</hi> hand, the <hi>Breach</hi> of <hi>one</hi> Law will cause Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness in keeping <hi>other</hi> Laws; and no Sin goes <hi>alone.</hi> So that 'tis but a bare <hi>Supposition</hi> in the Text, that <hi>a Man may keep the Whole Law, and offend but in one Point,</hi> or slight <hi>one</hi> Law, and observe all the rest; for there can <hi>really</hi> be <hi>no such</hi> thing; as is evident from what hath been now discoursed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> I may also add, that there is <hi>no necessity</hi> of being very solicitous, about any more than <hi>one</hi> thing, in order to our keeping God's Laws; and <hi>that</hi> is the Vigorously pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing our Souls with the <hi>Love of God. This,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:95575:18"/>
saith St. <hi>Iohn, is the Love of God, that we keep His Commandments,</hi> (or, this is a necessary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression thereof) <hi>and His Commandments are not grievous</hi>: Namely to those that <hi>Love God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what can we imagine so <hi>Natural</hi> to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Capable of <hi>understanding</hi> God, as <hi>Loving Him with all their hearts,</hi> Considering the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Loveliness of His Nature, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible Obligations He hath laid upon them?</p>
            <p>What so Agreeable to our Nature, as to love <hi>Him</hi> who is the Author of our <hi>Being,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whose Image we were made, who is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of our Souls, and in whom <hi>alone</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our True Happiness? And 'tis very easy to shew, that the Love of God will <hi>naturally</hi> draw after it, all those duties which relate, either immediately to <hi>Him,</hi> or to our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> or to our <hi>own Souls and Bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Considering <hi>these</hi> things, well may God Almighty Expostulate with Partially O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Christians, as once He did with <hi>such Iews,</hi> and that with greater reason, <hi>O my people, what have I done unto thee?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mica.</hi> 6.3.</note> 
               <hi>And wherein have I wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thee? Testify against me.</hi> He hath been <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> so far from <hi>wearying</hi> us with His Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that every good Christian's Experience
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95575:18"/>
is able to Testify that the greatest satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the truest self-Enjoyment, ariseth from the Observance of His Laws. Nor can it be <hi>otherwise,</hi> since <hi>Love,</hi> and the Love of <hi>God,</hi> is the <hi>fulfilling of them.</hi> For what so Pleasant as <hi>Love,</hi> and much <hi>more</hi> as love placed on such an Object as <hi>God</hi> is? We ought therefore to be so far from thinking <hi>much</hi> of yielding Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>all</hi> His Laws, that we are highly <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous,</hi> if we be not heartily thankful to Him, for giving us so <hi>few,</hi> and those <hi>such</hi> as in Obedience to which consists such Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>last</hi> place, and with <hi>these</hi> words I will Conclude, What a sad thing, and miserable disappointment, must it needs be, to come <hi>near</hi> to the Kingdom of Heaven, and yet at last fall <hi>short</hi> of it, for want of going a little <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>?</p>
            <p>May all Partially Obedient Professors of Christianity, Consider <hi>this</hi> also, and lay it well to heart.</p>
