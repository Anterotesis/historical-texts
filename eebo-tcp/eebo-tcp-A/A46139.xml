            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>The violation of the Kings Peace, in the chief Sanctuary of it, his own Royal Palace, and in ſo high a manner, as by the Death of one of his Subjects, is a matter that muſt be accounted for.

                        <p>It is indeed a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of Juſtice, where the Law is the Rule, and a ſevere and inflexible meaſure both of Life and Death.

               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords, Your Lordſhips have here a Member before you of your Noble Body, expoſed to the ſhame of a publick Arraignment, and (which to a Man of Honour is much leſs) to the hazard, both of his Life and Eſtate; All that he hath and ever hopes to have, his Wealth, his Fame, his Poſterity. All that is valuable to him in this World intirely depends on your Lordſhips Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, who are now his Peers, and on whom he doth freely put himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords, The Priviledge of this kind of Tryal and Judicature is a part of the true greatneſs of the Engliſh Nobility: It is an eminent and an illuſtrious Priviledge. It is a ſolid Point of Honour and Dignity. It is a Priviledge that no Neighbour Nation ever had, and a Priviledge this Nation never was without.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not a Priviledge Created by the Great Charter, but confeſt and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. They look but a little way that find this in the ſteps of the</hi> Norman <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, for it is to be found even in the footſteps of the</hi> Saxon <hi>Monarchy, when</hi> Godwyn <hi>Earl of</hi> Kent <hi>was Tried by Earls and Barons. And it is no improbable conjecture of theirs, who do think the Wiſdom of this Conſtitution was taken from that Law amongſt the</hi> Romans, <hi>whereby it was made unlawful for any Man to ſit upon a Senator, that was not himſelf of the ſame Order; a Priviledge, that (as learned Civilians tell us) continued with them during the Raign of many of the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperors. But, my Lords, as this is a Priviledge as antient as Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, ſo we have found by many old Experiences, that it cannot be taken away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94129:4"/>
the diſſolution of that Government: Therefore this is one of thoſe many tyes by which the intereſt of the Nobility, as well as their duty, have obliged them to the Service of the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the exerciſe of this Priviledge at this time; I know your Lordſhips will weigh the Fact with all the Circumſtances, whereby it is to receive its true and its proper Doom. Your Lordſhips are too juſt, to let pitty make any abatement for the Crime, and too wiſe to let Rethorick make any Improvement of it: This only will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be obſerved by all your Lordſhips, that the fowler the Crime is, the clearer and the plainer ought the Proof of it to be. There is no other good reaſon can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why the Law refuſeth to allow the Priſoner at the Bar Counſel in matter of Fact, when his Life is concerned, but only this, becauſe the Evidence by which he is condemned, ought to be ſo very evident and ſo plain, that all the Councell in the world ſhould not be able to anſwer it: upon this ground it is, that the Law hath truſted your Lordſhips with the Tryal of your Fellow Peers; no truſt can be more nobly lodged, nor no Judicature had ever more true ſubmiſſion made to it: Therefore it would be in me ſome want of reſpect to this Auguſt and noble Aſſembly, ſhould I go about to put your Lordſhips in mind of your Duty: no doubt you will obſerve the Evidence carefully, weigh it diligently, and when that is done, it is impoſſible but the Judgment you will give, muſt be Right and Honourable, and worthy of ſo wiſe and ſo great a Body; Therefore I will not detein your Lordſhips any longer, from hearing the Evidence that is ready to be offered unto you.</hi>

               <p>The Priſoner at the Bar, <hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Conwallis</hi> ſtandeth indicted of a great Crime, that he togather with <hi>Charles Gerrard,</hi> and <hi>Edward Bourne,</hi> not having in his heart the fear of God, but inſtigated by the Suggeſtions of the Devil, the 18. of <hi>May</hi> laſt, did Felloniouſly and of his Malice fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, aſſault one <hi>Robert Clerk</hi> in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> took him up in his Arms, flung him down, and broke his Neck, of which he inſtantly died; to this he hath pleaded not guilty: It lies upon us who are Counſell for the King, in this caſe to proſecute it, and prove it to you.</p>

               <p>May it place your Grace; my Lord High Steward of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and my Lords ſummoned for the Tryal of the Priſoner at the Bar:</p>
               <p>This Noble Lord ſtands Indicted for Murder; an Offence, my Lord, which is the firſt and greateſt that is forbidden by the ſecond Table, and an Offence of that nature, that the Law of God hath by a moſt Peremptory Sentence condemned and decreed, that whoſo ſheddeth mans Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed. Whether this Noble Lord be guilty of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains upon your Lordſhips to try, and I ſhall very ſhortly ſtate the matter of Fact, which we ſhall prove, and then let the Evidence be offered to you. We do not pretend, my Lords, neither doth the Indictment lay it, that this great Offence was committed by the hand of my Lord <hi>Conwallis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For I know your Lordſhips have obſerved the Indictment, by which it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94129:4"/>
is alleadged that the hand of Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> did the Fact: But my Lords, if we ſhall make it out that my Lord <hi>Conwallis</hi> did concur to this Act, and had in himſelf at that time an Intent to be a Murtherer; then it will be declared by his Grace my Lord High Steward, and my Lords the Judges, that though his hand and did it not, yet he is equally guilty as if it had.</p>
               <p>Now to make out the Charge againſt him, our Evidence will be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus;</p>
               <p>On the 18. of <hi>May</hi> laſt, Early in the Morning, between the hours of one and two came down two Gentlemen with three Footmen behind them out of the Gallery at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> by the Stairs that lead down to the Park: I call them two Gentlemen, becauſe it was not then diſcovered who they were, or of what quality; but your Lordſhips will perceived by the courſe of the Evidence; They were my Lord <hi>Conwallis</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> comming down to that unſeaſonable hour; the firſt Queſtion they askt the Centinel (who watched at the Foot of the Staires) was the hour of the Night, and from him had accompt that it was ſo much.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner and Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> were ſomewhat diſtempered with drink, and made him a reply that he lyed, with great Oaths accompanying it; at that time they did no more but go by him into the Park, where after they had continued by the ſpace of an hour, back they returned to the Stairs, and the Centinel demanding, according to his Duty, who came there? They anſwered him in very obſcene and uncivil Language, and threatned they would kill the Centinel, who only did his duty in enquiring who came by him at that time of night. And we ſhall make it appear they were in a kind of Contention among themſelves, who ſhould kill him; for as I am informed (I know if it be not proved, your Lordſhips will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it) one deſired, pray let me kill him; and the other deſired, pray let me kill him; and threatned no leſs than to run him through.</p>
               <p>My Lords, the Centinel being of a good reſolution, was not affrighted from his place, but kept them off, and when they ſaw they could not win upon the Centinel that way, one of them delivered away his Sword which he held in his hand not drawn, and then was pelaſed to come to the Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and deſired to kiſs him, and ſwore he would do that; but that the Centinel did equally refuſe, and then they did uſe the ſame threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſeemed to be in a contention who ſhould run him through. My Lords, after ſome time, being now come to the top of the Staires, and there ſtaying, it hapned there came to the ſtair-foot two Youths, and theſe young Men were it ſeems going to Bed to their Lodging which was very neer, and did make it their requeſt to the Centinel (one of them did) to call him up very early the next morning, becauſe he was to go of a Meſſage out of the Town. My Lord <hi>Conwallis</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> remaining on the Top of the Stair-Caſe, (being as we ſaid) in diſorder (which is the ſtrength of the Kings Evidence if proved) both of them ſaid before they went thence, they would kill ſome or other, which Evidence will go a great way to ſhew the concern that Noble Lord the Priſoner at Bar had in the Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>It hapned as theſe Boys were making their requeſt to the Centinel, my Lord and Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> took notice of it, and ſeemed to be concerned that they ſhould command the Kings Souldiers, and bid the Centinel ſhoot him, who told them he conceived the Boy had done him no wrong in asking a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94129:5"/>
Civil kindneſs from him, they again call'd to ſhoot him and they would bare him out; which he ſtill refuſed to do, finding no reaſon for it then one of the two took occaſion to ſwear a great Oath, he would kick his arſe to Hell; to which the Boy that askt the Centinel made ſome reply, wherein the word arſe was repeated; now (whether they underſtood it as an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, why kick my arſe to Hell? as he intended it, or in a worſe ſence, kiſs my arſe) one of the Gentlmen in a rage came running down the Stairs and that Boy that in truth ſpoke the word run away, and the other poor innocent Boy truſting in his own Innocency remained there, until the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon came to him and did on his Knees, (in a manner) deſire not to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, he was not the Perſon that uſed any ill words, and cryed out, O my Lord it was not I, indeed my Lord it was not I; but ſuch at that time was the Intemperance and wrath of the Perſon, who in ſuch a fury deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Stairs that (whether with the Blow or the Fall) the Boy received his death. We find by our Information of the Evidence, that he who did the thing was in truth Mr. <hi>Gerrard,</hi> who is not yet taken; but whether my Lord the Priſoner at the Bar did not concur in it, and had not an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to kill ſome body, is the queſtion left for your Grace and theſe Noble Peers to decide. This is the nature of the Fact; only I deſire to obſerve, that it is true here was ſome diſtance between the place where my Lord <hi>Conwallis</hi> ſtood, and the place were the Boy was killed. Of what conſequence that may be, I leave to your Graces and theſe Noble Lords Conſideration; It was the diſtance of the Stairs; But I think, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one knows, they are not ſo many but what is done below may be eaſily ſeen at the Top.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now without detaining your Lordſhips any longer, call the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and prove what hath been opened; The Souldier proved the Fact as it was opened by Mr. <hi>Attorney General,</hi> except that part about both ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they would kill one or other, which Paſſage was heard but by one of them, and was ſpoken but by one of the Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>They could not ſwear, who where the Perſons, becauſe of the darkneſs of the time.</p>
               <p>The Boy who was the Companion of him that was ſlain, and that uſed the the words that cauſed the Perſon to come down, ſwore them to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition only by way of Interrogation, (why kick my arſe to Hell?)</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> deſired to call my Lord <hi>Conwallis</hi>'s own two Footmen who had been Indicted and acquitted at the Kings Bench Bar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord High Stew.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords the Judges, is there any Queſtion whether a Perſon acquitted of an Offence be a good Witneſs againſt another charged with the ſame Offence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judges.</speaker>
               <p>None at all: when he is acquitted he ought to be admitted.</p>
               <p>Then the Copy of the Acquittal (proved by a Clerk in the Crown Office) was read and then ſworn, who fixed it upon the Perſon of Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> and ſwore that my Lord <hi>Conwallis</hi> was all the while upon the Top of the Stairs,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94129:5"/>
but after the Fact committed; haſted away for fear of being knock'd down by the Souldiers; and there ended the Kings Evidence.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord High Stew.</speaker>
               <p>Now my Lord is the time come for your defence. You hear what is charged on you, Pray ſpeak what you have to ſay for your ſelf.</p>

               <p>Then the Priſoner at the Bar confeſſed himſelf to have been in the Company that Night when this accident hapned, which he hoped would be a warning to him to ſhun ſuch diſorders hereafter; but that he had no evil Intention, and but one witneſs ſwore that both of them would have killed the Centinel, that he was not conſcious to himſelf to have had a hand in it, and therefore withdrew not himſelf, but yeilded himſelf to the Coroner the next day (which he proved by the Coroner himſelf) and did therefore in truſt of his Innocency ſubmit himſelf to the Judgment of his Grace and his Peers:</p>
               <p>Which being done, Sir <hi>Francis Winnington,</hi> the Kings Solicitor General, ſummed up the Evidence in this manner;</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Solicitor General.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace, my Lord High Steward of <hi>England,</hi> and my Noble Lords the Peers of the Priſoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>According to the duty of my Place I am to repeat the Kings Evidence and ſtate it to your Grace and theſe Noble Lords, and ſubmit to your great Judgments how far it will go for the Proof of this Crime; wherein I ſhall obſerve the Duty of all Honeſt Men, which is to do nothing either to wreſt any thing in diſadvantage of the Priſoner out of the Kings Evidence to goe farther than it ought, nor ſhall omit any thing that ſhall require your Grace and the Noble Lords Juſtice; for we come to ſeek out the truth, and we queſtion not but by this Honourable Tryal it will be brought to light: But I beſeech your Favour, to take notice in the firſt place what Crime this Noble Lord ſtands accuſed of, and it is for Murder, wherein our Law takes notice, that Murder is where a Man unlawfully kills another under the Kings Peace, with Malice forethought. Now that here is a Murder committed, I dare with all humily averre: by whom, that is the queſtion? for this <hi>Robert Clerk</hi> the Perſon killed, doth appear by the Courſe of the Evidence to have been doing his Duty, attending the place his Employment required; gave no offence to any whatſoever, but when the Perſon came down and fell upon him, the poor Youth cryed, indeed, my Lord, it was not I; yet my Lords, the Hands of Violence ſeized him and killed him, Let us then ſee how the Evidence brings it home to the Noble Lord the Priſoner at the Bar; wherein I muſt confeſs we have no expreſs Evidence (nay we have Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the contrary) that it was not his hand that did the Fact actually, for it is by two Witneſses; the Footmen ſwore that it was Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> who came down and gave the unfortunate Blow: But we have that which we think with humble ſubmiſſion may reach this Noble Lord: for I know your Grace and my Lords remember, that after they had been an hour in the Park, both returning, did with horrid Oathes ſwear they would kill the Centinel; there the Evidence fixeth it, not upon one only, but upon both; It was at that time ſo dark, they could not be diſtinguiſhed, but by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94129:6"/>
the voice: the Centinel hath given you an account how he performed his duty, and in what Straight he was, he had much ado to ſave his own Life, or to prevent killing them: But when they came upon the Stairs, theſe two Boys came there in order to deſire the Centinel to call one of them the next morning. Then one on the Stairs (no man can tell who it was) with horrid Execrations, askt, will you command the Kings Soldiers? ſhoot him, Centinel, we'l bear you out; but all this while it was dusk, no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Perſons could be made, whereupon it will fall out to come to this Caſe, If ſeveral Perſons intend to kill one, and happen to kill another, whether this be not Murder in them? For the urging of this, as to the matter in Law, I leave to him that comes after me: the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel ſwears one of them did ſwear he would kill one or other; who it was took up that cruel Reſolution, is left to you to judge. But at that time they were both together upon the Top of the Stairs; and my Lord doth not ſeem to give one Title of Evidence that ſhews any Endeavours of the Priſoner at the Bar, to prevent the other, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of his Actions; If he had given an account of that, he had ſilenced Juſtice: But when they were all together, he not endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtop his hand; It is as much in Law as if he had ſtrook the ſtroak.</p>
               <p>The other Soldiers give you a Particular Account to the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The two laſt Witneſſes do bring it to the Perſon of my Lord the Priſoner at the Bar, and Mr. <hi>Gerrard,</hi> who, they ſwore, came down the Stairs, and his Man followed him to the Bottom, and there ſtaid at ſome diſtance, till the Fact was done, and they all fled.</p>
               <p>This I take to be the matter of Fact faithfully proved, before your Grace, and the Lords the Peers, and I would not trouble your Grace longer, becauſe I would not miſreport any thing, whereby I might do wrong, either to the Priſoner, or the Kings Cauſe; and becauſe I know your Grace and the Noble Lords will diſtinguiſh and find out where the truth is: I muſt ſay it is a great comfort to all the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> that Crimes of this Nature are ſo carefully preſented, that whatſoever Honours and Dignities our Gratious Sovereign doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on any Perſon, it doth not exempt him from the Juſtice of the Law: It is not only a Comfort to this Aſſembly, but to the whole Nation, to ſee the King tender of his Subjects Perſons and lives, in that he hath cauſed this ſtrict Courſe to be taken, where the enquiry hath gone from the Grand Jury of the County, till the Bill came to this great Tribunal; where I doubt not but your Grace and theſe Noble Lords will give a righteous and juſt Judgement.</p>
            </sp>
            <stage>Then Serj. <hi>Maynard</hi> concluded Thus;</stage>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Serj. Maynard.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Grace, my Lord High Setward of <hi>England,</hi> and my Noble Lords the Peers.</p>
               <p>I according to the duty of my place, come now to conclude the charge
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94129:6"/>
on the Kings behalf; ſome things are fit to be obſerved upon the Evidence, that may produce a queſtion for the deciſion of the Fact, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is, that a murder is committed, is upon Evidence without all queſtion; and not only the death of a man, here is a Child ſlain, without any provocation in the world given by him to that Perſon that did it, and that did it too, notwithſtanding the deprecations of the Boy, affirming his own Innocency, and that with as full Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as a Chriſtian almoſt could a thing: theſe came from the Kings Palace walk in the Park; call the Centinel Rogue, and when he doth his duty, ſwear to murther him; with Oaths, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian would bluſh at, and be afraid to hear; <hi>God damme</hi> oftentimes reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and he that ſaith that word, doth beg of God to hate him, and affirm that he doth hate God. The Obſcenity that they uſed, I ſhall not mention again; theſe are Circumſtanes of the Caſe; that all were guilty of much, is no doubt; but who, of the murder, is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; And I humble conceive, it is manifeſt, that this Noble Lord was concerned in it. For it is not requiſite, to make a Murder; that he who kills a man, hath conceived a malice againſt him; for if I have a malice againſt any man, and the effect of that fall upon another, it is murder.</p>
               <p>I apply it thus, if it be a murder in Mr. <hi>Gerrard,</hi> if this Noble Lord partake with him in the deſign, which made it ſo; to wit, the malice againſt the Centinel, he is as guilty, as if his hand had been as much upon him, as was Mr. <hi>Gerrards,</hi> as in that known Caſe of the man that poiſoned an Apple,<note rend="inter">Sanders Caſe in Plowden, fol. 473.</note> with an intention to kill his wife, and ſhe not knowing of the Poiſon, gave ſome of it to her Chlid, of which it died, though he had no deſign to kill the Child, yet, the malice he had conceived againſt his wife ſuppli'd the defect of an expreſs malice to make it murther; and he was hanged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So if a man aſſault a Maſter, in the preſence of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who defends his Maſter, and is ſlain, though the other had no purpoſe to kill him, yet it is Felony in him, for which he ſhall die; the Law implying a malice. Then here was clearly a malice to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel; how neer it comes to the Boy, will come in queſtion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. I find the Objection made in my Lord's Caſe, That at the particular time wherein the Fact was committed, my Lord was not with Mr. <hi>Gerrard:</hi> but that will be no Objection in the Caſe; for if he did partake in the Deſign of the other, I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it with the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> of the South,<note rend="inter">Anno 33 H. 8. Coke, 3 Inſt. fol. 211.</note> who with ſome other went unlawfully to ſteal Deer, and the Keeper coming, ſome fled, among whom, my Lord was one: the Keeper was killed, my Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> being at that time without the Pales, a Mile off from the Place, and yet was found guilty of the Murther, and left both his Lands and his Life for it. But here my Lord <hi>Conwallis</hi> was preſent, for the Witneſs ſwears the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was not ſo great, but it might be diſcerned. Now whether he was aiding or aſſiſting, is the next thing in queſtion. What occaſion had they of Malice, Revenge or Injury to the Centinel? They both
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94129:7"/>
ſwore they would kill him: had there been any excuſe for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if one of them had killed the Centinel? that could not be: well, they did not kill the Centinel, but at the ſame time take up a cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs offence againſt another, and kill him: I argue, that the Malice againſt the Soldier, was diffuſive to the Boy; and one of the Witneſſes proves, that one of them ſwore he would kill ſome Body: now, no one ſpeaks to any thing of my Lords reproving Mr. <hi>Gerrard.</hi> Thus ſtands the Caſe before your Grace and my Lords; It is a Caſe of Blood, and it cries loud: how far this Noble Lord and Priſoner at the Bar is guilty thereof, you are to enquire, and without all doubt will give a clear Verdict, according to Juſtice and Honour.</p>

               <speaker>Lord High Stew.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords, you have heard the Evidence of your Lordſhips; Pleaſe, to go and conſider of it, you may.</p>
               <p>Then the Priſoner withdrew into his own apartment, with the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Lords went into a Room behind the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> and after a ſtay of two hours, return'd, and being all ſate; the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> who was the firſt of the Jury, addreſſed himſelf to my Lord High Steward, and ſaid;</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord High Steward</hi>; there is a queſtion in Law, of which ſome of my Lords deſire to receive ſatisfaction, before they can give in their full Verdict: acd we deſire to know of your Grace, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be proper here to ask the queſtion of your Grace, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to the Judges.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord H. Stew.</speaker>
               <p>If your Lordſhips doubt of any thing, whereon a queſtion in Law ariſeth, the latter opinion, and the better for the Priſoner is, that it muſt be ſtated in the preſence of the Priſoner, that he may know whether the queſtion be truly put. It hath ſometimes been practiſed otherwiſe; and the Peers have ſent for the Judges,<note rend="inter">Cooke Inſt fol. 3, 0. Paſch. 20. Hen.</note> and have asked their opinion in private, and have come back, and given their Verdict, according to that opinion; and there is ſcarce a Preſident of its being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe done; but there is a latter Authority in Print, that doth ſettle the Point ſo as I tell you; and I do conceive it ought to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; and it being ſafer for the Priſoner, my humble Opinion to your Lordſhips, is, that he ought to be preſent at the ſtating of the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Call the Priſoner to the Bar.</p>
               <p>Who being come, my Lord ſpake thus to him:</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord High Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Conwallis,</hi> My Lords the Peers, ſince they have withdrawn, have conceived a doubt, in ſome matter of Law ariſing upon the matter of Fact in your Caſe; and they have that tender regard of a Priſoner at the Bar, that they will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Caſe to be put up in his abſence, leſt it ſhould chance to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice him, by being wrong ſtated; therefore, your Lordſhip will do well, to attend the queſtion that is raiſed; and, my Lords, will you pleaſe to propound your doubts?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94129:7"/>It was taken notice of here, that by opening the matter by Mr. Solicitor, the matter of Murder was explained,<note rend="inter">Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi>
                  </note> to be meant by having a prepenſed Malice, and in that Caſe it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us, that any Perſons then preſent, and that had in any ſort contributed to the Diſorders, they were as equally guilty, as they whoſe hand had ſhed the Blood of the Perſon killed.</p>
               <p>Now the doubt of ſome of my Lords is, whether if it be found but Man-ſlaughter, thoſe are equally guilty, that are preſent (and have proved to contribute to the diſturbance) of that Crime, as they are in Murder; becauſe ſome of them have not the ſatisfaction that they are the ſame.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord High Steward.</speaker>
               <p>My Lords the Judges, I take it, the doubt propoſed to you, is this; whether or no, thoſe that are preſent, and have contributed to the diſorders, whereby ſuch an accident doth enſue, as proves to be Man-ſlaughter, be as culpable, as he that doth the immediate Fact, as it is in the Caſe of Murder?</p>
               <p>After a little Pauſe and Conference, the Judges returned this Anſwer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judges.</speaker>
               <p>We have had Conference of this Caſe, and our humble Opinion is, If ſundry Perſons be together, aiding and aſſiſting to an Action, wherein a Man-ſlaughter doth enſue, as in Caſe of a ſudden buſineſs without malice prepenſed, they are equally guilty with the Man-ſlaughter, as they are in the Caſe of Murder prepenſed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>The Lords deſire to withdraw once more, which they did, and after a ſhort ſpace returned; and being called over, anſwered to their Names, and all appearing, my <hi>Lord High Steward,</hi> took their Verdict <hi>ſeriatim,</hi> beginning at the Puiſne Lord in the following orders, they anſwering, ſtanding bare with their hands on their Breaſts.</p>
