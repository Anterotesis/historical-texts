         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Epistle to the gentle Reader, of what estate or calling soeuer.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, whether adorned with the royall Roabes of true Nobilitie, or apparrelled with the gorgious Garmentes of Gentilitie, pardon I pray, these my vnpolished lines: vnrip not, I beseech you, the mistaken stitches of this botcherit, neither sensure seuerely the vnsauerie taste of this Loafe, being <hi>Primogeniti,</hi> the first batch of my baking: But if you finde any thing herein conteyned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing your humours, say with the Doctor in Cambridge, What, was it I he meant? No, he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not mee, he spake it not by mee, he knoweth mee not; How should he then be priuate to any of my doinges? No no I am none of these miserable Maisters that so inhumanely burieth in obliuion vnrewarded the long, good, and duetifull seruice of my olde Seruant: But if you be such as either thus, or otherwyse abuseth those good creatures that God hath lent you, I meane these earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders, Golde and Siluer: Let these my cauiats
<pb facs="tcp:21538:3"/>
worke some remorse of conscience, and play not the gauled Horse that kicketh and winseth, his sore being once touched, to burst out into vngentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike tearmes agaynst the Authour, being with his worke displeased. For assure your selues, and before God I protest, I speake not against one in particuler, neither against all in generall, vpon a malepart or presumptuous minde, as not caring who are offended with my doinges; but carefull least I should offende any, or incurre their displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, by my presumptuous enterprise, I humbly (as before) pray pardon. Thinke not Gentlemen, that whereas I speake any thing of Maisters hard vsage of their Seruantes, or of any auncient famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aritie betwixt them, that thereby I woulde giue any incouragement to the Seruant to be negligent in his duetie, or by malepart sawcinesse to abuse that reuerence that he oweth vnto his Maister: for God is my recorde, be it farre from mee, that I shoulde once dreame of so inhumane and sedicious a practise: For I protest for my owne part, yf I should serue the meanest Carman that whistleth after his Horse, and be bound by his wages to call him Maister, I would not skorne to do him any reuerence and duetie that by my place and calling were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at my handes. Therefore gentle Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, since curtesie is alwayes the companion of true Gentilitie, courteously I pray you consider of me and my doinges. And now Reader, if you by degree deserue the name of a Yeoman, submissiuely without hautines of hart I pray your patience in
<pb facs="tcp:21538:3"/>
perusing this my first practise, for I hold your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling no lesse commendable, and your profession no lesse pertinent to the supportyng of this humane societie, then them of higher dignitie and degree: For, What is the Prince without the Plough? or the Potentate without the Pasture? Doth not the one affoorde them Corne, the other Kine, with all other prouision for their bodyly sustenaunce? Since therefore gentle Reader, yf Yeoman you be one, that I shall happily haue somewhat to say to in this folowing Treatise, I pray (as before) your patience, that if you finde any thing therein amisse, either in vnmanerly tearmes, or otherwyse, that you would passe it ouer with silence, and impute it to ignoraunce, and not to be done of any malicious or set purpose; or els to say with your selues, <hi>In ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena republica ne sis curiosus,</hi> It is not good to scalde ones lyppes in other mens Pottage. Since he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth neither by me, of me, nor agaynst me, nor any thing that consernes me, why should I spurne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst his speches, or hate him for his harsh harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? Let them that are galled kicke, and them that are wounded seeke remedie: But yf you be such as your guyltie conscience perswades you, that what as is spoken, is meant by you, for it is an olde saying <hi>Concius ipse sibi, de se putat omnia dici,</hi> the guyltie conscience thinkes what as is sayd, is alwayes spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken himselfe to vpbrayde: Then worthely waigh and consider whether you be iustly accused, and complayned of or no; and yf you finde your selfe to haue offended in such and such thinges, and that
<pb facs="tcp:21538:4"/>
what hath been sayd of you, you haue worthely deserued; then be content to bite the lyp, wincke at small faultes, and mende that is amisse: for if you manifest your malice in any opprobrious speaches against the Authour of this worke, then you shall pronounce a definitiue sentence of condemnation against your selfe, as worthy to haue deserued all, and more, then herein is conteyned. For be it kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vnto you, and all other of higher or inferiour degree, that I haue not touched any of the better sort, neither any that are men well meriting for their mindes and manners; but such as are mates of no merite, and as haue condingly deserued more then I can say against them: but if any of what estate or degree so euer, shall murmure against mee, I will say vnto him as Christ said to the men that brought the woman taken in adulterie before him to be stoned to death, <hi>Hee that hath not offended, let him throw the first stone:</hi> So, he that will acknowledge himselfe touched herewith, let him cast the first stone, let him the first seeke remedie and reuenge: but before he seeke reuenge, it were good he knew who had wronged him. And if he thinke I haue wronged him by speaking any thing against him, then let him come to me and know whether I ment it by him or no, and I will not onely resolue him of that doubt, but also pacifie his impatient humour. Therefore gentle Reader, I expect a pardon of course, if I haue offended by ignoraunce; which I vndoubtedly perswade my selfe to receaue at your handes, and so I leaue you to your labours: which
<pb facs="tcp:21538:4"/>
I pray God may yeelde you a plentifull increase. Now curtuous surueyour of these barren Landes, nay barren and mosse-begrowen lines, if thou beest my fellow in fraternitie a Seruingman, to thee I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse my petition, if you be a Gentleman borne, and a Seruingman by profession, if in reading this my Booke, you shall happely stumble on any vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie sentence that may mislike your taste, pocket I pray you this iniurie, as I may tearme it, since (God is my witnes) I meane you no harme, but rather pray for your preferment, and wysh your welfare, then by any meanes to seeke your indignitie, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. And if gentle Reader, thou be a Yeomans sonne, that hath with the complet Armour of foure Markes and a Lyuerie, entered the lystes to play the pryses of a Seruingman, shall in this my Booke finde a lumpe too much leauened, that a weake and queasie stomacke can hardly disgest, I pray thee perswade thy selfe, that it is better to haue a frowne of a friende, then a smyle of a flattering and deceitfull enemie: and whatsoeuer I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thee, or concerning thee, is rather of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, to forewarne thee of an imminent danger, then to beate thee with the dry blowes of intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ignominie. Wherefore gentle Reader, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer thou be, I earnestly intreate thee, to reuerse that hard sentence of Hatred in lue of my laboure, and rather smother thy discontent with the ashes of silence (if any such thou finde in reading this Treatise) then to wreake thy malice with the hot coales of inquenchable furie; which will sooner
<pb facs="tcp:21538:5"/>
consume they selfe, then preuayle against thy mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken enemie. Thus hauing (as I hope) satisfied my curious enemies, I am to craue the goodwill of my courteous friendes; desiring you (gentle Reader) to accept in good part these my labours: which if they shall like you, I shall accompt my gayne great; if not, yet must I needes count my losse but light, in that the doing of it kept me from idlenesse, a thing so dangerous to a young man, as it is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent he should seeke with as much industrie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the same, as the skilfull Mariners with vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eyes do labour to passe without perill the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Rockes of <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Caribdis:</hi> And so wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee as to my selfe, I commit thee to God.</p>

In the first creation of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> there needed no Superioritie, nor members for this body, being altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther planted and seated in all happines and perfectnes of Nature: but the offence committed, and the forfayture enrolde, that Man for his transgression <hi>Should eate the Labours of his handes by the Sweate of his browes,</hi> and that the commaunde, <hi>Increase and Multiplie,</hi> was strictly by the law of Nature obserued: Tract of time yeelded so plentifull an increase, as it grew very needefull that this body should be drawen into seuerall members, to auoyde a ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es of confusion, and frame an artificiall buylding. For euen as a Logge of wood vnwrought, yeeldes neither profite nor pleasure, but being sawne, hewne, and squared, serues for many seuerall vses; for that which will not be a Bedde, wilbe a Boord, a Table, or Trusse, so that euery peece hauing his proportion, will execute his office: Euen so this consort of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb facs="tcp:21538:7"/>
not knowing seuerally the partes of their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, restes very troublesome one to another: for all desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be Heades, then the body must needes fall for want of Eyes to direct him; and if all Eyes, then it must needes perish for want of a mouth to feede him: But being deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into members, euery one vsing his office, and resting contented with his estate, the body remaynes in perfect health &amp; happines. Now in the knitting of these ioyntes togeather, euery officer according to his aptnes was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. First the King as head, for his magnanimitie: then others adorned with the tytles of Nobilitie and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, their mindes no lesse meriting: And lastly, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaltie at the commaund of these mercifull Maiestrates. These Princes and Potentates thus seated in the solace of their soueraintie, thought it very meete and necessarie, to chose and ordayne one sort of Seruantes for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and pleasure (ouer and besides their seruile sottes, as Dicke to droyle, Ralph to runne, Kit the Cater, with other Gouldsmythes of their occupation:) which sort of Seruantes were knowen from the rest by the names of Seruingmen. Now being come to their names, it is necessarie to know of what mettall these ministers were moulded, and what sort of people were thought fittest for this frame, considering the ende for which they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned. First they were chosen men of witte, discretion, gouernment, and good bringing vp, considering their Soueraignes, Lordes, and Maisters serious busines, waightie affayres, and worldly wealth, was for the most part committed to their custodie and care: Whose vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eye, willing minde, and faythfull forecast diligently to discharge that duetie, was thought so necessarie, as choyce they were of them they admitted to this calling.</p>
            <p>Secondly, men of v<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>loure and courage, not fearing to fight in the mayntenance of their Maisters credite, in his iust quarrell, against his forraine foe, if occasion were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:
<pb facs="tcp:21538:7"/>
and also, if any Countries causes called him abrode, to garde and defende him agaynst Newmarket Heathes commissioners, or any consories of their craft.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, men of strength, &amp; actiuitie, to be excellent in shooting, running, leaping, dauncing, pitching the Barte, throwing the Hammer, or other feates of lyke facultie, wherewith Potentates in times past were highly pleased.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, men fine, neate, and nimble, in regarde of their nearenes about their Maister, his apparel and cates: for the Clowne, the Slouen, and Tom althummes, are as farre vnfit for this profession, as <hi>Tarletons</hi> toyes for <hi>Paule,</hi> Pulpit: betwixt which, though I make a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, yet to the place I reserue a reuerend regarde.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and lastly, men of qualitie to be seene in haulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hunting, fyshing and fowling, with all such like Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemanly pastimes: All which being required in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingman, and naturally belonging to a Gentleman: Amongst what sort of people should then this Seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be sought for? Euen the Dukes sonne preferred Page to the Prince, the Earles seconde sonne attendant vpon the Duke, the Knights seconde sonne the Earles Seruant, the Esquires sonne to weare the Knightes lyuerie, and the Gentlemans sonne the Esquiers Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingman: Yea, I know at this day, Gentlemen younger brothers, that weares their elder brothers Blew coate and Badge, attending him with as reuerend regard and dueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience, as if he were their Prince or Soueraigne. Where was then, in the prime of this profession, goodman Tomsons Iacke, or Robin Roushe my gaffer russetcoats seconde sonne? the one holding the Plough, the other whipping the Carthorse, labouring like honest men in their vocation: Tricke Tom the Taylor was then a Tiler for this trade, as strange to finde a Blew-coate on his backe with a badge on his sleeue, as to take Kent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streete without a Scoulde, or Newmarket-heath without
<pb facs="tcp:21538:8"/>
a Commissioner. But now being lapt in his Liuerie, he thinketh him selfe as good a man, with the Sheares at his backe, as the Poet <hi>Lawret</hi> with a penne in his eare: Notwithstanding for his profession I holde it profitable, and him selfe a good member, yf his Sheares do not can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, nor his Needle rust. And if there must be one amongst artificers, Coblers, and Carters, chosen felow of this facultie, I holde the Taylor not vnfittest: First, in regard his trade tyeth him to no vncleanlines: and secondly, that his Maisters apparell be kept in reparations: for nothing more vnseemely in a ciuile Gentleman, then his apparell out of repayre, torne, or broken. Agayne, yf he be a felow of an humble spirit, he may pleasure his friendes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite him selfe: his friendes, I meane his felow seruantes, without blot or stayne to his birth, or trade.</p>
            <p>Two thinges, it should seeme, were holden in high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard amongst the founders of this fraternitie of Seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: the preseruation of ancient Houses, and, the maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Commons in their calling. First, for the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of Hospitalitie or auncient Houses, a Gentleman by antiquitie, or an Esquire by his calling, waighing and worthyly considering his wealth &amp; worshyp, in this waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring worlde of wretchednes, hauing by Gods prouidence sent him .vi. or .viii. Sonnes, proper &amp; personable men, wel meriting for their myndes and manners, callyng I say to mynde the credite he caryed in his Countrey, the men he mainteined, the poore prouided for by pence from his purse, the blacke Iack ietting from haul to butterie, from butte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to barrel, from barrel backe for the hauls health, where good felowes dyuing into the deapth of this ditch, leaues in the bottome this inscription: <hi>God saue the founders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all these, with many moe, the good Gentleman meditating in his minde, sayes with him selfe: If I shall leaue my Land and liuing, my Kine and Coyne, equally deuided amongst my children, imparcially proporcioning
<pb facs="tcp:21538:8"/>
to euery one his part, the youngest to the heire and eldest no way inferiour for worldly fortune: then shall the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of my degree, the hope of my house, &amp; the mayntenance of these before mentioned members, be quite (as Issue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct) buried in the bottomles pit of obliuion. What, shall the light of my Lampe for want of Oyle be blemished, and my House for want of Lyuing sustayne the reprochfull name of a Mock-begger? <hi>Virtus post funera viuit.</hi> And shall I not leaue my name noted in the booke of ensuing ages? Yes, yes verely, Thou my eldest Sonne, that shall suruiue thy dying father, holde heere, wholly my Land I leaue thee, that my name may remayne registred in thy posteritie, thy byrthright by holy writ doth challenge it. Let therefore the example of <hi>Esaw</hi> be euer coated in the margent: Let couetousnes neuer corrupt thee, nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures so much preuayle, as for Pottage to hazard thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage: but let thy minde and manners be euer equally matched according to thy birth &amp; calling, that thy fathers foregoing may teach thee to folow. Maynteine thy right, &amp; loose no part of that which the law of libertie hath allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee. According to thy abilitie mainteyne Hospitalitie: for that is the harbourer of two hopes, prayse, &amp; prayers: yet let Liberalitie be the Linke to light thee, least Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes might corrupt, or Prodigalitie procure penurie, <hi>in medio concistet virtus, euery meane betwixt two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, is a vertue:</hi> so is liberalitie, betwixt auarice and prodigalitie, being placed: this meane in al musicke yeelds a most heauenly harmonie. Thus not doubting but in thee to liue after my Funerals be solemnized, committing the honour of my House to the care of thy credite, and thee with it to the tuition of thalmightie.</p>
            <p>And you my younger sonnes, to whom I allow no lesse loue then the law of nature doth allot, I giue euery one of you yeerely, to mainteyne you from miserie, an annual rent during your natural liues: with payment of which
<pb facs="tcp:21538:9"/>
rent your eldest brothers land shall remayne charged; so that the Legasie I leaue you, you may assuredly receaue: exceede not your exhibition, but liue within compasse, tyll your care and diligence, being sowne in seruice, it may yeelde you a more plentifull Haruest. For I tell you, my younger Children, Seruice I meane shalbe your inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: wherfore I will you, and euery of you, with modest mindes, and humble spirites, by diligence to augment your portions. And thus much for the preseruation of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Houses. Now it foloweth, with what care the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the commons in their calling, was in this electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on considered. For this Mundaine market was wholly maintayned by three Merchauntes, the supporters of this whole societie: fyrst the Prince or Soueraigne: secondly, the Nobilitie with gentrie: and the Commons the thirde calling. Now the Prince, being but one alone person, could lende no part to this profession: and for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, there were many causes to keepe them in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed consort. For if they should take Peter patch-pannell from the Cart to the Court, from the Plough to the Parlour, from the Sacke to the Saddle, and from course Karsie to handsome habite, this Shippe hauing one of her Cables thus crackt, might in a storme hazarde the whole, for want of such like necessaries to preuent the extremitie of winde and weather. Considering therefore that the Plough was the Potentates power, and Corne the kinges Commaunder, it was thought good not to lame it of any limbe, especially not of any such necessarie limbe as the houlder or the dryuer: for take but away a Yokesticke, the Yoke falles, the Plough standes, and the Haruest is hindered: Much more the mayming of eyther the before mentioned members. All artificers, Colliers, Coblers, and Carters, are consortes of this Craft, and maynteyners of this Misterie: And if any of them, nay any member of any of them be a missing, it doth blemysh

the body crosse the company, and hinder the hope of this happie Haruest.</p>
            <p>Since therefore, as I sayd before, the Plough is the Princes repast, the Maisters meate, the Seruantes suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the poores prouender; the Potentates as good Phisitians, had alwayes an eye that no hurt should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to hinder the health of this blessed body, the blemish whereof might bryng bane and bayle into their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. You see the two causes so highly had in esteeme in the choyce of Seruingmen: the mayntenance of auncient Houses, and the Commons in their calling. And thus much for the originall and ende of Seruingmens fyrst ordeyning. Now foloweth how florishing was the prime of this profession.</p>
            <p>Euen as <hi>Adam</hi> our fyrst Parent, in the perfection of all pleasure placed in Paradice, God in his wysedome thought this seate too solitarie for him alone, so framed him a felow for his further content, helpe, and comfort: but what was the mettall that his mate was made of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that two of a contrary nature being matched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather could neuer agree: and that these two must conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually accompany togeather the one with thother, as in a consort without discorde; thought it meete and necessarie to match them as neare as might be, so casting <hi>Adam</hi> into a dead sleepe, tooke a Ribbe from his left side, whereof he framed the Woman: which being made of the same moulde, euen part of his owne body, he combined togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vndesoluable bondes of assured friendshyp: Euen so, Gentlemen and States considering their calling, thought it very meete and necessarie to haue a helpe, to further them in euery of their actions: which helpe, though not to them so seruiceable as <hi>Eue</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi> yet so needeful vnto them, &amp; so necessarie about them, as it was thought meete, this helpe or Seruaunt should be made of their owne mettall, euen a Loafe of their owne dough:
<pb facs="tcp:21538:11"/>
which being done, as before I haue declared, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man receaued euen a Gentleman into his seruice, and therefore did limit him no other labour then belonged him selfe, as to helpe him readie in the morning, to brush his apparrel, Cloake, Hatte, Girdle, or other garment, trusse his poyntes, fetch him water to wash, with other such like necessaries. His Maister thus made ready, yf it pleased him to walke abrode, then to take his Liuerie and Weapon to attende him, being himselfe ready, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and well appoynted: at his returne, yf it pleased him to eate, then with all diligence, decently and comely to bring his meate to the Table, and thereon in seemely sort being placed, with a reuerend regarde to attende him, placing and displacing dyshes at the first or seconde course, according as occasion shall serue, tyll time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde to take away: which done, grace sayd, and the Table taken vp, the Plate presently conueyed into the Pantrie, the Haul summons this consort of companions, (vpon payne to dyne with Duke Humfrie, or kisse the Hares foote) to appeare at the first call: where a song is to be song, the vndersong or holding whereof is, <hi>It is merrie in Haul, when Beardes wagges all:</hi> But beardlesse Brian, and long toothed Tom, whose teeth be longer then his beard, sayth the inditer of this dittie, was as farre ouerseene in misplacing a worde, as the founders of Broughton Church in Crauen in Yorkshyre was, in placing it without an Alehouse: or, he that giueth his friende a potte of Ale in a frostie mornyng without a Toast, for that is the appurtenance therunto belonging: (Beardes for Choppes) say they is the right of it, for it is merrie in Haull when Choppes wagges all: But Beardes or Choppes whether so euer, they both agree to bid a base to the chine of Beefe, which being sore batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with many fresh assaultes, retyres backe agayne to his houlde the Kitchen, if he be able to abyde a seconde
<pb facs="tcp:21538:11"/>
charge: yf not, then he dyes manfully in the feelde, vpon the poynt of his enemies weapon, who pursues him with such hatred, as they euen eate him for very anger, or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, choose you whether: and not so contented, they commit his very boones to the Dogges to gnaw, for his further persecution.</p>
            <p>And if any other enemies of lesse esteeme incounter them in this hot conflict, all goes to the potte, vnlesse some sparke of mercie mooue their mindes to repriue these prisoners tyll the next assises to be holden in the Haull aforesayd: which seruice performed, and they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, the Maister calles to go on huntyng, haulkyng, fishyng, or fowlyng, in which he taketh most pleasure, or thinketh fit for the tyme. Then the Seruingman, or men, with all diligence prepare them selues to the feelde, euery one willing to shew his skil, to delight his Maister in which of these recreations he taketh most pleasure. Thus passing the day with these, or such lyke sportes, the nyght calleth them home, where the whole seruice of the Seruingman is styll imployde about his Maister. No seruile seruice was then sought for at the Seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hand, though no Gentelman but standeth neede of some moylyng mate to droyle about his drudgerie. How florishyng then the state of Seruingmen was in these dayes, he that hath eares to heare, let him heare. What sport or pastime in feelde or at home, pleasing the eye, or delyghting the care, could the Maister any way haue, but the Seruant was thereof equall partaker? What was the difference then, wyll some say, betwixt the Maister and the Man, yf their pleasures were equall? for then it had been as good to haue been a Seruant, as a Soueraigne, a Man, as a Maister: euen this was one, and all that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Potentates power, and the Seruingmans profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the one did commaunde, the other was to obey: the due obedience to which commaunde was had in so reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb facs="tcp:21538:12"/>
regarde, and the Seruant so fearefull to offende his Maister, no seruile, but as it were a filiall feare, as the Maister was almost as carefull in his commaunde, as the Seruant diligent in his duetie. For in these dayes what greater loue could almost be found, then betwixt the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and the Seruant? it was in maner equall with the Husbandes to the Wyfe, and the Childes to the Parent: for testimonie whereof, there are infinite examples to be alleadged, as in the prescription of the triumuerie of <hi>Marcus Lepidus, Marcus Anthonius,</hi> and <hi>Octauius Cesar,</hi> in the <hi>Romane</hi> ciuile warres, where <hi>Naso,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by their prescription, was by one of his Seruants kept safe in an hill: the sayd Seruant going to the Sea side, to hyre his Maister a Boate for his more safe passage and speedy escape, and at his returne, perceauing his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster by the strikers to be killed, he cryed aloude vnto him, (hauing yet a lytle life) Stay a whyle, O Maister (quoth he) and sodaynely stroke the Captayne and killed him, then comming agayne to his Maister, killed him selfe, saying: O Maister, you haue receaued comfort.</p>
            <p>An other in the same tyme of persecution and tryall of frindes, hauing a fayre shadowed Uineyarde, and in it a goodly Caue, deepe and large (for the which peraduenture he was condemned) by chaunce refreshing him selfe in the sayd Caue, one of his Seruantes perceauing the quellers yet a farre off, which came to finysh his Maisters tragidie, for the pure loue, and sinceere affection that he bore to his Maister, hid him safely, as he thought, in the secret place of the Denne, and furnished him selfe with his Maisters apparrell, feigning to be hee, euen offeryng him selfe to the death for his Maisters safetie. O rare examples, worthy of euerlastyng memorie: What greater goodwil? What purer loue, or more sinceere affection can be found amongst any consort of creatures then this? O happie Seruantes that had your beeing in those goulden dayes,
<pb facs="tcp:21538:12"/>
when Maisters would merite such maruels at your hands: and thrise happie Maisters, that past your pilgrimage in those blessed houres, when by your loue and liberalitie, you tyed your Seruantes with this vndessolueable bonde of assured friendshyp, euen to deserue and merite the full measure of your good will towardes them. Infinite are the examples (as I sayd before) that may be alledged in this matter, onely these two I holde sufficient to confirme this argument, since none but will confesse this loue and affection to be auncient, and of long continuance.</p>
            <p>Yea, but will some say, these examples are olde, and long is it since this loue and affection was thus in the highest degree made manifest, and the tryall of friendshyp thus exercised: shew me some examples of late yeeres, for the more credite of your cause, or els some reasons why these examples should not be as plentifull in these latter dayes, as in former tyme.</p>
            <p>To this Obiection, I answere thus: There be two especiall causes that hath vntwyned this knott, and euen cancelled this firme Obligaton, exchanging it for a single Bi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l. The first is, the compounding of this pure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined mettall (whereof Seruingmen were first framed) with vntryed dregges and drosse of lesse esteeme. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, is the death and decay of Liberalitie or Rewarde for well doing. But I wyll omit to vnrippe the bowelles of these reasons, tyll tyme and place of fitter oportunitie be offered, since I haue not as yet finished the seconde part of this tractate, which is onely to declare the florishyng dayes of the prime of this profession.</p>
            <p>I haue before declared how this seruice was in no sort seruile, nor the paynes belonging it any pennance, but they ioyed as much in their libertie, &amp; florished as fresh in their profession as any other, of what sort, degree, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng soeuer: their fare was alwayes of the best, their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell fine, neate, handsome, and comly, their credite and
<pb facs="tcp:21538:13"/>
esteeme alwayes equall with their birth and callyng, in good regarde: their exercises, or dayly labours, nothyng but pleasure, their head so smally troubled with carpe and care of worldly Coyne, and them selues so farre from miserie, pennurie, scarcitie, or beggerie, harboured in the hauen of happinesse, swimming in the calme, neyther too deepe nor too shallow, supported by these good patrons their Maisters, neither soaryng to high, nor dyuing too deepe, neither Prince nor begger, floryshing in this their estate, being (as it were) euen the meane or midwarde of all degrees and callinges, as I verily thinke they were the happiest consort of Companions, and the least troubled tradesmen, in the prime of their profession, that belonged this Mundaine market.</p>
            <p>O what pleasure belonged Seruingmen in those dayes? when the great Chamber was serued? the Hauls cryer with a Hoe yes, summoned all good fellowes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vpon an allarum? at which battayle, the boordes end was euer battered with the gunshot of Good-stomackes, where the chine of Beefe, the hagstocke to these Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was hewen and squared into diuers parcels, for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall purposes: And the blacke Iacke, merily trowlyng from one to another, well lyned with the lyquor of lyfe, moystened and molified the malecontent humors of these merrie mates, to their Maisters credice, and their owne comfort.</p>
            <p>But mee thinkes I heare the maligners of this myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or profession, lyke Momus mates murmure, saying to them selues, He telleth vs of their delicate diet, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some habite, and pleasant passing the Sommer of their yeeres: But when this lustie <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> begunne (with the Moone) to wane, and that crooked olde age had eclipsed the bright Sunshyne of their golden dayes, with duskie blacke Cloudes of darke morpheus; I meane, when that stealing Time, had consumed the oyle of their Lampes,
<pb facs="tcp:21538:13"/>
and euery ioynt begunne to grow starke, not able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his former place; what course then they tooke, to maynteine them selues from miserie, in this their greatest necessitie, he doth omit, as a thing altogeather impertinent to this discourse: but in my iudgement, a thing most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie amongst them to be considered, and the very marke whereat they ought chieflyest to ayme: for els, who is so simple but will confesse, that the Seruingmans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession (in regarde of their pleasure and ease) is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before diuers sortes of people, of more wealth, and greater abilitie, yf their ende were not miserie, pennurie, scarcitie, and almost beggerie: For, I holde it an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule, <hi>An olde Seruingman, a young Begger.</hi> What Gentleman now a dayes, that giueth wages and lyueries, doth not looke his Seruant shoulde deserue them? and when the Seruant is olde and crooked, and altogeather vnable to helpe him selfe, how much more is he then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to deserue mayntenance at his Maisters handes? To this Obiection, thus much: What sotte is so simple to aske a question, not knowing the cause? or to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, being altogeather ignorant of the question? My Discourse tendeth onely to set foorth the florishyng and golden dayes of Seruingmens fyrst ordeyning: and the Obiection commeth foorth, <hi>With what Gentleman now a dayes. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But least he, or they shoulde thinke me striken mute with the first blow, not able to abyde a seconde charge, I wyll answere so much of the question as shall seeme any way appertayning to this place, and leaue the rest to a fitter opportunitie.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore I haue handled the <hi>Ver, aestas,</hi> and <hi>Autumnus,</hi> of this Seruingmans estate, I wyl not leaue him tyll his fourth part be fully finished, since the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection hath allowed, that these three partes of his lyfe was spent in pleasure and delyght, accordyng to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

saying: But you must note by the way, that I holde straight on the path wherein first I set foote, not medlyng with these latter or leaden dayes, tyll tyme minister oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. Now for the fourth, which is the <hi>Hiems,</hi> and last part of mans yeeres, commonly called Crooked olde age; as <hi>Dauid</hi> sayth, <hi>are to euery man nothing but meere miserie,</hi> in regarde of weakening his strength, and decaying of nature: which hoarie heares, if they bryng to euery man miserie in generall, it must then needes touch this degree in particuler. But this miserie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, and by the law of nature so forcible, as the wealthy <hi>Cressus,</hi> the wittie <hi>Salomon</hi> nor the subtyle <hi>Simon,</hi> can any way eschew, yf <hi>Atropos</hi> do not befriende them in cutting the threed of their lyfe before these dayes of decay approch, cannot I say be onely attributed to Seruingmen, and them by that meanes accompted most miserable. But to leaue this naturall miserie, and come to the miserie that by pennurie, scarcitie, and want of worldly wealth, is incident. Thus much I say for this profession: When that <hi>Boreas</hi> boysterous blastes had blowen the buddes and blossoms from their trees, and that <hi>Hiems</hi> hoarie frostes had euen nipped and wythered the fruites of their florishyng Sommer, this kinde care had euery Lord of his attendant, and euery Maister of his Seruant that by these, and such lyke meanes, they prouided for their Attendantes and Seruantes, to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne them from want of worldly necessaries, euen vntyll the fall of their leafe was fully finished, and their vitall dayes ended. Some woulde giue their Seruantes an Annuitie or yeerely portion of Money, duering their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall lyues, ouer and aboue their Wages, to the ende, that when their seruice coulde not merite mayntenance, in respect of their yeeres and vnwealdines, consideryng they had reaped the fyrst fruites of their Benefice, euen the Sommer of their yeeres, this their beueuolence
<pb facs="tcp:21538:14"/>
should maynteyne these their Seruantes from worldly pennurie, to their last houre. Other some Maisters, in the same regarde, would procure for their Seruants such Martages, as they should thinke them selues suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently rewarded and satisfied for their whole seruice. Againe, some other would reward their Seruants with the Lease of a Farme, not as they are let now adayes, like a brydle for a brainesicke Iade, <hi>Durante bene placito,</hi> and rearing the rent, but <hi>Durante vita,</hi> and rent free: so that this angelicall Oyle, should so molifie his decaying members, and reuiue his dying spirit, as the thought of crooked olde Age should neither hinder his duetie in his seruice, nor with griefe shorten his dayes. By these, and such lyke meanes, were alwayes Seruingmen so proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for in those dayes, that none, no not one (that reserued that reuerent regard and duetie towardes his Maister that he ought) but passed his youth and age, in as much pleasure, plentie, and worldly felicitie, to his hartes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as any other, of what estate, degree, or calling soeuer. And thus much for the florishyng prime of this profession. Now foloweth the third, and last part of this tractate, wherein shalbe declared (God willing) the ruin, downe-fall, and decay, of this m<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

For euen as

the erector or buylder of an House, if he lay his platforme or foundation more large then the pence in his purse, or the coyne in his coffers is able to counteruayle or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, so that his abilitie is not sufficient to ende his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng, what he is censured, the simple may easely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, Euen so I, hauing vndertaken this taske, and layde this platforme, fitter to cary Stones and Morter to this buylding, then to be thought the workeman, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing I say layde this foundation, and farre vnfit to finysh it, what the gentle Reader may thinke of mee, I leaue it to his good consideration: For <hi>Cum desunt vires, tamen est laudanda voluntas,</hi> but the mutteryng or murmuryng of <hi>Momus</hi> mates I waigh not, for I holde them like bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Dogges, that ceasseth not to trouble, aswell the honest traueller, as the lurking loyterer. But least I should fall into a laborinth, not able to free my selfe from captiuitie, I meane, to goe so farre beside my text, as to forget where I left, I wyl returne agayne to my purpose. Since therfore I haue deuided this Tractate into three partes, namely the originall &amp; ende of this ordinance, the flooryshyng prime of this profession, and lastly the ruine and decay thereof: two of the which, I haue alredy handled. Now the thirde and last, which is the downefall and decay of this buylding, I will also deuide and reduce into three seuerall poyntes, though infinite are the causes that may be alleadged in this matter.</p>
            <p>First, the death of Liberalitie. Secondly, the ambition and disdaine of the plaine Countreyman, and the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly Seruingman. Thirdly and lastly, the decay of Hospitalitie, or good Housekeeping.</p>
            <p>Now for the fyrst, which is the death of Liberalitie, at whose Funeralles or Obsequies the Seruingman may be holden chiefe mourner: Of the yeere, and day, of his originall and beginnyng, I am altogeather vncertayne, vnlesse he tooke his beginnyng <hi>primo die et anno salutis,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21538:15"/>
in the first day and yeere of our sauiour Christ Iesus: whose loue and liberalitie to mankind, so farre surpassed all others, as I am sure he had eyther thence his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nig, or was then growen to his full perfection: but then, or whensoeuer he had his beginnyng (it is not greatly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall) since he is now almost buried in the bottomlesse pit of obliuion, he is sure now eyther altogeather dead, or els so aged, as he lyeth bedrid in some obscure place: Where he is surely I know not; but yf I were of that power to pay his ransome, and free him from captiuitie, or of that knowledge in the Phisicall science, as by mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stryng vnto him Potions I might mittigate his passions, I would endeuour with my whole power and skyll to procure his freedome and health, that I myght craue of him some acquaintance, for I much desire his friendshyp and familiaritie. But sure in my dayes he hath been such a stranger as I could neuer haue his acquaintance, no not know him from his ouerthwart neighbour Prodigalitie. I would fayne learne what is his countenance and habite, that yf I meete him, I may know him, and craue his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. Surely, I feare he walkes early in the mornyng, and then it is no maruell though I know him not, for my houre is eight a clocke, though it is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Rule, <hi>Sanat, sanctificat, et ditat, surgere mane:</hi> But yf I thought early rysing would preuayle in this quest, I would change my houre, and begone at foure: but I am almost past hope of his recouerie, since his two vtter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Prodigalitie and Couetousnesse, doth dayly pursue him with such deadly hatred. These are two extreames, and Liberalitie ameane betwixt them both, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a vertue: but <hi>Hercules ne contra duos,</hi> though his part was the meane to make the musicke the sweeter, yet it is accompted harsh harmonie where Liberalitie beareth a part: And why? because his two opposite ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hath banished him these (I may say) inhumane
<pb facs="tcp:21538:16"/>
coastes. Where he lyueth I know not; but sure I am, his exile, banyshment, death, or decay, hath brought this vtter ruine and ouerthrow to this profession, as further by the sequell hereof shall playnly appeare.</p>
            <p>I haue tolde you before, that Seruingmens onely mayntenance consisteth vpon Liberalitie, for their wages was neuer (in any age able to defray their necessarie char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and expences. But I would not haue you to m<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>scon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster my meanyng in this Liberalitie, that it was bestowed vpon them in meere commisseration, pittie, and charitie, as them of abilitie doe vpon impotent Beggers: but the Seruant by his duetie and diligence, did merite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it before he had it, though it was ouer and aboue his couenant and bargayne.</p>
            <p>And agayne, besides this good minde of the Maister to his owne Seruant, there was an other Liberalitie, as thus: If the Seruant were sent to his Maisters friende, or familiar, with a present or friendly remembrance, though he were not at that tyme prouided to requite his equall with the lyke gyft or present, yet he would shew his thankfulnesse towardes his Seruant, in liberally rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him for his paynes: And this kinde of Liberalitie is now very much decayed.</p>
            <p>There was also a Liberalitie allotted and belonging to the Seruingman, in this sort: If one Gentleman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited an other to his house, or that of curtesie and kindnes he came to see him, the Seruingmans duetie and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to do this his Maisters neighbour and friende ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and honour, though that was their Maisters pleasure and commaunde, yet in regarde of their extraordinarie paynes, some pence redounded to their profite: For a Gentleman in those dayes, thought it (as it is in deede) the greatest disgrace that coulde happen vnto him, to omit thankfulnes for kindnes receaued: But Couetousnesse doth now so much corrupt, as they eyther thinke it is
<pb facs="tcp:21538:16"/>
idely spent, or euyll bestowed that is geuen in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without care of their credit, or consideration why they should giue it, or els their memorie doth fayle them more then in former tyme it was wont: for sure I am, that they do either many times forget, or els are stacke in performance of this Gentlemanly gratitude &amp; liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>Est virtus vera nobintas, et liberalitas est virtus, ergo liberalitas est vera nobilitas:</hi> true it is, there are eyther few or none that are indued with wealth &amp; worldly blessings, but they couet to be comely couered with the handsome habite of their highest tytles, Nobilitie, or Worshyp, or els whatsoeuer: but whether on them these titles be rightly bestowed, or no, that I leaue to the censure and iudgement of their owne consciences. And yf that Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie be alwayes the companion of true Nobilitie, as it is in deede (for they are as neare ioyned togeather as Fayth and Good workes) Then, as <hi>S. Iames</hi> sayth, <hi>The good Tree will bring foorth good fruite</hi>: so the true Noble minde cannot be without his fruites, euen Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie it selfe will bud and planely appeare in the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this body.</p>
            <p>Is Liberalitie then a Uertue, and so neare a kinsman to the true Noble minde, as it is the very scuttion, creast, and badge thereof, so that if this Coate and Cognisance walke the streetes, the Maister thereby may easely be knowne? surely it is: but yf a Nobleman or Gentleman now adayes, could no otherwyse be knowne but by his Liberalitie, I feare mee, yf I should tread the Strand, I should often (for want of knowledge) vnduetifully iustle some of them, and scarse lende my Cappe, to whom a low legge should belong. For trust mee, I met (not long since) a Gentleman in Fleetestreete, whose lyuing is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter woorth then .2000. Markes yeerely, attended with onely one Man, whose apparrell was much better then his Maisters, though he was a Iustice of Peace is his
<pb facs="tcp:21538:17"/>
Countrey. But I speake not this, eyther to discommend the Gentlemans homely habite, or commende to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingman in his excesse: but the miserie of that minde, that regarded more Coyne then his credite.</p>
            <p>But me thinkes I heare one interrupt me, saying, If your sense of seeing be not besotted, you may easely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne a difference betwixt the Potentate and the Peasant, the Gentleman &amp; the meaner person: And yf your hart be not too hautie, you may render a reuerent regarde, &amp; due curtesie to whom in duetie it doth belong. For yf there were no other note nor difference to know the one from the other, a Gentleman from his inferiour, the Potentats costly apparrel, handsome habite, &amp; gorgious garmentes, doth alwayes easely bewray him; also his men and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantes (when he walketh abrode) doth shew what he is: for men of meaner estates do not vse to goe so garded, or walke so worthely attended. Wherefore, as I sayd before, easie it is, yf you be thereunto willing to lende Cappe or knee, or other duetie, to whom it shall rightly belong or appertayne.</p>
            <p>To this Obiection I answere thus: First, for appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, surely I thinke him some farr borne Countreyman, that thus obiecteth, where in his Countrey a Satten Doblet, nay yf it be but a Ueluet Gyrdle or Waste, is of as much power and force, as <hi>Boreas</hi> boysterous blastes in a wyndie day, or a long Staffe with a good arme, the one blowyng a mans Cappe from his head perforce, and the other teaching a man to make curtesie, being well layde on. For I say, in some places of England, let but a payre of Ueluet breeches make their apparance, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage so euer they retayne to, they shal haue moe Caps, and lowe Legges, then the Lord Maior of Applebie within his whole limit, precinct, or corporation. But yf he be such a cunning Lapidarie as can discerne cullours, and tell the nature and vertue of euery Stone by his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
<pb facs="tcp:21538:17"/>
appearance, then I woulde gladly (yf I myght make so bolde with him) craue his companie to walke Paules in a Terme tyme: and yf his shooes be not too neare worne, foote it downe to Westminster haull by land: in which perambulation, yf he can rightly discipher the nature of euery golde Lace, and the vertue of euery silke Stocking at the first blush, nay, after long perusing the same, yf he can shew me by their royall Roabes, and gorgious Garmentes, the Noble man, and Gentleman, from the Uerser, Setter, Cros biter, and Cunnie-catcher, then I will yeelde to his saying, and learne some of his cunning, that I may euer hereafter know my duetie the better, and spare my Cappe &amp; Legge from such mates of no merite, as many tymes I lende them vnto vnknowne. But surely I holde him in a great errour, that thinkes him selfe thus cunnyng, and no lesse able to performe this by his skill (I meane) to know euery estate by his habite, then the Alcumistes vnable by their Philosophers Stone, to make a metamorphosis of euery mettall, and turne all into Golde that they therewith touch.</p>
            <p>And whereas he alleadgeth, that the Seruingmen and attendantes do alwayes bewray the Nobleman and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman what he is, that I deny: for, <hi>fallet hec regula quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciescunque,</hi> I meete a Gentleman that may dispende yeere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his reuenues .2000. poundes of good and lawfull Englysh money, with onely one Boy at his heeles, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp Ludgate hill, and by that tyme I come to Paules middle walke, I shall see <hi>Sir Dauie Debet,</hi> with .vi. or .viii. tall fellowes attending him, whetting their kniues redie to dine with <hi>Duke Humfrie:</hi> but though they be sharpe set, they may take leasure enough, for there all lirching is barde by and maine. But yf their hard Commons were the worst, that might be mended with after noones bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for there is good Ale and Bread in <hi>Paules pettie Cannons:</hi> but there is a sore Giant, a Sargent I meane,
<pb facs="tcp:21538:18"/>
with whom they must wrastle, yf <hi>Pater noster Row</hi> be no better to them then <hi>Creede Lane</hi>: yf then sir Iohn Makeshift (whose last acre lyes morgaged to the mercie of sise sincke) hath many times .vi. or .viii. tall fellowes attending him, and an auncient Gentleman, that hath fayre landes, and great reuenues, whose onely studie is Arithmatique, and therein most practised in multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the goulden number, manneth him selfe with onely one Boy, How should it be possible to discerne this difference, and know the one from the other, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from the Swashbuckler, by his apparrel, attendants, and companie?</p>
            <p>But what is the reason, may some say, that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great worth and abilitie, doth walke nowadayes so slenderly attended? and a new vpstart Caueliro, whose Fathers chiefe Badge or Cognisance was the Weauers Shuttle, or the Taylors Sheares, will tread the streetes so stately attended, and so gallantly garded with a sort of seemely (yf so I may tearme them) and floryshing fayre Cloakes, as though he were the Prince of Peacockes, or Marques of some stately Moulhill? Mary euen this, The losse of Liberalitie in the one, and the power of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie in the other: for yf the Gentleman of high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde and esteeme, were not too studious in these two branches of the art of Arithmetique, Multiplication and the Goulden number: yf I say, Liberalitie, the badge and cognisaunce of true Nobilitie and worshyp, were not by his power &amp; authoritie committed to common Gaole, then would he, preferring worth before wayght, walke more worthely attended, garded gallantly with a sort of seemely Seruantes, alwayes well appoynted, aswell to shew his power, as to grace his person. And syr Henrie Hadland, yf he would well waygh and consider how many dayes, nay weekes, monethes, and yeeres, his father spent in sore toyle and trauayle, euery houre and moment,
<pb facs="tcp:21538:18"/>
day and nyght, carping &amp; caring, how of patches to make a weareable garment, and scrape some Crownes into his Coffers, whereby he, with his posteritie, might be more able to maynteine themselues in their trade and calling neighbourlike, would neuer so prodigally and carelesly spende, consume, and make hauocke in one Winter of that, which so many, yea and fruitefull Sommers before had yeelded. This prodigalitie procureth a double miserie, a miserable want in the ende to them that so carelesly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes their patrimonie, and meere miserie to the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Cormorant: for, sayth he, <hi>Felix quem socij nanim periisse procellis cum vidit, in tutum flectit sua carbasa portim,</hi> it is good to be rich, a man may be yoore when he will: So by the example of this prodigall person, he that hath wherwith to maynteyne himselfe in very Gentlemanlike sort, with men about him for his credite, being descended of an auncient house and worthy parentage, burieth in obliuion his state and dignitie, and becomming a very seruile slaue, and thraull, to this donghyll drosse, his golde and money, leadeth his lyfe in most miserable maner. Where is then this Liberalitie become, that hath been in former tyme so highly esteemed? Looke in the .vii. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> and there you shall finde a friendly perswasion, <hi>Be liberall vnto all men:</hi> much more then vnto your Seruantes &amp; Attendantes, meriting and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this your liberalitie. And in an other place of the same Chapter he sayth, <hi>You Maisters, restraine not your Seruants of their libertie, and be sure you leaue not your faythfull Seruant a poore man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O how many Gentlemen in these dayes doth respect this woorthy saying? or haue that care of their faythfull Seruants, that this place of Scripture doth commaund? sure they are few or none. The liberall Maister is a rare Phenix: so that the saying of <hi>Elias</hi> may well in these our dayes be verified, <hi>There is none, not one left in all
<pb facs="tcp:21538:19"/>
Israel, that feareth the Lord, and worketh righteousnes.</hi> Euen so it may be sayd, There is none, no not one, in this age, that beareth that loue in Liberalitie towardes his Seruantes, that he in goodwill ought, or they by duetie do dayly merite. But it may be sayd to mee, as the Lord sayd to <hi>Elias, I haue not onely seuen, but seuentie times seuen Seruantes in Israel, that hath not bowed their knees to Ball,</hi> though vnto <hi>Elias</hi> they were thought so small a number: Euen so, not onely seuen, but seuentie times seuen Gentlemen, in whom the ancient vertue, the badge and crest of true Nobilitie, euen Liberalitie it selfe, doth budde, blossome, and beare her accustomed fruite in due season, as in former ages.</p>
            <p>This number is since, by tract of tyme, much lessened and impayred: but howsoeuer, sure I am that Liberalitie, as I sayd before, is eyther quite dead, banyshed, or els playes least in sight, as Banckroutes, that walkes narrow lanes, or keepes them out of the Libertie, least they should sing the Counter tenor, or at Ludgate, For the Lords sake. But pittie it is, that Liberalitie that honest fellow should, dying, be buried without his rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, his funeralles and obsequies, to be duely solemnized. I feare me that none was so charitable as to ring his soule knell, or bestow on him a winding sheete. O that I had lyued when he dyed, or had been at the making of his Will, though I had been none of his Executors, nor had had any Legasie bestowed vpon mee, yet would I, at my owne charges, haue seene him honestly brought foorth to his long home (as the saying is:) but sure he died Intestate, and for heyres Apparent I think he had none, for since his death I neuer heard o<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Thus you haue heard, the death of Liberalitie to be one of the especiall occasions that hath wrought the vtter ouerthrow, ruine, &amp; subuertion of Seruingmens estate. Now for the ambition and disdayne of the Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Gentlemanly Seruingman.</p>
            <p>First for the Yeoman, or Husbandmans sonne, aspy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the Plough to the Parlor, I holde these the
<pb facs="tcp:21538:21"/>
contempt of his vocation, Feare, to hazard his life in his Princes Marciall affayres, and, the ambitious desire of dignitie, to be the especiall occasions that hath mooued him to change his habite and cullour, from Ierkin to Coate, and from Russet to Blew. In the first he imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates <hi>Icarus,</hi> who presuming vpon his Waxen winges, soared so high, as the heate of fierie <hi>Phaeton</hi> melted the winges of this vnfethered Foule, and so cast him fully as lowe as he had his beginning: euen so, this Yeomans Sonne prying into this easie and pleasaunt lyfe of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingmen, and considering the droyling he hath about his drudgerie, without consideration that he is called to this Countryes labour, or how farre he is vnfitte to execute the others office, not acquainted therewithall, taketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him this new trade of lyuing, in my iudgement as far vnable to execute the others office, as <hi>Icarus</hi> to soare in the highest heauens: but pittie it is that they are not as well punished for their aspyring mindes, as <hi>Icarus</hi> for his proude and presumptuous enterprise, <hi>Tempora mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur et nos mutamur in illis,</hi> when crooked olde age com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and they shaken off, as by their vnwildinesse not able to merite foure Markes and a Lyuerie, then they are faigne with heauie cheare <hi>retro spectare;</hi> and wisheth that eye had been blynde wherewith they fyrst pried into the floryshing profession of Seruingmen: floryshing I say, in their first age, but now by these and such like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions ruinated, and almost cleane withered.</p>
            <p>The seconde occasion that made Blew so deare, was this, These latter dayes are more dangerous and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some then former ages, so that many Kinges and Princes are euen occasioned to maynteine their right by force of Armes and Hostilitie. And now falling out so that an Armie must be leauied, to be imployed at home or abrode, for the defence of the Countrey, or offence to the enemie, Robin Russetcoate must of necessitie be one of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb facs="tcp:21538:21"/>
as good reason that all sortes shoulde be assistant to such seruice. Now his Father, loth to part from his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Sonne, will giue Markes and Poundes to redeeme him, and keepe him at home from doing his Prince and Countrey seruice. And yf he can by any fauoure, coyne, or kindnesse, blow ouer these boysterous blastes, and keepe his Sonne from being made deafe by the gunshot of great Ordinance: then he will seeke by all meanes possible to preuent a seconde feare, and makes haste to a Gentleman, or Iustice of peace, to whom when he commeth, he lendes moe Cappes and Legges, then a good Arithmetitian can almost in a long tyme number: then comes, I beseeche your Worshyp, and at euery worde a low legge: the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of whose petition may easily be surmysed. The Gentleman being of Seruantes sufficiently furnished, and hauing all his Offices full, loth to displace any, well consideryng how farre vnfit such a fellow is to be lapt in a Lyuerie, or harboured in the Haull, who wonted dayly to attende in the Oxe-parlor, shapeth him an answere: Friende, I can not pleasure you, I haue no place voyde that your Sonne canne supply. The seelie olde man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth home sad and sorowfull, not knowing how to preuent the next Alarum: but remembring the olde say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the popysh Priestes, that wont to make money of their Mattens, <hi>No pennie, no Pater noster,</hi> putteth in practise, by the oyle of Angels, to mollifie the hard hart of this Maiestrate: then comes he againe, I haue brought your worshyp a coople of fat Capons, Pigge, Goose, or Lambe; now good your Worshyp stande my good Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and take my Sonne into your seruice, I will appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell him at my owne charge, he shall aske nothing but meate, drinke, and a Lyuerie, with other necessaries I will maynteine him like a man. Now the Gentleman, calling to minde that hereby he might saue foure Markes and a Lyuerie, beside a preferment that his Man woulde
<pb facs="tcp:21538:22"/>
expect for his long and duetifull seruice, bethinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe one way or other, <hi>Nodum in serpo querere,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make benefite of this last motion: then he watcheth oportunitie, and euen for breaking a Bulrush, <hi>Facile cum inuenire baculum, ad cedendum Canem,</hi> Knaue packe out of my doores, I will keepe no such as thou art: with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande such lyke opprobrious liueries, neither befittyng a Gentleman to giue, nor a right Seruingman to receaue. But thus ridding his handes of one of his Seruantes that then most expected preferment, he giueth entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to syr Rowsand Russet-coates sonne, who restes no lesse glad of his place, then the Foule of a fayre day: But <hi>dulce bellum in expertis,</hi> If he considered what the want of fyre is in a Winter euening, he would rather with the Emmet laboure in Sommer, then with the Flye starue in Winter, though the Winter of Seruingmens yeeres was euer sufficiently prouided, as before I haue declared: but euery thing is worse for the wearing. Then th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s goodly Yeoman, thrusten into a Blew coate, holdeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a better Seruingman, then he that hath spent his whole tyme in that trade, though (simple swayne) he know not how to holde a Trencher.</p>
            <p>The thirde, and last occasion of this new enormitie, is the ambicious desire of dignitie: for in former ages (as before I haue sayd) when Seruingmen were had in good regarde, by dyuers occasions they were many tymes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preferred, as by their wit and will many of them often merited great matters: Some of them would cary them selues so soberly, discreetely, and wisely, as they came to great wealth, worth, and preferment by Mariage: some agayne, amongst the Potentates were so much esteemed, as they were thought worthy, &amp; in deede preferde to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices &amp; places of great credite: and many other meanes they had whereby they came to great promotion. Which wealth, worth, credite, and preferment, these vnciuill
<pb facs="tcp:21538:22"/>
sottes gape after, and surmise them selues worthyly to merite, though (God wot) many of them are as much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to keepe the Dogges out of the dyning Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as I vnable to expresse their insufficiencie.</p>
            <p>Now for the disdayne of the Gentlemanly Seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: You haue heard before what mettall the right Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingman was made off, of him selfe pure and right stuffe, not mixed with any dregges and drosse of lesse esteeme: But when this mixture of mingle-mangle begunne, and that he saw him selfe consorted with a crue of such cluster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fystes, he beganne to waxe weerie of his profession, euen loathing to lyue in fellowshyp with such vnseruiceable people, and disdayning the degree of a seru<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>le drudge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth eyther to cleare the suite of that Carde, or els to turne ouer a new leafe: but <hi>Herculei labores,</hi> it is as hard for him to thrust <hi>Pierce</hi> the Ploughman out of his Blew coate, as to tame the shrewysh tongue of a Kentysh-streete Scoulde; not in regard that the Gentlemen of this age are so delyghted with their clownish barbarisme, but that their mayntenance doth not so stretch the Purse-stringes of their Mai<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ters, as the mayntenance of the right Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingman: betwixt whose merites, there is much more difference, then in these our dayes betwixt their rewardes: for, foure Markes and a Lyuerie, is to them both as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as .vii. s. vi. d. for a flemysh Angell; nay, fourtie shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges a yeere keepeth a great sturre in many Houses, though it was ordinarie .400. yeeres since: but for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I will omit, tyll oportunitie be offered. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to returne to my purpose, I would fayne know whether the Iorneyman or Apprentice, the Workeman or the Labourer, be more worthy or better deseruing? If the Labourers wages be but .vi. d. a day, and the Maister workman can &amp; wil earne a shilling? So much, and more (in my iudgement) ought to be the difference betwixt a right Seruingman, &amp; a new vpstart Tom all-thummes:
<pb facs="tcp:21538:23"/>
For the one, <hi>A crepundiis,</hi> hath been trayned vp to his science: the other at .xx. yeeres setteth vp for him selfe. But it is maruayle they are not brought into the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, vsing other mens occupations, neuer seruing Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentishyp: Exchequer, nay, into the Towne-stockes, a fitter place: for the occupation is now a dayes so beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, as few, or none of them, is able to pay the fees to that Court belonging, neyther can Thenformer wring any powlyng pence out of any of their Purses. The olde saying is verified, <hi>There are so many of thoccupation, as one can not thriue for throng of his neighboures.</hi> Surely this doth proue, that <hi>in diebus illis,</hi> it was a good trade, otherwise so many would not haue left the Plough, to wayle in the Parlor. But euen as Ringtayles and Bussardes hoooueryng ouer the Partridge, spoyles the flyght of the Falcon, whose magnanimious minde daig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to stoope in the presence of these carion Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowes, but choseth rather to leaue the pray, and soare abroade, then to wagge her winges, or seeme any way conuersant amongst such coapesmates: euen so the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemanly Seruingman, whose lyfe and manners doth equall his birth and brynging vp, scorneth the societie of these sottes, or to place a Dysh, where they giue a Trencher.</p>
            <p>But amongst these vnfitting felowes for this fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I meane not to place all Yeomens sonnes, or others, that are not Gentlemen by birth, God forbid that I should do them all in generall so great wrong: for many there are that come to deserue the names of Gentlemen, and higher tytles, by Learning, and other their extraordinary good gyftes, whose Father could well content him selfe with the name of Goodman. &amp;c. Wherefore, such as haue eyther been brought vp in Learning, and so made fit for this Forme, or them that <hi>a purili etate</hi> haue been practisers of this science, I will make bolde to place amongst these
<pb facs="tcp:21538:23"/>
Gentlemanly Seruingmen: for <hi>Cicero</hi> sayth, <hi>It is more honoure and credite to be the first Gentleman of the name, then so to ende, as his posteritie cannot challenge for their inheritance that worthy tytle</hi>: And for my owne part, I thinke the Scholler (howsoeuer borne) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues alwayes the name of a Gentleman. Therefore filing these, as I sayd before, vpon the roule of right Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingmen, I will returne agayne where I left. What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience doth grow by this controuersie may easely be seene, knowne, and vnderstoode.</p>
            <p>First, for the aspyring minde of the Countreyman, that will needes be lapt in a Lyuerie, this mischiefe foloweth his madnesse, dearth, scarcitie, famine, and hunger: For I will prooue by good reason, that the Yeomans Sonne leauing his dayly labour (to which from his infancie he hath been trayned) and taking vpon him the degree of a Seruingman, breedeth as many inconueniences in the Commonwealth, as want of exercises begetteth diseases in a corpulent body: For the Yeomans sonne, as I sayd before, leauing gee, haygh, for Butlor some moe fayre Trenchers to the Table, bringeth these ensuing vleers amongst the members of this Common body. First, whereas he him selfe by the sweate of his browes and dayly hand labour, was able to digge yeerely from the wombe of the earth, so much belly timber, as was able to sustaine and satisfie the hungry mouthes of .vi.viii. or .x. of his Fathers familie, or neighbours neare dwelling, and so much backe prouision, as would hill, happe, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them in seemely sort, according to their Countreys callyng: This hand, that was so well imployed, <hi>Non sibi solum sed suis,</hi> now by change of his vocation, becomming idle, not any way gettyng meate for his owne mouth, the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eelie soules that were by his industrie before fully fedde, must of necessitie now perysh with famine, and starue for want of clothing, for that the meanes of their maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb facs="tcp:21538:24"/>
is now thus metamorphosed: for the hand of any man scorning his office to feede his mouth, the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of necessitie must perysh: euen so this body, this hand thus disdayning his duetie.</p>
            <p>Agayne, this is an other enormitie that hereof procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, This hand that maynteyned vi.viii. or .x. as I sayd before, ceasseth not only to do this good to his Countrey, but also in processe of tyme by changing his vocation, breedeth and begetteth a further mischiefe and inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the hurt and hinderance of the Common wealth, as after by circumstances I shall declare. For hauing thus altered his vocation, he must alter his habite, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, conditions, qualities, cogitations: and what not? he must as well as he can make satisfaction for the Queenes currant English before by him clipped, he must now make it full wayght, good and currant lawfull English: His habite must now be fashionate in proportion and cullour: Northeren Carsies not now weareable in Breetches, for it will shrinke, and the fashion is now to haue Uenetians of the largest sise: yf they will not holde a bushell a breetch, they are not saleable in Birtchen lane. For Kentish russet, it is no cullour, it will make no shew in a Countrey Church: But the best Broad-cloth, and newest coloure, must couer this late Countrey Courtier. His pase it must not be tother Legge totherway, and tother Legge totherway, as he was wont to throw them, when he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Cattle from Plough to Pasture, making Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures all along the ditches: But his gate and iesture of his body must be direct and vpright, treading as true as though he would tell what paces are in a Furlong. His curtesie with Cappe and Legge must be as his Apparrell of the newest fashion, with all other the rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies belonging to this new taken vp trade: no small tyme he spendes before he be in this an artist, and meane while, his senses are so besotted, as he quite forgetteth how to
<pb facs="tcp:21538:24"/>
holde the Plough, or whip the Carthorse: and for the cunning in this craft, not one amongst an hundred of them, euer in all his life time, attayneth to the knowledge of his duetie, for <hi>Ethiopcum lauare,</hi> is an endlesse laboure: euen so, to make a Foxe tayle a blowing Horne, or of a Countrey Clowne, a sufficient Seruingman: For, <hi>Quo semel est imbuta rec<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

duetie, what blunt fellow, how brutishly soeuer he hath been brought vp, but can and may learne quickly, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge so much as is here required:</p>
            <p>O foolysh obiection, and thrise sottysh surmise, no lesse simple, then meere simplicitie it selfe, not much vnlyke the Popysh Priestes of the olde Learnyng (as the say) which thought them selues worthy, nay, sufficient to discharge a place in the Ministerie, and take orders, yf they could say or sing by roate, or otherwyise, the olde <hi>Confitemini,</hi> or, <hi>Nunc dimittis seruum tuum domine,</hi> though they coulde better sing the whole Masse, then decline <hi>Dimittis:</hi> But as the olde verse is worthy notyng, and true in deede, that <hi>Qui bene can, bene con, bene le, presviter debet esse,</hi> and none els, no none ought to take vpon them that function, vnlesse they could reade well, sing well, and expounde well: So none ought (in my iudgement) to take vpon hym the degree of a Seruingman, vnlesse he be furnished with those qualities and partes that before I haue set downe belonging a Seruingman, and befitting his profession.</p>
            <p>And yf it be then requisite in a Seruingman, that he should be of wit, discretion, gouernment, and good bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp, fine, neate, nimble, and well qualited, to discharge those dueties, which before I haue set downe belonged him, and were required at his handes in the prime of his ordeyning, and for those qualities was so called to that place, as without them, nay, euery of them, he coulde not sufficiently discharge his duetie therein: how much would then the founders of this fraternitie haue frowned, to haue admitted one into this fellowshyp, that had wanted not onely one, but all these partes before mentioned, so requisite, and the full measure of them so much at his handes expected and required? would they, thinke you, haue been contented, to haue entertayned a man that could onely haue caried a Dysh, giuen a Trencher, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb facs="tcp:21538:25"/>
a Rapier after them? No, they did not onely require this to be done in decent and comely maner, which none, no not one of them which is obiected, fitte enough for this profession, can do as is required, but much more he must ouer and besides the qualities before in him required, be able to giue entertaynement to a stranger in decent and comely maner, delyuer a Message discreetely and wisely to a Potentate, Maiestrate, or meaner person, to talke and discourse with his Maister vpon forraine or domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call affayres, nay much more then I can expresse, for want of iudgement and experience herein: and if I were of knowledge sufficient, yet would my penne be weerie, before I should at large expresse the whole duetie to this profession belonging. But I will not take vpon me to teach others that, wherein I am my selfe but a learner, least it might be sayd vnto me (and not vndeseruedly) <hi>Turpe doctori cum culpa redarguit ipsum, You take vpon you to teach others their duetie, and cannot your selfe performe it.</hi> Therefore I will surceasse to wade any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into this Foorde, least I should be drowned in the deapth, or loose my selfe in this Laborinth. If then all these dueties, &amp; many moe be required in a Seruingman: How much then insufficient thinke you is the Yeomans sonne, that beginneth at .xx. to take vpon him this trade? Thus you haue heard what inconuenience doth grow by the aspyring minde of the Countreyman: Now what hurt doth happen to the Common-wealth, by the disdayne of the Gentlemanly Seruingman, a worde or two, and so an ende of this part.</p>
            <p>You haue heard before from whence this Seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was descended, of auncient and worthy Parentage, yet his mayntenance not altogeather correspondent: and the causes why he was no better by his Parentes proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, are before at large expressed: his mayntenance I say was but some annuall portion, and that after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceasse
<pb facs="tcp:21538:26"/>
of his Parentes, which without some other helpe, was no way able to maynteine him Gentlemanlike, and therefore called to this profession, for the better suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng of him according to his estate, without charging of his friendes further then his Fathers Legasie, his estate, birth, calling, &amp; credite, no way thereby blotted, blemished, stayned, impayred, or impeached, but much bettered for wealth and worth: in worth, in regarde he was fellow to no inferiour: and in wealth, because he kept his owne, and often increased his tallent by his diligence and desart. But now being forced to consort him selfe with men of lesse merite, and that they shall equall him in esteeme, and better him in rewarde, I meane, they comming in the after noone at foure a clocke into the Uineyarde, shall haue their hire for the whole day, in as full or larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, then he that hath endeuoured himselfe <hi>Manibus pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busque, with tooth and nayle,</hi> that is, euen to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of his power from .vi. in the mornyng, to the last houre, truely to earne his whole dayes wages, beginneth much to disdayne this drudgerie, and so leaueth the Uine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde wholly to these vnskilfull workemen, and loytering labourers: And now being not as before set aworke, but missyng that part of his mayntenance before mentioned, which he got in seruice, How do you thinke he can carie himselfe <hi>in statu quo prius?</hi> no, it cannot be without some extraordinarie meanes: Eyther he must be more charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his friendes then his Father willed him, or els procure his mayntenance by some worse meanes then will stande with his birth or credite. What neede I glose vpon the text, or seeme to daunce masked in a Nette? trueth it is, he must lyue, and he will lyue. How? lyke a Man? yea, and lyke a Gentleman. What, and want ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing? that is no matter, he wil liue by his Wittes. What, by the art of Alcumistrie, to metamorphis other Mettall into Money? or by conueying the Indies into Englande,
<pb facs="tcp:21538:26"/>
or Englande into the Indies? No, no, Pewter, Brasse, nor Tinne, we can not spare, to turne into Golde or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: and for the Indies to come into England, we haue no roome, vnlesse he can commaunde the Sea to giue it place, which doth on euery side so rounde immure vs, and I am sure it loues vs too well, to leaue vs vndefenced: What restes then? He can not, as Christ did, worke myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to turne Water into Wine; but he can do this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, by a writ of Remoue he can displace Money, or Golde, finding it vnseemely seated, and place it higher or lower, as he findes it worthy: and yf the sight of it be too garysh, and offende his eyes, he can do this myracle, he can turne it into Wine, which shalbe more pleasant to his taste, then was the sight to his eye: and after all, turne the Wine into Water, to shew his power and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence ouer it, and how smally he esteemes this worldly drosse and pelfe. But what Court this Writ of Remoue comes from, or whether it be <hi>ex officio</hi> or no, there is the question, but that doubt I leaue for men of more iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to discide: yet notwithstanding, thus much I wyll say, that yf the breaking, transgressing, and violating, of good Lawes and Statutes in a Common wealth, for the publique weale established, be offensiue, dangerous, and hurtfull to the state of the sayd weale publique, then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this disdayne that I haue hitherto spoken off, must of necessitie ingender many diseases in this common body, to his great hurt and hinderance.</p>
            <p>Much more surely I could haue said in discribing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly the inconueniences herof proceeding, but loth I am to protract time with friuolous phrases, &amp; seeme too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in a matter so apparant. Wherfore gentle Reader, you see how dangerous is this disdayne, &amp; how hurtfull to the Common wealth, &amp; beare with me I beseech you, in that I passe it ouer so slightly, for, <hi>Quod sub inteligiter non deest,</hi> that that is behinde I leaue to your good consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21538:27"/>But me thinkes I heare you say, You haue made a long discourse of this ambition and disdayne, what mischiefe and inconuenience doth thereof proceede to the Common wealth, and to all in generall: but, what hurt or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth thereof grow in particuler, to the state and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Seruingmen in this age, that you leaue alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather vntouched, which (as I take it) shoulde be the summe of your Treatise. I answere no, I haue in some sort handled it already: but yf I haue not therein satisfied your expectations to the full, I will briefely giue you a note or two moe, and so an ende of this part.</p>
            <p>For the Countreyman that will needes eleuate his voyce a note aboue <hi>Ela,</hi> that will with <hi>Icarus</hi> haue waxen Winges to flie aloft, because Fethers be to lyght in a boysterous winde: this felow I say, that imagines he can sing Pricksong at the first sight, before he can say his <hi>Gammoth,</hi> when he steppes in to play his pryses, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth all his partes, to see yf he haue any thing in him so to commende him, as thereby to gayne the good lyking of his new Maister. But finding in himselfe nothing worthy esteeme, and that his partes and gyftes cannot deserue nor gayne him that he expectes at his Maisters handes, he turneth ouer a new leafe, and seekes by sinister meanes to effect that, which otherwyse he could not by any good meanes bring to passe. Then he beginneth, like a Politician, to enter into consideration of his Maisters humor; and yf he be prodigall, he preacheth of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlyke liberalitie: yf couetous and worldly, then he turneth his copie, and prattles of sparing, he telles him he keepes too many idle fellowes, his Butterie is too open, and his fare too costly, lesse would serue and as well satisfie: with a thousande such lyke tales he tyreth his Maisters eares: which needeth not, for they are subiect enough to heare now adayes such pratlyng Parasites, especially talking of profite or sparing. And yf his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb facs="tcp:21538:27"/>
lende him hearing, and seeme to allow of his talke, then he ceasseth not to inuent and inuaigh against his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, hoping thereby to creepe into sole credite with his Maister, and to lyft them out that are men of much more merite, and better desart: but all this his practise and pratling, is not with sinceere affection to preferre his Maisters profite, but thereby to grope for some gayne to himselfe. For <hi>Pettie</hi> in his ciuill conuersation, sayth: <hi>That marke when you will, yf any seeke to come vp or benefite them selues, they seeke by briberie, flatterie, and such other sinister meanes, yf they want the gyftes of Nature and nurture to the same to commende them.</hi> Now yf this new vpstart tradesman preuayle in his practise, it makes the Maister slenderly regarde his olde Seruantes, it makes him agayne smally, or not at all, rewarde them for their long seruice, and good desartes; it cutteth them short of their wonted allowance, as well for fare and dyet, as for their libertie: which mayning of their mayntenance, and laming their libertie, makes their lyues so myserable, their profession so contemptible, and their manners so mutable, as not being able (as before) to play the good fellowes, they fall into some desperate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, or some malecontent melancholyke, cursing the houre of their creation, the day of their natiuitie, the place of their education, and the tyme wherein they tooke vpon them this their profession, wyshing they had been brought vp otherwyse, though it had been to the greatest and most seruile bodyly laboure: For, <hi>Who is so wobegon, as first a man, and then none?</hi> And thus much for the ambitious minde of the Countreyman.</p>
            <p>Now for the disdaine of the right Seruingman, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe thus agreeued, and his disease incurable, without change of ayre, leaueth his place and profession, and retyreth him selfe into some solitarie desart, where I will leaue him to the mercie of his malecontent humors.
<pb facs="tcp:21538:28"/>
Now he being thus banished as an exile, steppes into his place some mate of lesse merite, which hauing no partes to commende him, nor gyftes to deserue gaynes, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth very officious and diligent, willing to droyle and drudge in any seruile sort, so as he may get meate to his belly, and clothes to his backe, without respect of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of his place, his present gayne, or his future prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and when an other of better partes commeth to supply that place, hauing a care of his credite, and respect to his preferment, his Maister will regarde him no more then the other, neither in wages nor rewarde: so that this kinde of seruice by this meanes, becomes a very seruile seruitude. What might further hereof be discoursed I will omit, since I must touch it more at large in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell of this treatise, and therefore thus much shall suffice concernyng this ambition and disdayne.</p>
            <p>Now foloweth the last part of this Tractate, wherein I will shew (God willing) into what vtter ruine, downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall, decay, and meere miserie, this state of Seruingmen is fallen, by the decay of Hospitalitie and Good-house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping. It were a trauell too tedious to shew <hi>a capite, ad calc<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>m,</hi> all the causes that brought this bane and bayle to the Butterie and Bordes ende, which both being fallen into a consumption, a curelesse disease, there restes no Phisicke helpes to recouer their decaying members. Wherefore I will omit the originall, from whence their maladie proceedes, and onely speake of the hurt and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunce that thereof ensueth to the trafiquers in this trade, and ministers of this misterie.</p>
            <p>Now trueth it is, <hi>in diebus illis,</hi> in former ages, that Potentates and Gentlemen of worth, spent their whole Rentes and Reuenues in Hospitalitie and good House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping (Skot and Lot onely excepted) making euen at the yeeres ende, neuer trubling them selues with the art of Arithmetique, to adde or substract: they wayed no
<pb facs="tcp:21538:28"/>
wealth, but helde Coyne in vtter contempt, not vouchsaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to touch, handle, or dispose of it, that care they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the consideration of their Seruantes, strictly obseruing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund of wise <hi>Cato, Dilige denarium sed perce dilige formam.</hi> It was rare to see any of them sell, or purchase, or finde more Coyne in their Coffers then would defray necessary charges. O how meryly they lyued, and what pleasure they tooke to see the gunshot of good stomackes come batter the great Chines of their staulled Beefe. To compare the pleasures of their golden dayes, when Golde was so smally regarded, with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie of this latter, nay last age, were able in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to wring teares out of the eyes of Adamant. There was no violating of Fayth, nor breach of promyse, no hatred nor mallice, no cunning nor Cunnie-catching, no swearing nor forswearing, no feare of fraude, nor mistrust of friendshyp, no symonie, no briberie, no flatterie, no vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, no deceyte in bargaynyng, no false witnesse bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng, no cruell murderyng, no craftie conspyring, nor any fraudulent dealing. And why? Because Golde, the authour of all this vngodlynes, was not regarded. Why is promyse not performed? Mallice so manifest? Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Cunny-catching so common? Swearing and forswearing so vsuall? Symonie, Briberie, Flatterie, and all villanie, so dayly practised? What is the ende of deceyte in bargayning? Why doth the wicked beare false witnesse? the murderer kill cruelly? the craftie conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour imagine his mischiefe? and the fraudulent dealer deceyue his neighboure? euen Siluer and Golde, Money is the marke whereat they all shoote, the Maister whom they all obey, the Mine wherein they all digge, and the Man to whom they all do reuerence. It is Money they minde, Golde they grope after, and Gayne they groane for: Money I say, Money is the cause of al this mischiefe and miserie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21538:29"/>But it may be obiected, How can Money be the cause of all this mischiefe and miserie? It neither commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nor forbiddeth, procureth nor disswadeth, flattereth nor frowneth, compelleth nor denyeth, furdereth nor hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, any man to commit any offence, villanie, or kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie; it is a dead mettall, and no lyuing creature, that with fayre wordes, amiable countenance, or faythfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myses, it might intice, allure, or perswade any man to do any thing contrary to his owne intended meaning or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Trueth it is, the Mettall of it selfe cannot be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either good or hurtfull: for let it lie, it will neither stop your passage, nor hinder your iourney, it will not braue vpon you, nor vrge you to any inconuenience, take it and vse it with discretion, it will not be your foe, but your friende: But come to abuse it, it wyll beare no coales, it wyll not take any wrong at your handes, it is pure and fined Mettall, and cannot indure to be mixted with dregges and drosse of lesse esteeme: I say, it cannot indure to be vsed otherwyse then as it is, and to that ende it was ordeyned. It is not the Mettall of it selfe, as I sayd before, that is eyther good or hurtfull, but the vse or abuse of it worketh in it either of the foresayd effectes. For marke from the beginning, whom you haue seene to abuse it, I meane, to desire or procure it, contrary to law, equitie, and conscience (for that is the abuse of it) and it hath not quit him or his their meede, as the saying is, euen rewarded him according to his desartes.</p>
            <p>Did not <hi>Iudas</hi> that false traytor, euen for the couetous desire of Coyne, betray his owne maister our sauiour Christ into the handes of the <hi>Iewes?</hi> but what was his guerden and rewarde? How long did he possesse this boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by this his inhumane practise obteyned? Did he not immediately goe foorth, and cursing the houre of his creation, the time of his birth, the wombe that bore him, and the pappes that gaue him sucke, and so in this despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb facs="tcp:21538:29"/>
humor hanged himselfe? Infinite are the number of them against whom this definite sentence of death, or other danger hath been adiudged, onely for abusing these pure and refined earthly commaunders, Golde and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
            <p>You haue now proued, may some say, that the wrong vse of worldly treasure breedeth many diseases in this humane societie: But what particuler hurt hereof ensueth to Hospitalitie, which is the matter you haue now in hand, you omit. Not so my very good friendes, but haue pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a while, and I will pay you the vttermost farthing.</p>
            <p>I haue tolde you before, in what small esteeme men of worth in former ages helde this worldlinges God, nay, they were so afrayde to discontent or abuse it, that they would neither make nor meddle with it, but by substitutes and deputies, wich the helpe of it procured to them selues all worldly necessaries, which was the totall of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. But the Deuill (in my iudgement) the authour, roote, and originall of all mischiefe and miserie, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into this mettall some peece of Adamant, and into mans desire and affection some lumpe of Iron: which Adamant, according to his nature, drawing the Iron vnto it, linketh them selues togeather in vndesolueable bondes of earthly perpetuitie during this worldly pilgrimage: not much vnlyke the Castle of Adamant, feigned in the historie of <hi>Hughon</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> which Castle hauing drawne the sayd <hi>Hughon</hi> vnto it, all hope of departure thence was quite extinguished, onely except he coulde es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape and be thence delyuered by an extraordinarie and imminent danger: which was, to be caried ouer the Sea in the clawes of a Griffine, whose desire was to deuoure him, and that was one danger: and in great hazard in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of his wayght to fall from the sayd Griffine into the Ocean and so be drowned, and that was an other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: which dangers, as they were great and perilous, so
<pb facs="tcp:21538:30"/>
I holde their perils no lesse dangerous, and as hard for them to be seperated and deliuered from this pernitious Adamant Castle, that hath linked and chamed themselues vnto it by their extraordinarie couetouse desire of this worldly Mammon. Now this affectionate desire of this hase Bulloigne, hauing linked and chayned the hartes of great ones vnto it, such as in former ages were wont to maynteine Hospitalitie, and Good-house-keeping in the highest degree, in such a selfe blinded bond of assurance, as they fall into consideration and warie waighing of all the surplussage to that charge belonging: so lessening, pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, deminishyng, deuiding, and substracting of it, as they may almost be ashamed of the remayne, it is dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen into so narrow a roome: nay, yf they holde on (as God wot they haue done too long) their substractes I feare mee wilbe, Take nothing out of nothing, and there remaynes nothing. I aduise you goe not fasting to such a house, for there you may as soone breake your necke as your fast. O miserable and strange language, and not so strange as true: Where are the great Chines of staulled Beefe? the great blacke Iackes of doble Beere? the long Haull tables fully furnished with good victuals? and the multitude of good fellowes assembling to the houses of Potentates and men of worth? In a worde, they are all banyshed with the spirit of the Butterie, they are as rare in this age, as common in former tymes, These Potentates and Gentlemen, as I sayd before, haue begun in this maner to lessen their charge: fyrst, for their three yeeres staulled Beefe, it was too fatte, and triple charge, one yeere, nay lesse will serue to fatte a Bullocke, the meate much sweeter, and the charge much lesse, and so for other victualles of that kinde. Now for Beefe, Mutton, Ueale, Pigge, Goose, and Capon, which was the substaunce of their prouision in those dayes, wherewith their Tables were dayly furnished, so that
<pb facs="tcp:21538:30"/>
there was good cheere with plentie for them that sate, good reuertions for them that wayted, and great reliefe for the poore amongst those full platters. Now these bountifull and substantiall dyshes are changed into cates of lesse cost, though dyshes of rarer deuice. Now there must be Goose-giblets, Pigs-petitoes, and so many other boyled meates, forced meates, and made dyshes, as wyll supply the roome of the substantiall accustomed full platters, to furnysh the Table, though they be but as siphers in Augrime, to supply the number. Allow not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, that this kinde of seruice doth satisfie and content them that are serued, yet what shall answere the hungrie appetites of the attendantes that hath long fasted in hope of this reuertion? Euen the remayne of these cold boyled meates, and made dyshes, must satisfie their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie appetites, which may wel be called colde Commons: but after this latter dinner is ended, small are the broken meates that remayne to relieue the poore. Nay further concerning their fare, they (like good Phisitians) consider that change of choyce dyshes and seuerall meates at one time may breede a surfet, and all superstuitie bringeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, and therefore they will draw their multitude of dyshes into a lesse number, and content them selues onely with two or three dyshes at the most, with Fruite and Cheese after, to supply, yf neede require. Now, yf they haue but two or three dyshes, What should they neede so many Attendantes? So wanting seruice wherein to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them, there they cut off an other charge: this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foordes them a doble benefite, it cuts off the charge of Men, and many Dyshes. But yet there remaynes one seruice, wherein they must imploy moe Men then the tables attendance requireth, that is, yf their Mistres ryde abrode, she must haue .vi. or .viii. Seruingmen to attende her, she must haue one to carrie her Cloake and Hood, least it raine, an other her Fanne, if she vse it not her selfe,
<pb facs="tcp:21538:31"/>
an other her Boxe with Ruffes and other necessaries, an other behinde whom her Mayde or Gentlewoman must ryde, and some must be loose to open Gates, and supply other seruices that may be occasioned. Now to deminish and cut of this charge, aswell of Horse as Men, there is now a new inuention, and that is, she must haue a Coach, wherein she, with her Gentlewomen, Mayde, and Chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and what necessaries as they or any of them are to vse, may be caryed and conueyed with smaller charge, lesse cost, and more credite, as it is accompted: for one or two Men at the most, besides the Coach-man, are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for a Gentlewoman or Lady of worthy parentage. Now at Boord and abrode, yf so few Seruantes may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, and supply all the seruice that herein can be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all the rest sure are <hi>su<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now it should seeme (in my iudgement) that the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senyng and diminishyng of this consort of companions, should better their estate and callyng: for the fewer that a Gentleman hath attending him, the better he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them, being as able in worldly possessions as his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, which maynteyned many moe: But it falles out contrarie, for their seruice was neuer so smally regarded and rewarded as now; and yet the number of them neuer so small.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman (I know) will thus answere for him selfe, that he is neither able to do so much for his men, nor to maynteine his port &amp; hospitalitie in so bountifull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as h<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Now his lyuing is not greater then was his ancestors, nor any Acre by tract of tyme enlarged: yf the charge therefore grow thus doble burdenous, by reason of the deerenes of all kinde of prouision to that house keeping belonging, and his mayntenance not any way augmented, How is it possible for him to maynteine himselfe <hi>in statu quo prius?</hi> Now Farmours speake for your selues, for I holde you sufficient (though not learned) to answere this question, and discide this doubt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Trust me, I holde this excessiue costly Apparrell, a great cause why Gentlemen cannot maynteyne their wonted and accustomed bountie and liberalitie in Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie &amp; House-keeping: for when as the Mercers booke shall come, <hi>Item</hi> for so many yardes of Cloth of Golde, of Siluer, Ueluet, Sattin, Taffata, or such lyke ware: the Goldsmithes <hi>Debet,</hi> for Chaynes, Ringes, Iewels, Pearles, and precious Stones: the Taylors Bill, so much for such a Sute of laced Satten, and such lyke su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous charges, amounting in one yeere to more then the reuenues of his Landes, the charge of House-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other necessaries vndefrayde, How can he then chose but eyther make others Gentlemen by possessing his Inheritaunce, or els betake him to London, or some other Sanctuarie, where he may lyue priuate so many yeeres, as he is runne ouershooes, that debtes thereby may be payde, and defectes supplyed. Which tyme thus
<pb facs="tcp:21538:32"/>
spent in this priuate lyfe, is so euyll bestowed, as he can not make any accompt thereof to God, his Prince, or his Countrey, to whom he with his lands, liuing, possession, and worldly patrimonie, is bound in seuerall dueties: for there is none but knoweth, that at their handes that hath much, much shalbe required.</p>
            <p>If a Gentleman haue a competent lyuing, that wyll maynteine good Hospitalitie (which is, as I sayd before, the harbourer of two hopes, Prayse and Prayers) and him selfe like a Gentleman, yf he will not exceede his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, al other superfluous charge layde a part, wyl bestow vpon his owne or his wiues backe in brauerie of apparrel halfe a yeere of his house-keepinges charge, the other halfe yeere must of necessitie be maymed, pinched, and impayred, to the great hurt and hinderaunce of that duetie which he is bound to performe by neighbourhood to his Countrey, and by charitie to his poore brother.</p>
            <p>Concerning this costly and fashionate Apparrel, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a notable example of a King of England (as it is sayd) that calling, vpon occasion, certayne of his Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Peeres of his Realme to the Court, whyther when they came, one amongst the rest came very homely apparreled, in a Ierken of Frieze, and a payre of bretches of Countreys Russet, and al his other apparrel correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; his trayne and attendantes were a hundred or sixe score proper and personable men, all well Horsed, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly furnished at all poyntes: this Noble-man thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, came to the Court, and doing his duetie to his Prince and Soueraigne, the King sayd vnto him: My Lord, I cannot but commende your troupe and trayne so well furnished, and your selfe so worthyly attended: but your owne person to be apparrelled in so base and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely a suite, I cannot but highly discommende, for that it befitteth not a man of your estate, degree, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but alwayes to be apparrelled in costly, comely, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
<pb facs="tcp:21538:33"/>
and handsome habite. Well my Leige and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, answered the Noble-man, What as is amisse, shalbe amended (God willing.) So going from the Court to his lodging, he sene presently his man to buy hym a rich Gowne of blacke Ueluet, the sleeues thereof all beset with Aglets of Golde, a Ueluet Cappe, with a Fether and a golde Bande, very richly bordered about with Pearles and precious Stones of great value, a suite of Cloth-of-golde of the newest and richest fashion, his Gyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and Hangers richly imbrodred and beset with costly Pearle, with all other his apparrell no lesse stately and costly. Thus richly furnished, attended with onely one Man and a Page, he makes his repayre the next morning to the Court agayne, where when he had done his duetie to the King: Yea mary my Lord, sayd the King, you are now like your selfe, and as you should be: but where is your goodly trayne of Men and Horse, wherewith you were yesterday so gallantly garded? If it may like your Grace, answered the good Earle, throwing downe his Cappe, Heere is twentie Men and twentie Horse: and throwing off his Gowne, sayes, Heere lyes fourtie Men and fourtie Horse more, with other the rest of his sumptuous Rayment at the lyke rate, saying, that all his Men and Horses, were turned into gorgious Garments. Now sayth he, yf it like your Maiestie that I shoulde maynteine my selfe in these Royall Roabes to do your Grace seruice, onely garded with my Man and my Page, or that I should maynteine my troupe of Horse and Men, to do your Maistie seruice at home, or abrode against your Graces forraine foes, or domesticall Rebels (yf any such shalbe) in my homely habite: Whether of these, as it shall please your Grace to commaunde me, I am redie to obey: but my liuing is not able to perfourme them both. Now what answere he receyued from the King I know not, but if both could not be perfourmed, then I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb facs="tcp:21538:33"/>
my selfe that none is so simple, but will preferre the Men and Horse, before the gorgious Garmentes, both for the honour of the King, the credite of the Maister, the sauegarde of the Countrey, the common good for the weale publique, and in all other respectes whatsoeuer: But <hi>Totnam</hi> is turned French, these Men and Horse are metamorphosed into Golden Garmentes, which makes Seruingmen, yea and Men, so litle set by, and so smally regarded: wherfore they may wel both say &amp; sing,

            <p>Thus you haue heard, that the number of this professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by this decay of Hospitalitie, is greatly lessened and diminished, and so consequently the state of the remaine impayred: for what trade or occupation is best, there are commonly of the same most professors. But I will speake
<pb facs="tcp:21538:34"/>
a worde or two of the perticuler inconueniences that hath happened to this, at the first happie, but by tract of time, thrise vnfortunate fraternitie: hereby I meane by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of good House-keeping.</p>
            <p>First, whereas their pleasures were equall with their Maisters, and their Maisters tooke pleasure commonly in honest sportes: now these their Maisters sportes and pastimes, are either turned into couetousnesse, groping after worldly graith, or els into riotous spending their Patrimonie in gay Cloathes, lasciuious lewdnes, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie gaming, or such like; the godly meane, which is the heauenly harmonie, is now banished these (I may say) inhumane coastes, and cannot be harboured in any of our Hauens. Now the Seruingmans pleasure, is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to seruile toyle, and droyling drudgerie, for since he hath no fellowes but that are dayly and hourely imployed: and how? not in pleasure, as before, in haulking, hunting, fyshing, and fowling, but in other businesse, he himselfe alwayes riding and running about worldly busines, or otherwise, as it shall please his Maister to appoynt: but I cannot, nor will not maynteine argument against this, for, <hi>Otium est radix omnium malorum, Idlenesse is the roote of all mischiefe.</hi> And if Seruingmen should do no other seruice but as they were wont, and tie them selues to their ancient custome, then they should be altogeather idle, because former imployment is taken away. But it may be obiected, You tolde vs what maruels Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingmen merited at their Maisters handes in former ages: and why are not their desartes so well gratified in these latter dayes, as before? Marie for many respectes, yet principally for two. First, they are for the most part, though not all, of a baser mettall then they were wont to be, and therefore the kinde vsage, and friendly familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie that in former ages did linke the Maister and the Seruant togeather, is now on the Maisters behalfe had
<pb facs="tcp:21538:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in vtter contempt and disdaine, in regard of their homely, rusticke, and vngentlemanlike bringing vp: which they regarde as it is, and rewarde onely with bare wages. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenauntes they keepe and perfourme, as Artificers do with their Apprentises, &amp; Workemen with their Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; but preferment ouer and aboue they get none: And why? Because their singularitie in any of their seruices, is no such as can merite or deserue any thing aboue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. Neither doth Maisters now adayes take any such pleasure in the qualities of their Men, as he can affoorde them a Farme for their feates, or a yeerely Annuitie for their skill in any of the seuen liberall Sciences. Beleeue me, I speake as I thinke, If the wisedome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the strength of <hi>Sampson,</hi> the beawtie of <hi>Absolon,</hi> the prowes of <hi>Hercules,</hi> the eloquence of <hi>Cicero,</hi> the profound learning of wise <hi>Plato,</hi> and all the excellentest partes that can be named, were all comprehended in one man, and the same man would shroude him selfe in the habite of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingman, and professe the same by taking foure Markes a yeere wages and a Liuerie, I verily beleeue his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be rather a Remuneration, then a Guerdon, if he get any in this Leaden and last age. But what is the difference betwixt the Remuneration and the Guerdon, may some say, we would faine know? otherwise we can not tell how you meane this well qualited Seruingmans desartes should be rewarded. Your question is reasonable, and therefore I will distinguish them as their difference was tolde me, not long since by a friende of mine.</p>
            <p>There was, sayth he, a man (but of what estate, degree, or calling, I will not name, least thereby I might incurre displeasure of any) that comming to his friendes house, who was a Gentleman of good reckoning, and being there kindly entertayned, and well vsed, as well of his friende the Gentleman, as of his Seruantes: one of the sayd Seruantes doing him some extraordinarie pleasure du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:21538:35"/>
his abode there; at his departure he comes vnto the sayd Seruant, and saith vnto him, Holde thee, heere is a remuneration for thy paynes, which the Seruant recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, gaue him vtterly for it (besides his paynes) thankes, for it was but a Three-farthinges peere: and I holde thankes for the same a small price, howsoeuer the market goes. Now an other comming to the sayd Gentlemans house, it was the foresayd Seruants good hap to be neare him at his going away, who calling the Seruant vnto him, sayd, Holde thee, heere is a Guerdon for thy defartes: Now the Seruant payde no d<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ere<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> for the Guerdon then he did for the Remuneration, though the Guerdon was xi. d. farthing better, for it was a Shilling, and the other but a Three-farthinges. Therefore, I say as I sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the man of best qualitie in these dayes, if he be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingman by profession, shalbe as slenderly rewarded for his seruice, as the mome of no merite, that hath no partes at all in him worthy commendation.</p>
            <p>Now for the other reason, why Seruingmens desartes are not rewarded in these dayes, as they were wont in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages: It is, because Gentlemen nowadayes haue more vse of their Land &amp; Liuing, their Kine and Coyne, their Rentes and Reuenues, their Siluer and Golde, and all other their worldly Treasure, then they were wont to haue: for in times before they had so much (many of them) as they bestowed Landes, Liuinges, Rentes, and Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, vaynely and ceremoniously vpon Friers, Monkes, Abbots, Cannons, and pelting popysh Priestes: And to what ende? Euen that they, and their <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rue, might pray that their soules might passe Purgatorie with lesse pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance then they would willingly endure. But now they finde other vse for it, then either to bestow it vpon such momysh Massmongers, or any of it vpon them that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deserue it, their owne Men.</p>
            <p>What say they, yf a Seruingman for long and dueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:21538:35"/>
seruice, request the Lease of a Farme at the olde rent, or some other preferment? Was my Liuing left me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow vpon my Men? or, to deuide amongst my Children? Why do I giue you wages, but in regarde of your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? If you like not me nor my wages, you may prouide for your selfe when you will, I will not be your hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce; not waighing and considering, that that his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is not able to finde his Man necessaries from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle downe: but I dare not speake what I thinke, neither what might be spoken, concerning wages in these dayes. But why is the Gentleman so peremptorie and resolute at his Mans reasonable request? Mary, because he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth where to haue a Man fitter for his purpose, that will stande him in lesse charge; and therefore Seruingmen are not rewarded as they were wont, because Gentlemen nowadayes cannot spare any preferment to bestow vpon them. But what is this fellow that is fitter for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? and will stande him in lesse charge, expecting no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment at all at his handes, no not so much commonly as Wages? It is (as I sayd before) his neighbours Sonne, who will not onely maynteine him selfe with all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but also his father will gratifie his Maisters kindnes at Christmas with a New-yeeres gyft, and at other Festiuall times with Pigge, Goose, Capon, or other such like householde prouision. And why will the good olde Yeoman be at all this charge, since his sonne woulde otherwise earne him much more profite, and do him much more pleasure? Why? Marie, because his Sonne shalbe sure to keepe the Catte from the Tonges at home, when other his neighbours children shall trudge into Fraunce, Flaunders, and other Nations, to do their Prince and Countrey seruice. But if it woulde please God of his goodnesse, to sende vs peace and quietnesse, that our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soueraigne (whom God preserue long amongst vs, to his blessed will and pleasure) should haue no vse of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb facs="tcp:21538:36"/>
prouision at home nor abrode, and consequently the Yeoman no vse of this the Gentlemans goodwill and pleasure, you should see these new vpstart Seruingmen flocke to their olde haunt, as the Emmets in the beginning of Sommer do congregate them selues togeather, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour while Sommer lastes, for feare of Winters penury.</p>
            <p>Now if this Man, I say (as I sayd before) my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours sonne, can at one and twentie, or two and twentie yeeres supply the place of a Seruingman, and discharge that duetie as well as he that hath been trayned vp in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice from his childhood, and will take vpon him that trade, without expecting either present gayne, or future preferment for his seruice at his Maisters handes: what neede then the Gentleman giue wages and preferment to a Seruingman, yf he may haue these of so free cost? But I say it is pittie that God hath lent that man his fiue Senses, and all other his bodyly members that belonges to the sufficient furnishyng of a whole man, that bestowes his talent so euil, &amp; so slouthfully labours in his vocation, as he cannot with all his indeuours get meate to his belly, nor clothes to his backe, as these do that bestowes euen the best time of all their yeeres in the seruice of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. But this decay of Hospitalitie, hath bred a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mischiefe amongst Seruingmen then this: For now euery Gentleman almost, hath gotten such a rabble of Retayners, as makes poore House-holde seruantes so smally set by as they are. For what cares a Gentleman now adayes, to knaue &amp; rascall his Man at euery worde? And yf his Man (as flesh and blood many tymes cannot indure to be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> inhumanely intreated) shal scorne these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlemanlike tearmes, and thinke much for so small a cause, as many times they are, to be so hardly vsed: then off goes the Lyuerie-Coate, or Cloake, and packe out of my doores you arrant knaue, I wyll haue your betters to beare more then this at my handes. Thus is the poore
<pb facs="tcp:21538:36"/>
Seruingman turned out of his Lyuerie, &amp; out of doores, hauing but a bare quarters warning, but not that quarter that is allowed them by the Statute made for Seruants, in <hi>Quinto</hi> of her Maisties reigne, which is a quarter of a yeere, but scarce a quarter of an houre, to packe vp such apparrell as he hath.</p>
            <p>But what is the cause that the Gentleman cares so ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for his Man, though he be neuer so paynefull, honest, diligent, and duetifull a Seruant? What? marie this, because he can haue, yf he sende for such a Retayner, to ryde with him, or runne for him, or do any seruice he hath to commaunde him, till such time as he shalbe prouided of another. But poore Seruingman, what shall he doe? yf he be farre from his friendes, and haue small acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance there where he dwelt? Poore soule, I holde him to be in much worse case then the impotent Begger, that procureth the Towne-seale, with certayne of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours handes, where he hath been three yeeres last resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to begge within the limits of such hundredes, by vertue of the Statute made in <hi>Vicessimo secundo</hi> of our late dread Soueraigne, that worthy Prince of famous memorie, King Henrie the eight, for the reliefe of the poore: for the one hath free libertie to passe from Towne to Towne, without let, molestation, or hinderance, vsing himselfe honestly: and the other shalbe accompted as a Roge, and sent to Gaole, being Maisterlesse, for wandring abroade without a Lycence.</p>
            <p>Now the miserable needinesse of House-keeping was the first founder, begetter, and rayser of this Retayner. For yf a Gentleman nowadayes, coulde be content to giue Meate, Drinke, Wages, and Lyuerie, as his forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, to so many men as he had any imployment for, What neede he then haue any Retayners? And yf the Gentleman will pleade inhabilitie, that he is not able by his Lyuing to maynteine so many in householde as his
<pb facs="tcp:21538:37"/>
father did, though his degree and calling require no lesse countenance: then let him be content to cary so much a lower sayle, and grinde as his winde will giue him leaue, cary that port, credite, and countenance in his Countrey, as his lyuing will afforde him maynteinance. I will not say what I could say concerning these Retayners, since the worthy Lawes and Statutes of this Realme hath prepared, constituted, and ordeyned, pecuniarie punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes for the offenders herein, yf they might be duely put in execution: But, <hi>Quod supra nos, nihil ad nos,</hi> What hath Ioan to do with my Lady, or I with execution of Lawes or Statutes, that is neither Constable nor Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoulder of Towne nor Hundred? But I wysh well to all, and would not willingly incurre displeasure of any, and craue pardon yf in any thing I haue past my boundes, or been too bolde. But to returne agayne to my poore mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterlesse, and Lyuerylesse, nay Lyuerlesse and Hartlesse brother in Christ, What shall he do being thus Maister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, moneylesse, &amp; friendlesse, hauing lost his Maister and maynteynance both at one instance? What, shall he beg? no, he wantes his Testimoniall. Liberalitie is dead, as I tolde you before, and no body will giue him any thing, because he is able to worke. What then, shall he worke? Alas, he can not earne salt to his pottage, for he hath not been trayned to any bodyly laboure: and yf he would or coulde, yet no body will set him a worke, because they know him not: and yf they knew him, yet they will not, for they haue Townesmen labourers enough, to do what worke they haue. What shall he then do? Shall he make his appearance at Gaddes hill, Shooters hiil, Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie playne, or Newmarket heath, to sit in Commission, and examine passengers? Not so, for then, yf he mistake but a worde, Stande, for Goodmorow, he shall straight, whereas he did attende, be attended with moe men then his Maister kept, and preferred to a better house then euer
<pb facs="tcp:21538:37"/>
his father buylded for him, though not so holsome. What restes then, shall he starue? No, no, <hi>Ferrum frangit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitas, Hunger breakes stone walles,</hi> necessitie hath no Law: and yet necessitie vrgeth him to do some of these, to worke or steale: to worke if he coulde haue it, I holde well withall: but to steale, or starue, are two hard choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And woe, woe, and thrise woe be to him that is dryuen to eyther of them, as God wot many of these poore Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingmen be in this Leaden and last age.</p>
            <p>O who would be a Seruingman, to hazarde to fall into this detestable daunger, and be dryuen into these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities? euen into all the penurie, beggarie, scarcitie, and meere miserie, that may befall any humane creature: nay when they are in their greatest prosperitie, and had in highest esteeme, yet they are euen then the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and despised companie that lyues in this humane societie. For what doth a Gentleman now adayes care more for his Man, then to serue his present turne? No, no more for him then he doth for his Dogge or his Horse, who while they can do him seruice, he is content to allow them meate, and other necessaries: But when the Horse falles blynde or lame, knocke him in the head: when the Dogge growes so olde as he can do nothing but lie by the fyre, cut his throate, what is he good for, but to spende victualles: and the Seruingman, when the Sommer of his yeeres are spent, and that crooked olde age hath sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned him to make her many low curtesies, with ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded knees, so as he is not able now by his seruice to earne Otemeale for his Pottage, then off goes his shooes, and he is turned to the Common, inpasture is too good for him, for who would keepe one to do nothing, and bread so deare? Thus much doth his Maister regarde him when he is able to do him no more seruice.</p>
            <p>Agayne, yf this honest minded Seruingman doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into consideration of his estate, and woulde willingly
<pb facs="tcp:21538:38"/>
by some honest meanes prouide that he myght liue in time to come like a man, and so <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>endes a louing looke to some Yeoman or Countreymans daughter, whose Father he thinkes will bestow vpon her some reasonable portion, that with good husbandry may maynteine them both neighbour-like: then vpon some good lyking of both the parties, he comes to the Father &amp; Mother of the Mayde, to craue their good willes in the matter. What then? sayes the Father, shall I bestow my Daughter vpon a Gentleman, forsooth, that wantes lyuing, and cannot worke? On a Seruingman, on a begger? Noe, I am not yet so weerie of my Daughter, as I would see her stande neede of an almes: no no, I pray you prouide for your selfe otherwyse, for my Daughter is not, nor shall not be a pray for your pawes. Then it comes to the eares of my neighbours kinsmen &amp; friendes, that my neighbour Ienkingsons daughter shall haue M. what call you-hims man: then they beginne to gabble amongst them selues. What, shall Ioan haue a Seruingman? is her father so madd as he wyll marrie her to a Seruingman? What to a Seruingman sayes one? To a Seruingman sayes another? he neyther hath any thyng, nor can earne any thyng. How wyll they lyue, sayes one? How wyll they lyue sayes another? Marie merily, tyll his wyues porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be spent, and then wyll he be gone, and play least in sight. Mee thinkes he myght remember the olde saying: A Bakers wyfe may byte of a Bunne, a Brewers wyfe may drinke of a Tunne, and a Fyshmongers wyfe may feede of a Cunger, but a Seruingmans wyfe may starue for hunger.</p>
            <p>Thus vncharitably do they all iudge of the poore Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingman. What estate, degree, or callyng, can then be more miserable, then the profession of a Seruingman? Heere to day, and gone to morow. In good credite with his Maister at noone, and Iacke out of office before night.
<pb facs="tcp:21538:38"/>
It was not for nothyng that a good fellow, and friende of myne, a Seruingman, tolde mee he neuer made his Bedde before he went to it; for, sayth he, I know not in the mornyng, whether I shall lie in it at nyght or no, and therefore I wyll be sure my Maister shall not owe mee a bedde making.</p>
            <p>And thus you see, gentle Reader, the estate, degree, callyng, and profession, of euery poore Seruingman, in these latter dayes, to be more waueryng and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, then Winters weather, Womens thoughtes, or Fortunes wheele, that neuer restes rowlyng and turnyng about, in all thynges mutable, but mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
            <p>Thus courtuous Reader, I haue set downe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to my small iudgement herein, to what ende this fraternitie of Seruingmen was at the fyrst ordeyned, and of what mettall they were made. I haue also decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how floryshyng was the prime of their profession, and what estate, credite, and countenaunce, they lyued in, in former ages, euen tyll <hi>Vltima linea vitae.</hi> And thirdly and lastly, into what penurie, scarcitie, beggery, meere myserie, and vtter ruine, subuertion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, this auncient buyldyng is fallen into, in this leaden, latter, and last age. Whose fall, I earnestly lament and bewayle, wyllyng (yf any way I coulde) to procure a salue for this incurable disease: But, since I cannot, I wyll pray euen <hi>Ab intimo corde, from the bottom of my hart,</hi> that this companie of Seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, may eyther be better rewarded for their seruice, and better esteemed of amongst their superiours, equals, and inferiours; or els, that none of my friendes, or wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers, doe take vpon them this trade and profession: (though for my owne part I cannot speake any thyng of this, by my owne experience, as hauyng tasted my
<pb facs="tcp:21538:39"/>
selfe the gaule of this bitter-sweete: for euer since I was a Seruingman, I haue receyued the full measure of my desartes at my Maisters handes) least they should fall into the before rehearsed inconueniences, which are very incident generally to the professors of this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng.</p>
