            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Amicable Accommodation OF THE DIFFERENCE Between the REPRESENTER And the ANSWERER.</head>
            <p>HERE is a ſtrange Voluminous ado about the <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented</hi> and <hi>Repreſented.</hi> Firſt, almoſt Twenty Sheets by way of Anſwer to it; then, Ten in a ſecond Reply; and now, Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen in a Rejoynder: And after all this <hi>pother</hi> and <hi>noiſe,</hi> the upſhot of the Matter is come to this, That the Word <hi>Miſrepreſented</hi> is an <hi>improper</hi> Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; That the Character of a <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented</hi> cannot be called a <hi>Miſrepreſentation</hi> in a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> ſenſe, as our <hi>Antiproteſter</hi> has it often in his laſt <hi>Reply:</hi> where yet he owns the proving this, to <note place="margin">Pag. 2. 4.</note>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61788:3"/>
have been the main drift of his former Ten Sheets, and a great part of theſe laſt Fifteen. Surely he has taken a great deal of pains; but to what purpoſe, I expect to hear in other Ten Sheets yet to come: for really, I do not yet know that I am much concern'd, whether it be a Miſrepreſentation in a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> ſenſe, or no. And therefore, ſince he has pitch'd upon ſo civil a way of confuting my Book, I think I may, in return to his Civility, and without wrong to my Cauſe, grant him the whole of his Pretenſions, and then ſit down and ſmile with him a while, to ſee, how being ſo near of a mind, we have yet been ſo long claſhing Quills, as Adverſaries. I am really for Peace, and a good Correſpondence; and upon a ſerious Conſideration of this laſt <hi>Anſwer,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great reaſon to think, that the moſt conſiderable part of the Contention between us, has been about a <hi>Word,</hi> and for want of a fair Underſtanding, I'le en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to lay open my Mind farther to him, ſo to remove all <hi>Miſrepreſentation</hi> from between us, (I hope he'll pardon the Expreſſion, tho' it be not in its <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> ſenſe) and by this means accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date our Affair, without letting it ſwell farther into a Quarrel of yet greater Volumes.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, To take up the Matter from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, If he had duely conſider'd all I ſaid in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt Miſrepreſented and Repreſented,</hi> he might very well have excus'd entring the Field againſt me. For tho' I there complain'd of <hi>Papiſts</hi> being Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the World, that their Faith is expos'd in a Diſguiſe, and many things imputed to their Belief and Doctrine, which they diſown and abominate: Yet in all this Complaint I nam'd no body, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd no Accuſations againſt any particular Party.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61788:3"/>
And tho' I could have fill'd my Margins with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Authors, urging much blacker Calumnies than I there inſerted; yet ſtill I ſuppreſs'd all Names, conſulting Modeſty, and in regard of Peace. Now what need here of any ſingling themſelves, or a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out, to Engage with me? I left every body to to their own Conſcience; and had thoſe who felt themſelves touch'd, conceal'd the Sting within their own Breaſt, there had been ſtill a Peace betwixt us. If a Man wipes the Dirt off his Face, that has been thrown at him in the Street, I hope he may do it without any affront to the Paſſers-by. His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in <hi>general</hi> of being abus'd, is only a Natural Right; thoſe that are innocent need not be much concern'd to clear themſelves from the Charge; and ſuch as are guilty avoid all Quarrel, if they but hold their Tongues. The <hi>Papiſt</hi> therefore <hi>Miſrepreſented</hi> and <hi>Repreſented</hi> might very well have paſs'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moving of Choler, if thoſe who will have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not concern'd at all, had not been too much concern'd to wipe off the Imputation. This had been a means of preſerving a mutual Peace from the beginning.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, Tho' contrary to this Method, much Duſt has been rais'd, and not without ſome Heat in the Quarrel; yet I am ſtill perſuaded our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences may be compounded, if a fair Condeſcenſion can win any thing upon my Adverſary, and he'll allow me to purchaſe his Good-will by almoſt an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Submiſſion to the Chief of his Pretenſions. I'le beg his leave to ſtate the Occaſion of our Debate, and the Reader ſhall ſoon ſee how much I can oblige him by my yielding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61788:4"/>
The Occaſion of my writing the <hi>Papiſt Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and Repreſented,</hi> was this; I found that the People in <hi>England</hi> had a very falſe Notion of <hi>Popery,</hi> or of the Faith and Doctrine of <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> that there was ſcarce any one Article of their Creed, any one Practice of their Church, which was not falſly drawn in the Imagination of the Vulgar, either blackned with Calumnies, or disfigur'd with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd Interpretations or malicious Miſconſtructions; that hence aroſe ſo great a hatred againſt all of that Communion, that the Comprehenſive Precept of Loving ones Neighbour, ſeem'd now to admit with the Zealous of a neceſſary Exception againſt all of that Profeſſion; and the Deſign of rooting out <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> a ſufficient Diſpenſation for the violating all other Duties, both to God, the King, and our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>This Uncharitable Temper I could not but look upon as ill becoming a Chriſtian Name; and that to endeavour to remedy it, would not be only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to <hi>Catholicks,</hi> but even to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> too; who, I preſum'd, would be as willingly prevented from doing an Injury to their Neighbours, as the others would be willing not to be injur'd: it being a greater Concern of a <hi>Church</hi> not to do an Injury, than to receive one.</p>
            <p>For the removing therefore this Scandal from Chriſtianity, and hindring Men from maligning and railing againſt their Neighbours, for the falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of their own Imaginations, by what means ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever taken up by them, I thought it no ill Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to declare ſincerely what is really the <hi>Faith</hi> of a <hi>Catholick:</hi> and to ſhew more clearly how different it is from what it is vulgarly ſaid to be, I drew out
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61788:4"/>
two Deſcriptions or Characters of <hi>Popery;</hi> the one being an Idea of <hi>Proteſtant Popery,</hi> or as it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conceiv'd by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and painted in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the Vulgar of that Communion: The other being a Draught of the Faith of <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> as deliver'd and preſcrib'd by their Church. The former of theſe Characters I call'd <hi>A Papiſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented,</hi> and the latter <hi>A Papiſt Repreſented.</hi> And I thought theſe Titles juſtifiable enough, in as much as the one deſcribes a <hi>Papiſt</hi> otherwiſe than he really is, disfigur'd with falſe Colours, and artificially tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a Monſter, by a deform'd Dreſs, thrown over him by ſuch, who through ignorance or malice are willing to render him Ridiculous: While the other ſets him out diveſted of this Bug bear Habit, and ſhews him in his own genuine Shape and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
            <p>This inoffenſive proceeding of mine, as I thought and meant it, paſs'd not long without an Adverſary, who proclaim'd to the World that he had Anſwered and Confuted the Book: But what, and how has he done it? He ſays, he has prov'd that the <hi>Character</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 21</note> 
               <hi>of a Papiſt Miſrepreſented contains nothing in it, which in a STRICT and PROPER ſenſe can be call'd a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation:</hi> That <hi>it contains no Miſrepreſentation</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 4.</note> 
               <hi>PROPERLY</hi> ſo call'd. That <hi>there is nothing of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 18.</note> 
               <hi>PROPERLY</hi> ſo call'd. This is the way he has anſwer'd and confuted it: and for this he is ſet up upon every Stall, as bidding me defiance, and with the Character of an <hi>Adverſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But really the World is over haſty in proclaiming men at Odds. I love Peace too well, to fall out about ſuch Triſles. Let thoſe who have a mind to it, fight for a <hi>Word;</hi> for my part, he ſhall never be my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61788:5"/>
who demands no more of me than this: Ile willingly yeild my right in ſuch a Point as this, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than make an Adverſary of one, who is ſo civil to ask no more. Nay rather than fail of obliging my <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> Ile e'en crave his pardon, for putting him to the trouble of reinforcing his proofs a Second time. He ſays here <hi>(p.</hi> 2.) He <hi>hop'd the talk of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſenting would have been at an end:</hi> After he had prov'd, to wit, in his Former Reply, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented</hi> contain'd no Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation <hi>properly</hi> ſo call'd, in its <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Senſe. And really 'twas only through miſtake, and not deſign, that I have been ſo troubleſome to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him even to the talk of Miſrepreſenting beyond his expectation. For had I but imagin'd that that had been the utmoſt of his deſign in his laſt Ten Sheets, I ſhould certainly have ſo far condeſcended to ſo Gentile an Adverſary, as to have ſpar'd him the Charges and Sweat of laying down his Proofs again.</p>
            <p>And therefore that he may not be importun'd with any farther talk of Miſrepreſenting for the future, I do here in compliance with him ſolemnly declare, that the Title of the <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented,</hi> is not to be taken in its <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Senſe, as <hi>Miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſignifies only downright <hi>Lying,</hi> or falſly charging matter of <hi>Fact;</hi> the whole Character being not indeed of this Nature: But in its <hi>larger</hi> or leſs <hi>proper</hi> Senſe; as it comprehends both <hi>Lying, Calumniating, Miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting, Reproaching, Miſconſtruing, Miſ-judging,</hi> and whatever elſe of this kind; For in this Senſe I don't find the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> has any diſlike to it. But in caſe this ſhould not pleaſe him neither, Ile yield one ſtep lower, and will have <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> quite blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61788:5"/>
out. But then he muſt give me leave to ſee, If I can pleaſe him with ſomething elſe in its ſtead. And what if I ſhould try if ſomething borrow'd from the <hi>French,</hi> would be more ſuitable to his humor? That Nation ſpeaks very politely and quaintly, it may be a Title <hi>a-la-mode de France</hi> may be as acceptable as their Faſhions. What then if I ſhould take Copy from the <hi>Acts of the General Aſſembly of the French Clergy</hi> lately Publiſhed; and inſtead of that <hi>Improper</hi> Engliſh word of <hi>Miſrepreſenting,</hi> prefix to my Book what they have done to their Complaint, viz. <hi>The Calumnies, Injuries and Falſities, which the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Reformd publiſh in their Books and Sermons againſt the Doctrine of the Church?</hi> If this will agree to the Character in a more <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> ſenſe, than <hi>Miſrepreſenting,</hi> let me but know his Sentiments, and wee'l never fall out for want of ſuch a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>But however that he may be ſenſible, how much he's to be engag'd to me for this condeſcention; I muſt aſſure him, that whatſoever I yield in this kind, is purely out of good nature, and for the love of Peace; and not as oblig'd to it by force of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. For really to ſpeak freely and betwixt Friends, I do not think he has advanc'd any thing in the whole matter, that has the face of a Proof; but proceeds all along upon a Principle, ſuppos'd to be certain indeed, but without the ſupport of either Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Reaſon.</p>
            <p>His Principle is this, <hi>That there can be no Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting, where there's an agreement about matter of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 2. &amp; alib.</note> 
               <hi>Fact;</hi> which to me has more of the Counterfeit in it, than true Standard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61788:6"/>
For were the <hi>Anti-Proteſter</hi> put to prove, that there can be no <hi>proper Miſrepreſentation,</hi> where there's an agreement about matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> I believe 'tis not every ordinary Topick would find him mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> ſeems to ſtand in oppoſition to <hi>Repreſenting;</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Repreſenting being nothing more, than the Deſcribing or ſhewing a thing <hi>as it is in it ſelf:</hi> As many ways as a thing can be ſhewn otherwiſe than it is in it ſelf; ſo many ways may it be <hi>properly Miſrepreſented.</hi> Now 'tis certain that for the deſcription to bear an exact reſemblance with the thing; it muſt not only agree with it in matter of <hi>Fact;</hi> but likewiſe in every other reſpect, which it pretends to declare, as in <hi>Motive, Circumſtance, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, End,</hi> &amp;c. The diſagreement in any one of theſe, being enough to quite change the nature of the thing, notwithſtanding the matter of Fact being ſtill the ſame. Nay many times even a Grin, a Wry Face, a Shrug or a Frown is enough to Miſrepreſent any man, without belying him in matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain the Children of <hi>Reuben,</hi> and of <hi>Gad,</hi> and the half Tribe of <hi>Maneſſeh,</hi> had been fouly Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented, if upon ſight of the <hi>Altar</hi> raiſed by them on the Brink of <hi>Jordan,</hi> they had been preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd <note place="margin">Joſh. 22.</note> as <hi>Rebels againſt God,</hi> by the other Ten Tribes, as <hi>Prevaricators of the Law of MOSES, and as Setters up of an Altar againſt the Altar of God and of Iſrael.</hi> This I ſay had been certainly a Miſrepreſentation of the Two Tribes and a half; becauſe tho' the matter of <hi>Fact, viz.</hi> the <hi>building an Altar,</hi> was true beyond all exception; yet becauſe they raiſed this Altar, not for Burnt Offerings or for Sacrifice; but to be a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to their Children to come, that they had a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61788:6"/>
part in the Lord; the branding them with the Title of Rebels againſt God, and as Schiſmaticks from the Altar of the Tabernacle, had been altogether unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, and a Repreſenting them to their Fellow-Tribes, otherwiſe then they were, which is properly Miſrepreſenting.</p>
            <p>And had not <hi>Hannah</hi> been Miſrepreſented too, if <hi>Eli</hi> had ſet her out amongſt her Neighbours, for a <note place="margin">1 King. 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Drunken Goſſip,</hi> and a Prophaner of the Houſe of the Lord, when he ſaw her muttering over her Prayers, without hearing her voice?</p>
            <p>I know if Our <hi>Anſwerer</hi> had been by, neither the two <hi>Tribes,</hi> nor <hi>Hannah</hi> muſt have complained in this Caſe of being Miſrepreſented. He would have told them, whilſt there was an agreement about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, there could be no Miſrepreſentation in a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Senſe; that therefore they might reſt contented with this infamy upon them, ſince by this one Principle they had a full <hi>Anſwer</hi> and <hi>Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their Complaint.</p>
            <p>And is not this an admirable expedient now for the Honeſteſt Man in the World to be blaſted in his Credit and Reputation, and yet not to be <hi>Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented</hi> neither? If Envy or Malice can but be inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious enough, to invent ſomething like a Proof againſt him, and with Confidence inſinuate it into the populace; 'tis no <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> him, to ſet him out for a Fool or a Knave. Let there be only ſome matter of Fact, which ill Will can but interpret into a Crime, and his Reputation is forthwith brought to the Stake. For tho' barely to defame an Honeſt Man, would be a Miſrepreſentation, and a Sin: yet to Preach and Poſt him up for a Rogue and a Villain, and to ſtand to it, and run down his Credit with a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61788:7"/>
Proof, is no <hi>proper Miſrepreſentation</hi> at all. If the Two <hi>Elders</hi> had cried down <hi>Suſanna</hi> for a Harlot, without offering to prove their aſperſion, they had <hi>Miſrepreſented</hi> her then, it ſeems, according to our <hi>Anſwerer</hi>'s Doctrine: But becauſe their own Villany prompted them with a Proof againſt her Innocence, this ſo alter'd the Caſe, that a Vertuous Woman was painted out and decried for a Strumpet, and yet the Two <hi>Elders</hi> no <hi>Miſrepreſenters</hi> all the while. No, by no means; this is too foul a Character for them to bear, and they might be reaſonably concern'd to wipe off the imputation; they have a <hi>Proof</hi> for what they urge, they have a matter of <hi>Fact</hi> of her being <hi>Alone</hi> and <hi>Naked</hi> in the Garden: and this makes her Credit a Subject of <hi>Diſpute,</hi> and not of <hi>Miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This is admirable I confeſs, and tho' that young youth <hi>Daniel</hi> laid open the two Sages, for Perjury and Falſe Accuſation; yet they are beholden to this nicking Principle of our <hi>Anti-proteſter,</hi> for diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them from the Infamy of <hi>Miſrepreſenting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis not only theſe Two <hi>Old Sinners</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him for his Aſſiſtance: As many as have ever made uſe of thoſe Faſhionable Topicks of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Slander, and maliciouſly plotted againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence by Perjury and Deſamation, muſt come and acknowledge their obligation, for his having found them out a method, by which tho' they have turn'd White into Black, ſhewn Honeſt Men for Knaves, ſtamp'd Vice upon Virtue, made Wiſe men paſs for Fools, and always endeavour'd to repreſent things otherwiſe then they were; yet they may ſtill plauſibly quit themſelves from the charge of <hi>proper Miſrepreſenting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt let the <hi>Jews</hi> come; for tho' they cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61788:7"/>
againſt our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and painted him out, as a <hi>Breaker of the Sabbath, as a Glutton, as a Friend and Companion of Publicans and Sinners,</hi> and that in <hi>Belzebub the Prince of the Devils he caſted out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;</hi> yet this was no <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> of Chriſt, it ſeems; for as long as there was a matter of <hi>Fact</hi> in all theſe caſes, 'twas no <hi>Miſrepreſenting,</hi> thus fouly to blacken Innocence, and to Repreſent Chriſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then he was.</p>
            <p>And may not all after <hi>Jews, Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> come in too? For tho' they branded the Apoſtles <hi>as Troublers of the City, and movers of Sedition:</hi> Tho' they defam'd the Chriſtians, as <hi>Superſtitious Fooliſh</hi> and <hi>Bloody;</hi> tho' they decried them for <hi>Murdering Infants, and eating their Fleſh in their Aſſemblies, for Worſhipping the Sun, and adoring an Aſſes head for God,</hi> and teaching a thouſand other Abſurdities and Abominations. Yet if any one be ſo Bold as to call theſe <hi>Miſrepreſenters</hi> of the Chriſtians and of their Faith, the charge is not likely to paſs many days, without a return of ſomething which will be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd an <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay let none ſtay out from acknowledging their ſhare in this favour, excepting only ſuch Dull Souls, who have Malice enough to calumniate, but want wit to give a <hi>Reaſon</hi> for what they do, or can find no matter of <hi>Fact</hi> on which to ground their Scandal, or which they are not able to make Criminal by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. For as for all others, who carry on their Buſineſs by Calumny and Scandal, and can give a reaſon for it, they may go on as to this point; this Salvo is a General diſcharge, by which they may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely take away any mans Good name for the future, without being <hi>Miſrepreſenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61788:8"/>
And 'tis by this admirable Plea, the <hi>Anti-proteſter</hi> has abſolv'd all the Antient and Modern Proteſtant Character-drawers of Popery, from the infamy of <hi>Miſrepreſenting.</hi> For tho' they expoſe a Liſt of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Popiſh Doctrines to the People, uſher'd in with <hi>They teach this, They Believe that, They ſay this, They affirm that,</hi> and under theſe Preambles charge the Papiſts for aſſerting and believing ſuch Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Abominations, which they would ſooner loſe their Lives than aſſent to: Yet theſe are no <hi>Miſrepreſenters,</hi> as long as they can find ſome matter of Fact, on which to ground theſe charges. But whether it be with reaſon or without reaſon, that's no matter, <hi>only diſtinguiſh,</hi> ſays he, (p. 4.) <hi>between matters of Repreſentation and Diſpute: And if the matter of Fact they charge the Papiſts with be true, they are no Miſrepreſenters; as for their Reaſons and Arguments, I will not undertake to defend all the Reaſonings of Proteſtants.</hi> So that let them traduce the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and their Doctrine never ſo odiouſly, yet they are no <hi>Miſrepreſenters,</hi> as long as they charge them with matter of Fact, and can ſay ſomething they call a <hi>Reaſon</hi> for't, tho' it be no Reaſon at all.</p>
            <p>This is the Doctrine of the <hi>Anſwerer;</hi> and thus is the <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented</hi> confuted. So that for the future the Papiſt, tho' he be expos'd in the moſt monſtrous and horrid ſhape imaginable, muſt never complain of being <hi>Miſrepreſented,</hi> eſpecially as long as thoſe that make the ſhow have Wit and Malice enough to give a Reaſon for what they ſay, and can fix it upon ſome matter of Fact, but whether right or wrong, that's all the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61788:8"/>
But now I would willingly know, whether this Explication of <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> be <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,</hi> in regard to all Nations, Judgments and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; or only Calculated for the Elevation of <hi>Popery:</hi> So that only Papiſts muſt not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Miſrepreſented,</hi> when they are thus repreſented otherwiſe than they are; but not any others in the like Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>I have a little Scruple in this Matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will explicate my ſelf a little, that I may be better inform'd concerning the nature of <hi>Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting.</hi> I will for that end beg leave of my <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> to propoſe an Example or Two, which may ſerve to give me ſome Light into this Affair. Suppoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſome <hi>Zealous Brother,</hi> that had Separated from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> having now his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and his Intereſt engag'd in the <hi>Schiſm,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Re-union of his Flock, ſhould make it his daily Buſineſs to animate his Followers againſt the Eſtabliſh'd National Church, by expoſing her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practices, and rendring them as odious as he can; would it be <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> or no? As now, if he ſhould thus in the fervour of Spirit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs himſelf to his Congregation:</p>
            <p>Beloved, beware of the Whore that ſits upon the Seven Hills; flie from the Abomination of <hi>Babylon;</hi> get out of the reach of the Dragon; be not contented to get from under his Feet, but ſtand afar off, afar off, Beloved, out of the Swing of his Tail: Oh, he has a long Tail, Beloved,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61788:9"/>
a long Tail; and, do ye mark me now? there's as much Poiſon in his Tail, as in his very Teeth. I muſt explicate to you this Myſtery. The Dragon's Seat is upon the Top of the Hills, and the poor <hi>Papiſts</hi> lie under his very Noſe. There are ſome others, who have had thoughts of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themſelves from this Place of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and have ſtepp'd a little aſide, but could never yet bid Adieu to their Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and theſe are ſuch who call themſelves Men of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> who tho' they have retir'd a little from the Top of the Hill, and are got from under the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon's Feet, yet they are not the half-way down, but ſtick in the way, and are as much under the Power of the Dragon, as if they were under his very Belly. For, mark ye, Beloved, he has ſuch a Sweep with his Tail, that as many as are on the Sides of the Hills are ſtill under his Command, and breath nothing but the Air of the Dragon. Smell to 'em a little, my deareſt Saints, and you'l ſoon perceive them rank with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and that their Delight is in the Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries and Abominations of the Whore, and their Marks are the Marks of the Beaſt.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61788:9"/>
For ſee what they are, behold their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, Beloved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They allow and maintain an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Pride in their <hi>Prelates,</hi> ſetling on them large Revenues and State, contrary to the Example of the Apoſtles, who were poor and humble, and by the Work of their Hands got Bread for themſelves and their poor Neighbours. And theſe Prelates are verily nothing but <hi>Popiſh Prelates,</hi> and are commanded by their Church to wear the <hi>Miter</hi> and the <hi>Croſier,</hi> and the <hi>Cope,</hi> the moſt ſolemn Rags of the Whore: and tho' they generally diſſemble this <hi>Popery</hi> in their Life-time, excepting only on their Coaches, ſo to try if they can gain us; yet you may ſee their Claim to it at their Death; there being ſcarce any of 'um bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but with the <hi>Miter</hi> and <hi>Croſier</hi> on their Tombs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They make Gods of Dead Men, erecting Churches in their Honour, and Dedicating them to their Names. Nay, they honour them more than God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; of the Hundred and thirty ſeven Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Churches of the <hi>Weekly-Bill</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> there being only Five in Honour of Chriſt,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61788:10"/>
or the Bleſſed Trinity. And how much they honour the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> more than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you may ſee in the ſame Weekly Bills, in which <hi>Mary</hi> has Nineteen Churches Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to her Name, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> only Three. And is not this to place <hi>Mary</hi> above <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to make a <hi>Goddeſs</hi> of her? Is not this to worſhip her more than God? For, what more Sovereign and Divine Honour can there poſſibly be paid to any, than to raiſe Temples and Churches to their Names? This is an Honour and Worſhip to which all others of <hi>Bowing, Kneeling,</hi> and <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> are much inferiour. For theſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we lawfully uſe to Creatures, we <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Kneel</hi> to our Prince, and by humble <hi>Petitions</hi> beg his Aſſiſtance: But to build Temples and Churches to the Honour and Name of any Creature, is Blaſphemy and Idolatry, 'tis to make Gods of them; and nothing better than an Imitation of the Heathens: And therefore as they had their Temples Dedicated to their Demy-Gods, <hi>Hercules, Veſpaſian, Trajan,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana, &amp;c.</hi> ſo amongſt our Brethren you ſee one Temple rais'd to <hi>Martin,</hi> another to <hi>Dennis,</hi> another to <hi>Bennet,</hi> another to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61788:10"/>
               <hi>Catherine.</hi> For this the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and for this the <hi>Church of England</hi> are Idolaters, and this Idolatry they inherit of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> for tho' theſe Churches were built firſt by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yet the <hi>Church of England</hi> rais'd them out of their Aſhes, and rebuilt them with the ſame Titles, Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Dedications.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They teach and practiſe Idolatry on another account, and that is their <hi>Image-Idolatry.</hi> For tho' they pretended an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to Images for ſome years, yet that was only Diſſimulation. For now at laſt they ſpeak plain, and have given that Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination a place in every Leaf of their <hi>Bibles.</hi> They may pretend they do not honour and reſpect them as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do; but this is only before us <hi>Schiſmaticks:</hi> for, believe me, my Flock in Chriſt, they honour them in their Hearts more than the rankeſt <hi>Papiſt</hi> in the World. For I appeal to you now, be you Judges; What greater Honour can there be imagin'd, than to give a thing place even in the very <hi>Word of God?</hi> You underſtand very well, that to place an Image in the Throne of a King, is to give it Kingly Honour, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61788:11"/>
to place it in the Imperial Seat, is to give it Imperial Honour: What then, Beloved, is it to place <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Pictures</hi> in the <hi>Bible,</hi> in the very <hi>Word of God,</hi> but to give them <hi>Divine Honour,</hi> and to reſpect them as <hi>Gods?</hi> For certainly the <hi>Word of God</hi> is of God, and all Divine; and to give any <hi>Image</hi> place there, is the greateſt Argument of Sovereign Honour, and open acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of its Divinity.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, my Brethren; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this Abomination of thus honouring Images and Pictures, they likewiſe Pray to their Pictures, as you may ſee them in their moſt ſolemn Devotion of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer.</hi> For they have them not only on the Walls in ſome Churches; but look but over their Shoulders, and you'l ſee them in the very heat of their Devotion under their very Eyes, in the Leaves of their <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> Books.</p>
            <p>Nay, their Altars have their Images too, and this in a more prophane manner than the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> for theſe have none but Images of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and their Followers; and if any were tolerable, it ought to be Theſe at a Chriſtian Altar:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61788:11"/>
but to throw down theſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſet up <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in the place, is an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry beyond all Excuſe. God hid <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Body, and they ſet up his <hi>Likeneſs</hi> over their Altars.</p>
            <p>And mark ye now, Beloved, how all this is in defiance to the Commandment of God; For the Lord has ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any Graven Image, nor the Likeneſs of any thing in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath:</hi> So that did they not honour, worſhip, or pray to theſe Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, yet the very <hi>Making</hi> them is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden by God. And let their Intention be what it will in ſo doing, 'tis certain, there's no <hi>Intention can alter the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pap. not Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rep. by Prot. p. 65.</note> 
               <hi>Nature of Actions which are determin'd by a Divine Law;</hi> For then Men might Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Steal, or Forſwear themſelves, and yet avoid the Guilt of ſuch Actions, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to do no Evil in them. 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a very prophane Abſurdity, Beloved, to ſee the <hi>Commandments</hi> ſet up in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in order to the keeping them, and yet with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> on each ſide, which is a flat Contradiction to the very <hi>Second</hi> of them, which ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61788:12"/>
               <hi>the Likeneſs of any thing in Heaven above, &amp;c.</hi> What think you now, my Brethren, do theſe Men love <hi>Images</hi> and worſhip them, or no? They profeſs'd a hatred to <hi>Image-worſhip</hi> in the beginning, for the more plauſibly turning the <hi>Papiſts</hi> out of doors, when they purſu'd them with the Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in their old <hi>Common-Prayer-Books,</hi> of <hi>Curſed be all Worſhippers of Images:</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſucceeding to the Errors of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as well as to their Revenues, they no longer dar'd to curſe the <hi>Worſhippers of Images,</hi> knowing the Curſe would light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own Heads; but inſtead of that, reform'd their Prayers, and have it now, <hi>Curſed are ye Idolaters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. They worſhip <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels.</hi> For ſee, Beloved, beſides the building Churches to the Honour of their Names, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up their Pictures in them, which are as great external Acts of Worſhip and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as can be; they likewiſe ſet <hi>Days</hi> apart to honour them, as God has his Day ſet apart; they command their <hi>Vigils</hi> to be kept, and have <hi>Prayers</hi> in their Honour, not queſtioning but that they can Pray <note place="margin">Diſc. againſt Invocation of Saints, in the beginning.</note> for as many as they know upon Earth.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61788:12"/>
Nay, they likewiſe pray for, and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Aſſiſtance, Help, and Protection, but eſpecially of the Angels, as you may ſee in their <hi>Common-Prayer Books,</hi> where on the Day of <hi>Michael,</hi> they beg to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the Angels; as if God, who is Almighty, were not able to defend them, that they ſhould thus ſeek ſhelter under the Angels Wings. Is not this to leave God and his Chriſt, and to make Gods of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Oh! ſuch abomination as this is not to be endured; 'tis intolerable, Beloved. For theſe <hi>Churches</hi> in their honour, <hi>Days</hi> in their honour, <hi>Images</hi> in their honour, and <hi>Prayers</hi> in their honour, is paying to them Divine Honours, 'tis worſhipping them as Gods: For, mark ye now, all <hi>Civil</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is terminated on the viſible things of this World, and we have no intercourſe <note place="margin">Papiſt not Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rep. by Prot.</note> with the inviſible Inhabitants of the other World, but what is <hi>Religious;</hi> now if all Worſhip of inviſible Beings is Divine and Religious Worſhip; what abominable Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry are our blind Brethren faln into, who by this Religious Worſhip make as many Gods, as there are Angels and Saints in Heaven!</p>

5. They practice Idolatry again in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament; for though they allow this to be only Bread and Wine, yet they pay it Religious Worſhip, and honour it as God, by falling down to it on their Knees. They may ſay, they do not this to the Bread and Wine: But what, muſt we not believe our Senſes in ſo plain a Caſe? Do we not ſee them do it with our Eyes? And let them pretend what they pleaſe, their Practice is the beſt explication of their Belief.</p>

Yea, Beloved, from the abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaketh; as their Language is, ſuch is their very Heart and

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61788:14"/>
God himſelf, preſent in all Places. And this Devotion is call'd the <hi>Canticle</hi> of <hi>Benedicite,</hi> taken out of the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> which with them you may ſee paſſes for very good <hi>Scripture.</hi> So that the whole <hi>Common-Prayer Book,</hi> if not worſe, is nothing but the <hi>Maſs-Book</hi> in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, that the <hi>Miſſal</hi> is of an Ancient ſtanding, us'd even in <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s time: But our <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi> never knew light, till 'twas devis'd under <hi>Edward</hi> VI. And how many Alterations has it had in this time? Some made by King <hi>Edward</hi> himſelf, ſome by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others ſince. Nay, have we not ſeen Prayers added to this Book, in Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the Diſcovery of and Deliverance from a Plot, which now every conſidering Man has reaſon to believe to have been no more than a <hi>Chimera,</hi> and the Invention of Bad Men?</p>
            <p n="7">7. They make Gods of Men, attributing to them a Power of Forgiving Sins, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Attribute of the Almighty; and this is plain in their Liturgy, in which their Prieſts are order'd to give Abſolution to Sinners.</p>

They encourage a Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; permitting their Members to live as extravagantly as they pleaſe all the time of their Health; and not a word of <hi>Confeſs</hi> and <hi>Repent,</hi> but when Death is waiting for them at their Beds-Head. They have a Power to give Abſolution, they ſay; and their never enjoyning it; but in the laſt Agony, is Argument enough to conclude, there's no obligation of Repenting amongſt them, till Death looks 'em in the Face.</p>
            <p n="9">9. They know not what their Belief is touching this Power of <hi>Abſolution.</hi> Some of their Divines affirm, That the Sentence by which Abſolution is given to the Penitent, is an <hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Definitive</hi> Sentence, judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abſolving him from the Guilt of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. Others of their Doctors ſay, That the Form of Abſolution is <hi>Declarative</hi> rather than <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and think it a raſhneſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a <hi>Definitive</hi> Sentence in Gods Name. And thus tho' their Faith be all pretended to be according to the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yet 'tis wonderful hard to know what it is; and whilſt they thus diſagree amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how can any embrace their <hi>Creed,</hi> who know not what they believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>

            <p n="11">11. They are a Cruel, Bloody, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Church, and think nothing unjuſt which is for the Intereſt of their Cauſe, for the Security and Propagation of their Doctrine. You know how they help'd on this ſcore the <hi>Low Countries</hi> to Rebell againſt their Lawful Sovereign, and were the occaſion of much Innocent Blood being
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61788:15"/>
Spilt: and how they profer'd to aſſiſt the <hi>French</hi> in their Rebellion againſt their Prince. What they did to that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> you know like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe full well: She took Sanctuary here, and being Heireſs of the Crown, was made a Sacrifice upon the Scaffold for pretended Crimes, but in good truth for nothing elſe but the Security of the Church of <hi>England. Charles</hi> I. fell too upon the ſame account: They lay this, you know, at <hi>Diſſenters</hi> doors; but how far that War was an Epiſcopal War, the Lord knows. For beſides the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging him to take up Arms on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, you know one Archbiſhop changed his Rochet for a Coat of Mail, and the greateſt number of the <hi>Convocation-Houſe,</hi> of what <hi>Church</hi> were they?</p>
            <p n="12">12. They practice Cruelty again in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting us for not obeying their Church, when they at the ſame time are as great <hi>Diſſenters</hi> as <hi>we.</hi> For, look you now, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, are not their Miniſters commanded by their Church to enjoy but one Benefice: And yet how many of them poſſeſs two or three? They find no difficulty of being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpens'd in this Duty, if they can but make a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61788:16"/>
Friend to ſpeak for them, and Forty pound for the Fees. Are not their <hi>Prelates</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by their <hi>Rubrick</hi> to wear a <hi>Scarlet Robe,</hi> a <hi>White Rochet,</hi> and Corner'd <hi>Cap:</hi> their Miniſters an <hi>Albe</hi> and <hi>Tunicle;</hi> and who is there complies with this Order? Do's not their Church command all of their Communion to Faſt all <hi>Lent,</hi> the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-days, Rogation-days,</hi> and all <hi>Fridays</hi> in the Year: and yet who of them ſatisfies this Precept? Do we not find the contrary every where practis'd? And not only in this, but in a thouſand other Inſtances of the like nature. And yet while they themſelves thus frankly trample the Commands of their Church under feet, is it not a moſt malicious Cruelty that we ſhould be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for not ſatisfying her Precepts? So that tho' we are Members of their Church, we can, by their good will, enjoy no Peace amongſt them. They ſpare us our Lives indeed, but without Liberty or Property, the only Comforts of Life.</p>
            <p n="13">13. They teach Abſurdities and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. Firſt, in requiring us to ſubmit to the Authority of their Church, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us for refuſal: and then charging ſuch
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61788:16"/>
as follow them from all ſuch Submiſſion, and giving them liberty of embracing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is propos'd to them, but what they themſelves ſhall judge conſonant to the Word of God. And thus we muſt be oblig'd to go to Church; and yet when we come there, the Appeal is made from the Pulpit to the People, and we need not believe what we hear, unleſs we think fit our ſelves. Then the Authority of <hi>Councils</hi> we muſt like wiſe allow and ſubmit to; and yet after all their Examinations and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, we need not receive what they Decree, unleſs in our own private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we think it conform to Reaſon and the Law. So that we muſt not be allow'd to do what we think beſt, and guide our ſelves; and yet when we follow them, we need believe or do no more than we think fitting: Which is to take them for Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Directors, and then afterwards go alone by our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="14">14. After all this Liberty left to their Followers, 'tis yet the Belief of their Church, That whoſoever will follow her, muſt ſhut his Eyes, ſtifle his Senſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and be led only by the Noſe. And
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61788:17"/>
therefore we poor Schiſmaticks muſt not reform any Abuſe or Superſtition, which our Reaſon aſſures us to be contrary to the Word of God, without the Thunder of Excommunication forthwith breaking upon our Heads; but if their Church in Parliament and Convocation makes any Reformation, there's no Appeal to be made to Senſe or Reaſon, but 'tis immediately to be receiv'd as the Senſe of the Word of God by all her Members. <hi>And therefore,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Reviſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſ. in vindic. of the Biſh. of <hi>Winton,</hi> p. 23.</note> ſays one of their Divines, <hi>let them in the Name of God Reform on, if they proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to due Courſe of Law, and Act with Authority. For as to</hi> What, <hi>and</hi> How, <hi>and</hi> How far, <hi>things are to be Reform'd, ſuch as you and I are muſt leave it to the Wiſdom and Pleaſure of Governors.</hi> So that we muſt lay aſide our Reaſon, if we intend to enter their Congregation; 'tis only going on blindly without fear or care, and relying confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently on their Infallible Governors, and we ſhall be forthwith True and Subſtantial <hi>Churchmen.</hi> And what think you, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, do's not this ſmell of the <hi>Infallible Chair?</hi> 'Tis e'en ſo. But ſuch is the Church from which you are happily gone out.

            </p>
            <p n="15">15. By this means they are a wavering and unſetled Church, ſubject to continual Variations, and turning as many ways as their Governors pleaſe to wind them; and yet ſtill all is according to the Word of God. In the firſt <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, 'twas requir'd that Water ſhould be mingled with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Wine; and that in the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elements, the Miniſter ſhould ſign them twice with the Sign of the Croſs: And that the Communion-Bread ſhould be <hi>unleaven'd</hi> and <hi>round.</hi> Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Water was likewiſe appointed to be bleſs'd with the Sign of the Croſs; The Miniſter was commanded to Exorciſe and Conjure out the unclean Spirit from the Infant, to dip him <hi>thrice</hi> in the Water, to <hi>Anoynt</hi> him with Ovl upon the Head, and put on him the <hi>White Veſture</hi> call'd the <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> and make the Croſs on his Breaſt and Forehead. In <hi>Conſirmation</hi> the Biſhops were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61788:18"/>
order'd to Croſs the Children on the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. In the Viſitation of the Sick the Miniſter was to <hi>Anoint</hi> the Sick Perſon on his Forehead or Breaſt, making the Sign of the Croſs. And there was no Command to receive the Sacrament <hi>Kneeling.</hi> This was their Church then, as Eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of Governors, and conform to the <hi>Scripture:</hi> but now their Scripture and Governors ſay otherwiſe, and condemn what they then approv'd. 'T was then according to Scripture to <hi>Pray for the Dead,</hi> as in the ſame Book of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> VI. Now the Scripture forbids it. The Form of <hi>Ordination</hi> was then and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years after one thing, and now of late 'tis become another: and if right then, I wonder how it can be right now. Thus you ſee their Church alter and change ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Complexion of the Times. And not only in theſe things, but in a thouſand others; nay, in the very Articles of their Belief: The Apoſtles <hi>Creed</hi> had never more than <hi>Twelve</hi> Articles, and the aſſenting to theſe were enough to make a Chriſtian; but to make a <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Chriſtian,</hi> at firſt 'twas requir'd to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61788:18"/>
to <hi>Forty two</hi> Articles; and then a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after ſomething was bated, and 'twas enough to ſubſcribe to <hi>Thirty nine;</hi> and in theſe there was ſo much chopping and changing, both in Words, Expreſſions, and Sentences, that even the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s <hi>Expoſition</hi> never had more before it came to perfection.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Marks, my Deareſt ones, of that Congregation to which you are ſo earneſtly invited to joyn: but let thoſe joyn with her that can, thoſe that can find a way to diſpenſe with all their Senſe and Reaſon, and admit of Prophanation, and Superſtition, and Idolatry, for the Word of God. But for us, We have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and our Reaſon for our Guides, and we need no better; and we have no ſurer way of avoiding the Teeth of the Dragon, than to keep out of the reach of his Tail.</p>
            <p>If a Zealous Brother, I ſay, ſhould in this manner paint out the <hi>Church of England</hi> to his Flock, and endeavour to imprint in their Minds an Idea thus Foul and Monſtrous, of her teaching and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abominable Superſtitions and Idolatries; I would fain know of the <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> Whether this would be <hi>Repreſenting</hi> or <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> whether 'twould be a ſhewing her as ſhe is,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61788:19"/>
or as ſhe is not. I know, according to his Principles the Charges being not falſe as to matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and none being urg'd without ſome <hi>Reaſon,</hi> this Character ought not to be Entitled, <hi>The Church of England Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented.</hi> And yet methinks I cannot fancy 'twill be thought like her. But however it be, I am reſolv'd to compound, and not quarrel upon this ſcore. If he will not have this to be <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> in its <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> ſenſe, I am ready to allow, that the word <hi>Miſrepreſented,</hi> as it ſtands in the Title of my Book, is not to be taken in its <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> ſenſe, as it ſignifies Calumniating by <hi>Perjury</hi> only, and <hi>Lies;</hi> ſuch as was the Story of the <hi>Pilgrims, Screw'd Guns,</hi> and <hi>Black Bills,</hi> for the hanging of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and that of Stifling Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi> with a Pillow in the upper Court of <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> and Strangling him in the lower Court, before the Stables, with a twiſted Handkerchief, and laying it on the Papiſts: But in a leſs rigorous Signification, as it implies the Repreſenting a thing <hi>otherwiſe than it is,</hi> and putting on falſe Colours, whether by <hi>Wry Interpretations, Falſe Inferences, Malicious Applications, Weak Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,</hi> or any ſuch like Topick. For by whatſoever Method the thing is made to appear <hi>otherwiſe than it is,</hi> 'tis all the <hi>Miſrepreſenting</hi> I deſire, and equally fit for my purpoſe. And now I have ſo far comply'd with the <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> I hope the Talk of <hi>Miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as he ſays, will be over. And yet if he has a mind to prove once more, in other ten Sheets, That <hi>Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting</hi> is not to be taken in its <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> ſenſe let him do it; 'tis only Twelve-pence apiece more for the <hi>Curious:</hi> The <hi>Judicious</hi> will think it only worth a Smile, if ſo much.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61788:19"/>
But I am yet in Arrears, and muſt not part thus. For it ſeems the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> has a Complaint againſt me, and 'tis this, <hi>(pag,</hi> 3.) That in my laſt Reply, <hi>inſtead of defending my own Miſrepreſentations, which I ſo unjuſtly father'd upon them, I have pick'd up new Miſrepreſentations for him to Anſwer.</hi> And really I was much to blame, to look out for new <hi>Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations,</hi> when he had little to ſay againſt the former, except that they were not to be call'd <hi>Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations</hi> in a <hi>ſtrict</hi> ſenſe. But where did I father 'em upon any body? I laid them at no bodys door; and if ſome appear'd ſo ſolicitous in clearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they were ſuſpected to be Fathers, they may thank themſelves; I pointed at none.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, for the ſhewing they were none of my own Childiſh Conceits, I at length produc'd ſome eminent <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> deſcribing <hi>Popery</hi> with the ſame ill Features, and worſe than I had drawn it in my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a <hi>Papiſt Miſrepreſented:</hi> and firſt, the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of York.</hi> And here the Quarrel is, becauſe I left out the Authorities mention'd by that Prelate. And now the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> has inſerted thoſe Authorities, what do they make to his purpoſe, or againſt me? Were they all exact and true, which yet no Man will be able to make good, is every thing to be ſet forth for the Faith of a Church, which can be found in one Author, as it is by him, when he prefixes to them a <hi>He</hi> (that is, the <hi>Papiſt) muſt believe?</hi> Can the <hi>Church of England</hi> ſtand this Teſt? Would it not be Miſrepreſenting her, to Preface every extravagant Saying of her Members, with <hi>She believes,</hi> and <hi>She teaches?</hi> What ſignifie therefore the mentioning thoſe Authors, when the Queſtion is not, What ſome Private Authors ſay; but what the Church believes?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61788:20"/>
When the Archbiſhop therefore brings in the Papiſt profeſſing his Faith, with this ſolemn Proteſtation, <hi>We muſt believe;</hi> and then ſupports the Paradox with a ſingle Authority or two; as this was in him a piece of Artifice, not juſtifiable amongſt Friends; ſo the omiſſion of ſuch Teſtimonies was beyond the poſſibility of being a Deſign, unleſs it were of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the Credit of the Prelate.</p>
            <p>And tho' the Books mention'd were publiſh'd by Authority of Superiors; yet from ſuch Books cannot be fairly Repreſented the Faith of the <hi>Church,</hi> and whoſoever pretends to do it, is nothing leſs than a <hi>Miſrepreſenter:</hi> Nor will a <hi>Church of England-Man,</hi> I fancy, much queſtion this Truth, who, I believe, upon conſideration, will allow, that his Church may be eaſily Miſrepreſented, if every idle Opinion to be pick'd out of Books, which come forth with an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primatur,</hi> were to be inſerted into the Character of her <hi>Faith.</hi> And I cannot but wonder the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> ſhould urge this Diſpute now at this time, when we have ſeen a Book Publiſh'd by Authority of <hi>Pope, Cardinals,</hi> and other <hi>Dignitaries,</hi> and in a particular manner approv'd by them, and yet queſtion'd by ſome as not Repreſenting the Faith of the <hi>Church</hi> aright. Methinks, when a Book of this Authority comes to be diſputed, as not truly Repreſenting, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how every other Author with a petty Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is a ſufficient ground for a Repreſenter. But it muſt be ſo to drive the Buſineſs on. When a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhews forth the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> every thing that can be rak'd out of Books, is authentick enough for him to put into the Character: but when a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prelate Expounds the Doctrine of his Church, all the Authority of <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinals</hi> is not enough to ſet him up for a <hi>Repreſenter.</hi>

Beſides the Archbiſhop, I produc'd <hi>Sutcliff's Survey of Popery,</hi> in which he had laid to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> charge ſuch Tenets as are offenſive to every Chriſtian Ear, and as much deteſted by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as any other Society whatſoever. But I did not, it ſeems, ſet down his <hi>Reaſons</hi> and his <hi>Authorities.</hi> And this diſcovery puts the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> upon an outcry againſt the <hi>Repreſenter</hi>'s Honeſty. And yet where the Scandal is I cannot find. For I undertook for no more, than to ſhew the Doctrines laid by Mr. <hi>Sutcliff</hi> at the <hi>Papiſts</hi> door, and this I did ſincerely in his own words and ſenſe, and for his <hi>Reaſons;</hi> they were no Concern of mine, neither will the <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> after all his noiſe, put his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, as far as I ſee: for having ſumm'd them up, he concludes with this open hint, (p. 14.) <hi>If ſome Proteſtants have charg'd the Doctrines and Practices of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>with ſuch Conſequences as they cannot juſtifie, Wiſer Proteſtants diſown it.</hi> He muſt be a very foooliſh <hi>Repreſenter</hi> therefore, who ſhould go about to confute ſuch <hi>Reaſons</hi> which nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Repreſenting, and are ſuch as <hi>Wiſer Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> are aſham'd of.</p>
            <p>But now we are come to the Point of <hi>Honeſty,</hi> I cannot but admire a rare Knack the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> has eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Tranſlating</hi> honeſtly: one Inſtance he gives us in his former Reply, and another in this (p. 76.) where reciting a Prayer out of the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> he has theſe words in the Latin, <hi>

may then with reaſon cry out of <hi>curtailing</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty:</hi> But at preſent I think he has ſomething to mend at home in this Point. And for my part, I'le endeavour not to follow ſo ill an Example.</p>
            <p>And now at length we are arriv'd to the Queſtion concerning the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> and ſome Points Treated of by him. The <hi>Anſwerer</hi> has Debated the Matter in about One hundred Pages, and fairly invites the <hi>Repreſenter</hi> to diſpute it out, and two powerful Arguments he uſes to provoke him to it. The firſt is, (p. 26) That there is no reaſon to diſpute it at all: <hi>But the truth is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I know no reaſon there is for all this diſpute.</hi> So that the <hi>Repreſenter,</hi> if he will be advis'd, muſt leave off Character-making, and diſpute over an hundred Pages, <hi>becauſe there is no reaſon to diſpute.</hi> The ſecond Reaſon <hi>(ib.)</hi> is, becauſe I was not ſatisfi'd with his bare telling me he did not like my Religion, now he will give me ſome Reaſons for't. And this is a Reaſon like the former: For I never was concern'd with his not liking my Religion: I never told him, <hi>I was not ſatisfi'd with his bare telling me, he did not like it,</hi> that now he ſhould pretend for this Reaſon, to give me ſome Reaſons for it. All the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, diſpute he's reſolv'd, and in it muſt, tho' by head and ſhoulders; the Repreſenting Humour do's not pleaſe him, and Character-making is an aggrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, 'tis too fair a way of dealing for him, and lays too open the Myſtery of Iniquity: and therefore he has no better way to quit himſelf of this trouble, than to draw me into an Ocean of Diſputes, that ſo <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting</hi> may be at an end.</p>
            <p>Thus he labours to change the Scene, and to tempt me out of the way; but his weighty Reaſons do not work ſo powerfully, as to render me uncapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61788:21"/>
And therefore till we have other two Reaſons given, I'le be no other than <hi>Repreſenter</hi> ſtill. My buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and not of <hi>Right,</hi> or <hi>de jure;</hi> and ſince he has bulkt out his <hi>Anſwer</hi> with Nine Sheets of the Fifteen, fill'd up with an <hi>occaſional Diſcourſe,</hi> I'le take the freedom gravely to turn over thoſe his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>occaſional</hi> Pages, tho' I fear he'll take it ill; but I cannot help him. We <hi>Wiſe Converts</hi> do not love to go out of our way, but upon very good grounds; and therefore if the two Reaſons he has given for this at preſent, do not move us, 'tis becauſe they are too ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, and not ſuited to our Capacity.</p>
            <p>But however, he requires ſatisfaction as to the Points he has there handled, and I ſhall remit him to ſuch Books in which theſe Controverſies have been diſcuſs'd at large. And for my ſelf ſhall ſit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the Title he often allows me of a <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter.</hi> And as to the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> to whom I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd for the juſtifying the Character of the <hi>Papiſt Repreſented,</hi> he has undertaken his own Vindication, and needs not the aſſiſtance of another Hand.</p>
            <p>All the Concern I have, is to declare, that to aſſent to the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> as Expounded by this Prelate, is ſufficient for any to be receiv'd into the Communion of our Church; we require no other Terms. And if the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> finds different Explications given by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> and others; tho' the Books are approv'd, yet there's no obligation of being of their mind in things that are diſputed amongſt Divines. 'Tis in vain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to clamour againſt the Opinions of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or <hi>Suarez, Scotus,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>looſe, extravagant,</hi> harſh or unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince it ſuffices for <hi>Catholick</hi> Communion, to ſubſcribe to the Points treated by <hi>M. Condom,</hi> in the ſenſe he has expounded them; if they are more ſoft or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61788:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſweet than has hitherto be apprehended, or deliver'd formerly by others, let them but be receiv'd in that ſoft and ſweet manner, and no more is requir'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore nothing more than a Cavil, to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other eminent approv'd Authors, are not as authentic a Rule for the Expoſition of the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> and the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom.</hi> We have no concern in theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, our whole buſineſs is only this; Whether the embracing the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> as expounded by the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> be ſufficient for a Perſon to be receiv'd into the Communion of our Church. And ſince this is evidently ſo, and that all thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thus, are actually acknowledg'd Members of this Church upon this Aſſent, what needs the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter,</hi> who follows his Explication, any farther Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy? If any Perſon therefore may be thus receiv'd a Member of our Church, upon the Terms I have propos'd in the Matters there handled, I have Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the <hi>Papiſt</hi> aright. And amongſt all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that have been publiſh'd, only thoſe have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to me, which endeavour to ſhew the falſity of this. 'Tis no wonder therefore I have wav'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of many things that have been publiſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me under the Title of an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> ſince of the Forty Sheets that have come upon this Errand into the World, there has not been three, but what have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their Buſineſs they were ſent upon. If it be an Omiſſion therefore not to return an Anſwer to ſuch things as are not ſpoken to me, 'tis eaſily making a Liſt of Omiſſions. But let me ſee where it has been prov'd, that 'tis not ſufficient for a <hi>Catholick</hi> to believe as I have propos'd, as to thoſe Particulars. And if it has had no Anſwer, it ſhall have one.</p>
