            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Reasons against the rendering of
Our sworne and subscribed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith.</head>
            <p>1.
IF wee should rendér Our subscribed Covenant, wee
can not bee free of the great guiltinesse of Perjurie before
GOD: for as Wè were drawn by necessitie to enter into a
mutuall Union and Conjunction amongst Our selves. So are
Wee bound not only by the Laws of GOD and nature, but by
Our solemne Oath and Subscription, against all dangerous
or divisive motions, by all lawfull meanes to promove and
observe the same without violation, and not suffer our selves
by whatsoever suggestion, allurement, or terror, directly or
indirectly to be divided, or drawn from it: And it is too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that no mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion can be more divisive upon the one
side, nor can we upon the other part more directly give
way to division, then willingly, and with our own consent
to render the band of our union and conjunction to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
that no testimony thereof may be any more extant.</p>
            <p>2. Wee would distinguish (except wee will decave our
selves) between <hi>Res Iurata,</hi> that which is sworn, and <hi>Iuratio</hi>
our swearing thereof: for although all the generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
points contained in our subscribed Covenant were to
be insert in another Covenant, to be made by the expresse
commandement of authority; yet to rander our sworne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
were both to passe from our swearing thereof, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
si res esset integra,</hi> as if we had never sworne and subscribed;
and also to destroy that which we have beene doing, as a
thing unlawfull, and to be repented of. It were not only to
make our oath to be no oath, our subscription no subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and our testimony no testimony, but really to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Confesse our selves in this to have beene trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours;
so that we can neither clame any right to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of GOD, nor think our selves obliged in any duety to
GOD by vertue of that oath. It must ever be remembred
that oaths and perjuries are multiplied, not only according
to the diversity of the things that are sworne, but according
<pb facs="tcp:5989:2"/>
to the sweareing of the same thing at diverse times; so oft as
we sweare and subscribe the same thing, by so many oathes
and obligations are we bound unto GOD, and consequently the
rendering of our subscription, is the renunceing of that indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd and obligation, although possibly by another we
may s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nd bound or sworne.</p>
            <p>3. Our voluntary renewing of our Covenant with GOD,
carieth greater evidence of a free service to GOD: then if it
had beene done by expresse commandement of authority: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the power of GOD makeing his people so willing, and the
readinesse and sincerity of the people is so much the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
like as the LORD from heaven hath testified his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
by the wonderfull workings of his Spirit in the hearts
both of pastors and people, to their great comfort and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in every duety, above any measure that ever hath beene
heard of in this Land; And therefore to give any token of
recalling the same were unthankfully to misregard the work of
GOD, and to quite all the comforts and corroborations that the
people of GOD have to their great joy experienced at this time.</p>
            <p>4. We have decla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed before GOD and the world, that this
our Covenant, as it now stand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th sworne and subscribed, is
lawfull and necessary, that it is done in obedience to the
commandement of GOD, conforme to the practice of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and according to the laudable example of our religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors,
who by the like oath have obliged us to the substance
and tenor of this: And therefore if we should now by rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our Covenant un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o that which we have done, we should
deny the commandement of God, condemne the examples in
scripture, and the practis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in this kirk, and precondemne all
like commendable cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ses to be taken by posterity in the like
exigence.</p>
            <p>5. No Covenant in things civile can be alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red or rescin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
without consent of the parties with whom it is made; But
Our Covenant is a religious Covenant made with GOD and
amongst Our selves, and therefore can not be rendered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the expresse consent of the meanest of all the subscrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who justly for their comfort may crave of Us all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
and performance thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5989:2"/>
6. There is no appearance that such as affect the prelates and
their courses, will be moved to sweare and subscribe all the
parts of this Covenant: As for instance, To labour by all meanes
to recover the former puritie and libertie of the Gospel, as it was
established and professed, before the novations alreadie introdu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced,
or to declare that they undoubtedly do believe, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
and evils contained in Our Supplications; Complaints,
and Protestations are abjured in the Confession of Faith, as other
heads of Poperie expresly contained therein.</p>
            <p>7. Although all the points of the subscribed Covenant were
ratified by act of Parliament, yet could we not render the subscri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bed
Covenants: Because acts of Parliament are changeable, and of
the nature of a civile ratification: And it is necessarie, that this
Our Oath being a religious and perpetuall obligation, should
stand in vigour for the more firme establishing of religion in
Our owne time, and in the generations following.</p>
            <p>8. All the world may justly wonder at Our inconstancie, and
Our enemies who in their insolencie are readie to insult upon Us
at the least occasion, would not cease to mock at Us, and traduce
Us as perjured Covenant-breakers, and troublers of the peace of
the kirk and kingdome, without any necessary cause.</p>
            <p>9. Although we do not compare the Scriptures of God wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h
a written confession of faith, yet as the rendering of the Bible w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
the sin of <hi>Traditores</hi> of old, and a signe of the denyall of the
truth contained therein: so the rendering of Our Confession of
faith, so solemnly sworne and subscribed, for staying the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>urse of

               </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
of religion, could be interpreted to be no lesse, then a reall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall
of Our Faith before men, in a time when GOD calleth
for the Confession thereof.</p>
            <p>10. Many fair promises have beene made, for not urging
of articles already concluded, and for not troubling us with
any further novations, which being beleived, have ensnared
many, and drawne them on to doe that which otherwise they
would not have done, all which promises have beene broken
and denyed, when the performance was craved. And why shall
We not expect the like in this case, especially where the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
will be found to be more hard and difficile?</p>
