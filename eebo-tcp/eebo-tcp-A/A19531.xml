                  <note>In 3 parts; "Comfortable and fruitfull meditations on the Lords Prayer" and "Briefe and profitable meditations on the 7. penitentiall psalmes" each have separate dated title pages; register is continuous.</note>
                  <note>The catechism, which the Stationer's Register entry indicates was "collected by a poore man" of the Company of Stationers, has a few phrases resembling those in STC 5962 but is so condensed, rearranged, and adapted as to be a different text; it may be related to STC 21496.3. The meditations on the penitential psalmes are taken from G. Du Vair's "Méditation sur les pseaumes de la pénitence de David", in a different translation from STC 7373.6. --STC.  Du Vair's Méditation was published as part of 'La saincte philosophie'.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>O My God,<note place="margin">Our Father.</note> I come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, as to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Father of all the world; euen vnto thee doe I make my ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who in the creation and preſeruation of all thy works, haſt manifeſted thy more then fatherly loue and affection. I come to thee, as to my true and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb facs="tcp:17237:17"/>
Father, which haſt not onely giuen me my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, life, and motion, as thou diddeſt to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but powred out thy ſpirit vpon me, and lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ſoule with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly rayes of thy diuinity. I come vnto thee, my God, beeing regenerate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into thy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by thy free grace and boundleſs bounty. I come, hauing appeaſed the anger of my Father, by the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my Redeemer? I come, becauſe it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee to call mee, and to ſpread out thy gracious armes, ready to receiue me.
<pb facs="tcp:17237:17"/>
Receiue me then, not in the auſteritie of a iuſt Iudge, but in the tender compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a mercifull Father. And accept this my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prayer, which my heart hath conceiued, my lippes diſcloſe, and my voice doth ſend vp to the fauourable eares of my heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And ſince it is thy good pleaſure, O Lord, that I thus cal vpon thee, Grant,<note place="margin">Which art in Heauen.</note> O gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t I beſeech thee graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, that it may reach euen vnto thee which art in heauen. I know aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that thy throne is in the higheſt heauens; that the Sunne, the Moone, and the
<pb facs="tcp:17237:18"/>
ſtars, are vnder thy feet, that the earth is but a point, to thee, and I the leaſt part of the earth, yea, leſſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. VVho then hath made mee ſo hardy as to dare to lift vp mine eyes to thy moſt glorious Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie? It is euen thou my God; who haſt ſet thy ſelfe ſo high, to behold all the workes of thine hands, to ſupply all our wants, and dayly to diſtill downe thy grace into our hearts, as a moſt ſweet morning deaw. It is thou, who haſt ſaid, Aske and yee ſhall receiue: Call vpon mee, and I will heare thee. But how can I
<pb facs="tcp:17237:18"/>
call vpon thee, vnleſſe I put my confidence in thee, and take faſt hold of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes by a firme and faſt faith? O then infuſe it into my ſoule, and engraft it in my heart; (for it is a gift that commeth from the ſtore-houſe of thy grace.) And as ſometimes thou didſt cauſe the mouthes of babes and ſucklings to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound thy praiſe, ſo at this time gouerne the Infancy, and ſtrengthen the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my hart, that it may ſend out that prayer which is acceptable in thy ſight. And that it may appeare that the prayer of my lips

bleſſed all the Nations of the earth? Wilt thou bee praiſed, as Lord of Hoſtes, the God of power; or as the Sauiour and Redeemer of the world?

glorious Temple to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and admire thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie; may wholly apply all our faculties and vnderſtanding, to the appre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hending of thy will.<note place="margin">Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come.</note> That ſo beeing all of vs re-vnited and linked in one and the ſelfe-ſame deſire to ſerue thee, thy Kingdome may come: that wee hauing caſt off the yoake of ſin, which hath ſo long held vs in thraldome, thy loue alone may rule in our conſciences full of happineſs and true felicitie.

of our ſelues; and to bee Maiſters of our ſelues, is more then ſoueraigne principalitie. A ſweet thing it is, to ſerue thee, O my God: thy yoake is eaſie: and al the tribute thou exacteſt of vs, is onely that wee will be willing to be made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie.

But what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beiſance can wee render thee? How can wee attaine to that height of perfection
<pb facs="tcp:17237:22"/>
as is due vnto thee? who is able to ſound the depth of thy thoughts? or who is able to fulfill thy will? All wee can doe,<note place="margin">Thy will be done.</note> is but to pray vnto thee that thy will may bee done. For ſeeing that thou art euen goodnes it ſelfe, and therefore wilt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is good, and that with thee to will and to doe, is all one; wee doe in this Prayer whollie commit our ſelues to thy will, who art neuer wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to will vs well, and to do whatſoeuer thou in thy goodnes knoweſt to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for vs. Whatſoeuer thou haſt vvilled, O Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:17237:22"/>
hath been done: and from this thy good wil and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as from an euer-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fountaine, are deriued ſo many good things, as the whole Globe of the earth is filled, and the immenſe circle of the heauens is beautified therewith. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue then this thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto vs: and foraſmuch as thy loue is as fire, (which augmenteth where it mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with combuſtible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) and that it encreaſeth in wel-doing to vs, euen to vs poore miſerable wretches, in whoſe miſery and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, it may finde matter enough to worke vpon)
<pb facs="tcp:17237:23"/>
when I pray to thee, my God, that thy will may bee done, the intent of my prayer is, that it may pleaſe thee to roote out of mine hart all worldly wil, which ſpringing from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fleſh, is no waies compatible with the law of the ſpirit: That thou wilt neuer giue me the raines to liue at mine owne pleaſure: and ſeeing that thou haſt vouchſafed to honour me with ſo high a title as to be ſtiled thy ſonne, thou wilt not emancipate or giue me ouer to mine affections; but keepe me vnder the rodde of thy lawe, vnder the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telage

That togither with thy bountie, receiuing alſo thy benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we ſettle not our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections vpon worldly, and tranſitorie things; ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

Let not the taſte of this earthly bread make vs to forget that heauenly Manna, that bread of life, which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth and cheriſheth our feeble ſoules, filleth our mouthes with heauenlie plenty, and maketh vs the liuing Temples of our God, by receiuing him into our bodies through a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and liuely faith.

And ſince it hath pleaſed thee to make vs the veſſels and recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of thy diuinitie, purifie and cleanſe our hearts, and renew and rectifie all our affections, that there may bee nothing to cauſe thee retire, and leaue vs deſtitute of thy grace and our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Forgiue vs our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</note> But wee cannot bee cleanſed, vnleſſe thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue

Neither haue wee ſo much as one mite toward the paying of our ranſome or acquiting our debt. Of thee therefore muſt wee expect forgiuenes, who haſt once redeemed vs by thy preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud, and made vs free from Satan our arch enemie: but wee daily fall againe into the hands of our enemies by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting millions of ſins which bring into ſlauerie, and

make vs lyable to grieuous puniſhment. Yet let not this O my God, cauſe thee to ſhutte vp that treaſure from vs, whence wee may take the price of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Let not, O Lord, our obſtinacie in back-ſliding, take away thy conſtancy in pardoning: but let thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull hand be euer ready to reforme vs. For ſinne euer ſince the fall of our firſt father Adam, is as it were incorporated into our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fleſh, and dayly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and groweth with vs: ſo that the older we grow, the fowler and filthier wee appeare, vnleſſe it pleaſe

giue vs a calme and peaceable ſpirit, which may foſter and maintaine in vs vnity and brotherly loue, teaching vs to ſupport with gentleneſs one anothers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. For wee can not but acknowledge, O Lord, how eaſily we ſlippe, yea ſtumble, and tumble, in the ſlippery paths of this refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie life. Too too ſlender is our owne force and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to hold vs on foot, and vphold vs againſt thoſe whirle-windes which are euer ready to driue vs headlong into Iniquitie.

That we may call to minde that they are but as a cloud, which for a while fleeteth from one country to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſuddenly vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away and appeareth no more; &amp; that many times that gold and ſiluer which wee heape vp with much ſweate and trauell, doth ſerue but to the procuring of our owne damnation. And if it ſhall pleaſe thee to beſtowe vpon vs riches in greater aboundance; grant

vnto vs likewiſe the grace to vſe them well, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly and charitably to communicate them to ſuch as haue want. For the whole earth is thine, and wee are but the tillers and tenants thereof: our goods belong vnto thee, and wee are but thy depoſitaries and vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals. So that if we refuſe to impart them to ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them in thy name, thou maieſt not onely put vs out of poſſeſsion, but make vs pay the vſurie of our ingratitude &amp; vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, we begge of thee, that the falſe luſtre

                  <p>Furthermore, that this ſame deceitfull lure, which wee ſo much admire (after which we runne our ſelues out of breath, and all but to our ruine) is but like an

                  <p>Giue me therefore, O my God, conſtancie, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw mine affections, and withhold my ſight from ſuch vanities; make mee only ambitious of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; let my ſpirit bee ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to immortalitie, that ſhee make no repoſe in the choaking ſmoke of this world.
