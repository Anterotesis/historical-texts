         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas We are well informed, and do visibly perceive a present scarcity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
throughout the circuit of Our whole Dominions, occasioned by the late il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal
and promiscuous buying and selling of all sorts of Gold and Silver at high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
rates then ever We or any of Our Royal Progenitors have allowed in Our
Mint, which therefore is exported, whereby no Gold or Silver can be brought
thither, but to the loss of such as bring the same, which ('tis probable) no man
will do: And so in consequence a great decay or utter ruine of the general Stock
of Moneys (both for present and future times) must necessarily follow, if this
mischief be not speedily prevented by a severe and strict observance of those many
and wholesom Statutes, Laws, and Proclamations (both antient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern)
made and Ordained by Our Royal Predecessors and Progenitors in that behalf. And We find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and humbly acknowledging it hath pleased Almighty God to bless Our Kingdoms with a plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and rich Dowry of native and home-bred Commodities, both by Sea and Land, above some of Our
Neighbours, the Exportation and Product whereof may bring great Treasure, both of Gold and Silver
into Our several Kingdoms, which so brought in, should there remain a perpetual Stock not to go forth
again, but be preserved as well for making and maintaining of just and honorable Wars Offensive or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58562:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as for adorning and furnishing Our Dominions in time of Peace, and strengthening the same
with Reputation; which followeth such Princes as are esteemed rich in Treasure: And considering the
makers and Ordainers of the aforesaid Statutes, Laws and Proclamations, had prudently and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
foreseen, that if no Gold or Silver should be suffered (directly or indirectly) to be Exported out of
this Nation, it must necessarily follow, that the Foreign Commodities, which are for the most part but
delicacies, superfluities, or trifles (which in it self is a thing intolerable) could not possibly be Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in greater quantities, then the native Commodities of Our Dominions might at least balance and
answer in Commerce, because no other means was left to satisfie or supply the Overplus by Our own
Gold or Silver; and by continuance of such course, these Nations might have been secure, and certain
never to have run behinde-hand, or become indebted, and yet still remain in great possibility to increase
in Wealth and Treasure, even as it ever happens to Prudent single Persons, whereof the Publick is the
compact. Upon these and many other weighty considerations, We, with the Advice of Our Privy
Councel, are resolved to follow the safe and solid ways of Our Royal Progenitors, for the good of all
Our loving Subjects: And We do therefore publish and declare Our Royal Will and Pleasure to be,
and We do hereby streightly Command and Charge, That no person or persons, Alien or Denizen, or
other Subject of what estate or quality soever, do at any time hereafter (without Our special Licence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
granted, or hereafter to be obtained) transport, carry, or convey, or attempt, consent, assist, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to export, carry, or convey out of Our Dominions, and Gold or Silver, in Plate, Iewels,
Coyn, Uessels, Gold-smiths work, Bullion in mass o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> otherwise whatsoever, upon pain of Our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Indignation and displeasure, and such further punishment, as by the Laws of this Realm may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on them for such their offence. And to the end that none of Our loving Subjects may hereafter
be deceived, or deceive themselves through ignorance of the many and good Laws and Statutes in this
behalf made by Our Royal Ancestors, and now in force, We have thought it fit and requisite to insert
the particular branches thereof in this Our Proclamation (That is to say) The Statute made at <hi>York</hi> in
the ninth year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, called, <hi>The Statute of Money,</hi> First, Sixth, and Ninth Chapters,
whereby it is provided, that from thenceforth none should carry any Sterling out of the Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
nor Silver in Plate, nor Uessel of Gold or Silver, upon pain of forfeiture of the same Money, Plate
or Uessel: And that the Mayor and Bayliffs in every Port, where Merchants and Ships be, should
take an Oath of the Masters and Merchants of Ships going and coming again, that they should do no
fraud against the provision of that Law in any point, and that good and streight Ward should be made in
all places upon the Sea-coasts, in Havens, and elsewhere, where any arrival should be, by good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
men thereto sworn, that in the Kings Name they should make diligent search, that no man, of
what estate or condition soever, should carry out of the Realm Sterling Money, Silver in coyn, either
of Gold, or Silver, or Plate, nor Uessel of Gold or Silver without the Kings Licence, as by the same
Statute (amongst other things) more fully doth appear: and one other Statute made in the Fifth year
of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, the second Chapter, whereby it was assented and accorded, That no manner of
People, upon pain of as much as they might forfeit, should privily or apertly send or bring, or do to be sent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58562:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or brought out of this Realm, any Gold or Silver in Money, Bullion, Plate or Uessel, but in certain
Cases in the same Statute mentioned, as by the same Statute likewise (amongst other things) more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth appear. And one other Statute made in the second year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
whereby the King, to obvent the subtilty of them the would do fraud or deceit to him, contrary to
the said Statutue made in the fifth year of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, did Ordain and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish,
That if from thenceforth any Searcher of the King might finde Gold or Silver in Coyn or in Mass,
in the keeping of any that should be passing, or upon his passage, in any ship or Uessel for to go out of any
Port, Haven or Créek of the Realm, without the Kings special Licence, that Gold or Silver should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
to the King (saving his reasonable expences) as by the same Statute more at large it doth and
may appear: And so much of one Statute made in the second year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, the sixth
Chapter, whereby it is Ordained and Established, That no Gold nor Silver should be carried
out of the Realm contrary to the form of the Statutes before made (except in certain cases therein expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
upon pain of forfeiture of the value of the sum of money so carried out of the Realm, as by the same
statute, amongst other things, at large appeareth: And one other statute made in the five and twentieth
year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, the twelfth Chapter, whereby it was accorded, That it should be lawful
for every man to exchange gold for silver, so that no man hold the same as exchanged, nor take any profit
for making of such exchange, upon pain of forfeiture of the money so exchanged (except the Kings Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers.)
And one other Statute made in the fifth year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, the nineteenth Chapter,
whereby it was Enacted, That if any person or persons after the first day of <hi>April</hi> then next following,
should exchange any coyned Gold, coyned Silver, or money, giving, receiving, or paying any more in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
benefit, profit, or advantage for it, then the same then was or should be declared by the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
to be currant for within this Realm, and other his Dominions, That then all the said coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gold, Silver, and money so exchanged, and every part and parcel thereof should be forfeit, and the
parties so offending should suffer Imprisonment for the space of one whole year, and make Fine at the
Kings pleasure: And one other part of the said Statute made in the said second year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
sixth, the sixth Chapter, whereby it was Ordained &amp; established, That the Merchants Aliens should finde
Surety in the Chancery, every Company for them of their Company, that none of them should bring out of
the Realm no Gold nor Silver against the form of the said Statute, upon pain of the forfeiture of the same
Gold or Silver, or the value of the same. Which said Laws and Statutes have also been confirmed and
strengthened by sundry Orders and Proclamations of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi>
Our Royal Father of blessed memory, whereby this Nation hath flourished for many hundred of years,
famous for her constant Sterling Standard, and renowned for her plenteous stock of Moneys, and
magnificence in Plate, until these late distracted times, wherein the great Solemnities and Reverence
due to the Laws of God and man, have been so miserably troden down, contemned and violated.
And We do Publish, Charge and Command, aswel Our Lord Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> Chancellor of Our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58562:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Exchequer, and Warden of the Cinque-Ports, and his Deputies, and all other Our Iudges, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons

Our Mint) Customers, Comptrollers, and Searchers and their Deputies, and Waiters in all
and every of Our Ports, and all other Officers and Ministers to whom it may appertain, and to all
Our Subjects in general, that all and every the Statutes and Proclamations aforesaid, and all and
every Branch and Clause thereof, so as aforesaid, respectively made against the Exportation of Gold or
Silver, in coyn or Bullion, Iewels, Plate or Uessels, and buying and selling of all sorts of Gold or
Silver above the Rates appointed in Our Mint, or other things therein contained; as also against
Culling, Washing, or otherwise Diminishing Our currant Moneys, be straightly kept, duely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and diligently and carefully prosecuted and put in execution, upon pain not only of the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Forfeitures in the said Statutes or any of them contained, but also of Our high Indignation
and Displeasure.</p>
            <p>And We do further by these Presents straightly Command and Charge all Merchants and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
Masters of Ships, Mariners, Passengers, and all other Our loving Subjects whatsoever,
that shall have any notice of Gold or Silver in coyn, Iewels, Plate, Uessels, Bullion or otherwise
whatsoever, which shall be hereafter Exported (without Our special Licence) or Shipped for Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(reasonable Charges for the Uoyage onely excepted) or shall be gathered or got together by
change or otherwise, with intention to Export, or put into the hands of such as shall Export it, That
they forthwith reveal the same to Our Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> Our Under-Treasurer, or other Our
Officers before mentioned for the time being; for which their Service, every Searcher, or other person
that shall discover or seize any Gold or Silver in Coyn, Iewels, Plate, in Mass or otherwise, in
any Ship, Uessel, or Plate intended to be Exported, shall have and receive in reward, the one half
of the Gold or Silver, or the value thereof, being seized and recovered to Our use: And on the other
part, if they shall not discover the same as aforesaid, they shall incur and receive such condign punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as by the Laws of this Our Realm, and Our Prerogative Royal may be inflicted on them.</p>
            <p>And whereas there is daily a great consumption of the heavy currant Silver, Coyns and Bullion of
the Kingdom, in making Gold and Silver Wyer, Gold and Silver Threed, Spangles, Ones, Purles
and Lace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> also by the slight and deceitful adulterate making these aforesaid Manufactures of course
Silver, under Sterling, to the great damage and abuse of the Wearers of Gold and Silver Lace,
and likewise a vast expence and waste of Gold in all sort of Gildings, whereby many irregularities and
abuses are daily practised therein, to the great waste of the Gold of Our Kingdom, We do intend, and
<pb facs="tcp:58562:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shall in due time take such strict course, as shall reduce the makers of these Manufactures into such
order, that all these abuses formerly put upon Our Subjects, shall for the future be prevented, and
these Manufactures of Gold and Silver dusely regulated and assayed according to the Laws and
Statutes of Our Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And We further Will and Command, That this Our Proclamation be set up and fixed openly to
be read in all and every of Our Custom-houses in this Our Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of
