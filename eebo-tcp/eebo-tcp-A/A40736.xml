            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Epiſtle Dedicatory
TO
URANIA.</head>
            <p>IT is your Command, Madam, that I ſhould
make public the enſuing Oration on <hi>Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>
and your Commands can be no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
than your Eyes. But beſides, that it is
not in the power of your Slave to diſobey
you, I can pay no leſs a Tribute to the <hi>Manes</hi>
of our deceas'd Brother in ſervitude, than to
give this public Teſtimony of the reſpect I
have for his Virtues.</p>
            <p>Other Lovers not ſo diſintereſſed as my
ſelf, might perhaps triumph at the death of
ſo conſiderable a Rival as was <hi>Favorite.</hi> But
I, Madam, who take ſhare in all your Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
am ſo far from rejoicing at it, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
a Trophy on his untimely Deſtiny,
<pb facs="tcp:53405:3"/>
that I profeſs all the Conſolation I can fetch
From Philoſophy, from the <hi>Lyceum,</hi> the <hi>Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
or the <hi>Tuſculanum,</hi> is not able to ſupport me
under the deep ſenſe I have of your unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Loſs.</p>
            <p>Nor can we condemn, or think unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
your Grief. Were not the World ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
acquainted with the deſerts of <hi>Favorite,</hi>
yet even thoſe who were altogether ſtrangers
to his good Qualities wou'd deduce a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conſequence, that there was ſomething
moſt emphatically, moſt conſpicuouſly ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in him, which ſhould prefer hint to <hi>Urania'</hi>s
favour. For certainly a Woman of your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
a Woman ſo nice a Judge, and ſo
bountiful a Rewarder of Merit, whether in
Man or Brute, cou'd never beſtow ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
a portion of your Kindneſs on a Dogg,
whoſe Endowment did not give him a title to
it. In fine, you fed, you cheriſhed, you careſs'd
him. By your Favour you rais'd him more
above the Animals of his own Species, than
Animals themſelves are exalted above the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Vegetables.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53405:4"/>
'Tis true, he created ſome private Jealouſies,
ſome Diſcontents in the Breaſts of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miters:
But to do publick juſtice to his aſhes,
I muſt ſay that of <hi>Favorite,</hi> which cannot,
without manifeſt injury to truth, be affirm'd
of all the other Favorites of Princes, of the
<hi>Richelieus,</hi> of the <hi>Mazarins,</hi> of the <hi>Wolſeys,</hi> of
the <hi>Buckinghams,</hi> of the <hi>Lerma</hi>'s, and of the
<hi>Olivares,</hi> that in the Univerſal corruption of
a moſt degenerate Age, he preſerv'd an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſh'd,
an inviolable Integrity to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs;
that he did not give Intelligence to a
Forreign Court, of the private Reſolutions
of State that were taken in the Cabinet at
home; that when Affairs of Importance
called her Abroad, he did not ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
her, nor ſleep ingloriouſly upon the
Couch; that he ſtood unmov'd, ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken,
againſt all the Attacks of Bribes;
that he did not cruſh calamitous Merit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
him, nor ſupplant the Obſtacle in his
way above him; that he never Smiled where
he intended to ruine. In ſhore, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
the little Artifices of the Great, as the
<pb facs="tcp:53405:5"/>
Politick Nod, the ſlaviſh Cringe, the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Bow, the betraying Hugg, and the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Whiſper.</p>
            <p>But I will enlarge no farther on his Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
ſince I am ſenſible that by my want of
Ability he has ſuffer'd too much already in
the enſuing Oration. Expect not then that
after I have injur'd your Dog, I ſhould be
ſo hardy as to attempt your Panegyric, that
is, to injure you. For, Madam, ſhould I
employ all the Tragical forces of Rhetorick,
ſhould I laviſh all the magnificence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and all the ſplendid pomp of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tephors,
I ſhould fall infinitely ſhort of my
Divine Argument. Eloquence here loſes its
uſe, the gaudy Train of Tropes and Figures
are but vain and empty Oſtentation. We
cannot ſpeak Figuratively of you, we cannot
ſpeak of you with exaggeration. You tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
all <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> your Merit riſes above
the ſublimeſt flights of Fancy. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay, that all Virtues unite to make a
bright Conſtellation in you, and that if
there were a general ſhipwrack of your Sex,
<pb facs="tcp:53405:3"/>
we ſhould find the ſcatter'd Perfections ofWomankind collected in your ſelf.</p>
            <p>Other Ladies, if they have their Graces
have their Defects withal. <hi>Angelica</hi> talks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the merit of her Face, and what ſhe
gains by her Eyes, ſhe loſes by her Tongue.
<hi>Horatia</hi> overwhelms us by the ſplendor, and
leads us Captives by the Arts of her Dreſs,
who were ſhe to be ſeen in <hi>diſhabillee</hi> in the
<hi>ruelle,</hi> would ſigh to ſee her ſelf no longer
the Object of Adoration. <hi>Melaniſſa</hi> appears
with advantage in the ſimplicity of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artful
Attire, who cannot ſuppreſs the pomp
and Ornament of Dreſs. <hi>Sempronia</hi> treads
on every Heart when ſhe Dances, but gains
no Triumph when ſhe Sings. <hi>Belinda</hi> charms
us with her Voice, but is diſagreeable at a
Ball. <hi>Oriana,</hi> with her melancholy Air,
gives us ſad Cauſe of Melancholy, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
our Laughter with her own. <hi>Aurelia</hi>
has Wit, has Youth, has Beauty to fix the
moſt roving Heart, but cannot fix her
own. <hi>Lindamira</hi> woul'd make the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Lover in the Univerſe, but wants the
<pb facs="tcp:53405:4"/>
Charms to make us ſo. <hi>Aemilia</hi> ſpeaks fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
of all the World, but gives all
the World juſt occaſion not to ſpeak fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
of her. <hi>Caſſandra</hi>'s Innocence is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Cenſure of others, but the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of others cannot defend themſelves
from the Cenſure of <hi>Caſſandra.</hi> But in you,
Madam, we find united all the Advantages
of the happieſt of your Sex, without any of
their Defects. What the moſt celebrated
Wit of this Age has ſaid, of the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Beauty of a neighbouring Kingdom,
may with equal Juſtice be applied to you.
One may be conſtant to you, with all the
pleaſure of inconſtancy. We change every
moment for your Graces, but are ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
to your Perſon. But, Madam, as I
ſhall not offer Incenſe to you that has been
preſented at other. Altars, ſo neither will I
attempt your Compariſon with the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
Beauties of the former, or preſent
Ages. When ever we think or talk of you,
Madam, the Diſpute is not with other, but
with your ſelf, which Part, which Feature,
which Poſture is moſt agreeable; whether
<pb facs="tcp:53405:5"/>
you charm us moſt when you Move or Sit,
Stand or Walk; Whether, you throw the
Lover down more with your hand, than you
trample on him with your foot; whether is
moſt powerful, the Eloquence of your Eyes,
<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that of your Tongue; whether is moſt
delicate, your Tread in the Conduct of your
Life, or that of your Gate: In ſhort, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your Thoughts are brighter than your
Looks, and whether is moſt boundleſs your
Fancy, to the Empire of your Beauty. Thus
it is with you, Madam, as with Kings or
Princes, whom we dare not bring in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with their Inferiours, but meaſure
them by themſelves, and compare one part
of their Life by the other.</p>
            <p>Thus, Madam, by the common Fate of
all Dedicators I have ſuffer'd my ſelf to be
carried into the ſtream of Panegyric, even
after I had proteſted againſt it; but I ſhall
proſecute this Argument no farther, which
I am not able to ſuſtain; the dreadful fate
of <hi>Salmoneus</hi> ought to deterr me, who died
by the Bolts he endeavour'd to imitate. By
obſerving this conduct, I ſhall not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb facs="tcp:53405:6"/>
my own Reputation, but the Intereſt
too and Repoſe of Mankind: For ſhould I
perſiſt to draw your fair Picture, ſhould I
deſcend into the detail of your innumerable
Excellencies and Perfections, there would
fall ten thousand Victims at your Feet, and
this <hi>Epistle Dedicatory</hi> might prove perhaps, in
ſome ſenſe, a Funeral Oration on the Reader.</p>
            <p>I ſee, Madam, your Breaſt is capable of
tender Impreſſions. You can be mov'd at the
Fate of <hi>Favorite,</hi> (no wonder he out-ran Us
in your Affection, ſince four Legs will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be too many for two) take pitty then
of his Orator. You can weep to ſee him
dead, pay then a Teat to the Funerals of the
Man, whom your ſelf, whom your own
bright Eyes have ſlain.</p>

Funeral- Oration
UPON
FAVORITE,
My Lady
Lap-Dog.</head>
            <p>I Am commanded, Gentlemen, to do a Thing to
day without a <hi>Preſident:</hi> For I believe I am the
firſt <hi>Orator</hi> who ever yet undertook to ſpeak the
Funeral-Oration of a <hi>Dog.</hi> But if <hi>Catullus</hi> cou'd
write an Elegy upon <hi>Lesbia's Sparrow;</hi> if <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
cou'd build and dedicate A <hi>Town</hi> to the Memory of
his <hi>Horſe;</hi> can you think it ſtrange that <hi>Urania,</hi> no leſs
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53405:8"/>
llluſtrious by her <hi>Beauty,</hi> than that Monarch was by his
<hi>Achievments'</hi> and who has gain'd as wide an Empire
by her <hi>Eyes,</hi> as he did by his Arms: I ſay, if <hi>Urania</hi>
is willing to celebrate the Funerals of the <hi>Dog</hi> ſhe lov'd
ſo dearly?</p>
            <p>Beſides, As <hi>Favorite</hi> eminently excell'd all other <hi>Dogs</hi>
during his <hi>Life,</hi> ſo it is but reaſonable we ſhou'd diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
him at <hi>Death.</hi> But 'tho' both for the ſake of <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and upon the ſcore of his own admirable <hi>Qualities,</hi>
he deſerves to be conſider'd with a <hi>Funeral- Oration;</hi> yet, of
all Men, certainly am I the moſt <hi>unqualify'd</hi> for ſuch an
Employment: For, not to inſiſt that any Talent in Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
is but ſlender, <hi>Urania</hi>'s Cruelty has reduc'd me to
a Condition little better than <hi>Favorite</hi>'s. Yes, <hi>Urania;</hi>
your Unkindneſs has had the ſame ſad Effect upon me,
that Fate has had upon him; and I am preſent at my
own <hi>Funerals,</hi> as well as thoſe of your Dog. But it is
your <hi>Command,</hi> Madam, that I enter on this Office; and
your Eyes have not left me the Liberty to <hi>diſobey</hi> you.
Behold then the <hi>Dead,</hi> making the Oration of the <hi>Dead;</hi>
an unhappy <hi>Man,</hi> of a happy <hi>Dog;</hi> the Object of your
<hi>Scorn,</hi> of the Object of your <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, Gentlemen, I demand your <hi>Attention,</hi> I
demand your <hi>Sorrows:</hi> For, Who will not afford both
their Attention, and their Sorrows to <hi>Urania</hi>'s. Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
Are not her <hi>Misfortunes</hi> ours, and are we not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſsed
in her <hi>Afflictions?</hi> Is ſhe mov'd with any <hi>Paſſion,</hi>
wherewith we are not likewiſe affected? But beſides
that, our <hi>Grief</hi> is a Tribute we owe to <hi>Urania,</hi> and
which it is not in our <hi>power</hi> to refuſe her, <hi>Favorite</hi>
himſelf, and. his <hi>Vertues,</hi> require from us, that we ſhould
drop a <hi>Tear</hi> upon his Grave: For, undoubtedly, never
was <hi>Dog</hi> poſſeſs'd of ſo many <hi>excellent</hi> Qualities; never
was <hi>Dog</hi> ſo belov'd <hi>living,</hi> or regretted <hi>dead.</hi> To give
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53405:8"/>
you a due Senſe of our <hi>Loſs,</hi> and that you may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
how juſt, how warrantable our Sorrows are, I ſhall
ſet before you the <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Endowments</hi> of this <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>
Creature: And here ſhou'd I re-count at large his
good <hi>Qualities,</hi> ſhou'd I enumerate diſtinctly his ſeveral
<hi>Excellencies,</hi> I ſhou'd ſooner exhauſt your <hi>Patience,</hi> than
my <hi>Argument.</hi> Let it ſuffice to touch lightly and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorily
on thoſe which were moſt <hi>conſpicuous</hi> and <hi>ſhining</hi>
in him.</p>
            <p>Before I launch out into the immenſe <hi>Ocean</hi> of the
<hi>Argument</hi> before me, I might, after the uſual and laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Example of all the celebrated <hi>Panegyriſts,</hi> both of
Antient and Modern Times, reckon up a long and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
<hi>Catalogue</hi> of his Heroick <hi>Progenitors.</hi> I might
tell you, how, by the <hi>Mother,</hi> he claims Kindred with
all the Courts of <hi>Europe;</hi> there being hardly a Queen,
or Princeſs. or Lady of Quality, throughout <hi>chriſtendom,</hi>
in whoſe <hi>Lap</hi> there does not <hi>lie</hi> ſome one or other of
<hi>Favorite</hi>'s great Relations. I might tell you, how, by
the Father, he is ally'd to Heaven, and to the Stars:
How the <hi>Celeſtial Dog</hi> beholding from above beautiful
<hi>Fanny,</hi> (for <hi>Favorite</hi>'s Mother condeſcended to <hi>dignifie</hi>
that Name,) ſporting her ſelf in <hi>Urania</hi>'s Garden,
ſtruck with the Almighty Date of <hi>Love,</hi> and deſirous to
<hi>poſſeſs</hi> her, like <hi>Jove</hi> of old quitted his bright <hi>Abode,</hi>
and descending like a Star-ſhoot upon Earth, <hi>compreſs'd</hi>
the lovely <hi>Nymph</hi> in a Bed of Roſes, and begot our
<hi>Hero.</hi> Behold the Extraction of <hi>Favorite!</hi> Such was the
Race of <hi>Hercules,</hi> of <hi>Achilles,</hi> of <hi>Aeneas;</hi> half <hi>Mortal,</hi>
half <hi>Divine.</hi> But I ſhall inſiſt no longer on his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53405:9"/>
Great <hi>Deſcent,</hi> as it adorns true <hi>Merit</hi> where it finds
it, ſo where it finds it not, it does not create it. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite</hi>
relies only on his own Deſerts for his Fame: <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite</hi>
reflects back as much <hi>Luſtre</hi> on his Noble <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors,</hi>
as he can derive from them. But let us return
from whence we have <hi>digreſs'd,</hi> and come to his own
Perſonal Vertues.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, Was ever any thing ſo <hi>beautiful?</hi> Nothing,
certainly, was ſeen ſo axquiſitely <hi>form'd.</hi> What Star more
lovely than his <hi>Forehead?</hi> What Snow more white than
his <hi>Feet?</hi> What more delicately turn'd than his <hi>Ears?</hi>
What more curiouſly poliſh'd than his <hi>Neck?</hi> No Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of <hi>Cupid</hi>'s rounder than his <hi>Tail:</hi> No Dove of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s
ſmoother and ſofter than his <hi>Back.</hi> Aſſuredly, the
<hi>Goddeſs</hi> of <hi>Beauty</hi> her ſelf, were ſhe to appear in the
Form of a Four-footed <hi>Animal,</hi> wou'd aſſume no other
Shape than <hi>Favorite</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Again, Was there ever anything ſo <hi>well-manner'd?</hi>
For the purpoſe, If at any time any Ladies of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Quality came to pay their Reſpects and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs
to <hi>Urania,</hi> he was never obſerv'd, like other ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manner'd
Dogs, to run with <hi>open</hi> Mouth to the Door,
and receive them with the <hi>clamorous</hi> Salute of his Voice;
but entertain them with a reſpectful <hi>Silence,</hi> and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them with <hi>Civility</hi> unto his <hi>Miſtriſs,</hi> nor, during
the whole Viſit, as is alſo the <hi>wont</hi> of the reſt of Dogs,
<hi>thruſt</hi> himſelf in a rude and troubleſome manner into
their Laps, <hi>diſordering</hi> their Dreſs, and with dirty Feet
<hi>incommoding</hi> their Linnen; but, like a <hi>well-bred</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſit at a <hi>due</hi> Diſtance, and <hi>ſilently</hi> wait the Call of
the Ladies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53405:9"/>
A Third remarkable Quality was, his <hi>cleanlineſs.</hi> And
truly ſo <hi>clean</hi> did he conſtantly appear, with a Body
ſo white, ſo ſmooth, ſo ſleek, that one wou'd ſay <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
her ſelf had comb'd him, that all the <hi>Cupids</hi> had
unanimously waſh'd him, and that all the <hi>Graces</hi> had
elaborately and exquiſitely wip'd him. And ſo <hi>careful</hi>
and <hi>ſollicitous</hi> was he to preſerve himſelf ſo, that he
avoided all Commerce with the <hi>Stables</hi> or <hi>Kitchin,</hi> leſt
he ſhould contract a <hi>Filth</hi> thereby; confining his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi>
altogether to the Chamber or the <hi>Parlour,</hi> to
the <hi>Bed</hi> or the <hi>Couch.</hi> Nor wou'd he ever, without
manifeſt Shew of <hi>Regret,</hi> commit himſelf to the Arms
of a <hi>Foot-man,</hi> or common <hi>Servant,</hi> as apprehending a
<hi>Stain</hi> from their Embraces, and <hi>Pollution</hi> from their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Touch. In like manner, Whenever Nature impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd
him, he wou'd <hi>privately</hi> withdraw from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
into ſome <hi>ſolitary</hi> Retirement, and there <hi>obey</hi> her
Laws: Or if ſhe call'd upon him at a Time more <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable,</hi>
when he was either in the <hi>Arms</hi> or <hi>Lap</hi> of a
Lady, he wou'd ſignifie with his <hi>Foot,</hi> or by ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Tone</hi> of his Voice, the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> that preſs'd him,
and <hi>admoniſh</hi> her to ſet him down.</p>
            <p>'Twou'd be endleſs a farther Enumeration of his <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</hi>
I ſhall only mention one <hi>Quality</hi> more, which
crowns and conſummates all; that is to ſay, his unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd
<hi>Affection</hi> to his Miſtriſs. I ſay, <hi>Unparallell</hi>'d; for
I believe, upon all the Records of <hi>Story,</hi> there is not to
Be found an Inſtance of ſo unexampl'd and ſingular a
<hi>Love</hi> in <hi>Dog:</hi> And, as on the one hand I may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm, that never had Dog ſo <hi>kind</hi> a Miſtriſs; ſo on
the other, I may with Truth averr, that never had Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs
ſo <hi>affectionate</hi> a Dog. <hi>Urania</hi>'s Soul and Body
were not more <hi>ſtraitly</hi> united, than were <hi>She</hi> and her
<hi>Dog;</hi> and as ſoon might ſhe have been <hi>ſeparated</hi> from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53405:10"/>
               <hi>her ſelf,</hi> as from <hi>him:</hi> Whereſoever ſhe <hi>went,</hi> he was
ſtill her <hi>Companion;</hi> not her own <hi>Thoughts</hi> were more
conſtantly with her: He wou'd accompany her in her
<hi>private</hi> and in her <hi>publick</hi> Walks; he wou'd attend her
in the Park, in the <hi>Play-houſe,</hi> at <hi>Balls,</hi> at the <hi>Court,</hi> and
in her <hi>Viſits;</hi> he wou'd follow her to her <hi>Chamber,</hi>
to her <hi>Cloſet,</hi> to her <hi>Bed;</hi> he wou'd invade her very
<hi>Retreats</hi> and <hi>Solitudes,</hi> intrude upon her <hi>Meditations</hi> and
<hi>Devotions,</hi> and not permit her to be <hi>alone,</hi> even with
her <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that wherein he moſt <hi>manifeſtly</hi> and <hi>ſignally</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
his <hi>Love</hi> to his Miſtriſs, was, his <hi>conſtant</hi> Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and Preſence in the Time of her late <hi>Illneſs:</hi>
For, during the whole Courſe of her Sickneſs, from
the firſt Moment the Violence of her <hi>Indiſpoſition</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
her to her Bed, <hi>Favorite</hi> was not known to be
<hi>abſent</hi> from her one Minute; but placing himſelf at
the Top of her <hi>Pillow,</hi> continu'd there to <hi>abide</hi> and
<hi>watch</hi> by her whole Nights and Days, without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:
Nor cou'd he ever, by <hi>Force</hi> or <hi>Flattery,</hi> be
Prevail'd upon to <hi>quit</hi> his Seat, before ſuch time as <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania</hi>
was perfectly reſtor'd to her good Condition of
<hi>Health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Wonder then if a Dog thus excellently endow'd,
and ſingularly qualify'd, was both admir'd and lov'd,
was favour'd and careſs'd by all that had the leaſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with his Merits. Upon the Score of theſe
rare Qualities and Vertues, if any Dog, aſſuredly <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite</hi>
deſerv'd to be immortal. But, alas! every thing
beneath the Sun muſt terminate, and have an End. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that <hi>Favorite</hi> had been deſervedly the Joy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of the Ladies, and that, he had arriv'd to the
higheſt Pitch of Happineſs attainable here below, that
is to ſay, had acquir'd particularly the Favour and
Love of <hi>Urania,</hi> behold, unexpectedly is he taken
from us!</p>

            <p>Weep Ladies, weep Gentlemen, weep; <hi>Favorite</hi> is

            <p>Poor <hi>Favorite!</hi> How art thou chang'd from what
thou waſt but yeſterday? What a Revolution has one
Day made? Thou, whom but four and twenty Hours
ago the Sun beheld in <hi>Urania</hi>'s lovely Lap; behold,
now ſhortly the cold Earth will contain thee. Thou,
whom ſhe bore about in her tender Arms; behold,
now the rough Embraces of Death do fold thee.
Thou, who waſt then thy Miſtriſs's Joy, art now her
Grief. Thou, who waſt then our Envy, art now our
Pity. Laſtly, Thou, who waſt then ſo viſibly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from all other Dogs, art now confounded with
the meaneſt.</p>
            <p>No more now wilt thou entertain <hi>Urania</hi> as thou
waſt wont, with wanton Play: No more now wilt
thou divert her with a Thouſand Sportive Tricks: No
more wilt thou be her beloved Companion in her
Chamber, in her Parlour, in her Garden, in her
Coach, in her Walks, at her Table, and on her
Couch; Alas! Where is now that Beauty, which
render'd thee the Admiration of all that beheld thee?
Where thoſe innumerable Graces, by which thou didſt
tranſcendently ſurpaſs the reſt of Dogs, and which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53405:11"/>
created thee the Love of the Ladies, and the Envy of
the Men? So far art thou from being that admir'd,
that beautiful Thing, which once thou wert, that we
are making all the haſte we can to remove thee out
of our ſight, as an Object that offends us, as a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
our Eyes are not able to ſupport without A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
and Pain.</p>
            <q>Lugete ô Veneres, Cupidinéſque.</q>
            <p>Weep Ladies, weep Gentlemen, weep; <hi>Favorite</hi> is
dead; <hi>Urania</hi>'s beloved Dog is dead.</p>
            <p>Who can here forbear complaining of the Rigour
of Fate? Who wou'd not be almoſt tempted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate
in thefſe Terms with Heaven? Why are the
moſt excellent Things ſtill the moſt periſhable? Why
was the Flower ſo fair, and yet ſo fading? Why is
what we eſteem moſt, ſnatch'd from us ſooneſt?
Why had not Fate beſtow'd fewer Vertues on <hi>Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>
or given a larger Extent to his Life? But, vain
are theſe Expoſtulations: Heaven is inexorable, and
will not reſtore him to us; he is irrecoverably, he is
for ever gone. Diſlevel your Hair, Ladies, and tear
your Garments: Disfigure your Faces, Gentlemen, and
knock your Breaſts. Let us grieve; let us lament?</p>
            <p>But what do I madly do? Why do I endeavour to
move your Tears, which but flow of themſelves too faſt?
Why do I attempt to raiſe your Grief; which rather
wants reſtraint than incitement. Alas! we have La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
enough: Let us rather ſeek how to diminiſh,
than augment our Sorrow; we need comfort, we need
Conſolation. Let theſe following Conſiderations, then
mitigate our Grief.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We wou'd do well to conſider, That to dye, is
to pay a common Debt to Nature, and is a neceſſity, to
which the greateſt and beſt Men have ſubmitted. Of all
theſe infinite numbers of Men: Of all theſe prodigious
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53405:11"/>
ſwarms of Animals that fill the Globe; is there one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Perſon or Creature, who is exempted from this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
Law? Nay, do not the moſt inanimate, the
moſt inſenſible things arrive at the ſame end, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the ſame Deſtiny with us? Do not the moſt durable
Walls, the ſtrongeſt Fortifications decay? The Sun,
which is daily a Spectator or ſo many Funerals both of
Men and of Beaſts, is it not it ſelf periſhable? The Earth,
which is the common Grave of every living Creature,
will it not find it ſelf a Sepulchre in the Univerſal Ruin?
The Heavens, the Stars, the Elements, the whole Maſs of
the Univerſe, will it hot ſooner, or later, ſuffer Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Nay, what is yet more lamentable, what is yet
more deplorable, that which is fairer than the Heavens,
that which is brighter than either Sun, or Stars, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
production, the moſt exquiſite Composition of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Urania</hi> her ſelf, will ſhe not one day die, and can
we then demand with juſtice that <hi>Favorite</hi> ſhould be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal?</p>
            <p>Next, let us remember that our Grief may be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to our ſelves, but cannot be any real Benefit to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite.</hi>
Cou'd our Lamentations indeed call him back
to life, cou'd our Sighs inſpire new Breath into him, or
our Tears water the lovely Flower' till it revived, our
Sorrows then were warrantable; but, alaſs! fruitleſs are
our Sighs, unprofitable our Tears.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let us comfort our ſelves with this Aſſurance,
that <hi>Favorite,</hi> whatſoever his Condition be, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.
For if, as moſt Philoſophers hold, the Souls of
Brutes periſh, and are intirely extinguiſh'd with the Body,
not exiſting after death, as he is not capable of Happineſs,
ſo neither is he of Miſery. But if that other Opinion
be true, that the Souls of Brutes, as well as Men, do not
dye, but only change their Habitation, and paſs by way
of Tranſmigration from out of one Body into another,
<hi>Favorite</hi> may enter once more upon the ſtage or Life,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53405:12"/>
and he that now parts from <hi>Urania</hi> a Dog, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
return to her again a Squirrel, or Sparrow; or it
may be a Lover.</p>
            <p>Since then he is partaker of a common Lot, ſince our
Tears can neither profit him nor our ſelves, and ſince we
are perſwaded he is not unhappy, let us omit an unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
and unneceſſary Sorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Favorite</hi> himſelf, cou'd he ſpeak, wou'd certainly bid
us ceaſe our Lamentations, and give over our needleſs
Complaints, expreſſing himſelf after this manner.</p>
            <p>Mourn not for me; for, to what purpoſe is it to
mourn? Has not my Orator already told you, that your
Tears are idely and unprofitably ſpent; that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avail to reſtore me again to Life; and why then
this weeping? Why theſe Complaints? Why theſe ſad
Sighs? Do not diſquiet your ſelves in vain. Do not
give yourſelves anxieties which are not needful; But
as for you, my beautiful Miſtriſs, it is your Intereſt
more eſpecially to be ſedate, unleſs you deſign to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the Men's Quarrel on your own fair Face, and
ruin that Beauty, which has ruin'd them. For what
have thoſe lovely Cheeks, done that you ſhou'd endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
by exceſs of Grief, to robb them of thoſe Graces
which ſubdue all Hearts? How have thoſe bright
Eyes offended you, that thus you go about, by immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
weeping, to deprive them of that Luſtre by which
they kill? Are you reſolv'd to make my Grave your
Beauty's Sepulcher? Alaſs! I am not worthy of the
leaſt of your Thoughts, much leſs your Tears, which are
Gemms too bright, too ineſtimable to be thrown away ſo
lightly. But if you ſhall ſtill retain any kindneſs for
a Dog that has ſerv'd you faithfully, demonſtrate it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53405:12"/>
way than by your Tears. Transfer your Love
as a Legacy I bequeath from my ſelf to my Orator, from
the Dead to the Dead, but yet from one you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
to one whom you can.</p>
            <p>I ſay the Dog himſelf, had he a Voice, wou'd expreſs
himſelf in the manner I have repreſented.</p>
            <p>What remains then, but that we bring at once our grief
and our Diſcourſe to a Period? Let us perform our laſt
Office to <hi>Favorite.</hi> Let us commit his Body to the Duſt,
and ſo depart.</p>

               <hi>Urania</hi> is my Lady's Name,</l>
            <l>To her I go, front her I came:</l>
            <l>O're ev'ry Heart the Maid does Reign,</l>
            <l>And Men are proud to drag her Chain.</l>
            <l>At her bright Feet they bleeding lie,</l>
            <l>For her they Sigh, for her they die,</l>
            <l>Then uſe me tenderly, for know,</l>
            <l>Her Eyes will ſure return the blow.</l>
            <l>She calls me <hi>Favorite,</hi> and loves</l>
            <l>Me more than <hi>Venus</hi> does her Doves.</l>
            <l>What wou'd you give Alaſs! to be</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Urania</hi>'s Favorite like me?</l>
            <l>Where e're my Miſtreſs does repair,</l>
            <l>I and the Graces follow her.</l>
            <l>Sometimes with her in Coach Tride,</l>
            <l>Young <hi>Cupids</hi> runing by our ſide.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53405:13"/>
Sometimes ſhe Walks with Noble gate,</l>
            <l>Whilſt I, and <hi>Ruine</hi> on her wait.</l>
            <l>Till kindly favouring my Feet,</l>
            <l>She makes her own bright Arms my Seat.</l>
            <l>What wou'd you give, Alaſs! to be</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Urania</hi>'s Favorite like me?</l>
            <l>With her at Table do I Eat,</l>
            <l>And take my Dinner from her Plate.</l>
            <l>Or ſtanding at her Chair am fed,</l>
            <l>Receiving from her hand the Bread.</l>

            <l>Sometimes her boſom's Snow I beat,</l>
            <l>With Sportive motion of my Feet:</l>
            <l>Sometimes her Mouth I Kiſs, and Sip</l>
            <l>The Nectar from her Roſy Lip.</l>
            <l>What wou'd you give, Alaſs! to be</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Urania</hi>'s Favorite like me.</l>
            <l>At Night I follow her to Bed,</l>
            <l>And on her Boſom lean my Head.</l>
            <l>The little God of Love, and I</l>
            <l>Together on one Pillow lie.</l>
            <l>The Dog which in the Heav'ns appears,</l>
            <l>And Shines among the glorious Stars,</l>
            <l>I Envy not, while here I reſt,</l>
            <l>For there is Heaven in her Breaſt.</l>
            <l>What wou'd you give, Alaſs! to be</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Urania</hi>'s Favorite like me.</l>
            <l>But it is time that I were gone,</l>
            <l>I've told my tale, and ſo have done.</l>
            <l>Poor Man! you Sigh, Alaſs! I fear</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Urania</hi> then is too Severe.</l>
            <l>Farewell, and may my Miſtreſs be</l>
