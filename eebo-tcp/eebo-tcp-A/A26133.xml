            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Grand-Jury for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> having on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the Twenty fifth of <hi>February,</hi> had a Bill preferr'd to them, againſt Count <hi>Charles John Conningſmark, Vratz, Boroski,</hi> and <hi>Sterne,</hi> as the Inhumane Actors of that Barbarous and Unmanly Murther, (the Three laſt being actually concerned in it) and againſt <hi>Harder, Dubar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> and <hi>Merckman,</hi> as the Acceſſaries in abetting and concealing the ſame; unanimouſly returned them <hi>Billa vera</hi>; upon which, about Nine of the Clock this morning, being the Twenty Eighth of this inſtant <hi>February,</hi> they took their Tryals in the <hi>Old-Bailey,</hi> being brought from <hi>Newgate</hi> to the <hi>Seſſions-houſe,</hi> which was as follows.</p>
            <p>The firſt that were brought were the Three Murtherers; ſome time after them, the Two perſons that were ſuſpected to be privie in it; and immediately after the Count, whoſe Beauty and Youth drew ſorrow from all perſons that were Spectators; his Countenance ſeemed very compoſed, and his looks did ſhew him to be under a particular diſſatisfaction. The Count came from <hi>Newgate</hi> in a Coach, and ſo was guarded into the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:109742:2"/>The Priſoners being brought to the Bar, and the Jury called over, the Indictment was read, they being Indicted in this Order, by the Names of <hi>George Boraski, Chriſtopher Vratz, John Stern,</hi> and <hi>Charles John Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningſmark,</hi> for that they on the Twelfth of <hi>February,</hi> 1681. not having the fear of God before their eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did Maliciouſly, and of Malice forethought, Aſſault and Murther <hi>Thomas Thynn</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields. After the reading the Indictment, ſome time was taken up in interpreting the words of the Indictment to the Priſoners at the Bar, by Sir <hi>Nicholas Johnſon,</hi> whom the Court aſſigned to be their Interpreter: which being done, they were ſeverally asked, whether Guilty or not Guilty? to which they all pleaded, Not Guilty; and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded how they would be Tryed? they anſwered, by God and a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of half Engliſh and half High-Dutch; the Count deſired by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, on the behalf of himſelf and the reſt of the Priſoners at the Bar, that thoſe Engliſh-men that were to be of his Jury, might be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sir <hi>Thomas Thynn,</hi> or any other that were related to, or had any dependence upon Mr. <hi>Thynns</hi> Family; in anſwer to which, my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton,</hi> bid Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> aſſure them, they ſhould not. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired likewiſe, that he might have the Pannel, that ſo when the Jury was called, he might know the better how to except againſt, which was granted. He excepted againſt about Twenty, and thoſe Engliſhmen that were called, he asked them all if they had any acquaintance with Mr. <hi>Thynn.</hi> The Jury being Sworn, the Foreman whereof was Sir <hi>William Roberts,</hi> the Indictment was read to the Jury, and they directed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether <hi>George Boraski, Chriſtopher Vrats,</hi> and <hi>John Stern</hi> were Guilty or not Guilty of the Felony and Murther whereof they ſtand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted; and if they find them Guilty, what Goods and Chattels they had when the Murther was committed, or if Not Guilty, whether they fled for the ſame, and if they did, they were to inquire what Goods and Chattels, as if they had found them Guilty, and that if they ſhould find cauſe not to find <hi>George Boraski, Chriſtopher Vrats,</hi> and <hi>John Sterne</hi> guilty, who are in this Indictment charged as Principals in this Fellony and Murther, you are not to inquire further concerning <hi>Charles John Conningſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> who is charged as an Acceſſary, by abetting and procuring the ſame. Then the Indictment was learnedly opened, firſt by one of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns-Inn,</hi> and then by Sir <hi>Francis Withins,</hi> who alſo learnedly urged the heinous aggravations of the Crime; firſt from the Dignity and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the perſon Murthered, and ſecondly from the bold and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as well as barbarous and cruel manner of committing the Murther; which being done, the Evidence for the King was called in and Sworn; the Evidence was very full againſt them, ſome tending to prove that Capt. <hi>Vrats</hi> entertained <hi>Boraski</hi> and <hi>Sterne</hi> as his Servants, and that they took Horſe and rid out together Armed, <hi>Boraski</hi> with a Blunderbuſs, and <hi>Vrats</hi> and <hi>Sterne</hi> with Piſtols, and that the Piſtol which was taken up near the place, and ſoon after the Murther was committed, was <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rats</hi>'s. The Coachman who drove Mr. <hi>Thynns</hi> Coach, and ſome others, proved they were all Three in Company, and that they road up to the Coach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that <hi>Vrats</hi> ſtopped the Coach while <hi>Boraski</hi> diſcharged the Blunderbuſs into the Coach, and that then they rid away together. There were many more Witneſſes Examined on both ſides, but the matter of fact appearing ſo plainly, the Jury after having been ſome time in debate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and found the Three Aſſaſſinates Guilty of the Murther; as for the farther particulars, we refer you to a more large account.</p>
