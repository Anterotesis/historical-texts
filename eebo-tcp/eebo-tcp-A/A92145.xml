            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in the Margin of this great volume. There
bee many wonders and depths in the book,
and the <hi>Lord</hi> doth even before our eyes in
this old age of the world create new things
and miracles in <hi>Britaine.</hi> 1. It is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous

Chapters of the booke, eſpecially becauſe
wee trade by the ſenſes, and colour of
things, for wee ſee not how <hi>God</hi> hath ſet his
enemies in ſlippery places, and that the
throne that myſticall <hi>Babylon</hi> ſitteth on, is
made of Cryſtall glaſſe, and the pillars
thereof nothing but Saffes of ever-guilded
earth, the Sonnes of <hi>God</hi> would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
their teares with the joy of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
O that wee had grace to read to a full
period, and with the ſenſe of a godhead, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſection of the treatiſc of providence; wee
doe halfe both the word and the workes of
<hi>God,</hi> wrong reading of <hi>God</hi> in his wayes doth
ſpoyle the true ſenſe and ſcope of God in
his acting. The light of faith maketh legible
to us, that <hi>The viſion at the end ſhall ſpeak, and not
lie,</hi> and <hi>that light is ſowen to the righteous;</hi> then
the harveſt muſt be hoped for, and wee erre
not a little, if wee comment any otherwiſe
on the <hi>ſhort triumphing of the wicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 20. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>and the joy

2. This ſeemeth darke to us, that all the

the ſame thing;</hi> yet in the <hi>Apoſtolick Church</hi> there
hath been ſome diſcord, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 10. Phil. 1. 2.

that <hi>God</hi> muſt worke us to an union, by the
ſword of the common enemy, wee might
have union at an eaſier rate. 3. It is a
myſtery, but <hi>it is alſo from the Lord who is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
in counſell,</hi> that truth muſt bee trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
through floods of blood. 4. That
a <hi>Church</hi> is greene and flowring and ſmelling
out beautie, glory and life, in the flaming
fire, that the crueltie, policie, wiſedome,
counſels of nations round about <hi>Britaine,</hi> and

us, and wee deſpaire not, perſecute us, and we are not
forſaken, cast us downe, and wee are not deſtroyed.</hi>
What a living death? what a breathing and
triumphing grave is this? what a ſhining
darkeneſſe? what a rejoycing ſorrow is here?
5. Wee wonder that our warres are not
at an end? <hi>But Gods thoughts are not like our
<pb facs="tcp:113056:4"/>
thoughts,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> hath by the ſword taken
away his <hi>Jewels</hi> and his pretious ones out of
theſe Kingdomes, it is rather like the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
burning of the houſe, then any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

the <hi>Lord hath made the glory of Jacob thinne, and

in ſilence and hope to beleeve that a <hi>remnant
muſt bee ſaved?</hi>

The words containe ſix particulars.</p>
            <p>1. There is here <hi>Chriſts</hi> Sea journey with the convoy; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
time; thirdly, and place. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his members have
not a way of onely dry land to heaven, there is much Sea-way
before <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his followers, ere they come to ſhoare.</p>
            <p>2. We have in the Text, the condition of the ſhip and the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and paſſengers that are carried in the veſſell with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Six parts of the Text.</note> in
ſix particulars, expreſſing the greatneſſe of the danger by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a mighty ſtorme.<note place="margin">The words opened.</note> Firſt, there is a <hi>behold</hi>

               </gap>, ſet before
it; firſt to hold forth the greatneſſe of the ſtorme, <hi>Matth. 8. 24.
And behold, there aroſe a great tempeſt.</hi> Secondly, to note that
creatures as winds and ſtormes are daring and bold againſt
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Church, God</hi> permitting them; wee imagine
when <hi>Chriſt</hi> goes to Sea, hee muſt have faire weather, and a
calme Sea, for how dare the winds blow upon the faire face
of him who created Sea and winds? But <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayling muſt
have a mightie gale, if the Prince of the ayre <hi>Satan</hi> can in
his owne ſpheare and pariſh command the winds. <hi>The ſecond
circumſtance, Mark</hi> ſaith a great ſtorme <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> came downe; it is
contrary to nature that winds deſcend, they rather aſcend;
this ſaith it was not an ordinary wind, but thirdly, a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
<hi>Mark</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſuch a wind, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, is moſt
dangerous, by rolling in a circle with violence, ſo as it doth
in <hi>Italy</hi> and other parts ſwallow up townes. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith
it was <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>a great tempeſt,</hi> a Sea-quake, that had as great
force and ſtrength as an Earth-quake, that can remove Caſtles
and Towers out of their places. Fourthly, from the effect, the
greatneſſe of it is amplified, the <hi>ſhip was filled with water; Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi>
obſerveth as <hi>the waterpots, Iohn 2. are filled with water to
the brim:</hi> for it is the ſame word. Fiftly, they were in ſuch
feare, that the Diſciples being ſome of them Fiſhermen, and ſo
experienced with Sea ſtormes, cry that they periſh, and are
gone; when the Shipmaſters art faileth him, and the grayhai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Seamen goe to their prayers, the paſſengers have cauſe to
bee afraid. But ſixtly, that is not much, there is a good Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the Ship, the great <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> not of the Seas onely,
but alſo of the winds, is here; <hi>Lord Admiralls</hi> on earth cannot
make winds and faire weather, all ſhall bee well, the Creator
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113056:5"/>
of Sea and winds is here; yea but hee is ſo here, as if he were
not here to them, hee is faſt aſleepe; God ſave us from a Sea-ſtorme,
when Chriſt is either farre away from us, or ſleeping.</p>
            <p>3. What courſe take the Diſciples in their danger? firſt,
they awake Chriſt with their prayer; ſecondly, they double
their words, <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Maſter,</hi> for (if he can, and
what can hee not?) hee'l helpe his Diſciples, ſo they put an
argument of helpe home upon Chriſt from his office. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they complaine, <hi>Careſt thou not for us? What a maſter art
thou, who ſleepeſt when wee are in danger to be drowned?</hi> ſo dreame
we Chriſt careth not for us, if he deliver not preſently. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they lay the danger before him, <hi>wee periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Wee have Chriſts preſent helping of them, <hi>Matthew</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the naturall method; <hi>Why are yee fearefull, O yee of little
faith?</hi> hee firſt rebuketh the Diſciples unbeleefe, before hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
the Sea and winds. Secondly, hee ſpake angry words to
the Sea and winds, or laid a ſtrict charge on the Sea and
winds, as the word is, <hi>Luke 3. 12. Luke</hi> 9. 21. or it is to rebuke
with threatning and authoritie, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. not becauſe Sea
and winds can ſtirre without ſpeciall commiſſion from <hi>God,</hi>
as the <hi>Poets</hi> fancied that their <hi>Aeolus</hi> could boaſt and chide the
winds and caſt them in fetters, but this is to expreſſe the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
and invincible dominion of Chriſt over Sea and winds,
they being his Apparitors and Purſevants, ſo that thirdly,
Chriſt (as <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith) uttered angry words of authoritie
and commanded the Sea, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>bee muzled,</hi> it is borrowed from wild beaſts or dogs
that are muzled up that they cannot devoure, ſo is the word,
1 <hi>Cor. 9. 9. Thou ſhalt not muzle the Oxe that treadeth out the corne;</hi>
it is a hard trope, and holds forth to us the Sea as a devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
beaſt, that would ſwallow up ſhips; ſo <hi>Matth. 22. 34. Ieſus
ſtopped the mouths of the Sadduces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The effect of Chriſts rebuking is here ſet downe, there
was without more adoe <hi>a great calme;</hi> when Chriſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113056:6"/>
glowmeth upon the Sea it dare but ſmile and bee ſtill.</p>
            <p>6. The fruit of the miracle is here, the Seamen, not the
Diſciples were ſtricken with wonder and aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>Now it came to paſſe on a certaine day.<note place="margin">Part I.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the three particulars in the firſt part, a word firſt
of the place, this was not properly a Sea, but a lake, not <hi>Lacus
Gadarenus,</hi> of which <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith beaſts could not goe through
it, without the loſſe of haire and hoofes, the waters being
ſo peſtilent, but it was the lake of <hi>Geneſareth,</hi> through which
Chriſt and his Diſciples ſayled to the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> called by a
<hi>Hebraiſme</hi> the Sea of <hi>Tiberias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly Chriſts convoy in this Sea-journey were his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.
Seldome was Chriſt his alone, onely when he went to
a mountaine to pray, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 15. and in the garden when his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
would not watch with him one houre.</hi> But ordinarily his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
and others were witneſſes of his doctrine and miracles.
Firſt, becauſe the Diſciples were to bee eye-witneſſes of him,
to preach by ſenſe as well as by faith, 1 <hi>Iohn 1. 1. 2 Pet. 1. 18.
And this voyce which came from heaven we heard</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) when
wee were with him in the holy mount.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preachers are to converſe much with Chriſt, &amp; why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Senſe of Chriſts ſweetneſſe
in Preachers is not ſo good as faith, but it is more excellent then
heareſay; there is a ſenſe of faith in ſuch as have beene in the
Mount with Chriſt; <hi>I beleeved, therefore I ſpake, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 13.
Senſe of Chriſt is an excellent Preacher of Chriſt, <hi>Now beleeve
wee</hi> (ſay the <hi>Samaritans, Ioh. 4. 42.) not becauſe of thy ſaying, for
wee have heard him our ſelves;</hi> every faithfull paſtor is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a meſſenger to ſpeake tydings, but a witneſſe who ſaw and
<hi>heard the viſions of God.</hi> Secondly, Croſſe-bearing is not eaſily
learned, Chriſt had the perfect art of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8. the Diſciples
muſt ſee how ſtraight Chriſts ſhoulders are in walking under
the Croſſe; to learne to doe is no difficill thing, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of learning to ſuffer. Thirdly, wee know our owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
beſt in converſing with Chriſt. Chriſts beautie and faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
caſteth a ſhade and a light on our blackneſſe; wee are all
faire enough while wee ſee Chriſts faireneſſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6. 5. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the more you converſe with Chriſt, the more you partake
of heaven; to bee with your ſelfe is to bee in ill company,
to be with the world rubbeth ruſt on you, to be with Chriſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113056:6"/>
leaveth a ſmell of heaven, and a die and colour of another
world on you that you ſhall never rub off; to touch perfume
and ſweet oyntments leaveth a witneſſe behind it; none can
preach nor ſuffer, but ſuch as have beene with Chriſt to ſee
and heare; you may bee called to a bloody death for Chriſt.
I pray you aske when was you laſt with Chriſt, and how oft
was you with him, or was you ever with him?</p>

of words, here two Evangeliſts, as their manner is, doe write
a Diurnall of Chriſts life and actions,<note place="margin">How carefully Chriſt husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded time.</note> they chronicle Chriſts
time carefully. Whence ſee wee how well Chriſt husbanded
his time upon earth, Act. 10. 38. <hi>he went about doing good:</hi> So in
his meſſage to <hi>Herod, Luke 13. 32, 33. Goe tell Herod, Behold, I
caſt out devils, and doe cures to day and to morrow, and the third day
I ſhall bee perfected.</hi> Firſt, <hi>he ſpent whole nights in prayer to God,
Luke</hi> 6. 12. wrought miracles in the night, <hi>at the fourth watch,
Matth.</hi> 14. 25. yea now while hee is ſleeping hee is making
way for a miracle. Secondly, <hi>Early in the morning hee taught in
the Temple, Iohn</hi> 8. 2. and while hee was eating hee loſed not
time, but preached in time of dinner. <hi>Luke 7. 38, 39. Luke</hi> 10.
39, 40. and <hi>made it his meate and drinke,</hi> when hee ſhould have
eaten, to gaine ſoules, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 34. Thirdly, hee began early,
being twelve yeares of age, <hi>to diſpute with the Doctors in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
and died preaching and praying on the Croſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.
43. 44. 46.</p>
            <p>Then firſt, ſuch are rebuked, as know not well their time,
<hi>Ier. 8. 7. Yea the Storke of the heaven knoweth her appointed times,
and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow obſerve the time of

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it were a right timing of actions if the honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Parliament would begin not at the eſtabliſhing of their
owne Liberties, Lawes, houſes, but at the building of the
houſe of God; the Lord hath given opportunitie for many
yeares of a ſitting Parliament, and there is not yet a face of a

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, wee have not knowne in this our day of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

was terrible and loud, as if it would cleave Mountaines and
Rocks, and there muſt bee ſuch a preſſure of paine here, as if
you would take a living mans bones, and make fewell for fire,
and uſe them as we do Faggots; and not that onely, but they
indured as much heat of fire as the hearth-ſtone that is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of the godly, and the heart of their hell ſhould ordinarily bee

the ſufferings of the Saints in this life is their whole hell: wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

firſt,<note place="margin">The Church a moveable thing as a ſhip.</note> in a naturall; ſecondly, in a civill; thirdly, in a ſpirituall

all are but changes and meere motions; for mans

<hi>The heavens ſhall wax old as a garment, Pſal.</hi> 102. 26. 2 The

and <hi>God</hi> with a put of his foot turneth the Bowle out of its

a moving and rolling thing, like a Cart wheele or a feather in

ten, twentie troubleſome dayes of warre, perſecution, diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
hereſies, plots. Reade the Hiſtory of the Judges, and of
the perſecuting, yea and Chriſtian <hi>Emperours,</hi> and you ſhall
ſee the ups and downes of the Church, they had eaſe, yea

moving thing: in that, 1. change is a part of ſufferings, and
ſuffering and the Croſſe is the patrimony of the Church;
whereas <hi>David</hi> ſaith of the wicked, <hi>Pſal. 55. 19. Becauſe they have

a joyfull feaſt betweene Chriſt and his Church. But this world
laſteth not alway; ſhee falleth aſleepe and holdeth Chriſt at

and a ſad diſcourting of her; for it is farre otherwayes, Verſ.
6. <hi>I ſought him, but I could not finde him, I called him, but hee gave
mee no anſwer.</hi> Grace, as it is in God, is God gracious, and is
moſt ſtable and unchangeable, but it is various, as it is received
in us, who are made of changes, and a difference there muſt
bee betweene a communion of grace and a communion of
glory, and 2. betweene this life and that life; as for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<hi>glory</hi> is grace in everlaſting action, and therefore there is
no deſertions in heaven, no hiding of Gods face, no cloud, no
night, no change, nothing but a ſunne in its full ſtrength; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
day without night, a full Sunſhine without a cloud or

and our ſtabilitie here (as touching the other) is <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. Verſ.

it cannot beare the ſhip above, no more then a board of glaſſe

<hi>John 16. 33. in the world you ſhall have tribulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, all the ſafetie of the ſhip is in a good pilot, now
Chriſt who can ſayle with every wind, and bringeth many

tothed in good ground, it is <hi>up within the vaile</hi> in heaven; hee
muſt ſhake heaven, who loſeth the Anchor. Thirdly, Chriſt
the forerunner, who leapt firſt aſhoare, and as <hi>the firſt begotten
of the dead,</hi> firſt hanſelled heaven with our freſh, hath the farre
end of the Anchor in his hand. Chriſt ſtrengthneth the Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

life, ſhall loſe it.</hi> Thirdly, ſome ſtill remaine in the ſhip, but as
<hi>Judas</hi> did with Chriſt, waiting an opportunitie either to play a
game for Malignants, or to foſter diviſions betweene the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and diviſions in the Church, to raiſe a mutinie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the paſſengers of Chriſt, that the one halfe may throw
the other over board in the Sea. Fourthly, Some are like
<hi>Jonab,</hi> downe in the ſides of the ſhip ſleeping; theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
paſſers by, <hi>Lament.</hi> 1. 12. they'l neither ſweat at the
Pumpe, nor lay one finger on a rope, nor move an Oare, but
(ſay they in their heart) Chriſt is a good enough Seaman, if he
will not guide his owne ſhip to ſhoare, let him ſee to it. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſome paſſengers are merchant men; their Sea voyage in the
ſhip is to gaine, to buy and ſell Religion, and live on the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
theſe that would draw in to themſelves gaine from the
publike now, would crucifie Chriſt for his coate. Sixthly,
ſome truſting in multitude and ſtrength thinke by hard row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſweating at the Oares to bring the ſhip to land; <hi>but
a horſe is a vaine helpe.</hi> Seventhly, ſincere profeſſors are willing
to ſtay, and take faire or foule weather with Chriſt, to
ſinke or ſwimme with the Goſpell, and not onely to ſtay, but
to row and pray. Wee cannot but ſee winds and
ſtormes, loud and mightie toſſing the poore ſhip in <hi>Britaine;</hi>
Pirates and robbers have made ſtops in the ſhip by plots, much
underwater is come in. Eighthly, though the winds be ſtrong
and the Sea tempeſtuous, yet the port is ſure, for this is the
promiſe of the Lord who ſits at the helme, <hi>Eſay 54. 11. O thou
afflicted and toſſed with tempeſts, behold I will lay thy ſtones with faire
colours, and lay thy foundations with Saphires.</hi> Chriſt can ſaile
with contrary winds, yea the harbour is neare; <hi>Behold I come
quickly,</hi> (ſaith the Lord); in the greateſt ſtorme that ever was,
the Church can ſee the ſhoare and dry land, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 9. and faith
in warre ſeeth peace, and in ſhipwrack is aſſured of the land,
and in ſaddeſt times, when God is fartheſt off, the children
of God feele the ſmell of the flowers of the higher gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113056:13"/>
               <hi>Romans 5. 3. Wee rejoyce, or wee leape for joy, in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>[And hee was faſt aſleepe.]</hi> Wee are here to conſider farther
of the condition that they were it;<note place="margin">Why Chriſt took on our nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</note> it is a ſtorme, but Chriſt
ſleepeth. Firſt, a word of Chriſts ſleeping. Secondly, <hi>of his
ſleeping at this time.</hi> If wee compare the Text with it ſelfe wee
ſhall finde, hee was ſleeping, <hi>who can neither ſlumber nor ſleepe,</hi>
and that hee is waking while hee is ſleeping, for hee who is
the <hi>mightie God, the Prince of peace,</hi> and <hi>rebuked the Sea and the
winds, and there was a calme,</hi> does not ſleepe. How then? can
God ſleepe? hee that is in one perſon <hi>God-man</hi> can ſleepe. Firſt,
becauſe in this rare peece of our redemption, <hi>Chriſt-God</hi> took
all our infirmities on him, <hi>except ſinne,</hi> as hee tooke our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo hee tooke our condition and place, to expreſſe the
depth of the love of <hi>God</hi> to mankind; the lower and the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
our glorious redeemer was, it hath the greater impreſſion
of love.<note place="margin">Chriſt, God and man, and why.</note> 
               <hi>Love, love</hi> anſwereth all our queſtions of wonder.
O way of life, why waſt thou wearied? O bread of life, why
waſt thou hungry? O well of life, why waſt thou thirſty?
Haſt thou not made all the fountaines and all the Vines in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi>
and in all the earth? O ancient of dayes, why becameſt
thou young, and a weeping infant? <hi>bleſſed Jeſus</hi> would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>workhouſe of ſufferings</hi> and infirmities for us; and <hi>love,
free love</hi> anſwereth all theſe queſtions; for us, for us ſinners hee
came thus low. Secondly, here is a wonder, if there be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the world, <hi>Chriſt God and man</hi> in one perſon is more then
a miracle. The <hi>mightie God</hi> giving infinite ſubſiſtence to a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
nature, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. Thirdly, here is an able and ſufficient
Saviour furniſhed to us, one who is more then a man; why?
there was not onely need of infinite worth and merit to the
perſon, but of infinite ſtrength under the ſufferings; man as
man is but a creature, and all the Angels in heaven and a world
of worlds of new created Angels could not indure the infinite
wrath of God, and therefore God muſt bee in this play, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
all had beene marred. <hi>Qu. But the Godhead could not ſuffer
nor be a paſſive ſubject of ſuffering, God therefore though bee had
not made one perſon with the manhead, might have added actively
ſtrength to a man to endure and ſuffer all that Chriſt ſuffered. Anſw.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:113056:13"/>
It is true, the <hi>Godhead</hi> was no formall paſſive ſubject of either
infirmities or ſufferings in Chriſt, and God might have added
to one who is only man poſſibly ſtrength to ſuffer the terrours
of the ſecond death without deſpairing: but then it could
not bee ſaid, that in that caſe theſe ſufferings ſhould have
beene the ſufferings and blood of God, and ſo of infinite
worth and merit. But here all ſtrength, and which is more,
all worth and merit of ſuffering came from the <hi>Godhead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The influence of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in Chriſts ſufferings was active, not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</note> which
may bee illuſtrate from two compariſons. Firſt, ſuppoſe there
were a faire roſe in the ſoutheſt part of the earth, neareſt the
Sunne, growing in great beautie, but in danger to bee burnt
up with the extreame heate of the Sunne, yet if wee ſhould
imagine there were at the root of this ſame roſe a cold refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fountaine and Spring of water, ſending up an oily and
lively ſope of life to the roſe, ſo that how much the parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heate of the Sunne conſumed and waſted of the life and
greeneneſſe of the Roſe, the fountaine eternally furniſhed as
much of new vigour and life to it, wee may thinke if the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
were eternall ſo to act upon the Roſe, the Roſe muſt bee
eternally greene and never wither: So the <hi>flower of Iſſai, Jeſus
Chriſt the faire Roſe of Sharon,</hi> that Lilly of the field never
planted with hands, that bleſſed man who was a ſonne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a father, though the parching Sunne of the infinite wrath
of God, for our ſinnes did burne him, and looke upon him
to conſume him, as hee complained, <hi>Pſal. 22. 15. My ſtrength
is dried up like a Potſheard. 17. I may tell all my bones;</hi> yet the
<hi>bleſſed Godhead,</hi> in a perſonall union, was like an oily foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
at his root, that contributed the active influence of life,
courage, vigour and ſtrength, ſo as this roſe could not but
grow in death, and the excellency of his perſon makes the
ſufferings of infinite worth. And even as the Scarlet and
purple Curtaines in the Tabernacle caſt a glaunce and luſtre
on the golden Mercy-ſeate, when the Arke was within the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle:
ſo the purple wounds and blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and
all his infirmities received an excellent ſweet luſtre, worth and
beautie from the glorious and more then golden Godhead
of our true and living Arke the Sonne of God. It may alſo
bee thus cleared, the Iron wedges of <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke ſeparated
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113056:14"/>
from the Arke, and caſt into the waters ſhould ſinke to the
bottome, but being faſtned in the Arke they fleet above the
water: the <hi>manhead</hi> ſeparated from the <hi>Godhead</hi> ſhould ſinke
under the wrath that Chriſt did ſuſtaine, but being wedged
and united to the <hi>Godhead,</hi> in a perſonall union, could not
but ride out againſt all the ſtormes: O bleſſed bee our ſure Ark.
Now though ſuffering could not touch the Godhead paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet could the Godhead actively contribute to the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Manhood for ſuffering.</p>
            <p>Hence wee are to conceive if Chriſt the Redeemer,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note>
Chriſt perſonall, was a Standard-bearer that could not
faint under all his ſufferings and infirmities, Chriſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
is more then men, I meane the Church of Chriſt
muſt have alſo ſtrength againſt all the perſecutions of
men; there is a bone in the head of the Church, that is,
ſtrength in Chriſt that cannot bee broken, malignants ſhall
fight againſt <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> but ſhall not prevaile, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any victory that the ſeed of the <hi>Serpent</hi> or <hi>Satan</hi> could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
againſt Chriſt, but the bruiſing of his heele, that is a
poore victory, a wound in the heele, or a bleeding heele is
farre from the heart; Malignants are but drawing blood of
Chriſts heele, in theſe bloody warres. But they doe but threſh
the waters, Chriſt hath indured more then the wrath of the
<hi>King of Britaine,</hi> and beleeve it, hee ſhall bee victorious and
ſhall prevaile.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt be ſuch a wonderfull one that is God no leſſe then
man,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> it is neither pietie nor good policy to take any thing
from him that is his due; if <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſtepped in and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
a headſhip over the Aſſembly convened in the name of
Chriſt,<note place="margin">It were ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Roman Empire and Senate to give out decrees to the Churches as the Apoſtles and Elders did, Acts 15.</note> 
               <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and had ſaid <hi>it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt,

the <hi>decrees of the Apoſtles and Elders at Jeruſalem,</hi> as they are

wronging of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in his prerogative
Royall, and an abridging of the freedome of his Court; nor
was it ever in our heart to teach that the <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113056:14"/>
with blind obedience to execute the decrees of the Church;</hi> for this
poore argument, if it have any nerves, as it would caſt upon
us the doctrine of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to make the wayes of
Chriſt odious, it hath as great ſtrength againſt the preaching
of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> for if <hi>Paul</hi> or any faithfull Paſtor preach to
the Magiſtrates of <hi>Berea</hi> that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom the Jewes crucified,
is the onely Redeemer and Saviour of the world, and that
therefore they are as nurſe-fathers to give libertie to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God, to preach this doctrine, and to hinder any to
perſecute ſuch as ſhall preach this doctrine, yet by their civill
authoritie, and <hi>ex officio,</hi> they are not for that, with blind
obedience to receive it, and not to ſearch the Scriptures to try
whether that which is preached bee agreeable to the Scriptures,
nor to take it upon the bare authoritie of the Preacher, but
they are to ſearch the Scriptures, and obliged to beleeve the
preached Goſpell. But not as Magiſtrates either to preach
themſelves, or to judge authoritatively by vertue of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
whether the Preachers doctrine bee the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> or
no: ſo if a Synod, by the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the light of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
determine any thing for diſcipline or cenſure, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi>
as hee may as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> try the word preached, ſo
may hee the ſame way try the decrees and determinations of
the Church, and not take them upon blind truſt, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
puniſh the contraveners as a magiſtrate, and as hee is
<hi>the Miniſter of God</hi> that beareth his ſword; but yet hee can
no more as a Magiſtrate, and by his office preſcribe ſuch eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick
Lawes, (as wee have <hi>Acts 15. v. 28, Act.</hi> 16. 4.) unto
the Churches of <hi>God,</hi> or as a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> and by his office
judge them unlawfull, and forbid them, then hee can preach
the word, or ſay, <hi>it ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to me who
beares the Sword, to command that the Churches obſerve ſuch and ſuch
Lawes.</hi> But wee ſhall hardly beleeve that the honorable Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
will take on them ſupreme authoritie above the Aſſemblies
and courts of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> or that they will give occaſion
to all the Proteſtant Churches in the world who prayeth for
them, to write againſt their proceedings.</p>
            <p>[<hi>And he was faſt aſleepe]</hi> What? ſhould Chriſt ſleepe now, as
<hi>Lonab</hi> did, when God ſeemeth to bee angry with all in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113056:15"/>
ſhip?<note place="margin">Innocency can ſleepe ſound amidſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt calamities.</note> Nay but Chriſt holdeth forth to us by his ſleeping, that
innocency and a good conſcience can ſleepe ſecurely amidſt the
greateſt calamities and ſtormes, and not bee afraid. This is
made good by theſe grounds of Scripture; as firſt, <hi>God</hi> hath
a chamber and a pavilion to ſave his owne people in, ſo are
they ſpoken to <hi>Eſay 26. 20. Come my people, enter into thy Chambers,
and ſhut thy doores about thee, hide thy ſelfe for a little moment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the indignation bee overpaſt.</hi> Secondly, God not onely
ſaveth his owne from trouble, but alſo from the feare of
trouble, <hi>Pſal. 3. 5. I laid mee downe and ſlept. 6. I will not
bee afraid of ten thouſand of the people, that have ſet themſelves againſt
mee round about, Pſal. 23. 4. Yea though I walke through the valley
of the ſhadow of death, I will feare no evill.</hi> Thirdly, there is
yet a higher degree to which a good conſcience can aſcend,
for <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iob 5. 22. At deſtruction and famine thou ſhalt
laugh,</hi> faith is ſo above death, that it maketh a holy ſporting
at death, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 55. O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where
is thy victory?</hi> It is much to looke death on the face and to
laugh; beleeve and triumph. It is true, the Godly are fitteſt
to bee ſouldiers, and faith hath more true courage for the
warre then thouſands of men, yet are not meanes to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed.
God will not have us to worke miracles on the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of our owne private ſpirit, though God worke miracles
himſelfe; <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 141. 7. that the Lord covered his

head himſelfe in the day of battell, and was <hi>a man of warre.
2 Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 17. 10. There is reaſon why the Saints are ſecure in <hi>God,</hi>
in the greateſt calamitie, becauſe peace with God maketh
peace with bullets, and ſwords and ſpeares, and theſe goe well
together, <hi>Pſal. 149. 6. Let the high prayſes of God be in their mouth,
and a two edged ſword in their hand:</hi> and faith knoweth nothing

there is faire weather within, faith is a grace above time,
as there is neither raine nor winds above the ſecond region of

Secondly, unbeleefe hath a wide apprehenſion, and is full
of jealoſies and feares, and beleeveth every buſh to bee an armed

for when the beleever hath cloſed a covenant with death, not
ſuch a one as is <hi>Eſay</hi> 28. 15. but ſuch a covenant as taketh in
Chriſt as a party with the beleever, in which hee is in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with the wild beaſts of the field, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 18. and with
the ſtones of the fields, then is hee ſecure, for if death bee the
Saints ſervant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. why but wee ſhould have Law-ſuretie
in Chriſt, with our ſervant, that death ſhall not hurt
us? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55. and if the grave bee our bed of reſt, why
ſhould not the ſick man bee at peace with his owne Couch,
and with his owne poſt that conveyeth him over the water to
heaven? the beleevers death is a ſleepe, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 6. 51. 1 Cor.</hi>
4. 14. then it muſt bee a ſweet and ſound ſleepe, as is the ſleep

who was <hi>to reſtore the kingdome to Iſrael is gone;</hi> and what ſhall the
people of God now do? utter deſolation is ſo neare that God is
put to it, and the poore Churches coale ſo cold, that they

chainzed men to his cauſe, and carries his owne holy

the wiſedome of God the Pilot of his Church overpowereth
mens intentions which are ſet on gaine, honour, factions,
their owne by-ends, eaſe and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>It is not unlike that when this worke now under the Lords
wheeles in <hi>Britaine</hi> is come to a height of extreame deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that wee are at this, <hi>Lord, either now or never,</hi> and the Sea
is come in at the broad ſide of the ſhip, that the Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
by ſome immediate way; and wee ſee feavours come to
a height, and then decreaſe and coole: and when doth the
Sea turne to an ebbing? not while it flow to the utmoſt ſcore
of the coaſt, and then be fulleſt; ſeldome doth ever the <hi>Lord</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

that <hi>Parliaments, Aſſemblies, armies of and in both kingdomes, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies,
ſhippings, treaties, victories</hi> can doe no more? and then the
Lord ariſe, and by ſome immediate omnipotency wee never
dreamed of, calme our Sea, and bring his owne ſhip to land.
Firſt, you never ſaw creatures doe any great worke, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was left to omnipotency and to <hi>God</hi> onely to bee done.
<hi>Moſes</hi> led the people out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but hee could not divide
the red Sea, and that was their way. Secondly, in <hi>Gods</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
workes immediate providence hath had hand. The victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over <hi>Midian</hi> had more of Gods immediate worke, then of
<hi>Gideons</hi> Sword in it: this truely to me is one continued mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
that theſe 1600. yeares, <hi>God</hi> hath carried his ſhip and kept
the paſſengers alive, when perſecuting <hi>Emperours,</hi> when bloody
<hi>Babylon,</hi> when <hi>Hereticks, Kings the hornes of the beaſt that roſe out
of the Sea,</hi> fire, faggots, ſword, torments have torne the ſailes of
Chriſts Ship, broken the Maſt, drowned the paſſengers, yet
wee live. <hi>Joſeph</hi> is bleſſed, but when hee is ſeparated from his
brethren, then bleſſings come upon the head of <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was faſt aſleepe.</p>
            <p>This is the ſaddeſt circumſtance in their ſuffering. What
is death and the drowning of them all, ſo they have Chriſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113056:17"/>
with them?<note place="margin">The preſence of God in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</note> But Oh! Chriſt to their ſenſe is as good as abſent;
for hee is faſt alſeepe; and as they complaine, hee careth not
for them; Chriſt walking and working for a ſoule in the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
affliction of the world is a bleſſed viſitation. To bee in
heaven, if Chriſt ſleepe and bee not with you, is a hell, and to
bee in hell and want his preſence, is two hells; to bee ſicke, and
the onely Phyſitian Chriſt will not come at mee, is two hells.
<hi>Gods</hi> watching preſence, firſt, bringeth the courage of faith:
To bee in the midſt of devils, the beleever having <hi>God</hi> with
him walketh without feare; even cold death that <hi>king of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>
walking with him at his right ſide, hee hath a paſſe-port
that will take him ſafe through the grave, as theſe places
prove, <hi>Pſal. 16. 8, 9, 10. Pſal. 23. 4. Pſal. 46. 2. 3. Mic.</hi> 7. 8. Secondly,
<hi>God</hi> is not preſent with his owne in trouble as the picture of
a friend, who hath much love in his heart while hee ſtands at
your bed ſide ſeeing you goe to a great hell through a little
hell of ſickneſſe and paine, and cannot take off you one graine
weight of ſorrow and paine. But <hi>God</hi> is in a farre other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
preſent, <hi>Pſal. 91. 15. I will bee with him in trouble,</hi> but this
is not all, <hi>I will deliver him,</hi> Eſay 43. 2. <hi>when thou paſſeſt through
the waters, I will be with thee, and through the Rivers, they ſhall
not overflow thee, when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not
be burnt;</hi> nor is Chriſt in trouble like our Summer-friends
who in a great drough dry up.</p>
            <p>But may not God be with his own, though they be both burnt
&amp; drowned? then this is no conſequent at all, <hi>feare not that the fire
ſhall burn thee, or the waters ſhall drowne thee, for I am with thee;</hi> yea
it is moſt ſtrong, this preſence of God with his owne in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
maketh God and them ſo one, by Gods union of love, (for
Gods love to us is infinitely more active to ſave us, then either
our faith and love to him) that the fire that burneth <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt
alſo ſeiſe upon God, according to that, <hi>Zach. 2. 8. Hee that
toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye.</hi> Thirdly, when
Chriſt waketh and ſleepeth not in heavy afflictions, his love
is ſo in action, even while hee ſtriketh, that the rod falleth
out of his hand, that hee 1. giveth them not ſo hot a fire, as
ſilver, and 2. hee acteth love and mercy on them in their ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
time of ſuffering, and marieth them at their loweſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
both which are excellently expreſſed, <hi>Eſay 48. 10. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113056:18"/>
I have refined thee, but not as ſilver, I have choſen thee in the
furnace of affliction.</hi> Fourthly, wee may adde another benefit
of the preſence of God in afflictions, that the very breath of
Chriſt is ſweet, though hee ſhould not deliver for the preſent,
yet the ſmoake of hell and the paine of the furnace is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed
and over-gilded with the breathings of the love of
Chriſt, that the paine of the furnace is allayed; this is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
by the Martyrs ſinging at the ſtake; If in theſe bloody
ſufferings wee want Gods preſence, how miſerable are wee?
and therefore this is one of the proper markes of the children
of God, if wee can miſſe Gods comfortable preſence in this
fiery tryall that is now in the three kingdomes: So <hi>Lament.
1. 16. for theſe things I weepe, mine eye, mine eye runneth downe
with water,</hi> yea but theſe ſufferings are but the materiall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of weeping, there is a higher cauſe of weeping then that,
and ſet downe in the Hebrew as a cauſe with an <gap reason="foreign">

therefore the word is doubled: as if hee would ſay, <hi>any forſaking

Pſal. 88. 6. Thou haſt laid mee in the loweſt pit, in darkneſſe, in the

thou off my ſoule? why hideſt thou thy face from mee?</hi> poſitive
wrath is not ſo heavy as the meere negative abſence of God.
<hi>Mary</hi> her want of the man <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſad, but ſhee wants him

            <p>Luke 8. 24.<note place="margin">Part III.</note> And they came to him, and awoke him, ſaying, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,

            </p>
            <p>The third part of the text containeth the courſe they take
in their trouble. It is good that in their trouble they agree in
theſe foure. Firſt, that there is a great danger, even preſent
drowning. Secondly, they looke ſpiritually on it in this,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113056:18"/>
that the face of death is ſo much the more awefull that Chriſt
their deliverer ſleepeth. Thirdly, they agree in judgement that
Chriſt onely can helpe them. Fourthly, they agree in practiſe,
all joyne in prayer to awake Chriſt, and by faith to awake him,
and ſet him on worke to helpe and ſave them. <hi>It is excellent
when one heart and one mind is amongſt all the paſſengers of Chriſts
ſhip, eſpecially in a troubleſome Sea ſtorme. Gen. 13. Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Lots</hi> herdmen ſtrive. But it is ſo much the worſe that it is ſaid,
Verſ. 7. <hi>and the Canaanite and the Perizite dwelt then in the land,</hi>
they had common enemies,<note place="margin">Reaſons for Chriſtian uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> and therefore ſtriving was unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable;
holy <hi>Joſeph</hi> (when his brethren was in great diſtreſſe,
falling out was unſeaſonable) therefore ſaith to them, <hi>Gen. 45.
24. See that yee fall not out by the way:</hi> Alas! wee are in great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and yet <hi>wee fall out by the way:</hi> it was a ſad time with the
Diſciples neare to the time when <hi>the ſhepheard was ſmitten and
they ſcattered ſheepe,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>John 13. 35. By this ſhall
all men know that yee are my Diſciples, if yee love one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doe but heare how <hi>Paul</hi> is moſt copious in arguments for
this in one Verſe, <hi>Philip. 2. 1. If there bee therefore any conſolation
in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any
bowels and mercies, 2. Fulfill my joy, that yee may bee like minded,
having the ſame love, being of one accord, and of one mind Pſal.</hi> 133. 1.
to bee of one mind in love, is the fulfilling of the joy of the
Saints; biting and devouring is a hole, a gap, a great blanke to
the <hi>joy of the holy Ghoſt;</hi> love neighboureth with the ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
of Chriſt, it is the birth, a fruit, an Apple growing
on the ſpirit of Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. in the wombe and bowels of
<hi>love</hi> lodgeth bowels of tender mercies; pardoned ſinners cannot
ſo hate pardoned ſinners as to jeere them out of the hearts of
the Saints, &amp; end them to the lake of Brimſtone. <hi>Pſ. 133. Behold
how good, and how pleaſant it is for brethren to dwell together in unitie.</hi>
Many things are good, as workes of divine juſtice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
the enemies of <hi>God,</hi> yet they are not pleaſant; and
many things are pleaſant that are not good, as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of ſinne for a ſeaſon muſt bee pleaſant; but becauſe
unlawfull, they are not good; but unitie amongſt
brethren is both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>pleaſant;</hi> now becauſe ſtriving and
bitter diviſions in this land and Church are ſo ſad, and a
lovely and peaceable union ſo neceſſary, give me leave to preſſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113056:19"/>
this a little; the motion of a loving union were deſirable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe our Father the <hi>Lord</hi> appeared to <hi>Elias,</hi> not in
<hi>the thunder, but in the calme voyce.</hi> Love is not onely from God,
but 1 <hi>John 4. 8. God is love,</hi> and that in all the foure cauſes of love:
See how much of God is in any, as much of love and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is in them; love is the breathings of heaven, love is the
aire and element wee live in, in the higheſt new <hi>Jeruſalem,
1 Cor.</hi> 13. 8. 13. The redeemeds breath ſmells of <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>love</hi>
hath the ſmell of another world; it is a flower of Chriſts plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the bleſſings and prayers of the good husbandman
Chriſts Father came on the flower, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 3. The dew of
God lieth all the night upon the leaves of the flower, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
greene. The Church is a houſe that is builded up in
love, that raiſeth the wall up to heaven, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt our redeemer, whoſe wee are, being bought
with a price, is a maſſe of love, hee hath a heart very hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
to lodge all our infirmities; when hee ſaw his people, as
touching the condition of their ſoule, like ſheepe without a
ſhepheard, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>hee was bowelled with compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
toward them: Eſay</hi> 40. when the Prophet ſpeaketh of his
power and his ruling arme, hee alſo prophecyeth of his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and bowels of compaſſion to weake ones; there bee three
ſorts of perſons in the Church that hee ſhall handle tenderly.
1. The ſimple but gratious, and for theſe, Verſ. 11. <hi>hee ſhall
feede his fl<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cke like a ſhepheard;</hi> hee hath the heart of a ſhepheard
who tendereth and careth for the flocke. 2. There bee
young ones, babes in Chriſt, and of theſe it is ſaid, <hi>hee ſhall
gather the Lambes with his arme, and carry them in his boſome,</hi> two
excellent ſweet expreſſions, hee ſhall not throw his club at the
Lambs, nor bee froward and cruell to them, but in lieu of a
club, <hi>hee ſhall gather them with his arme.</hi> 3. And as for the
young and weake that have not legges, <hi>he ſhall carry theſe in his
boſome;</hi> the boſome of Chriſt is a ſeat of love and tenderneſſe
of bowels. 4. There bee ſome in the Church that want not
their infirmities and ſinnes, and have legges, and a little
ſtrength, yet the tenderneſſe of the bowels of compaſſion muſt
yeeld them, ſome Chriſtian condeſcenſion and accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and they muſt not bee forced and driven roughly, Chriſts
Spirit is a ſpirit of accommodation, <hi>Sir Ile make you in deſpight
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113056:19"/>
of your teeth,</hi> is not for theſe, and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>hee ſhall
gently lead thoſe that are with young,</hi> ſo <hi>Eſay 42. 2. Jeſus Chriſt ſhall
not cry nor lift up, nor cauſe his voyce to bee heard in the streets,</hi>
Chriſt hath not the art of rayling, ſhouting and thundering
againſt the meeke of the flock. Yea Chriſt rideth and triumpheth
in meekneſſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 9. his horſe hee rideth on, is meekneſſe,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 4. it is ſpoken to him, <hi>Ride proſperouſly upon truth and
meekneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 6. This <hi>Lord lifeth up the meeke,</hi> and
<hi>Pſal. 76. 9. bee will ſave all the meeke of the earth:</hi> Chriſts heart
is King <hi>Solomons</hi> Chariot, <hi>the pillars of it is,</hi> (Cant. 3. 10.) <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the bottome thereof Gold, the covering of it of purple, the midſt
thereof beeing paved with love, for the daughters of Jeruſalem.</hi> And
Chriſt chooſeth to dwell in a heart paved with love and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Spirit of the Lord is a Dove, the ſpirit of
grace is a gaul-leſſe and gentle ſpirit. Grace, grace is the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centeſt
thing of the world, there is no wild fire of ſinfull wrath
in grace. Bitterneſſe, rayling, jeering, perſecution with the
tongue, outcries againſt Aſſemblies, Presbyteries, are not the
tooles of the ſpirit of grace; yea calumnies, ſalt writings on
either ſide are not from that ſpirit of Chriſt which hath a
hand to wipe teares off the faces of the mourners in <hi>Zion;</hi> To
all raylings, all bitter mockings againſt Presbyteries and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
wee ſay, wee are deſirous not to bee driven off the
roade way to heaven, but to goe on, <hi>Through honour and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
by evill report and good report, as deceivers, and yet true.</hi> One
inch of a good conſcience is rather to bee choſen, then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
yards of windie credit. Meeke <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi>
uſed not ſuch a ſtile of language, nor is ſuch Grammar from
heaven, nor ſmelleth it of the holy Ghoſts pen.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if wee bee the children of one father, it might
breed ſtrange thoughts in our minds, when the ſonnes of one
father <hi>Independents</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (ſpare mee, neceſſitie, not
love of factions forceth mee to theſe tearmes) ſhall ſing one
ſong up before the throne, to him that liveth and reigneth for
ever, that wee cannot gather heate and warmneſſe of love in
one arke, and in one Church here in the earth, pens and
tongues ſalted and ſteeped in the gall of bitterneſſe are not the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113056:20"/>
fruits of the Spirit. Shall wee kill and devoure one another
all the day, and lodge together in one heaven at night, and
can wee ſay one to another in heaven, <hi>haſt thou ſound me, O
mine enemy?</hi> ſhall there bee any factions, any ſides, either reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> in heaven, or nationall
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> (which yet differ not eſſentially (I am
ſure) but onely in the poore accidents of <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi>) and
yet on earth wee muſt bee at daggers, at rentings, diviſions;
are there two Chriſts, becauſe two nations?</p>
            <p>Fiftly, truth is never victorious by perſecution; now the
Scripture ſpeaketh of a perſecution with the tongue, <hi>Jer. 18. 18.
Come</hi> (ſay they) <hi>let us ſmite Jeremiah with the tongue. Job</hi> thus
complayneth of his friends who never put violent hands in
him, Chap. 19. 22. <hi>Why doe you perſecute me as God, and are not
ſatisfied with my fleſh?</hi> then tongue perſecution is an eating of
the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which wee profeſſe is a Goſpel of peace,
wee preach warre betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, and warre
betweene the womans Seed and the Serpent. But oh! ſhould
wee preach warre betweene the Saints? wee have choyſer gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
chaines to tie us together, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 4. There is <hi>one body, and
one ſpirit, even as yee are called in one hope of your calling. 5. One
Lord, one faith, one Baptiſme. 6. One God, and Father of all.</hi> Have
wee need of Prelats and a high Commiſſion Court, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevants
ſent out to hunt us for praying together, that they
may reconcile us and unite us together, as wee were all one
within theſe few yeares?</p>
            <p>Seventhly, the more grace and mercy wee have from <hi>God our
Father, and from our Lord Ieſus,</hi> the more peace amongſt our
ſelves, and the more grace the more compaſſion toward the
weakneſſe of Brethren. Chriſt is an uniting and a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Saviour, his blood and his ſpirit ſoweth and needleth
together the hearts of the <hi>lambe and the Leopard, of the Calfe and
of the young Lion, Eſay</hi> 11. 6.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, the Saints of the moſt High are ſtiled <hi>the meeke of
the earth, Eſay</hi> 11. 4. there bee no meeke creatures on earth but
the regenerate. <hi>Buls</hi> and <hi>Lions</hi> fight together, <hi>Lions</hi> and
<hi>Woolves</hi> purſue <hi>Lambes.</hi> But wee have not heard of warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113056:20"/>
               <hi>Lambes</hi> and <hi>Lambes; Why ſhould wee ſtrive, for wee are
brethren?</hi> how unſeemly that one redeemed one ſhould hate,
perſecute and chaſe another redeemed one, even into the gates
of heaven?</p>
            <p>Ninthly, are wee <hi>not debtors one to another?</hi> and the ſum wee
owe is love. O what a ſpirit of accommodation was in that
choſen veſſel <hi>Paul!</hi> who ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 22. I am made all
things to all men, that I might by all means ſave ſame.</hi> This is
<hi>Pauls charge, Gal.</hi> 6. 1, 2. who will have love to put in joynt an
overtaken ſinner, in the ſpirit of meekneſſe, and ſo it is, love
doth not onely beare it ſelfe, but alſo the burdens of our
brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo fulfilleth the Law of Chriſt; love planted
by Chriſt is the Law of Chriſt, and why doe wee by ruptures
and diviſions labour to fruſtrate the end of Chriſts prayer,
which is, <hi>John</hi> 17. 2. I pray (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that they may all bee
one, as thou Father art in mee, and I in thee?</hi> if wee bee one in
<hi>uno tertio,</hi> in the heart of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Father, why
but wee ſhould bee one amongſt our ſelves? yea <hi>love</hi> is burnt in
tender feeling and compaſſion with the very ſmoake of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe that is on fire, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 15. Love is not eaſily
provoked;</hi> it is a pardoning grace, and hath ſtrong ſhoulders
to beare the madneſſe and infirmities of a fellow heire of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<hi>Love thinketh not evill, love</hi> muſt abound in love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
thoughts towards others, as every element aboundeth
in its owne ſpheare, it thinketh not that the Saints doe hunt
for a dominion over Saints. 6. <hi>Love rejoyceth not in iniquitie.</hi>
Curſed bee that love that exulteth when malignants prevaile,
and rejoyceth not when the cauſe of the Lord and his people
are victorious. <hi>Love rejoyceth in the truth;</hi> then <hi>love</hi> is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and ſicke when hereſies and ſects prevaile; and ſigheth to
ſee <hi>Altars multiplied,</hi> and that many <hi>falſe Christs</hi> and <hi>falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi>
ariſe. Wee cannot deny but God hath put his ſeale to
the miniſtery of the ſervants of Chriſt that went from this to
<hi>New England,</hi> and in the wiſdome of God they ſaw and doe
ſee, that libertie of conſcience is no remedie, but phyſick
worſe then the diſeaſe; againſt falſe religions; It is now off my
way to diſpute. But I know certainly a negative argument
from the practiſe of Chriſt and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> becauſe they ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113056:21"/>
not up heathen Magiſtrates and Wolves, not fathers, to
puniſh falſe teachers, is not good divinitie to infer libertie of
conſcience; for in their practiſe they ſtirred not up the
ſword of the Magiſtrate againſt extortions and rapines in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans,
nor againſt the perſecuting and killing of the Lord
of Glory, nor againſt ſedition, inceſts, tyranny over the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi>
and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> bribing and unjuſtice uſed againſt <hi>Paul</hi> by
<hi>Felix</hi> and others who were ſubject to higher Magiſtrates, and
many other ſcandalous ſinnes againſt the ſecond table; any
might inferre libertie of converſation in matters of the ſecond
table, no leſſe then libertie of conſcience in matters of the firſt
table, if this argument hold good. But the doctrine of Chriſt
and his Apoſtles giveth to the Magiſtrate the Sword againſt
<hi>evill doers, Rom.</hi> 13. 4. but teachers of falſe doctrine though in
the matter of ceremonies, are evill doers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. and they
pervert ſoules, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and kill ſoules, and <hi>ſubvert whole houſes,</hi>
and make their followers <hi>twofold more the Children of hell, then
they themſelves, Matth.</hi> 23. 15. nor did wee ever dreame
that the bloody ſword was a mean of converſion of ſoules, the
Goſpel is ſo the onely power of <hi>God</hi> to ſalvation, but that
hindereth not but the Magiſtrate is to reſtraine by a coercive
power the man that teacheth that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is not true God
conſubſtantiall with the Father,</hi> becauſe the Sword ought to
curbe the ſpreading of falſe doctrine, it followeth not that it
is a meane of propagating true doctrine. But of this more
poſſibly in another place. Nor doe I intend the bloody ſword
ſhould bee drawne againſt every different opinion holden by
the truely godly, though in the government of the Church
all ſee not with the ſame light.</p>

            <p>Firſt, extreame afflictions, as Phyſicke, ſtirre up both the
good and the bad humours, they make legible both the good
and the ill in the man, and which of them is the predominant;
when the fire boileth extremely, if there bee a ſcum in the
liquor, it is that which is firſt ſeene, yea and it is not onely
the vertue and ſtrength of the fire, but alſo of the gold that
the droſſe goeth to its owne place, if it were all gold there
ſhould bee no ſeparation at all; the Diſciples here put a falſe
Character upon Chriſt, that hee hath neither love to them,
nor care of them, they double the word, <hi>Maſter, maſter,</hi> and
that is a check, being added to the other, <hi>careſt thou not for
us?</hi> it ſaith 1. that hee is worſe then other maſters, better
ſerve any maſter then Chriſt, a maſter will care for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
ſo hee can helpe them, no earthly maſter will ſleepe,
when hee knoweth his ſervants are drowning. 2. They object
his ſluggiſhneſſe, <hi>careſt thou not for us? hee bath neither love nor
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113056:22"/>
reſpect to us, though wee have forſaken all and followed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>apprehenſion</hi> putteth a baſtard glowme upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and cauſeth us to take a falſe meaſure of <hi>Christ;</hi> Fancy hath
ſtrong operations, eſpecially when it commeth in the roome
and place of faith. What could they imagine now but that
the Sea will drowne Chriſt? hee had ſaid to them, hee muſt
bee <hi>delivered to the hands of ſinners and bee crucified,</hi> or then, hee
could walke upon the Sea and eſcape death, and would let
them goe to the mercie of the raging Seas, and periſh in the
waters? now this was a belying of the promiſes of <hi>God;
Chriſt</hi> had both decreed and ſaid that they behooved to bee
<hi>his witneſſes,</hi> and to carry his name to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and carry
the chariot of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> thorough all the world, and <hi>be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up to Synagogues and councels, and bee beaten and ſcourged,
and hated of all men for his names ſake,</hi> now all theſe are dreams,
they muſt bee drowned in the waters, through no other cauſe
but the negligence and cold affection that their maſter Chriſt
beareth to them, though they had preferred him and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to all the world. Wee are beaſts under great temptations,
and phantaſie is all the wit that leadeth beaſts, ſo the <hi>Prophet</hi>
ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Pſal. 72. 22. ſo fooliſh was I and ignorant, I
was a beaſt before thee;</hi> and why a beaſt? hee had ſaid in his
heart, Verſ. 11. <hi>how doth God know?</hi> that was a ſtrong dreame:
<hi>hee that teacheth man knowledge, ſhall bee not know? Pſal.</hi> 94. 10.
and Verſ. 13. <hi>Verely I have cleanſed my heart in vaine,</hi>

               </gap> is an
emptie thing, and our word ſmoake or reeke ſeemeth to come
from it, then ſaid the Prophets imagination, it is as empty a
thing as ſmoake to ſerve God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſenſe is ſtrong as fancy, drowning and death was
come over board, and therefore they complaine of a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and ſleeping Chriſt; now old and gray haired judgements
move us not, as the drowning of the <hi>old world,</hi> the deſtruction
of <hi>Sodom</hi> with fire and brimſtone, theſe are gone many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
yeares, therefore they affect not us, and the day of
judgement is farre off, and where is the promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming?
ſay the ſcoffers, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. and ſo did the people, <hi>Ezek.
12. 27. Sonne of man behold they of the houſe of Iſrael ſay, The viſion
that hee ſeeth is for many dayes to come, and hee prophecieth of times

that are afarre off.</hi> But when death is at thy right ſide, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
upon the ball of thy cheek, that acteth and worketh on us.
When the Sword is two hundreth miles from us, wee take no
care of it; but if the enemy were comming in at the ports of
the Citie, and wee ſaw them burning houſes, and killing huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
and children, and heard the crying of women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
wee ſhould then bee on the other extremitie, and cry,
<hi>Chriſt is changed and cares not for us;</hi> keepe good and heavenly
thoughts of Chriſt in the ſaddeſt times, <hi>Pſal. 22. 2. O my God
I cry by day and thou heareſt not, in the night ſeaſon I am not ſilent;</hi>
What then? doth hee fall a chiding with God? doth hee ſay,
<hi>Oh, God is changed, hee careth not for us? no:</hi> yea the contrary hee
ſaith, Verſ. 3. <hi>But thou art holy, O thou that inhabiteſt the praiſes
of Iſrael. 4. Our fathers truſted in thee and were delivered;</hi> ſay in
the mouth of hell, I will beleeve, as <hi>Job 13. 15. Though the
Lord ſhould kill mee, I will truſt in him;</hi> faith liveth and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the grave, in the throat of hell. How ſweet is it to heare,
<hi>There is the grave of a buried beleever;</hi> theſe bee the aſhes of a dead
man, that went into the grave in faith and hope as Chriſt did,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. Beware of falſe imaginations of God in time of
trouble. Fancy can ſpin out and forge a God weake of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who hath forgotten his promiſes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49. 14, 15. wee caſt
behind us the promiſes in the day of trouble; yea which is
fearefull, often when wee conceive wee are praying, wee are
but chiding with God, and not farre from blaſpheming;
grace in the day of trouble layeth ſilence on the thoughts, wee
have need of an high Prieſt to waſh our ſacrifices, and when we
have prayed, there is ſo much ſinne in our prayers that Chriſt
muſt pray them over againe, as it were, for hee maketh prayers
and <hi>requeſts for us, Heb.</hi> 8. 25.</p>
            <p>They awoke him ſaying, Maſter, maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayer</hi> awaketh a ſeeming ſleeping <hi>God,</hi> and puts him to it,
wee cannot take a better courſe in trouble then to runne to
Chriſt by prayer, <hi>Pſal. 130. 1. Out of the deeps have I cryed unto
thee, Pſal. 18. 6. In my diſtreſſe I called upon the Lord:</hi> that is a

his ſonnes deſtruction. 7. <hi>Ariſe O Lord, ſave mee;</hi> and
hee anſwers himſelfe, <hi>Thou haſt broken the teeth of the ungodly:</hi>
A praying Army muſt be a victorious Army. If this ſtorme
had not riſen they ſhould not have prayed: alas! wee put
Chriſt often in the reere; or wee keepe Chriſt to a reſerve or a
recrute; when we have tryed Phyſitians for twelve yeares, and
ſpent all, then wee come to Chriſt, when wee can doe no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
There is much deceit in bed-prayers, for the <hi>principium
motus,</hi> the firſt ſpring is extrinſecall, it comes from the rod on
us; it is true, naturall conſciences deaded and benummed with
rubbing doe gather warme blood, and are ſtirred up to devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and faſting, and praying in the ſpirit, and the ſpirit of
prayer may bee wakened by judgement,<note place="margin">Iudgements of themſelves are the occaſion, rather then the cauſe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> but judgement is not
the cauſe of praying in the godly, but the occaſion. Hee that
raiſeth up a ſleeping man is not the cauſe of his motion and
walking, the cauſe was in him, when hee was faſt aſleepe, his
life and the Locomotive power is the cauſe of walking, and
this is not put in the ſleeping man by him who raiſeth him:
when the hypocrite and ungodly man faſteth and prayeth,
the hand of an angry God is both occaſion and cauſe of his
praying; wee would try what moveth us to faſting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Some ſignes that ſinne, not afflictions put us to faſting and praying.</note> whether ſinne or afflictions, this is a good ſigne, if we
can pray with as great intention of ſpirit to bee delivered from
the dominion of ſinne, as for the pardon of the guilt; we may
be afraid that God heare us when wee pray for deliverance
from the dominion of Idol-ſinnes, experience teacheth this.
But wee are never afraid to bee heard, but afraid with the feare
of unbeleefe, for the moſt part, that wee bee not heard, when
wee pray for pardon and deliverance from the guilt of ſinne;
the reaſon is, men may hate the guilt of ſinne, and yet love the
ſinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if affliction put us to a humiliation for ſinne, as
ſinne and the depth of griefe for ſinne putteth us to condemne
our ſelves without flattery and lying, the contrary of which
is when in trouble wee give God good words, and have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us lying hearts and thinke not ſo, as the people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 34.

flatter him with their mouth, and they lyed to him with their tongues.
37. for their heart was not right within them;</hi> men doe then flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>Thirdly, when we are more anxious in our fasting for <hi>Zion,</hi>
and the <hi>taking of the Arke of God,</hi> then for our ſelves, our Lawes,
goods, houſes, lives and liberties; when <hi>David</hi> made the 25.

though hee confirme and ſtrengthen that faith by miracles.<note place="margin">How the rod of God muſt work us to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, ere we be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</note> It is fit that Chriſt rebuke us ere hee deliver us from drowning.
Hee firſt rebuketh the noble man and all his nation for unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
and then healeth his ſonne, <hi>John</hi> 4. 48, 49, 50. Hee firſt
chideth <hi>Martha</hi> out of her unbeleefe, and then raiſeth her

heard that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had beene boyled with the ſword of
the Lord, but the ſcumme of their Idolatry and blood remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in them; whilſt the wicked of theſe kingdomes, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
bloody Iriſh, rotten hearted men, ſuch backſliders
and perjured Apoſtates, as are in <hi>Scotland, delivered to Satan</hi>
and excommunicated, while theſe taſte of the Gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
of the wrath of God in this warre, the hand of God
cannot bee removed, and therefore that muſt bee taken notice
of, <hi>Jer. 6. 29. The bellowes are burnt, the lead is conſumed of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113056:24"/>

O that our Lord would boyle out on the fire the ſcumme of
both kingdomes. The whoredomes of <hi>Popiſh Aegypt,</hi> and the
ceremonies, the inventions of men are not mourned for by the
paſtors of the Lord, ſure, I am, not by moſt of the Miniſters in
<hi>Scotland:</hi> What can wee ſay for our confidence in our Armies,
our multitude, Parliaments, Navies, our extortion, oppreſſion,
unjuſtice, hollow-heartedneſſe in the cauſe of God, our lying,
couſening, budding and bribing, our breach of our Covenant,
denying of juſtice to the oppreſſed, to the widow, ſtrangers,
and Orphans, to the poore and needy, the abominable and
daring opinions of God, his Sonne Chriſt, his Church, his
Sacraments and free grace and ſanctification and holineſſe in
this land? Thirdly, judgements on a land or a perſon are the
cup of the Lords fury: now often it is the grounds and thick
of the cup, which is the ſubſtance and vertue of the cup, and
muſt worke the cure. And poſſibly to ſip at the brim will
not doe it, it is a judgement that ſome get not leave to heate
in the furnace, but are dipped in in the flood, and are never at
leaſure to commune with their owne heart, nor hath the Lord
time to <hi>allure them in the wilderneſſe, Hoſ.</hi> 2. 14. as <hi>Ephraim</hi>
was in the Oven as a <hi>Cake unturned:</hi> poore <hi>Germany</hi> hath
not beene ſlenderly dipped in, and preſently out againe, they
have now beene in the floods, and under the water theſe 26.
yeares, theſe kingdomes are yet greene, not ripened, for the
mercy of deliverance, ourſcumme remaineth in us; diviſions
amongſt us ſay, it is not yet time for our triumph, <hi>The fields
are not while already to harveſt;</hi> when all godlineſſe is to diſpute
out new wayes to heaven, and not ſeeke after the power of
godlineſſe; it is good wee ſee the farre end of the judgement,
and that wee bee heart-humbled and tamed, and made wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
children, that wee <hi>put our mouth in the duſt, and ſit alone on
the ground, and keepe ſilence, and bee filled with reproach, and beare
the yoake, Lament.</hi> 3. 28, 29, 30. and reſolve to <hi>beare the indignation
of the Lord, becauſe we have ſinned, Mic.</hi> 7. 9. and it is good we be
threſhed while we be ſo broken as <hi>we may remember, and bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
and never open our mouth any more, becauſe of our ſhame, when
the Lord is pacified toward us, for all that we have done, Ezek.</hi> 16. 63.</p>

Marke 4. 40. Why are you ſo fearefull? Luke 8. 25. Where
is your faith?</p>
            <p>The ground of their doubting and unbeleefe is exceſſive and

you?</hi> hence the Text will leade us to inquire in the bad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of this feare; which that wee may doe, a little of the
affections in generall; 2. of this bad feare condemned by our
Lord in theſe following propoſitions.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Propoſition.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Grace doth not extirpate, but regulate feare and other affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> Grace removeth not affections; <hi>Chriſt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
not their <hi>feare,</hi> but onely their <hi>fearfulneſſe</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo
high bended. <hi>Grace</hi> maketh not men Stoicks, nor does it root
out Nature: Nature of it ſelf, as it commeth out of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
of the Creator, is an innocent thing. Whatever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
the high former, and Potter have concerning all things,
in the exerciſe of his abſolute, but moſt pure and holy Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
over lame Veſſels, yet <hi>all that hee made is good;</hi> hee is
the author of no ſinfulneſſe in the Creature. But hee doth
not extirpate the nature, and harmleſſe being of naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
A <hi>Chirurgion</hi> taketh not away life and ſenſe, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rottenneſſe and corrupt humors, that are enemies to life and
ſenſe. Grace embroidereth ſinleſſe nature, but does not turne
it out at doores: Give your luſt to <hi>Chriſt</hi> who maketh all
things <hi>new;</hi> and hee ſhall reſtore it againe to you in renewed
<hi>love:</hi> Put your fainting in his hand, and hee'll make it holy
<hi>feare:</hi> Chriſts furnace melteth but out the refuſe and droſſe
of our affections. What fire was in <hi>Peter a Fiſher</hi> is but made
holy zeale in <hi>Peter the Apoſtle;</hi> no man is the worſe that hee
come through the new Phyſitians hands; hee maketh braſſe
Gold: I ſhould wiſh no better, but that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would barter
an old heart with a new; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> has skill to over-gold na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with Grace. Grace turned not <hi>Job</hi> in a lumpe of iron,
that hee could not weepe or ſorrow; for it was not deſtructive
of Grace which hee ſaith, <hi>Job 16. 16. My face is foule with
weeping:</hi> The Man <hi>Chriſt</hi> that choſen flower, and the rareſt
pearle of ſinleſſe nature both wept, <hi>Job. 11. 35. Luke</hi> 19. 42.
and was feared, <hi>Luke 22. 44. Heb.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Propoſ.</hi> Grace but removeth the ſcumme, and exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:113056:25"/>
of our affections: As firſt, Grace is a regular thing, and
moves as the Starres doe, in a motion, contrary to the motion
of the whole World; it moveth not as nature doth, to ſeeke
its own being and life, but with ſubordination to <hi>God. Bee
angry, but ſinne not,</hi> holdeth in all; <hi>Feare, but ſinne not;</hi> Love
the Creature, <hi>but ſinne not;</hi> Truſt holy men, <hi>but ſinne not;</hi>
Sorrow at calamities, <hi>but ſinne not.</hi> Grace is a ſtraight line
that meaſureth both it ſelfe, and all crooked lines. And
therefore the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is a teaching guide, <hi>Tit.
2. 11. The grace of God, 12. teacheth us to deny ungodlineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, grace is an excellent skreene between the ſoule
and the burning heat of affections, it is a ſtrong banke to
keepe off over-ſwelling tides of luſts in the ſoule; when affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſtart up without leave of the grace of God, then a man
according to Gods heart <hi>David</hi> will but utterly deſtroy <hi>Nabal</hi>
and all hee hath, the Diſciples, becauſe they cannot have a
nights lodiging, will doe no leſſe then burne Cities and
Townes, &amp; have <hi>Samaria</hi> deſtroyed as <hi>Sodome,</hi> as if Chriſt were
come in the world to raiſe fire and ſword againſt men, women
and ſucking infants, but when affections looke toward the
creatures, the grace of God ſets them on to move on leaſurely
and upon ſlow wheeles, and loppeth off from our affections
all the wanton and luxuriant branches, that is a ſweet fruite
of the <hi>grace of God, 1 Cor. 7. 29. But this I ſay, Brethren, the
time is ſhort, it remaineth that both they that have wives, bee as
though they had none. 30. And they that weepe, as though they wept
not, and they that rejoyce as though they rejoyced not, and they that buy
as though they poſſeſſed not;</hi> and mortification laugheth at mirth
and laughter, as <hi>Solomon</hi> in his repenting dayes doth, <hi>Eccleſ.
2. 2. I ſaid of laughter, it is mad, and of mirth, what doth it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Propoſition. There bee diverſe diſeaſes in the feare of
the Diſciples; as firſt, their feare is more then enough, they
ſpeake as if the Sea could drowne <hi>Chriſt</hi> and them both,<note place="margin">The faults of the Diſciples feare.</note> ere the
<hi>man Chriſt</hi> awake. Hence their precipitations, <hi>Maſter, maſter,</hi>
and their complaint, <hi>careſt thou not for us?</hi> our affections in
great dangers runne with the head formoſt, not onely before
the light of faith, but before that reaſon command them to
riſe; according to the meaſure of unmortified luſts ſo is the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:113056:26"/>
ſwelling of our affections; grace keeping them within banks,
elſe they are as ſome great Seas that have great tides. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there is much unbeleefe in this feare; and therefore as
<hi>Matthew</hi> relates the ſtory, Chriſt ſaid to them, <hi>why are yee fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
O yee of little faith?</hi> and as <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith, 4. 40. <hi>How is it that
you have no faith?</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>where is your faith?</hi> that is,
they had little or no great ſtrength of faith, with this fear, it
being mixed with much doubting; hence as Chriſt denyeth
not ſimply that they had no faith, ſo hee condemneth their
unbeleefe, <hi>unbeleefe</hi> doth not a little dull our apprehenſion, ſo
that death and afflictions looke on us with a more ugly and
awſome countenance, the more of the ſunne bee covered in an
eclipſe, the greater is the darkneſſe: <hi>unbeleefe</hi> is a darke black
webbecaſt over our eyes, that wee ſee not what <hi>omnipotency</hi> can
doe, and how it ſecondeth the faithfulneſſe of God, to make
good his owne promiſes, our corrupt affections ariſing in
their ſtrength are great enemies to righteous judging. Hence
thirdly, this feare doth make them to misfather their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they lay the blame of their danger on Chriſts ſleeping, and
his forgetfulneſſe and careleſneſſe of them, as their complaint
ſheweth: <hi>Careſt thou nor for us? wee periſh, and thou ſleepeſt;</hi> in this,
if in any thing, it is true; <hi>happy is hee who knoweth the cauſes of
things,</hi> wee are often ſmitten of God in the darke. To apply
theſe to our ſelves. It is much to know the cauſes of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
warre in the rwo kingdomes, ſome ſay it is becauſe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is not given to every man to live in what Religion hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
but this is a ſin that every man doe,<note place="margin">It were good to inquire the cauſes of the judgement.</note> 
               <hi>What ſeemeth good
in his owne eyes, becauſe there is not a judge to put any to ſhame, Judg.
18. Chap.</hi> 19. 1, 2. the contrary then cannot bee the cauſe of
the ſo great judgement. Others ſay <hi>rebellion</hi> againſt the <hi>King</hi>
is the cauſe, but rather the not timous <hi>riſing to helpe the Lord,</hi>
and his oppreſſed people <hi>againſt the mightie</hi> is the cauſe. The
defection of both kingdomes to altar worſhip, imagerie,
idolatry, Popiſh and Arminian Doctrine, the articles of Perth
Aſſembly followed and practiſed in our owne kingdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance, the ignorance of God, people periſhing for
want of knowledge, both under prelacy, and now the not
building of the houſe of God in this land, the backſliding of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113056:26"/>
many after the Covenant of God is ſworne, are the true cauſes,
and it is to bee feared that if <hi>Presbyteriall government</hi> bee erected
in this land (as wee hope it ſhall) if this bee not taken heed to,
it ſhall continue a judgement on the Land, and it is this, many
both preachers and profeſſors ſhall conforme to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as they would doe to either the prelaticall, or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall
way as many time-ſervers doe) and ſhall hate and
perſecute the power of godlineſſe under the pretence of <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Browniſts, Separatiſts, independents,</hi> and the like, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
an Antichriſtian and rotten heart ſhall doe what in
them lies, under that colour to vex, oppreſſe and baniſh many
godly men out of the land. But this is to bee conſidered, if
it were not needfull there were a Faſt through both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
to deale with God to find out the true cauſes of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings,
and theſe heavy judgements in which in the three king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
many hundreth thouſands are killed. I doubt if under
any Prince or Emperour there bee a hiſtory can parallel the
blood ſhed within theſe few yeares; <hi>Job</hi> when God viſited him
deſired to know wherefore <hi>God contended with him:</hi> it is a ſad
thing to lye drowned under unknown and fatherleſſe plagues,
wee being ignorant of the cauſes of Gods judgement; ſo wee
ſuffer blind croſſes like the Oxe that beares the yoake and
knoweth nothing of the art of husbandry, or the horſe killed
in the battell, and yet is ignorant of State-affaires, and of the
cauſes of warre, and of diſorders in Lawes, Liberties, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in State and Church, wee are like one ſmitten in the dark
night by a ſpirit or a ghoſt, but hee ſeeth not who ſtriketh.
Oh it were good wee would inquire, as the Prophet doth, <hi>Eſa.
42. 24. who gave Jacob for a ſpoyle; and Iſrael to robbery?</hi> and
<hi>wherefore is all this come on us? why doth the Lord contend with us?</hi>
O make us know our iniquities.</p>
            <p>Often the rod maketh a lying report of God,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> and accuſeth
Chriſt in our deſertions. O! Chriſt is unkind, hee is changed,
hee hath forſaken me; wee can ſooner ſpy a fault in Chriſt
under deſertion then in our ſelves, and wee often reaſon from
that which is no cauſe for the cauſe. Chriſt ſeemeth
changed to us, and unmercifull and ſleepey and careleſſe. Firſt,
when the judgement is extreame and wee apprehend it as a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:113056:27"/>
fruite of the anger and vengeance of God.<note place="margin">The cauſes of miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſt.</note> Apprehenſion
gives life to afflictions and caſteth in many ounce weights of
wrath in our cup, which was never there, becauſe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
giveth in againſt us lying libells and unjuſt complaints,
ſuch as this, (<hi>thou art not in Chriſt) nor a convert, nor a pardoned
and juſtified ſinner;</hi>) and wee firſt retort the lying libell upon
Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>O! Chriſt hath forgotten to bee mercifull,</hi> wee ſee Chriſt in
the falſe glaſſe, in our extreame ſuffering, our ſinne and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
joyning together. Secondly, Chriſt may ſleepe
and hide himſelfe in a great tryall, and when hee is gone, and
grace hath no actuall influence on our ſoules, then wee languiſh
and die; the paſſes of the Clock being laid by, there is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all, and the wheeles gather ruſt. Should wee ſuppoſe
that the Creator of nature did ſuſpend his influence, all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
operations ſhould ceaſe, there ſhould bee no motion in
the Sunne, it ſhould neither riſe nor goe downe, the raine
ſhould not fall, the wind ſhould not blow, living things
could not move, Beaſts could not walke, Fowels could not fly,
Fiſhes could not ſwimme, Roſes, Flowers, and Hearbs could
not grow, &amp;c. becauſe hee cauſeth all theſe to bee, and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
influence addeth oyle to all wheeles, and rowleth and
moveth them, elſe they could not ſtirre; ſo Chriſt in the
ſpheare of grace being the firſt mover, if his influence ſtand
ſtill, all our wheeles as wanting oyle and motion gather ruſt
and ſtand ſtill; <hi>Paul</hi> cannot call <hi>Jeſus Lord,</hi> the <hi>Spouſe</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not, for the bridegroome will not draw, <hi>Can. 1. David</hi>
dieth and withereth a hundreth deaths; for <hi>God</hi> hides his face.
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> fainteth, for <hi>God</hi> glowmeth, <hi>Haman</hi> is downe <hi>amongſt
the dead,</hi> in the grave, Chriſt his life worketh not, ſo here in
trouble Chriſt ſtandeth <hi>behind the mount,</hi> and the poore Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
faint and die, and dreame, and are all afraid in a ſtorme,
becauſe <hi>God</hi> ſeemeth to ſleepe, as if <hi>God</hi> were dead: <hi>Oxthodoxe</hi>
and ſound apprhenſions of Chriſt in us are not habits, but
acts, and are in us as lightnings are in the ayre, when nature
actually cooperateth, or as fire is in the flint, not but when
it is beaten out with force. Thirdly, diſtempers and feavers on
faith take away the taſte and the honey out of Chriſt, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is not a father to the child in a fit of an ague.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:113056:27"/>
Thirdly, when extreame danger is neare and the Army
foyled, and the enemy entering in at the ports, our courage
is as farre to ſeeke as ever was the courage of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> Oh
then wee are gone, this is our death, the cauſe is now loſed,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is buried, hee cannot riſe againe, <hi>Eſay 7. 2. It was told
the houſe of David, ſaying, Syria is confederat with Ephraim, and
his heart was moved, as the trees of the field:</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is to
bee moved from place to place, and is aſcribed to <hi>Cain</hi> the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 12. wee feare the creature too much, becauſe
hee can kill the body, and wee feare the Lord of heaven and
earth to little, though hee have dominion over both ſoule
and body, remember what a forgetting of God it is to feare
the creature in Gods cauſe, <hi>Eſay 51. 12. I, even I am hee that
comforteth you, who art thou that ſhalt bee afraid of a man that ſhall
die, and of the Sonne of man that ſhall bee made as graſſe?</hi> is it ſo
great a ſinne to feare man? ay, the next words beare no leſſe.
13. <hi>and forgetteſt the Lord thy maker that ſtretched out the heaven,
and laid the foundation of the earth;</hi> an unbeleeving people hath
a feare of their owne, which the people of God are not to
follow, <hi>Eſay 8. 12. Feare yee not the feare of this people, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            </p>
            <p>Matth. 8. 26. Then hee ſaith unto them, why are yee fearefull,
O yee of little faith? Luke 8. 25. where is your fatth?</p>
            <p>That which Chriſt firſt ſeeketh, and firſt miſſeth in any is
their faith. Where is your faith? by comparing the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi>
together a little faith is faith, and it is no faith, that
is, not ſo great a faith as is required in a great ſtorme. Hence
theſe concluſions concerning a little faith.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Concluſ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">What is a ſmall or weake faith.</note> A little faith in regard of the nature of faith is
faith; as Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. ſaith not, <hi>they have no faith;</hi> but
hee childeth them for their <hi>little faith;</hi> as the leaſt of fire is fire,
as well as a fire of all the timber and fewell of the earth is fire,
and the fourth part of a drop of dew is water, no leſſe then
the whole element of water is water; the leaſt meaſure of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faith is ſaving faith; and there bee other three acts of
free grace that are of the ſame nature. As firſt, Gods free love
of election to glory can neither bee halfe nor divided; the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:113056:28"/>
meaneſt of the elect is no leſſe a choſen Senator inrolled in the
booke of life then <hi>Abraham,</hi> or great <hi>Moſes.</hi> Secondly, all
the Saints are equally ranſomed and equally married on
Chriſt, there was no greater ranſome of Chriſts blood given
for <hi>Job, David, the Apoſtles</hi> then for thee, O thou the leaſt of
Saints. Thirdly, all are equally ſaved and crowned Kings;
of the degrees of grace and glory, I doe not now ſpeake.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Concluſ.</hi> Faith and fainting may conſiſt together at one
and the ſame time, as night and day are one in the twylight,
ſo the poore man ſaid,<note place="margin">Faith and fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting may conſiſt together in one</note> 
               <hi>Marke 9. 24. I beleeve,</hi> that is faith, <hi>Lord
helpe my unbeleefe,</hi> that is fainting; and <hi>David, Pſal. 31. 22. I
I ſaid in my haſt, I am cut off from before mine eyes;</hi> here is much
fainting. <hi>Nevertheleſſe thou heardest the voyce of my ſupplication;</hi>
here muſt bee much faith, when his prayers hath beene heard:
So <hi>Jonah Chap. 4. Then I ſaid, I am caſt out of thy ſight,</hi> this was
baſe fainting; <hi>yet I will looke toward thy holy Temple,</hi> this is faith,
and <hi>Jeremiah, ch. 20. 7. O Lord thou hast deceived me, and I was
deceived, thou art ſtronger then I, and haſt prevailed, I am in deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
daily, and every one mocketh mee.</hi> Hee fainted not a little, when
hee ſpake ſo of God to God; but Verſ. 11. hee getteth up
the mount againe; <hi>But the Lord is with mee as a mightie terrible
one, therefore my perſecutors ſhall ſtumble, they ſhall not prevaile.</hi> A
wreſtling faith oppoſing doubtings and faintings is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a vigorous life of Chriſt, and weakneſſe here is an
argument of ſtrength and deadneſſe doth argue life, and fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
beleeving; wee have a bad opinion of our owne ſtate
when there is no cauſe, and the reaſon is, that it is a reflect
act to know our owne acts of faith;<note place="margin">Reaſons why wee know our grace ſo hardly.</note> and firſt, reflect acts are
more rare and difficill, becauſe more ſpirituall then direct
acts. Secondly, the light of ſaving grace muſt concurre in all
our reflect acts, but it ſeemeth to mee to bee eaſier, becauſe
more naturall to reflect upon our doubting and unbeleefe, then
upon our beleeving, eſpecially where there is any tenderneſſe
of conſcience, as a ſleeping man knoweth not that hee is in
health, nor can hee have any ſenſe of his health while hee
ſleepeth, and yet a ſleeping man may know and feele the paine
of ſickneſſe, and of an aking bone, and thereby bee wakened
to feele it more ſenſibly, though I know there bee a neceſſitie
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113056:28"/>
of the influence of ſaving grace, either to know our fainting,
or our faith in a ſpirituall manner, yet there bee degrees of
grace here.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Concluſ.</hi> Thoſe who have a great faith <hi>in habit,</hi> many have a
little faith in <hi>act,</hi> and the Diſciples who had forſaken all and
followed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt have a great meaſure of <hi>faith of fiduciall
adherence;</hi> it is a great faith to renounce all our boſome-lovers
for <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Though 2. their faith of light, <hi>or in regard of
knowledge</hi> was weak; they not knowing <hi>Chriſts</hi> death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
which are principal Articles of faith, <hi>Matth. 16. 21,
22, 23. Joh.</hi> 20 9. Yet in this preſent act their faith was weake.
The grounds of a weake faith in regard of the act, and ſome
ſpeciall exigents of a prevailing temptation: are firſt, becauſe
faith is one thing,<note place="margin">The grounds of a faith weak in action.</note> and the uſe of faith another thing: The
habit of faith is not the compleate and onely cauſe of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
1. Becauſe then the regenerate from the firſt moment of
their regeneration to their dying day, ſhould alwayes beleeve,
which is repugnant to Scripture and all experience; for the
habit of faith, and the ſeed of <hi>God</hi> alwayes remaineth in them,
even when they ſin, they loſe not that, <hi>Joh. 3. 9. 1 Ioh. 2. 27,
28, 29. Ioh. 4. 14. Ier. 32. 40, 41. Eſay</hi> 59. 21. 2. We are
not Lords, having by free-will a dominion over the habit of
faith, to ſtirre it up into acts when wee pleaſe; for then, theſe
that have the habit need not to pray for the actuall influence
of the grace of <hi>God,</hi> to worke in them <hi>to will and to doe,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
many Scriptures, as <hi>Cant. 1. 4. Pſal. 25. 5. Pſal. 86. 11.
Pſal.</hi> 119. 18, 36, 37. 66. 68. 80. 3. Our free-will, at its beſt, is
but <hi>Graces armour-bearer,</hi> and ſervant. <hi>Grace</hi> whether habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or actuall, is Gods Prerogative Royall, and one of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and abſolute flowers of his Crowne. And therefore
wee are Maſters of our owne ſins; wee can bee willingly wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and fall when wee will, we are not maſters of our owne
riſing againe; wee can faint when wee will, but wee beleeve
when <hi>Christ</hi> will, and when his ſaving grace breathes on us,
and neither ſooner nor later, neither more ſtrongly, nor more
remiſſely, then the free-grace of <hi>God,</hi> inableth us: for if wee
could beleeve ere grace blow on us; Firſt, wee could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene
grace, and then ſhould wee carry it all before us; and it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:113056:29"/>
ſhould bee after this, not prevening grace, but prevening
nature, prevening free will. Secondly, if the intention of the
degrees of actuall beleeving were in our power, <hi>Paul</hi> did not
well to aſcribe his <hi>labouring more abundantly</hi> to the grace of
<hi>God,</hi> and not to himſelfe, 1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>But I laboured more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
then they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was
with me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Faith and ſenſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together. Simile.</note> Secondly, our faith is often led by the ſenſe of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and ſecond cauſes, and that is a very bad rule. Faith
and ſenſe may thus bee compared: Faith is like the <hi>juſt horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge</hi>
or watch which ſheweth to us juſtly the houres at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
when there bee neither Sun, Moone, nor Stars to give
notice what time of night it is; ſo rotten boylie <hi>Job,
chap.</hi> 19. 25, 26. when hee had not ſo much as Star-light of
appearance to lead him, but death and rotten boyles, could
in faith point the houre, and ſay, <hi>I know that my Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
liveth, and that I ſhall ſee him for my ſelfe, and my eyes ſhall
behold, and not another, though my reines bee conſumed within mee:</hi>
But ſenſe is not like the <hi>night horologe,</hi> but like the <hi>Sun-diall,</hi> that
cannot point the houres in the night, nay, nor yet in day-light
if the ſame bee under cloud, ſenſe muſt have daylight, and a
ſhining Sun; and can doe nothing for Chriſt upon truſt: and
this is a great unthankfulneſſe in our ſenſe; for it is faith and
not ſenſe that layeth hold on relations, and ſuch a relation
as is betweene husband and wife, ſo the <hi>Lord</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Eſa.
54. 4. Feare not,</hi> that is, beleeve; upon what ground? Upon the
ground of marriage-faith. Ver. 5. <hi>for thy maker is thy husband.</hi>
ſo is faith expreſſed by a marriage word, <hi>Wee are freed from the
Law, Rom.</hi> 7. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>that yee ſhould bee for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
husband,</hi> that <hi>yee ſhould bee maried on another lover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 <hi>Concluſ.</hi> Sometimes wee beleeve on <hi>Chriſt</hi> as morall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
and then wee may both know <hi>Chriſt</hi> and our own ſtate,
if the light of the Spirit concurre to make the promiſes viſible
to our ſpirituall ſenſes: not onely as true, but alſo as good
and ſweet, for wee ſee colours, and apprehend them both as
colours, and as pleaſant and delectable: ſo a man may ſee a
great heape of <hi>Gold</hi> which belongeth to another man, hee ſees
it as of ſuch a colour, and as it offereth it ſelf to the eye; but
becauſe it is not his owne, nor hath hee any hope it can bee
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:113056:29"/>
his owne; hee ſeeth it poſſibly with griefe: but if it were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
and given to him, hee ſhould then ſee it as good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable:
now the grounds of a weak faith, is a weake evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our intereſt in Chriſt; ſmall and weak evidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
weak acts of beleeving: it is true there is ſometime lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
evidence of knowledge, where there is ſtrong adherence,
and ſtrong faith, as many unlettered <hi>Martyrs</hi> of no great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the Scriptures, have dyed with great adherence and
ſtrength of faith: but there is a twofold evidence, one literall,
another ſpirituall, it is unpoſſible there can bee a ſtrong faith,
but there muſt bee a ſtrong ſpirituall evidence proportionable
thereunto to convey it, for faith walketh not without eyes,
and therefore the weakeneſſe of ſpirituall evidence of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in Chriſt (as here the Apoſtles ſee not but Chriſt hath
forgotten them, and cares not that they periſh) muſt produce
a weake faith. Againe faith commeth not onely from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and the morall perſwaſion of the holy Ghoſt making
uſe of ſanctified reaſon,<note place="margin">Faith from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of grace ſometime ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then from light of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> but alſo ſometime from a meere ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
inſtinct, as where there is no diſcourſe, eſpecially when
wee firſt beleeve, and have nothing but a meere command, and
knowes not whether the promiſe and the Saviour belongeth
to us or not, even as the infant that can make no uſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
relieth and truſteth to the mother or nurſe for milke,
by meere inſtinct, having neither promiſe nor experience for
it, and the young Chickens confide in the covering of the
Hens wings, and the Lambes for food from the damme meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by naturall inſtinct: ſo when wee are new borne againe,
the firſt act of fiduciall adherence ſeemeth to bee from the new
nature and inſtinct of grace, as the child in a ſuddaine danger
without diſcourſe or promiſe that his father will helpe him,
runnes to his father, and the Conies in danger to their holes
of the rock, and ſo a weake inſtinct of grace may produce
weake acts, and by the way the promiſe may bee forgotten and
out of mind, and the aſſurance that Chriſt loved mee before
the world was, none at all, and a beleever yet may rely and
confide in Chriſt through inſtinct, and know no ground, as
through ſome ſecret ſympathy of nature one may love ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and they know not the reaſon, and proportionally may
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:113056:30"/>
truſt in another alſo, for love produceth ſome confidence, ſo
ſome are kind and their heart warmed with Chriſt; and
they doe not well know Chriſt, as the Diſciples going to
<hi>Emmaus</hi> have hearts burning with the love of God, but they
knew not it was Chriſt who was there, the third man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
with them.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Concluſ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſpeciall cauſe of all ſinnes of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</note> The chiefe cauſe, as of all ſinnes of infirmitie,
ſo of a weake and infirme faith, is not ſo much from want of
will as want of power, and rather from want of grace and a
larger meaſure of the ſpirit of faith, then from malice and
wickedneſſe. I deny not but the corruption of a wicked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath influence in ſinnes of infirmitie, and in a weake
faith, as it hath in all ſinnes (as ſome of the mothers ſeed muſt
alwayes bee in the child;) but I ſpeake comparatively, and in
regard of that which is the nature of ſinne; therefore ſinnes
of infirmitie and a weake faith, though they bee not veniall
ſinnes, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> vainely teach, yet they bee ſinnes of a lower
ſize; for there bee leſſe activeneſſe and more paſſiveneſſe in
theſe ſinnes, and ſo leſſe will and more renitency and reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
then in raigning ſinnes, and all ſinnes of infirmitie have
but the halfe of the will, ſometime nothing but a virtuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
as in the firſt motions of concupiſcence and ſome ſinfull
errors and bad opinions contrary to the truth which the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God have, and the renewed part doth proteſt on the
contrary againſt the fleſh and ſide with Chriſt; and if the will
joyne in ſinnes of infirmitie, it is but the one halfe of the will
trayling the other halfe after it, like the motion of a worme
in which the former part having more life and vigor draweth
after it the hinder part. But I come to prove the nature of a

worke may bee ſwayed by it, if the fleſh act by prevalency, it
goes wrong, but in the wicked, where there is no prevalency
of ſaving grace, nor any ſuch principle, the ſinne is not a
ſinne of infirmitie. Chriſt hath not one voyce in the court,
if reaſon ſpeake againſt ſome crying ſinnes, that is ſomething
of God the Creator, but nothing of Chriſt, it is not from a

things expreſſing the nature of infirmities, and ſo of a weake
faith in the Saints. Firſt, ere the captive bee taken in warre he
reſiſteth, and ſheddeth blood, and therefore by paction they
promiſe him quarters. Secondly, it is <hi>major vis,</hi> a greater
power that doth it, ſo it is againſt his will that hee is taken,
and onely for want of ſtrength and power to fight hee is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
ſo hee that falls of infirmitie or ſinnes of weakneſſe, if
hee had more ſtrength of grace, hee would not yeeld, and
therefore hee reſiſteth and accepteth not of quarters from the
fleſh without ſtroake of Sword, and the ſpirit doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the ill hee doth, as it is, <hi>Rom. 7. 15. For that which I
doe, I allow not, for what I would, that I doe not: but what I hate

that the <hi>Lord</hi> is working in the three kingdomes, there bee
ſundry notes of divinitie and footſteps of God, and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
doe but wonder; as 1. when <hi>Prelats</hi> and <hi>Malignants</hi>
were on the top of their wheeles, <hi>God,</hi> from deſpiſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
beginnings, raiſed the worke to a great height; 2. our
adverſaries were agents, and would not reſt, but did coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to their owne deſtruction: They would move the <hi>King</hi>
to change Religion in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt all Lawes. 2. They
would ſtirre him up to raiſe Armies by Sea and Land againſt
<hi>Scotland.</hi> 3. They moved the <hi>King</hi> to break the articles of
peace, and the word of a Prince to his Subjects, after an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
and ſet him on bloody warres againe. 4. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Army was defeated and a Parliament granted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
they moved him firſt to come and yeeld to all that is
juſt and right in a Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but againſt their
mind, with no purpoſe to keepe their faith, and then to
raiſe Tragicall and bloody warres in <hi>England,</hi> and in all
theſe they were coagents and workers with a judiciall and
ſecret providence, to their owne deſtruction. 3. They have
beene ſearching to find out, that our intentions were not to
eſtabliſh Religion in power and puritie, and to bee freed
of the bondage of arbitrary and tyrannicall domination over
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> but to change monarchy, and ſet up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
government; this they could never yet find. 4. They
ſee God againſt them, prophanitie and wickedneſſe on their
ſide, and with them <hi>Papiſts, Idolaters, Iriſh murtherers,</hi> the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elleſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113056:36"/>
of men, the ſcumme and refuſe of the Churchmen, yet
they will not ſee <hi>God</hi> in this. 5. They find and ſee their
treachery, popery, tyranny diſcovered by many plots come
to light, by letters under the Kings hand, their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to bring in a forraigne nation, ere popery and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
government bee not eſtabliſhed; and that all Treaties
have beene intended, not for a juſt peace, but for this end
that a peace being once patched and ſowed up, <hi>all things ſhall

            <p>If <hi>naturall</hi> men wonder at the power and excellency of
Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> in that hee with a word commands Sea and winds,<note place="margin">The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus a wonder to all.</note>
and they obey him; ſhould not Chriſt bee to us a worlds
wonder? ſhould hee not bee to us altogether lovely? were
it poſſible to lay in the counter-ſcale of the ballance to <hi>Chriſt</hi>
a world of Angels, put in yet millions of worlds of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
adde to them a world of <hi>Solomons</hi> with tripled wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
put in all the delights of the ſonnes of men, put
in yet the flowre and Roſe of ten thouſand poſſible
worlds perfections, they ſhould bee under-weight to him,
the ballance ſhould never downe. Oh! wee glory in good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
wee rejoyce in victories and ſucceſſe, in a good Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
in godly Commanders, in a good reformation,
all is excellent to us, that hath any luſtre or glimpſe of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
goodneſſe, but why doe wee not rather wonder, admire
and extoll excellent <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> who ſetteth him on high
above the skies? who lifts up his throne and his glory?
Conſider but what is ſaid of him, <hi>Col. 1. 15. Who is the image
of the inviſible God, the firſt borne of every creature,</hi> Verſ. 16.
<hi>For by him were all things created, &amp;c. 17. And hee is before all
things, and in him all things conſiſt. 18. And hee is the head of the
body the Church, who is the beginning, the firſt borne from the
dead, that in all things hee might have the preheminence;</hi> ſee what
wonders are there in Chriſt, as firſt, hee is Gods equall, every
way as high as God, being the ſubſtantiall Image of God,
begotten of the Father, and without all beginning. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as man the eldeſt of the creation of <hi>God,</hi> and as <hi>God</hi> the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113056:37"/>
Creator of the new world. Thirdly, no leſſe the Creator
of all then the Father; wee have a head who can make and
unmake all the glorious Angels in heaven, the royalleſt of
the houſe of heaven, theſe principalities and powers, theſe
little Gods, the eldeſt and ſupreme Courtiers, the higher
houſe of the Peeres of heaven, are but peeces of dependent
ſhadowes that fell from the fingers of our higheſt King,
when hee framed this great all, and the rich Palace-Royall
of this greateſt body of heaven and earth and all the furniture
within the boſome of the great world. Fourthly, the <hi>Lord
Jeſus</hi> hath all the created world ſo in the <hi>hollow of his hand,</hi> as
a man that holdeth a bowle of glaſſe in his hand in the aire,
ſhould hee take his arme from under it, it ſhould fall to the
earth and breake in a hundred peeces, and doe no more good,
if Chriſt in whom all things conſiſt (ſome ſay) as the notes
of an excellent muſick in a ſong, draw in his armes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
providence, the world ſhould go all out of tune, and the
Globe of Cryſtall glaſſe ſhould fall to a thouſand meere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things;
and as a man betweene his fingers may cruſh an Egge, ſo
hath Chriſt the huge created Lump of the whole creation in his
hand, if hee but thruſt his two fingers together with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
cruſh, all the world is diſſolved like a broken Egge. Fiftly,
hee is the head of the Church, and ſuch a head as is deaths el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
ſonne and heire, hee lay in deaths wombe, and as the
doubly bleſſed firſt-borne, had the key of death with him in
the inner ſide, and opened the wombe and tooke away the
ports and gates of death on his backe, that now all the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
brethren might come out at the ſame paſſage alſo; yea hee
came a bridegroome from heaven to ſuite in marriage a bride
his Church, was ſicke, and died of love for a Princes daughter
his lovely Church, &amp; roſe the third day from death, and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her. Sixtly, he hath ſo the abſolute preheminence in all things
that the higheſt of the Angels are but his vaſſals and ſervants, &amp;
is now in ſuch incomparable eminency of <hi>Glory,</hi> above all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that when the <hi>beloved-diſciple John</hi> who came that neare
to him in the <hi>dayes of his fleſh,</hi> that hee <hi>leaned on his boſome,</hi> ſaw
him in his glory, hee <hi>fell downe at his feet dead, Revel.</hi> 1. 17. yea
there was more of heaven in Chriſt then his eyes of fleſh could
behold.</p>
