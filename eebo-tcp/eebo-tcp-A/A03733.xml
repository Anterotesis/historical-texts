            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF HIS DOCTRINE.
OR
Certaine Tenents collected out of the <hi>Sermon</hi> of <hi>Samuel How</hi> a <hi>Cobler</hi> in Long Ally in Morefields, which
<hi>Sermon</hi> he Preacht in the <hi>Nags-head Taverne</hi> neare <hi>Coleman-Street</hi> in the preſence of aboue a hundred people, among which
was five <hi>Miniſters</hi> (ſome of them ſilenc't ones) This <hi>Sermon</hi> being lately Printed, and Intituled, <hi>The ſufficiency of the Spirits
teaching, without Humane Learning; For the light and information of the Ignorant.</hi> Theſe following Doctrines are
publiſht in the very ſame words he there deliverd them; upon this Text, 2 Peter 3. 16. <hi>In which they
that are unlearned, and unſtable wreſt as they do all, ſo the other Scriptures
to their owne deſtruction.</hi>

               <note place="margin">1 Doct.</note> are the learned ones that truely underſtand the <hi>Scriptures</hi> according to <hi>Peters</hi> mind, elſe
he condemn'd himſelfe, for <hi>Peter</hi> was an unlearned man, and <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> without <hi>Human learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Human learning</hi> was never ſanctified by GOD,<note place="margin">2 Doct.</note> but to ſpirituall vſes is accurſed, and is onely profitable to a <hi>States-man,</hi> a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian</hi>
or a <hi>Lawyer;</hi> for to a <hi>Divine</hi> it is as bad as fire in the Roofe of a Houſe: Therefore if two men both alike indewed with grace
from GOD, the one learned, the other unlearned, be to be preferred to the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> the unlearned is to be preferred for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Firſt, Becauſe GOD reſpects no perſons, ſecondly, it is ſuteable to the <hi>Goſpels</hi> ſimplicity: thirdly, GOD chooſeth the unlearned in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the learned, ſo muſt we; for that learning which is attained to by labour, is not fitt for <hi>Chriſts Church,</hi> but for Egypt, and Babylon it is
ſuteable.</p>
            <p>That if knowledge in Tongues,<note place="margin">3 Doct.</note> be given us from GOD without labour, then we may accept it as comming from his grace, not elſe, for we
muſt not labour for it; for <hi>Human learning,</hi> as it is noe helpe to ſtop the mouthes of gaineſayers, and oppoſers, ſo it may not be purchaſed with
money, for we read that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> offering to buy it with money, was ſharply reproved for it by <hi>Peter,</hi> as ſpringing from an evill root.</p>
            <p>That we are to be ſuſpicious that ſuch perſons are deſtitute of the <hi>Spirit</hi> that make any uſe of <hi>Human learning</hi> to underſtand the <hi>Scripture,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4 Doct.</note> for
that ſuch vſually, are veſſels of wrath prepared for deſtruction; for all which came to CHRIST having any kind of <hi>Human learning</hi> for ſooke it;
<hi>Moſes</hi> forſooke the Treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of which <hi>Human learning</hi> was the chiefe: The <hi>Epheſians</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> converted <hi>Acts</hi> the 19. wholy did abon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
it, for they burned their bookes of curious Arts: Therefore no words of Art, or of <hi>Humane learning,</hi> may be uſed in Preaching the <hi>Goſpell</hi>
for doubtleſſe <hi>Moſes, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> contemned all ſuch.</p>
            <p>That ſeeing <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> was deſtitute of <hi>Human learning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vſe. 1.</note> ſo his Servants ought to be alſo, for it is not fit for them to be above their Lord.</p>
            <p>To diſcover the great woe the World lies under,<note place="margin">Vſe. 2.</note> that are ſo blind as not to ſee that <hi>Humane learning</hi> is ſo far from being a helpe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the mind of GOD, that quite contrary inſtead of a Bleſſing it is a Curſe, inſtead of a fire profitable, it is as pernitious fire in the Roofe of
a Houſe: Therefore all Chriſtians are to beware of it, for it is that evill ſeed that cauſeth Error, and occaſioneth thoſe noiſome Luſts that
drowne men in perdition, it is the Dragons taile, and ſuteable for thoſe Locuſts that aſcend out of the Bottomleſſe Pit, whoſe ſmoke <hi>Human
learning</hi> is; <hi>Scribes, Phariſees, Papiſts, Egyptians, Babylonians,</hi> they are the men that highly eſteeme of <hi>Human learning:</hi> And thus the unlearned
Cobler his zeale having made him out-run his Laſt concluded. Let the man of GOD fly <hi>Human learning.</hi>
