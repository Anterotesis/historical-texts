            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

born, upon his People that fear and dread his holy Name, by adding Afflictions to their Bonds.</p>
            <p>Therefore as a <hi>Warning</hi> unto you, this I ſend, both high and low, who Perſecute and Oppreſs the People that the Lord hath choſen; the Lord hath <hi>beheld you,</hi> the Lord hath <hi>beheld you,</hi> the Work which you are about to do, will be too hard for you; For who ever fought againſt the Lord and proſpered? ye Briers, ye Thorns, the Lord will burn you up and utterly conſume you, his Indignation is kindled againſt you, and in his fierce Wrath he will deſtroy you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh vain men! would you limit the Lord, or his good Spirit in his People, that they ſhould not be led thereby? if ye can ſtop the Sun that it ſhall not give Light to the world, or ſtay the Moon from going its Courſe, or number the Sands on the Sea-ſhore, then may you fight againſt the Lord and his People, and proſper. Therefore hearken ye ſtrong Oakes, and give ear ye tall Cedars, to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, dreadful Sound, which is as the Sound of a <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> and as a Warning unto you all, to break off from Wickedneſs, Oppreſſion, and Cruelty, by turning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord before your day be paſt, and the Sun go down upon you.</p>
            <p>Oh! liſten ye great Ones of the Earth, and give good heed ye that are of low Degree, yea, all that put afar off the evil day, and cauſe the ſeat of Violence to come near, that lie upon Beds of Ivory, that ſtretch your ſelves upon your Couches, and eat the Lambs of the Flock, and the Calves out of the midſt of the ſtall; that chaunt to the ſound of the Vyal, and invent to your ſelves Inſtruments of Muſick like <hi>David;</hi> that drink Wine in Bowls, and annoint your ſelves with the

with you, but ye have not turned unto him, but have ruſhed into Iniquity as a Horſe into the Battle, and have erred from his pure Spirit, which hath often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved you, which would have led you in the Way of Life, and the Path of Peace; and ye have hated the reproof of Inſtruction, which is the Way of Life, and have choſe the Path that leads to the chambers of Death.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>England, England!</hi> the Sins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Iniquities of <hi>Gomorrah</hi> are found in thee, <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi>; and now you Inhabitants are ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Luſts of the Fleſh, Eating, and Drinking, and riſing up to Play, glorying in your ſhame, ſeeking to your ſelves honour, and to make all bow before you; building your Towers ſo ſtrong, as if it ſhould reach to Heaven, that ſo you might not again be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and that you might exalt your own Horn: Ah! how have you forgot the Lord that hath done great things for you, and hath raiſed you when you were very low; ſurely it was not that you ſhould diſhonour Him, neither that you ſhould have the Supremacy to rule over the Conſciences of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which alone is the Lord's right; for Him have we chooſe (whom ye Perſecute) to be our God, even the Lord, the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to Him we commit our Cauſe, for he alone is our defence; and this ye may be ſure, that we are not of thoſe that fight with Carnal Weapons, or to defend ourſelves with them, for we wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſs that rules in the Hearts of People, and with no other Weapons but thoſe that are ſpiritual: Therefore hearken all ye
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105410:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that are erred from the Lord in your Hearts, and have forgot your Maker; For <hi>all that forget God muſt be turned into Hell,</hi> (Mark) <hi>all that forget God</hi>: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is a <hi>Warning</hi> to you all, and an Invitation of Love that you return to the Lord, that he may have mercy on you, and to the living God, that he may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don you; for your Sins have reached to Heaven, and your Iniquities are come before Him.</p>
            <p>Oh! while you have yet a day return to the Lord before it be over, and time to you be no more, and your perpetual Deſtruction be ſealed, for then you may <hi>call</hi> to the <hi>Mountains,</hi> and <hi>cry</hi> to the <hi>Hills</hi> to <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you,</hi> but from them there is no Salvation, for alone in the Lord Jehovah is Everlaſting Strength, and Preſervation for ever. Therefore be awakened ye that ſleep, and ariſe from the dead, that ye may know Chriſt to be your Light, to lead you out of Darkneſs, which you are at this day found in, doing the Works thereof: Ah! the end will be bitter, Sorrow is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon you, and Pain as a Woman in travel, anguiſh and trouble of Spirit ſhall take hold of you, Fear and the Pit ſhall be your Portion, and everlaſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſhall come upon thoſe who hate the Light, which the Lord hath given to be a leader, and to be ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ends of the Earth; and all you that will not that he ſhould reign in the Hearts of People, are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Him; therefore come unto Him that ye may be broken, for if he fall on you, you will be ground to powder; for it's He that ſaves from Sin, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſeth the Fathers Wrath, and reconciles loſt man to God, who is come a Light into the World, that all men through Him might believe and be ſaved; in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105410:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whom none can believe but they that come to know him to be the <hi>Author</hi> of their <hi>Faith</hi>; for he is the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and the Finiſher,</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Laſt,</hi> which was <hi>dead</hi> and is <hi>alive,</hi> and <hi>lives for evermore.</hi> Oh! come unto him that you may know him, to blot out your Iniquities, and your Sins out of his remembrance; but if ye perſiſt and go on in Cruelty againſt the Lord and his People, then he will make a ſhort work with you: Ah! did ever a Nation Sin againſt the Lord as this Nation? or hath the like Mercies been beſtowed upon any People, as the People of this Land? and yet have not returned unto the Lord; the King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> will riſe up in Judgement againſt you, who came down from his Throne, and humbled himſelf at the Preaching of Repentance by <hi>Jonah,</hi> and the Lord did forgive him, and did divert the Judgement that it came not on his People.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Repent, Repent,</hi> this is my <hi>Cry,</hi> for <hi>Woe, Woe</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> will certainly overtake you; for the Lord hath looked for Mercy, but behold Oppreſſion, for Bowels of Pitty, but behold Hard-heartedneſs and Cruelty; you multiply your Iniquities, and Cruelty greatly abounds, and <hi>Cain's</hi> Spirit you are led by; for ye are caſting into Holes and Priſons thoſe that fear the Lord, and number them amongſt Tranſgreſſors; Oh! How is <hi>Juſtice fallen in the Streets,</hi> and <hi>Equity hath no place?</hi> and yet called a Chriſtian Nation; but this be ſure, you want a Chriſtian Spirit, your Sacrifice is as <hi>Cain's,</hi> and your Tears and Prayers as <hi>Eſau's,</hi> and the Lord hath no reſpect unto them, but will ſpread them as dung on your faces, for it's Truth the Lord requires, and alone in that is he Worſhipped.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105410:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>Therefore hear all ye that drink New-wine with a Song, ye ſhall mourn and languiſh, and the merry in heart ſhall ſigh, the mirth of the Tabret ſhall ceaſe, the noiſe of them that rejoice (and not in the Lord) ſhall end in mourning, and the Joy of the Harper ſhall be turned into Sorrow; Oh! the Land is full of bloody Cryes, the Cities are full of Violence, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and thoſe that fear the Lord, and dread his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name, are daily made a prey upon, and are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Sheep for the ſlaughter, for no other thing, but as concerning the Law of their God. Oh! for theſe things will the Lord viſit you with Plagues, as he did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yea, Plague after Plague, and perplexity of Spirit ſhall be upon you, till you let the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> go free to Worſhip the living God.</p>
            <p>And this lay upon me, to warn you while you have a day to return to the Lord, before he cut you off in his ſore diſpleaſure; and thus far have I cleared my Conſcience as concerning you, whether you hear or forbear.</p>
