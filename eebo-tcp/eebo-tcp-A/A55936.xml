            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following Narrative compriſing at large only the Evidence given againſt <hi>Mr. Thomas Thwing, and Mrs. <hi>Mary Preſſicks,</hi> (who was tryed by the ſame Jury with him) it may be expected that ſome reaſon ſhould be given why the tryals of the Lady <hi>Anne Tempeſt,</hi> (Daughter of Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoyne,)</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Charles Inglesby,</hi> who were tryed by other Juryes and acquitted, are not alſo publiſhed; and therefore to anſwer that expectation we ſhall ſay.</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That the Evidence, though differing, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially in ſome circumſtances, was in great part, eſpecially in what related to the Priſoners defence the ſame that was given in Mr. <hi>Thwings</hi> tryal; and therefore that this Narrative might not be ſwelled to too great a bulk, the Evidence is not repeated ſo often here as it was upon the ſeveral tryals.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That Engliſh Proteſtants inclining rather to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than to Juſtice, and ſo not being forward curiouſly to examine or to cenſure a tenderneſs of proceeding in caſe of blood, it may be as acceptable (as neceſſary for the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Juſtice of the Nation) to give a particular accompt of the tryal of Mr. <hi>Thwing,</hi> who was executed.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Papiſts do endeavour to diſparage the Evidence of this moſt Helliſh Plot by boaſting that the Witneſſes are ſuch as have revolted from their Church, we ſhall take this occaſion of relating the Evidence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

of the Plot in general, upon the tryal of the Lady <hi>Tempeſt</hi> by one Captain <hi>Baines,</hi> who then owned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Roman Catholick, and declared that he intended to live and die ſo, but that he came in as a witneſs out of an abhorrence of the Plot. This Gentleman teſtified that the Lady <hi>Tempeſt</hi> diſcourſing with him at Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoyne's</hi> Houſe, in <hi>1677,</hi> about his purpoſe of going to the <hi>Indies,</hi> diſſwaded him from it, by telling him that he might have a Commiſſion, and work enough in <hi>England</hi> ſhortly; that the Papiſts had reſolved the Deſtruction of the King, and that they declared him an Heretick, and that the Pope had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated him, and therefore he was to be cut off.</p>

               <p>Look you Gentlemen, theſe two Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſtand Indicted of High Treaſon, and it is for conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Death of the King, and other heinous Crimes; As Deſigning the Subverting the Government, and bringing in the Popiſh Religion.</p>
               <p>Now the Witneſſes that have been produced againſt <hi>Thwing,</hi> are <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray;</hi> and againſt <hi>Preſsicks,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bolron,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Bolron</hi> ſenior and junior, and one <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> and the Evidence againſt <hi>Thwing,</hi> is one thing, and againſt the Woman quite another; there is no Evidence againſt her but what they heard her ſay others were to do, there is no Evidence of any action of hers, or that ſhe was preſent at any Conſultation, nor acting any thing there, but that ſhe ſaid <hi>ſo</hi> and <hi>ſo.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> and his Grandmother do both ſay that ſhe ſaid, <hi>Pickering</hi> was to have killed the King, and that ſhe was ſorry that he did not do it. That the Gun with which he ſhould have done it, was found, and ſhe was afraid that was the cauſe of his Death, and they all ſay ſhe ſaid, that it would be never well with <hi>England,</hi> till the Catholicks had got the upper hand, and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> were King. Now I muſt tell you, that my opinion is, that a bare ſaying of this doth not amount to High Treaſon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you do beleive from theſe words, that ſhe knew other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by hearſay, that <hi>Pickering</hi> was to have killed the King, and that ſhe was Privy and Conſenting to the deſign of Killing the King, then ſhe is guilty of Treaſon, but if ſhe only knew it by hearſay, the bare knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing of it will make her guilty of Miſpriſion of Treaſon; but knowing of it barely by Report doth not make her guilty of High Treaſon. My Brother will tell you his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion herein. Now for Mr. <hi>Thwing,</hi> the Evidence againſt him is very home; for they both Swear againſt himone to one
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41078:14"/>
Meeting, and the other to another, that he was preſent at their Conſulttaion to <hi>Kill</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> Subvert the Government, and to bring in the Popiſh Religion; that he did agree at the meeting to the <hi>Killing</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> they do both Swear, and this they ſay was at Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoynes,</hi> and that at the ſeveral meetings there was a Liſt produced, but <hi>Bolron</hi> ſaith, that the Liſt when he was preſent was a Liſt of thoſe that were engaged towards the carrying on of the Nunnery; that which the other ſpeaks of, was a Liſt of thoſe that were engaged about the <hi>killing</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> about the whole deſign which was to be effected by <hi>killing</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> this he Swears, that <hi>Thwing</hi> did produce this Liſt; and <hi>Mowbray</hi> ſaith, that three or four Prieſts were preſent at that time, and that <hi>Thwing</hi> ſaid, the <hi>King</hi> was an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Pope, and it was not only <hi>lawful</hi> but <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious</hi> to kill <hi>Him.</hi> So that admitting this Evidence be true, it is a full Evidence of High Treaſon againſt him; here is an imagining the Death of the King, and here is an overt Act, here is a ſetting hands to it; ſo that if this be true, <hi>Thwing</hi> is guilty of High Treaſon. Now againſt this, they have produced many Witneſſes, and none of them doth go about to prove this impoſſible but only improbable, but one that is a Groom of Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoyne</hi>'s, who ſaith, he was but once or twice that year there, and not at <hi>Eaſter</hi> but about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> is that enough to anſwer the Teſtimony of theſe two Men, Gentlemen, for a Groom to take upon him, to ſay two years after who was at his Maſters Houſe, and how often, and what time of the year, is to me a very ſtrange thing; unleſs it were one that was never uſed to to come there: But this man, he ſaith, did uſe to come there, but that I muſt leave to you. The Reſt of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were the ſame that were Examined yeſterday. Firſt They inſiſt concerning Mr. <hi>Lowther,</hi> they ſay, that when Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> firſt went to Mr. <hi>Lowther,</hi> he ſaid nothing of Mr. <hi>Thwing,</hi> but it appears, he ſaid then, that afterwards he might remember more, then the man was under a great Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and told him, the great and dangerous conſequences of having ſo long concealed it, was the occaſion of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41078:15"/>
upon him, but he ſaid, he ſhould remember more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and ſo he did; the reſt of the Witneſſes do all go this purpoſe, that either <hi>Bolron</hi> or <hi>Mowbray</hi> ſhould tell them at one time or other, they did know nothing of the Plot, nor againſt Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoyne;</hi> and ſome of them ſay, that it is out of Malice to Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Family, for ſo <hi>Thwing</hi> would have it, he being his Nephew; that the Malice ſhould reach to Mr. <hi>Thwing;</hi> that they would have it, and ſomething to the ſame purpoſe they do offer againſt Mr. <hi>Mowbray.</hi> Now here is one <hi>Walker,</hi> that ſwears, that <hi>Bolron</hi> ask't her if ſhe knew <hi>Thwing</hi> to be a Prieſt, and offered her 10 l. to ſwear him a Prieſt, ſhe is a Servant of one Mrs. <hi>Laſſel</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Thwing</hi>'s Siſter, he came to Mrs. <hi>Laſſel's</hi> to ſearch for Preiſts. It is ſomething ſtrange, that he ſhould offer to perſwade her to Swear againſt <hi>Thwing,</hi> who was Servant to his own Siſter, and at the time when he came to ſearch for Prieſts, the Truth of it is, the thing doth depend purely upon the Credit of Witneſſes. The Kings Witneſſes are upon their Oathes, but on the other hand the others are not on their Oaths, but Credit is to be given to what they ſay; if you conſider their Evidence and do find a clearneſs in their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which you muſt weigh, for certainly he that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly in the preſence of God will ſay a falſe thing, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo dare to Swear it, how far their Principles will carry them I know not, I can ſee nothing but <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray</hi> are good Witneſſes, I do not ſee but what they ſay, is coherent, and that they ſpeak the Truth: And if you beleive what they ſay to be true, then <hi>Thwing</hi> is guilty of High Treaſon, but if do not beleive, what they ſay is true, but out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice you muſt acquit him. They do object the other Juries did not beleive <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray,</hi> the caſe with the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at the Bar is not the ſame with theirs, but you are to give your Verdict according to the Evidence that you have heard, and according to your Conſciences.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I ſhall be very ſhort; The Crimes that are laid in this Indictment, and charged upon theſe perſons, are the deſigning to take away the Kings Life, Subverting the Government, and Introduing Popery; you obſerve the nature of the Evidence which hath been given againſt the Priſoners. And firſt, I ſhall ſpeak but one word concerning <hi>Mary Preſſicks;</hi> I do fully agree with what my Brother hath ſaid; you do take notice, that the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that hath been given againſt her, hath been what came out of her own mouth; the Witneſſes are Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> and his <hi>Grandmother,</hi> and likewiſe one <hi>Hutchinſon:</hi> Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> ſaith, ſhe did tell him that <hi>Harcourt</hi> was her Confeſſor, and that he had engaged her in the Plot; ſhe likewiſe told him that <hi>Pickering</hi> was to kill the King, that the Gun was found with him, and was the cauſe of his death; this is ſome Evidence of High-Treaſon, I muſt leave it to you of what weight it is, and how far by this you will conclude her privy to the Plot: It is true, were ſhe an Actor in it, it is plain, ſhe is guilty of High-Treaſon. As to what <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> ſaid, that ſhe told him, we ſhould never be at peace, till we were all of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion, and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was made King, that will not amount to High-Treaſon: This I take to be the ſum of the Evidence againſt her. Then as to Mr. <hi>Thwing,</hi> there are two Witneſſes that have ſworn againſt him, that is Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mowbray: Bolron</hi> tells you, that in <hi>1677,</hi> there came to him ſeveral Prieſts, to his Houſe at <hi>Shipton;</hi> and amongſt the reſt <hi>Thwing</hi> the Priſoner, who askt him how he ſtood affected to the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion, and he then expreſt his zeal for it, and they thought him a perſon fit to impart their ſecrets to; then he ſaith, that in <hi>1677</hi> there was a Meeting at <hi>Barnbow-Hall,</hi> which is Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoyne</hi>'s Houſe, and at that Meeting there were Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoyne,</hi> Eſquire <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyne,</hi> Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> and amongſt the reſt this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner <hi>Thwing;</hi> and that there was a Conſult held at that time, and Deſign of killing the King, and that this perſon did agree to it, and declared, that if they ſhould miſs that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41078:16"/>
opportunity, they ſhould never have ſuch another; and that it was for the good of the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion. The next was <hi>Mowbray,</hi> and he ſaith to the ſame effect that in <hi>1676. Thwing</hi> and others declared they did deſign to kill the King, for he was an Heretick, and Excommunicated, and had not kept his word with the Jeſuits, and therefore they thought it not only Lawful, but a Meritorious Act: And this is what both <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray</hi> do reſtifie; this they ſwear poſitively againſt the Priſoner; if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they have Sworn to be true, I muſt declare that it will amount to High Treaſon. You are likewiſe to conſider the Evidence he hath produced for himſelf; the Law, 'tis true, doth not allow us to give them an Oath; yet if they be Perſons of credit and honeſty, it is Evidence which you are to conſider of. The Priſoner hath called ſeveral Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: The firſt was <hi>Nath. Wilſon,</hi> I ſhall not repeat what he ſaith, being of no import. <hi>Thwing</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> was before Mr. <hi>Lowther</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tindall,</hi> two Juſtices of Peace, who did take his Oath, and then he ſaid, he did not Accuſe him of the Plot at that time; and by that would infer, that he would have ſaid what he had againſt him, as well then as now, if he had had any thing whereof to Accuſe him: But <hi>Bolron</hi> anſwers, He did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to theſe two Gentlemen, he was not able at that time to Recollect his whole Knowledge, but gave it in afterwards to the King and Council: The next are <hi>Moore</hi> and <hi>Thorpe,</hi> the effect of their Evidence is to ſtrike at the Reputation of <hi>Bolron,</hi> that it was an Act of Malice and Revenge; for they ſay, that <hi>Bolron</hi> told them, that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was innocent, and knew nothing of the Plot. <hi>Thorpe</hi> ſaith, he met with <hi>Bolron</hi> in <hi>Long-Acre,</hi> and that he told him, that though Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> were quitted, he would ruine ſome of them: I ſay, theſe things, if true, are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome Evidence of a Malicious Proſecution; but it ſeems ſomething improbable that <hi>Bolron</hi> ſhould ſo openly make a diſcovery of himſelf, when it appears he was not greatly acquainted with them, eſpecially with <hi>Thorpe.</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41078:16"/>
There are ſeveral other Witneſſes that ſpeak much to the ſame purpoſe. Gentlemen, In matters of Fact, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Teſtimony of Witneſſes, the Credit of the Witneſſes is greatly to be conſidered; if you believe what <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray</hi> have both poſitively Sworn, the Treaſon is plain; you muſt take all the parts of your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence together, you muſt weigh all the Circumſtances; you muſt, as I ſaid before, conſider the Credit of the Witneſſes of the one ſide and of the other, and by theſe ſteps you will be the better guided in the giving of your Verdict. I muſt leave it to you: and I pray God direct you therein.</p>

You have been Indicted for High-Treaſon, the higheſt Treaſon that ever any Subject was guilty of, for attempting to Kill the King, for reſolving ſo to do upon deliberate advice and conſultation, and this for no other end or purpoſe, but that you might have your Religion ſet up; for that was your Deſign, to change this Religion here, and to ſettle Popery in <hi>England;</hi> and the better to bring that to paſs, you thought to take away the Kings life, knowing you could not otherwiſe accompliſh it. You are I am ſatisfied a Prieſt of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that I can ſay to you in reference to your future ſtate you will not value, for you account me an Heretick as you do the King, and I am content to be ſo eſteemed in ſo good Company, therefore I ſhall wave it.
