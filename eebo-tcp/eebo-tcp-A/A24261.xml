            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account from <hi>PARIS</hi> of the ARTICLES Of <hi>PEACE</hi> concluded betwixt the Two Crownes of FRANCE And SPAINE.</head>
            <p>THE Articles of the Peace ſigned by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ever ſince the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Currt</hi> in Spaniſh, were received by an Expreſs; and at the ſame time that they were received in <hi>France,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> received them Signed by the King in French.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall gave them to the Marquis <hi>Pimentel</hi> to explain them, and he gave him them again the ninteenth. They are Signed by the two Kings, and two Miniſters of State.</p>
            <p>The Articles are, That we reſtore to the King of <hi>Spain Mortara, Valentia,</hi> and all that was taken from him in <hi>Italy, Roſas</hi> in <hi>Catalonia, Graveling, La Baſſee, Montmedy,</hi> and <hi>Thionville. Arras</hi> remains in our hands, and they give us <hi>Cambray,</hi> the County of <hi>Artois, Perpignan,</hi> and the County of <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> as a Dowry to the <hi>Infanta</hi> in Marriage to our King.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> is to go into <hi>Spain</hi> to fetch the <hi>Infanta</hi>; and the Interview of both the Kings and both the Queens is to be at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> where the King intends to go very ſhortly, with all his Court.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall hath diſpatched away two Poſts, one to his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and the other to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to give notice of what is paſt.</p>
            <p>The Peace is to be publiſhed, as is believed, the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> between both the Armies.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> hath ſent a Blanck to the King, to fill as he ſhall pleaſe, demanding nothing of him but his favour: he is to remain three years without returning to the Court, during which time he may ſtay at <hi>Rocroy, Catelet,</hi> or at <hi>Anjou.</hi> In the mean time, he ſhall enjoy his Revenue according to appointment.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> his ſon returns to <hi>Paris,</hi> to continue his Exerciſes, Lodgings are preparing for him at the houſe of Monſieur <hi>de Menoult.</hi> It is reported, that he hath ſent to Complement <hi>Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle Hortance,</hi> Niece to the Cardinall. The King gives him the Survivancy and Revenue of his father's Offices.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh are comprized in the Peace. The Spaniard conſents, that we ſhould redeem or regain <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which probably may be done, in conſideration of a Million of Mony to defray their charges.</p>
            <p>The Marquis of <hi>Piementel</hi> is within few daies to take upon him the quality of Ambaſſadour.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> is alſo ſet at liberty, and his Country is to be reſtored wholly to him, excepting <hi>Nancy,</hi> which we are to keep yet ſix years.</p>
            <p>The Letters from <hi>Bayonne</hi> of the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Currt</hi> do certifie the arrivall of the Plate-Fleet at St. <hi>Andre</hi> in <hi>Gallicia,</hi> being in number fifty Gallions.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday departed hence an Expreſs to the Emperour, to communicate theſe Articles to him from the King.</p>
