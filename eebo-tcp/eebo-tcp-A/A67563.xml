            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>2 KINGS VI. and last Verse.</bibl>
               <q>And he said, This evil is of the Lord, Wherefore should I wait upon the Lord any longer?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE cause of this Solemn (and
most Honourable) Assembly at
this time, is to humble our selves
in consideration of a most grievous
and horrible Calamity, which was
some years since (as upon this day)
brought upon these Kingdoms, by the Sacrilegious
and Bloody Martyrdom of our late most Excellent
Sovereign; to afflict our souls in Contemplation of
our sins; which brought upon us that heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
with humble, penitent, broken and contrite
Hearts to wait upon the Lord, to implore his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in removing from us the guilt of that innocent
blood, in pardoning our Offences, and taking away
his Plagues and Judgments from us.</p>
            <p>To work our selves to such a frame or temper of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48701:4"/>
spirit,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> there are two ways or methods; either by
shewing the Necessity and Utility, the Beauty and
the Comeliness of such a temper, and the Happiness
which will follow thereupon (by convincing us how
much it is our Duty, and our Interest, and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
or else by having before our eyes (the indecency
and absurdity,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> the folly and madness, wickedness
and misery) how much it is against our Duty and
against our Interest to be found in a contrary temper
and disposition.</p>
            <p>Of these two Methods we find that <hi>Solomon</hi> (in
his Book of the Preacher) made choice of the later;
That to bring men to fear God, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
he thought it best to convince the
world of the vanity of all other courses: That gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his mind to understand the reason of things, he
applied himself to know the folly of wickedness, and
the wickedness of folly and madness: And to bring
men to wisdom and virtue, he thought it the best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to represent to them the absurdity and ugli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of folly and wickedness.</p>
            <p>Something like to this I have proposed to my self
at this time, and to that end I have chosen to submit
to your consideration this strange and extravagant
instance in the Text.</p>
            <p>Where (that I may the sooner arrive at what I
aim at) I shall not spend time in disputing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the words; but with the best Interpreters
(as I conceive) suppose them to have been the words
of <hi>Joram</hi> King of <hi>Israel;</hi> and (in some measure) to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48701:4"/>
collect and raise a true idea or character of him, I
must draw you a little back into the Story.</p>
            <p>Our Author I say was <hi>Joram;</hi> he was the Son of
<hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and King of the ten Tribes of
<hi>Israel:</hi> his capital City was <hi>Samaria:</hi> his adjacent
neighbour on the North was <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi>
who now made War against him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joram</hi> not able to keep the Field, was driven up
into <hi>Samaria,</hi> and there was obstinately besieged.</p>
            <p>The City was a fenced (or fortified) City, and
<hi>Benhadad</hi> would not storm it, but resolved to take
it by Famine.</p>
            <p>And the Famine here prevailed to a degree
almost incredible: the prices of commodities so
great, the diet, to which they were reduced, so vile
(an Asses head was sold for 80 pieces of silver, a
cab of Pigeons dung for 5.)</p>
            <p>So vile! nay, so exceedingly monstrous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Can a woman</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiab) forget her
child?</hi> Here two women conspire together, and
against the laws of God and nature, enter into an
engagement (to act that which you will abhor to
hear) to devour their tender little ones, and resume
into their bodies that fruit whereof they had lately
been delivered.</p>
            <p>And because one of them repents of her engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the other makes her appeal to <hi>Joram:</hi> she
spies him walking the rounds to view the Works,
and out of a complicated passion of hunger and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48701:5"/>
sorrow, envy and indignation, in the agony
and bitterness of her soul, she cries out, <hi>Help O
King!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now begin to take a character of this <hi>Joram.</hi>
He supposed she had cried for Victuals, and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
falls upon cursing the woman, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
So <hi>Josephus.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. So the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint.
Let not God help thee, how should I help thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well! this was indeed part of the womans grief,
but this was not all, she had killed her child; and
her companion (according to agreement) had eaten
part of him, and now had withdrawn her own:
her spleen would now be satisfied as well as her sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;
she therefore states her case, and cries for
Justice.</p>
            <p>Indeed the case was lamentable, enough to move
the heart of any man, and it put <hi>Joram</hi>'s into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but it was not into compassion, but fury.</p>
            <p>It had been reason that he should have rent his
Heart and not his Garments; but he rends his cloaths,
and falls into cursing and raving, and into a wild
extravagant resolution, <hi>God do so to me, and more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
if the head of</hi> Elisha <hi>the Son of</hi> Shaphat <hi>shall stand
on him this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the coherence? or where is the Logick of
this cursing and damning resolution? How was
<hi>Elisha</hi> concerned in what had happened?</p>
            <p>Before, he cursed the woman, now he curses
himself with a grievous curse; <hi>God do so to me</hi> [that
is, take away my life:] <hi>and more also</hi> [that is, in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48701:5"/>
the language of our times, God damn me] <hi>if the
head of Elisha</hi>—</p>
            <p>But why must <hi>Elisha</hi> suffer? what had he done?
had he devoured the child that was dead, or hid the
living child; or brougt the Famine upon <hi>Samaria?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if rage did submit to reason! or from the wrath
of man, we were to expect the righteousness of God!
that he should swear and curse there was no reason,
nevertheless, for his Oaths sake, he sends his Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to <hi>Elisha</hi>'s house, and presently follows to see the
Execution.</p>
            <p>Where (to make up the <hi>hiatus,</hi> betwixt his coming
and uttering the words of the text) we may conceive
that <hi>Joram</hi> has there blustered out the Story of
the woman; That he hath raved at <hi>Elisha,</hi> and
blasphemed against the Lord himself; and that in
reply, the Prophet and endeavoured to allay the
passion, and calm the storm of rage, that was upon
him: That he had put him in mind of looking up
to God the sender of all Publique Calamities; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
him to humble himself under his mighty
hand, to wait upon him for deliverance, to pray to
him for succour, and the like.</p>
            <p>To all which he ungratiously rejoyns, according
to the tenor of the text.</p>
            <p>You tell me of the Lord, Who is the Lord that I
should concern my self about him? You talk of
God, and think to draw me into a vain and pucil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimous
devotion, and so to drill me into a frivolous
hope and expectation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48701:6"/>
You talk of Waiting, have I not waited all this
while?</p>
            <p>You speak of Praying, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? to what end
should I pray?</p>
            <p>I have spoken, and he will not hear; I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and he will not answer; I have clothed my self
with Sackcloth (Lo! here it is upon my loins!) and
he laughs at it.</p>
            <p>The more I court him, the more he slights me.</p>
            <p>The evils that are upon us are of his own sending,
'Tis evidently his hand that is upon us, and he that
hath cast us into all our misery, Wherefore I'le Seek
to him no more, I'le Pray no more, I'le Wait no
longer.</p>
            <q>
               <p>This evil is from the Lord, Wherefore
should I wait upon the Lord any longer?</p>
            </q>

            <p>My business will be, First to evince the Truth of
the Observations; Then to shew the Absurdity of
<hi>Joram</hi>'s inference; And so to descend to Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>1. The first Observation is this, <hi>That Publique
Judgments and Calamities proceed from the hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is to say, They do not arise out of the Dust
(as <hi>Job</hi> speaks);<note place="margin">Chap. 5. 6.</note> They are not scattered into the
world by the uncertain distribution of blind and
improvident Contingency, nor thrust upon it by
an ungoverned overbearing force of a Brute Fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
They proceed not from a casual coincidence of
various senseless Atoms.</p>
            <p>Nor from the overpowring influence or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of the Planets or the Stars. Nor from the
malignant ardours of ill-boding and portending
Comets (all which are the foolish imaginations of
Atheistical or Superstitious persons) But they are
sent out of the Armory and Magazine of him, Who
hath made all things by his Word, susteins them by
his Power, and rules them by his Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48701:7"/>
I may not upon this occasion be permitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon a Philosophical or Theological discourse,
concerning the Providential Administration of the
world, or the Properties or Attributes of God,
from whence it ariseth, upon which it is founded;
or the manner of his concurrency with secondary
Causes (how that insinuates its influence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
its operation, so as the Contingency of Events,
and Liberty of Agents, may be maintained).</p>
            <p>I shall here content my self only to suggest thus
much to your Notice and Observation; That As
the Providential Administration of the world pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
immediately from the Efficacy of the Divine
Wisdom, Power, and Presence, So there is not any
thing in nature wherein every one of these may not
by a considering Person be discerned.</p>
            <q>(Praesentemque refert quaelibet herba Deum)</q>
            <p>And as the smallest Rivolet, attentively and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
followed, will direct and lead one to the Sea;
so the most fortuitous event, being traced through
the chain and series of it's Causes, will bring the
mind at last to the original Fountain and Ocean of
all causality, and force an acknowledgment of a
wise, voluntary, providential administration of the
world.</p>
            <p>And as for this part of Providence in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of Publick Plagues and National Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it is so obvious to common reason, that it hath
forced an acknowledgment not only from men of
Philosophical and deep consideration (whether of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48701:7"/>
the <hi>Graecanic</hi> or <hi>Barbaric</hi> Families) But from Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Rhetoricians, and Poets, persons not obliged
by their profession to so severe an enquiry, or so
deep a penetration into the works of nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Homer</hi> refers the Calamities of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War to

(<hi>i. e.</hi> the Assertors of fortuitous or fatal Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself appeals to the testimony (of

of <hi>Aratus,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But why should I detein you in the out-skirts of
humane reason or testimony! seeing we have a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
word of Prophesie, which plainly assures us
(both in general and in particular; by way of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
and Prediction; in reference to Nations,
Plagues and Persons) that Vengeance is the Lord's;
and the Distribution of Plagues and Judgments is
within his own peculiar Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>That it was he that let loose the Cataracts of
Heaven upon the old World, and sent down the
fire and brimston upon the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha.</hi>
That the plagues of Wars, of Pestilence,
Famine, Wild beasts, &amp;c. are all of them his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers;
and he sends them where he sees cause.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48701:8"/>That there can be no evil in a City or a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which the Lord hath not done. That he it was
that prepared and ordered, and marshalled out the
Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Burdens of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
and <hi>Dumah,</hi> and all the other Nations mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Prophets. That he gave <hi>Jacob</hi> to the spoil,
and <hi>Israel</hi> to the robber.</p>
            <p>And (to come yet nearer to the Case of <hi>Joram</hi>
in the Text) to shew that he was the dispencer of
these things, he punctually foretold the fate of his
Father <hi>Ahab,</hi> and concerning <hi>Jezebel</hi> his Mother,
<q>That Dogs should eat her by the Wall of <hi>Jezreel;</hi>
               </q>
And he may seem long before to have pointed at
this very particular instance of the Judgment in the
Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou for sake the Lord thy God—thine Enemy shall
besiege thee in all thy Gates—and thou shalt eat the
fruit of thy body,<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 52, 53.</note> the Flesh of thy Sons and of thy Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in the Siege; because of the straitness wherewith
thine Enemies shall distress thee:</hi> So that I shall say no
more in proof of the first Observation, arifing from
the Concession of <hi>Joram</hi> absolutely considered; <hi>He
said, This evil is from the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I come now to the second Observation, drawn
from the consideration of this Concession in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to <hi>Joram,</hi> from whom it did proceed, <hi>viz.
<q>The most wicked and most distemper'd sinners are
forced sometimes to acknowledg the hand of God in the
dispensations of his Judgments.</q>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the design and purpose of our present meeting,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48701:8"/>
nothing in the world can be of greater consequence
than to be thorowly convinced of the truth of the
former Observation. And to this end nothing can be
superadded of greater moment, than the manifesting
the truth of this which we are now upon.</p>
            <p>Surely great is the power and irresistable the force
of such a truth, as can assert it self in the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed
minds of men, and break through the
strongest defences and Barricado's raised against it:
That can gain an admittance and extort a Recogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from those whose understandings are most indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to receive it, and whose inclinations and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
most averse, and whose endeavours are most
engaged against it.</p>
            <p>And this is the pretence of the present Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in reference to wicked and ungodly persons:</p>
            <p>Though they are unacquainted with any religious
consideration, and the wayes of God and of his
Providence very rarely come in all their thoughts:</p>
            <p>Though they give themselves up to vain Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
so that their foolish heart is darkned:
Though they endeavour to put out the light within
them, and love the darkness rather than the light:</p>
            <p>Though they say unto God depart from us, for we
desire not the knowledg of thy ways:</p>
            <p>Though they do their utmost endeavour to arm
and fortifie themselves against all impression, to sear
and cauterize their consciences, to hearden their
hearts as an Anvile, and their faces as the nether
Milstone:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48701:9"/>
In plainer terms, though they devote themselves
to prophaneness and debauchery, enter themselves
in the Academy of Atheism and Irreligion, become
very hard Students in the Schools of Rioting and
Drunkenness, of Chambering and Wantonness, of
Hectoring and Ranting: Frequent the Brothels and
the Stage.</p>
            <p>Yet all this will not serve their turns; when the
hand of God is lifted up, though they will not see,
yet they shall see and be afraid:</p>
            <p>And to this recognition they shall be constreined,
by one or both of these two ways especially; either
<list>
                  <item>1. By some special signiture upon the Object.</item>
                  <item>2. By some special and extraordinary excitation of
the Subject.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. In the dispensation of God's extraordinary
works of Providence, (whether in the way of
Mercy or of Judgment) he takes an especial care,
that neither his hand may be undiscerned, nor the
Acts of his Providence unregarded. And to this end
he orders them, and sends them forth dressed and
trimm'd with circumstances, eminently conspicuous
and characteristical.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elihu</hi> tells us (in the Book of <hi>Job</hi>)<note place="margin">Job. 37. 7.</note> 
               <q>That God
sets his hand, and stamps his Seal upon his Works,
that all men may see, and every man may know
that they are his Works.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Isa. 41. 20.</note> 
               <q>That God doth his
Works in such a manner, that they may see, and
know, and consider, and understand, that the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48701:9"/>
hand of the Lord hath done them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the Works of Mercy <hi>David</hi> prays,
That God would shew some token upon him for
good, that men might see it, and that they may
know, that this is his hand, and that the Lord hath
done it.</p>
            <p>And concerning God's Judgments, he declares,
that he (plainly and sensibly) discovered in them the
hand of the Almighty. <hi>Thine arrows</hi> (saith he) <hi>stick
fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore, there is no
health in my flesh, because of thy displeasure, nor any
rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But secondly, this often happens by some
great and extraordinary awakening and excitation of
the subject; of which kind, though the particular
instances are various (as the motion of the wind
that bloweth where it listeth) yet they may be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
reduced either to

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. Though the Principles of Synteresis, the seeds
of Piety and Virtue scattered and disseminated in the
Soul (to bring forth the fruit of Vertue and Felicity)
may be trampled on and kept under, crop'd and
snib'd by the bestial part, yet they will sometimes
be starting out, sprouting and putting forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>Scintillae virtutum,</hi> the (sparks intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48701:10"/>
to enlighten and enflame the Soul to goodness)
may be smothered, and oppressed, and raked up in
ashes, yet sometimes they will make an Eruption,
and put all things into a conflagration and combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:</p>
            <p>These Principles are congenit and connatural to
the Soul: They are not to be erased or extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but their duration must and will be coextended
with the subject of them.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us,<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>chap</hi> 1 &amp; 2.</note> that even the Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and even of them the worst and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
and debauched (such as are filled with all
unrighteousness, and given up to vile affections, and
all manner of uncleanness, have still the work of the
Law (of Nature) written in their hearts; that they
know the righteous judgment of God, and that
they which do such things are worthy of death, That
the wrath of God is revealed in them; And they
have Consciences accusing or excusing, naturally
and certainly tormenting them by particular Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
upon occasion.</p>
            <p>2. But secondly, Wicked men are convinced of
the hand of God, in the dispensation of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by the means of Providential Excitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Now these are numberless in particulars, and of
many kinds. I shall only instance in a very few.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <p>1. Sometimes they are put into an expectation
of Judgments, and thereby prepared and disposed to
discover and to apprehend the signature and impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48701:10"/>
of an Avenging Nemesis, by the eminent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocity
of their actions.</p>
                  <p>This was the case of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Lamech,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
committed Murther were perpetually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with ominous bodings and fearful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Every man that sees me will slay me, cries
one: If <hi>Cain</hi> shall be avenged seven fold, surely
<hi>Lamech</hi> seventy times seven, cries the other.</p>
                  <p>This was the Case of <hi>Alexander</hi> and of <hi>Nero,</hi>
when they were haunted and tormented by the
Ghosts of <hi>Parmeno</hi> and <hi>Agrippina</hi> (and is generally
the Case of secret Murderers.)</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p>2. The secure and dormant Conscience is awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
by Acts of Providence, not in their nature
extraordinary, but in the circumstances very suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and proportioned to some former sin.</p>
                  <p>When the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> were brought into trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and great perplexity (into anxiety and anguish
of Soul) they presently made this Application,<note place="margin">Gen. 42. 21.</note>

               <item>3. Sometimes by some extraordinary Signs and
Indications. When <hi>Belshazzar</hi> saw the singers writing
upon the Wall, the joynts of his loyns were loosed,
and his knees smote one against another.</item>
               <item>4. Oft-times a powerful and seasonable Charge
or Admonition from a poor despised Minister, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
and sent upon that Errand, hath shaken the
stoutest heart, and brought down the confidence of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48701:11"/>
the proudest sinner, and forced him to tremble at
the apprehension of a present or impendent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Of all the Sinners mentioned in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Sacred History gives preeminence to <hi>Ahab:</hi>
It always mentions him with a note of Eminence
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. This is that King <hi>Ahab!</hi> He sold himself
to work wickedness, he exalted himself against God
and man, and went on triumphantly in a course of
sinning: He killed, also took possession: yet when
<hi>Elijah</hi>
               <note place="margin">I Kings 1. 8.</note> (a poor overgrown neglected hairy man, girt
with a girdle of leather about his loins) charges him
that it was he that troubled <hi>Israel,</hi> and denounces the
Judgments which should befall him; <hi>He rent his
cloaths, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, he fasted and
lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all the wicked persons mentioned in the New
Testament, there is none who (by the History of
<hi>Josephus,</hi> and by <hi>Tacitus</hi> and other Roman Authors)
is represented to have been more impudent and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
more outragiously debaucht then <hi>Felix</hi> the
Roman Governour of <hi>Judea</hi> under <hi>Claudius</hi> and
<hi>Nero:</hi> yet when <hi>Paul</hi> (his Prisoner a little wearish
aged man, whose bodily presence was weak, and
his speech contemptible) reasoned, before him
concerning righteousness and temperance, and the
Judgment to come, <hi>Felix trembled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the conviction of <hi>Joram</hi> did proceed from
one or more, or all, or any of these causes, it is not
needful to enquire: Thus much appears in fact, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48701:11"/>
though he was extracted from <hi>that</hi> King <hi>Ahab,</hi>
and from <hi>that</hi> Queen <hi>Jezabel;</hi> though his life and
manners were answerable to his extraction and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
though he was under a complicated distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of mind, a paroxysm of madness, yet in the
midst of all his indisposedness he is forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the hand of God in that Calamity, which
was upon him. He! even <hi>Joram!</hi> said, <hi>This evil is
from the Lord. Even wicked and distempered men are
forced sometimes to acknowledge the hand of God in the
dispensations of his judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto I have endeavoured to represent and
prove before you the truth and evidence of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
or supposition (the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) laid down by
<hi>Joram,</hi> and how agreeable that is to Reason, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and Experience.</p>
            <p>And now what consequence would any one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from such an antecedent? If the words had
been barely (without proof or enlargement) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the Prophet, had it not been reasonable for
him to assent to the truth of them, and natural for him
to have fallen upon this conclusion: <hi>This evil is from
the Lord; therefore upon him will I wait; to him will I
address my self for our deliverance;</hi> and forthwith to
have put himself upon all necessary and congruous
ways of application? But being delivered by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as an extorted acknowledgment of his awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd
conscience: Who would not expect, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
before his conviction he went on resolutely in
his course?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48701:12"/>
Yet being now rowsed and awakened, he should
proceed according to his Conviction, That the same
causes which had forced him to see and acknowledge
the hand of God in the Judgment, should have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with him to apply himself to him for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of it.</p>
            <p>Who would not expect that the words should run
thus? <hi>This evil is from the Lord,</hi> wherefore upon
him will I wait for succour, and not give over until
he have mercy on us.</p>
            <p>But behold! <hi>he said, This evil is from the Lord;
wherefore should I wait on the Lord any longer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the absurdity of this Inference is that
which remains to be laid open before you.<note place="margin">II.</note>.</p>
            <p>I call it an Inference because in effect this delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
question carries the force of a strong negation,
<hi>Wherefore should I wait?</hi> i. e. I am resolved I will wait
no longer.</p>
            <p>To take the full meaning of that word; which is
here rendred by waiting, I must entreat you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,

It seems the Prophet, finding him in a distemper,
had exhorted him to give over huffing and ranting,
cursing and swearing; and to betake himself to fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and mourning, to prayers and earnest Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

            <p>To leave off his frowardness and impatience,
and with patience and due submission, to tarry the

               <hi>Mah Ochil

my self to weeping and mourning? Why should I
submit and humble my self under the hand of God?
to what purpose should I expect, and wait upon him
any longer for deliverance: (intimating a perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
resolution to the contrary.)</p>
            <p>You see now the Question betwixt <hi>Joram</hi> and the
Prophet, and I am to make your selves the Judges,
which of them had reason on his side: In order
whereunto it is necessary that I premise three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In every deliberation the end or scope is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed,
and the question is, of the best and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
means for the attainment of that end.</item>
               <item>2. When any one is fallen into calamity, it is to be
presumed, that the end which he will propose to
himself, will be the removal of the calamity.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Joram</hi> having acknowledged his calamity to have
come from God, it was supposed, on both sides,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48701:13"/>
that to remove, or continue this calamity, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
and absolutely in the hand and power of God.
So that the only question is this, which is the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
way to prevail with God, to remove his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and take away his heavy hand, the way of
<hi>Elisha,</hi> or the way of <hi>Joram.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Now, although it seems very easie, to determine
this question, upon principles of common reason,
and by reflexion upon the ways of men; yet seeing
it is to be supposed, that every one knows best, what
way it is, that will move and prevail upon himself;</p>
            <p>And seeing God hath declared himself in this
matter, and his declarations were then extant in the
writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets (to which, a
King of <hi>Israel</hi> ought to be no stranger) I should
think it most congruous, that the deliberation ought
to proceed upon those measures, and the enquiry
accordingly to be, what was like to be the issue of
<hi>Elisha'</hi>s way, and what on the other side, if <hi>Joram'</hi>s
way should be taken, in this case of publick Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>1. Then how hath God declared himself as to
Prayer and Fasting on one hand, and to Cursing
and Swearing on the other? (and so of the rest of the
particulars in Question.)</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <p>1. In general,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide</hi> Psal. 107.</note> 
                     <hi>Call upon me,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>in the
time of trouble, and I will hear thee and help. I cried
unto the Lord in my trouble</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) and he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
me out of my distress.</p>
                  <p>Again! as to Fasting and Mourning, in a day of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48701:13"/>
darkness (<hi>i. e.</hi> a case of Publick Calamity) the way<note place="margin">Joel 2. 15.</note>
prescribed by the Prophets is, to blow the trumpet
in Sion, to proclaim a Fast, and call a solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.
For the Priests to weep betwixt the Porch
and the Altar.<note place="margin">Joel 2. 12.</note> That men turn unto the Lord with
all their hearts, and with Fasting, and with Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and with Mourning.</p>
                  <p>But as for <hi>Joram'</hi>s way, (the ranting, cursing,
swearing, blaspheming way) God hath declared,
That because of Swearing and of Cursing the Land
mourns: He loved not blessing, and it shall be far
from him; he delighted in cursing,<note place="margin">Psal. 109. 6.</note> and it shall
happen unto him: it shall come into his bowels
like water, and like oyl into his bones. And for
the blasphemy, wherewith mine Enemies have
blasphemed me, I will up, saith God, and I will
ease me of mine Enemies, and avenge me of mine
Adversaries.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p>2. As to <hi>Elisha</hi>'s way of meekness and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
God hath declared, That he will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto the lowly, and give grace and favour to
the humble: <q>And though he dwells in the high
and holy place, he will dwell also with him that
is of an humble and contrite heart.</q> More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
as to the case in hand, he hath expresly
promised; <q>If I bring upon the land Famine,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 7-13.</note>
or Pestilence, or Sword, or any other plague;
and my people humble themselves: then will I
hear from heaven, and will remove their
plague.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48701:14"/>
But in reference to <hi>Joram'</hi>s way, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that he hateth the proud looks, and will
destroy the sturdy sinner: That he will pull down
the stoutness of their hearts; and the haughtiness
of the haughty shall be humbled.</p>
               </item>
               <item>3. Lastly! he hath declared, on one hand, that
the patient abiding of the meek shall not perish
for ever; but on the other, that the frowardness of
the froward is an abomination to him.<note place="margin">Prov. 3. 32.</note>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And now the case being clearly stated, one
would think certainly, that <hi>Joram</hi> (without any
haesitation) should submit to the proposals of the
Prophet, and come to a quick and a speedy reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to pursue them.</p>
            <p>But now behold and wonder! stand amazed all
ye that pretend to sense and reason.</p>
            <p>He cannot deny any one of <hi>Elisha'</hi>s premisses,
yet he adheres, and sticks to his own conclusion,
and roundly resolves, that he will neither fast nor
pray (much less betake himself to whining) he
will not humble nor submit himself; he will not
attend or wait upon the Lord any longer.</p>
            <p>Very well and wisely! But what then becomes
of the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>? And how shall this same calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be removed?</p>
            <p>To remove the calamity there are but two ways
imaginable:
<list>
                  <item>1. The way of Address or Accommodation:
or,</item>
                  <item>2. The way of force and compulsion: and the
former of these he hath declined, and will he

therefore betake himself to the later?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>What King being to make War, sits not down
first, and considers, whether he be able with ten

with twenty thousand.</p>
            <p>The Lord is a Lord of Hosts, and a Man of War:
<hi>thousand thousands minister unto him,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 10.</note> and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

coop'd up by the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and will he now
make War with the King of Heaven? Let the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheard
strive with the potsheards of the earth: But
who art thou, O <hi>Joram!</hi> that strivest against God?
what is the hope wherein thou trustest? or wherein
lies thy confidence, that thou rebellest? Did ever
any man exalt himself against God, and hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed?</p>
            <p>Call to remembrance things lately past, and of
ancient days how he hath formed it: The success
of the Giants of old; the modern Fate of <hi>Ahab</hi>
thy Father, the Destiny of <hi>Jezabel</hi> thy Mother,
for the wickedness of the Father <hi>Ahab,</hi> the Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and Witchcrafts of <hi>Jezabel</hi> thy Mother.</p>
            <p>What doth this man intend to do? and what
doth this resolution signifie? Will he arise in the
power of his might, and make a gallant sally,
and so scatter and confound his adversaries? Will
he cause the earth to open, and swallow up this
<hi>Benhadad,</hi> and cover the Congregation of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians?</hi>

            <p>

Or will he cause Quails or Manna to fall from

            <p>Judge in your selves Brethren! were not this a
foolish imagination, an instance of stupidity and
madness?</p>
            <p>Well then! Because the Lord hath vexed him
by his plagues, will he endeavour to plague the
Lord by his wickedness?</p>
            <p>Alas! his wickedness extendeth not to him. Is
not this the folly and madness of wickedness?</p>
            <p>But he will revenge himself upon the Church:
and wreak his spleen upon the Prophet, <q>God do
so to him, and more also, if the head of <hi>Elisha</hi>
the Son of <hi>Shaphat</hi> shall stand upon him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this the wickedness of folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</p>
            <p>Briefly! is not this case of <hi>Joram</hi> a monstrous
and a prodigious case? Doth he not deserve to be
punished and tormented with many stripes? To
be tormented (as it were) in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> for the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his wickedness? In the Valley of <hi>Hinnom</hi>
for the wickedness of his madness? There it was
that <hi>Tophet</hi> was prepared of old, for the King it
was prepared: and certainly this seems to be the

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To look no further back, than we are obliged by
the occasion of this our meeting together: What
sort of Plague or Judgment hath not, within the
space of 20 or 30 years, been inflicted upon this
Kingdom? What sort (I say) of Spiritual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or Temporal Calamity?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Judgment,</hi> which we are here met to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate,
and lament; had in it a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of all manner of Spiritual Judgments
(of Injustice and impiety, of carnal and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48701:16"/>
Wickedness) as well as Misery and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>It was a Calamity pregnant and productive of
innumerable others, wherewith it hath been suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
and which are perpetually pullulating
from it. For this the Land hath mourned well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh
30 years; and for all that, God's anger is
not turned away, but his hand is stretched out
still.</p>
            <p>His Judgments have followed us, and grown
more and more upon us to this very moment, still
eating into our bowels, and corroding into our
bones. And if we be not more mad than <hi>Joram,</hi> we
cannot but acknowledge them to have proceeded
from the hand of God.</p>
            <p>This would evidently appear, if I might be
permitted to insist and animadvert upon the evils
which have befallen us; and trace them backward
to that great and prodigious Judgment, which
was the cause of this days observation.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to spend time to prove, that our
threatning and growing Famine, our present
Murrein, or late Pestilence have proceeded from
the hand of God: Such plagues as these are so
plainly and confessedly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that <hi>David</hi> being
left to his choice betwixt the Sword, the Famine,
and the Pestilence, thought it a plain expression of
his mind, when he only desired he might fall into
the hand of God.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore proceed to a few, particulars of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48701:16"/>
another nature. That a novel and upstart Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
of a Nation, lately feeble and poor,
whining and submissive, should in the space of
not many years arrive at the ungrateful boldness
to provoke a powerful and mighty Kingdom, (a
Kingdom to which they had been in their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and minority so much obliged;) That they
should be permitted to disappoint and baffle their
strongest Preparations, and come to such an height
as to attempt, and endeavour to fix upon them
marks and characters of perpetual ignominy and
dishonour.</p>
            <p>That a fire should proceed out of the Bramble,
which should consume the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon:</hi>
That a spark should kindle in a corner, and should
be permitted to destroy all the stately Palaces,
publick Buildings, and venerable Churches in
one of the most considerable Cities of the World,
besides 12000 private habitations. This certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is <hi>Digitus Dei: This evil is from the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When after the miseries of 20 years the Lord
had caused Light to spring out of Darkness, and
Order out of Confusion; Reduced all things to
that state and position, out of which they had
been distorted; Had Restored our Religion, our
Laws, and Liberties; Had Established the King,
the Church, the Nobility, Gentry, Populacy in
their ancient Rights and legal Stations; Had
fortified all these by new additional Laws, and a
Loyal and worthy Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48701:17"/>
That after all this, without any disturbance by
Foreign Invasion, or intestine Rebellion, meerly
by the application of our own wisdom and policy
(and our most industrious endeavours) in the
short space of about a dozen years (the same
Parliament still continuing) This goodly Fabrick
should be shattered, and all things e'ne ready to
drop into Disorder and Confusion.</p>
            <p>That out of Depth of Policy, and Mystery of
State, the foundations of Government should be
subverted, and the Ligaments of it dissolved.</p>
            <p>That for the establishment of Government, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one should be permitted to do that, which is
right in his own eyes; as if there were no King in
<hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That for the Advancement of the Established
Religion, there should be permitted to assume to
themselves a Toleration of all Religions (or rather
irreligions) Schisms, Heresies, and Blasphemies
in the world.</p>
            <p>That out of Indulgence to tender Consciences,
the Principles of Atheism and Anarchy should
be permitted to be disseminated, countenanced,
watered, cherished and fostered, and all means
used, that conscience it self should be eradicated
out of the Souls of men.</p>
            <p>WIth fear and trembling! horror and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement!
to come up to the prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
instance of this day!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48701:17"/>
That the vilest and the worst of men should be
permitted in the most horrible and most impious
(the most impudent and brazen-faced) manner,
under a form of Godliness and Justice, in the
sight of this Sun; in contempt and defiance of
Providence, and of God himself, to shed the
Royal Blood, and take away the Sacred Life of
the Lord's <hi>Anointed;</hi> and of him that was the
most Harmless and Innocent, the most Meek and
Gentle, the most Virtuous and Religious, the
most Sober and Prudent Prince that ever sate
upon the English Throne.</p>
            <p>Lastly, That after all this, and all the rest that
our eyes have seen. After the Massacre and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> The Covenant contrived in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> The Bloody Wars and Sacrilegious
Judgment and Execution made here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That after we have seen the end of the Lord,
the Vengeance of God so signally executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Principal Authors, Actors, and Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the Judges and Executioners of all those
things; Matters should (in so short a time) be
brought to that pass, that (according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Inclinations of men) some should Fear,
and others Hope, that the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi>
and that Religion, and those Laws, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
persons, which uphold it, should now be
abandoned; And that the great Interests of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Government should be delivered up
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48701:18"/>
into the hands of the <hi>Irish</hi> or <hi>English</hi> Papists,
the <hi>Scottish</hi> or <hi>English</hi> Covenanters, or other
Sectaries and Fanaticks.</p>
            <p>Are not all these things strange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?
are they not marvellous in our eyes? In all
this is not the hand of God clearly to be seen?
certainly we cannot but acknowledge, that <hi>This
evil is from the Lord.</hi> So that in respect of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Calamities you have seen the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
of our Case with the Case of <hi>Joram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Let us now reflect upon the National beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and examine, Whether hath this been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
according to the way of <hi>Elisha,</hi> or the way
of <hi>Joram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Judgments of God have been so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
so grievous, so visible amongst us, have the
Inhabitants of the Land learned righteousness, or
unrighteousness? Have they prevailed upon us,
to break off our sins by Repentance, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in them, and increase them with a brisker
and sturdier resolution?</p>
            <p>As the Lord's hand hath been more and more
lifted up, have not we endeavoured with an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and higher hand, to sin against him?</p>
            <p>As he hath smitten us more and more, have not
we revolted more and more?</p>
            <p>Instead of being made a Religious and a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
People, are we not become an Atheistical, and
a Scoffing, and Blaspheming People?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48701:18"/>
Instead of being a Sober and Fasting People, are
we not become a Riotous and Drunken People?</p>
            <p>Instead of being made a Chast and Modest, a
Meek and Humble, a Gentle and Composed Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
are we not become a Shameless and Immodest,
a Ranting and Tearing, a Hectoring and God-dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
People?</p>
            <p>Briefly! <q>Instead of turning to the Lord with
all our hearts; and with Fasting, and with Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and with Mourning for our Sins:</q> Have we
not turned from him with all our hearts, and with
laughing, and with scoffing, and with jeering at
all Humiliation, and Devotion, and Religion?</p>
            <p>It is not here my intention to charge every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Person with these things: No doubt there
are thousands in this our <hi>Israel,</hi> who have not bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves to these enormities. And it is well
for them, and happy for the Kingdom, that there
are so: for, <q>Except the Lord had left us such a
remnant, we should have been as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and made
like unto <hi>Gomorrha.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet (the exception of this remnant notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing)
may it not be fit to consider, whether we
be not truly and properly a sinful Nation, a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
laden with Iniquity?</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Chap. 1.</note>
that the Lord had
left them such a remnant, and all that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
they remained still a sinful Nation, a
People laden with Iniquity, that their whole head
was sick, and their heart faint; that from the sole
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48701:19"/>
of the foot to the crown of the head there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Wounds and Ulcers, stinking Leprosies,
and putrefied Sores.</p>
            <p>Will it not be fit therefore for us, to examine
our condition, to consider what we may expect,
and what is fit for us to do?</p>
            <p>To search the Wounds and Ulcers of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from the sole of the foot to the crown of the
head. To examine or expose the Condition of all
Degrees, Orders, and States of men in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
(The Clergy, and the Laity, the Gentry and
the Commonalty, the City and the Court; in their
Personal, or Publique, or Politick Capacities)
though I suppose that to some it might be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable,
yet it lies not in my Commission, and I
shall wave it.</p>
            <p>My Commission reaches to those who have called
me hither, at least in that Capacity wherein they
have called me: And I hope they will not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at me in the conscientious discharge of that
Commission. I therefore take the humble bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Name of God, and our King, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to enquire of my self, and those, that brought
me hither, Whether we also have not fallen into
the way of <hi>Joram?</hi> Whether we can wash our hands
of the universal Irreligion and Debauchery which
seems to have over spread the Land?</p>
            <q>
               <p>Qui non vetat peccare, cum possit,
Jubet.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Have we employed the great and various talents
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48701:19"/>
wherewith we have been intrusted, Publick and
Private, Personal and Politick; the Advantages
of Nobility and Education, the Interest of our
Persons and our Places, our Authority Judicial
and Legislative to prevent or to punish these hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
enormities.</p>
            <p>Nay, have we readily accepted and embraced
such means as have been tendered to that purpose?</p>
            <p>If we should be examined what good Laws in
twelve years space have proceeded from us, to
bring our selves and others to live soberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and godly in this present world. What cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Laws, to prevent the Poverty and Beggery,
the Villany and Roguery, the miserable ends, and
fatal destiny of such multitudes of people, as daily
perish by a fearful end, should we not be puzzled
to reply?</p>
            <p>If Laws against Rioting and Drunkenness shall
have been, or shall be hereafter stifled, left they
should prevent Consumption, and make an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Rents, or the Excise.</p>
            <p>Against Atheism and Blasphemy, lest they should
dull the Wits and hinder the exercise of Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
abate the disputacity of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Against Swearing and Cursing, Ranting and
Tearing, Hectoring and Rencountring, lest they
should abate the vivacity, and take off the edge,
or spoil the mettle of the young Blades of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Against Prophanation of the Lord's Day (I do
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48701:20"/>
not mean tending to Judaism or Sabbatarianism)
lest they should intrench upon the Mirth and Jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Sports and Recreations of the People.</p>
            <p>When God shall call us to answer upon such
interrogatories, how are we provided to reply?</p>
            <p>Upon this occasion, in this mixt Auditory, to
enlarge any further upon this argument, I do not
find my self obliged by my Commission. But there
is one thing, which by virtue of another Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
I find my self obliged plainly and clearly to
lay before your Lordships, and it is this (with
which I shall conclude.)</p>
            <p>That (as sure as there is a God in Heaven, a Lord
that is higher then your Lordships, as sure as Christ
is now sitting at his right hand, as sure as holy
men of old (the Prophets and Apostles) were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
by the Holy Ghost) If we do not speedily
break out of this way of <hi>Joram,</hi> if we do not our
utmost to redeem and rescue the Kingdom from it;
this our Iniquity will be our Ruine.</p>
            <p>That (if aftet so many loud calls to Religion and
Virtue, we shall resolvedly go on in the ways of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion
and Debauchery, or (which in our case is
all one) if we shall not do our utmost for the eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of them, we must expect a sure and a swift
destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In that day (saith the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>)<note place="margin">Isa. 22. 13.</note> did
the Lord God of Hosts call to weeping, and to
mourning, to sackcloth and to baldness,—
And behold, jollity and gladness, slaying of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48701:20"/>
Oxen, and killing of Sheep, eating flesh and
drinking wine, <hi>(Let us eat and drink, for to
morrow we shall die)</hi> And it was revealed in
mine ears by the Lord of Hosts: Surely this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
shall not be purged from you till you
die.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If when Gods Judgments are multiplied,<note place="margin">Ezek. 14. 14. &amp;c.</note> a
Nation will not turn unto the Lord, he hath
sworn, and sworn again (four times together in
one Chapter) that though <hi>Noab, Daniel,</hi> and
<hi>Job</hi> were there, they should deliver neither Son
nor Daughter from destruction.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (in one word to conclude) return
now O <hi>Shunamite!</hi> return! arise, and bethink your
selves, Men, Brethren, and Fathers! O ye Wise and
Honourable among the People, consult, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der!
what shall we do, that the Blood of Jesus may
speak better things for us, then the Blood of the
Righteous Royal Martyr? What shall we do to be
saved from ruine and destruction?</p>
            <p>You have seen in some measure the folly and the
madness of the wickedness, and the wickedness of
the folly and madness of this way of <hi>Joram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore! let us trifle no more, let us sin no
more, let us fool no more, lest we fall and perish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the condemnation of <hi>Joram,</hi> when he said, <hi>This
evil is from the Lord, Wherefore should I wait upon
the Lord any longer?</hi>
