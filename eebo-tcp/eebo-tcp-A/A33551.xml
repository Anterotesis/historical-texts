         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Am oblig'd, with the modern
Poets, to be ſpeak my Reader's
favour to the following Sheets.
They contain nothing but what is
fact; yet, <hi>That</hi> appears too ſimple
in their primitive dreſs, to bear
the Cenſure of ſome peeviſh Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics:
The firſt draught was done
at Sea, and it was my buſineſs
for an hour after dinner, only to
keep me from ſleeping; elſe theſe
Obſervations had lain to this day,
wrapt up in that rubbiſh of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
in which they wee made; for
ſoon after my Summer's expedition
was at an end, I was commanded
to attend the Fleet, under Sir
<hi>Cloudeſly Shovel,</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi>
which is the ſole reaſon, why theſe
<pb facs="tcp:105646:5"/>
Papers are not fild from ſome of
their roughneſs, that might juſtly
have forbidden their ſeeing the
light, if my deſign of publiſhing
my yearly obſervations ſhou'd not
have been broke off: and I know
that Ingenious and Candid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
will more eaſily diſpence with
this Ore, than to have had no
Metal at all. But that they might
not prove entirely ungrateful, as
the reading a continu'd ſeries of
Obſervations always is, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to interſperſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that's more of Theor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Reaſoning, as often as the
thread, nature and deſign of the
ſubject would allow me: I never
ſought a Digreſſion, yet when I

practic'd as long as <hi>Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelah</hi>

known among us; yet we deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
admire the ſtupendous and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing
relations we have, of the
progreſs they have made, and the
certainty they have attained to in
<hi>Aeſculapius</hi>'s Art, and that with the
native plants of their Country, and
<pb facs="tcp:105646:7"/>
the only reaſon we can aſſign for
their ſingular and great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this moſt noble and uſeful
Art, (which by restoring us to our
health, makes us enjoy our Eſtates,
our Liberty and our Relations, gives
us all the ſatisfaction Mankind is
allowed to enjoy in this troubleſom
life, and ev'n makes us conquer our
misfortunes) is that they initiate
their Children from their tender
years in its myſteries, by a conſtant
attendance upon their Parents, who
are often Kings, Princes, and
Brachmans, as well as Phyſicians,
and that they enjoin them a ſtrict
obſervation of their Parents practice
without being diverted and amus'd
with any thing beſides, when they
are upon the ſtudy of ſo human and

bring relief to their languiſhing

decaying nature: So there is no
wonder if one that is inſtructed in
the experience of many former ages,
having his head turn'd, and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:105646:8"/>
perfectly moulded that way, does
arrive to a greater perfection and
certainty in that art, even in a more
barbarous and ignorant Country (if
we may ſuppoſe them ſo) than they are
capable to do in Nations that are
more famous for Learning, where me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin
is begun with nothing ſo great
an advantage, nothing ſo much
ſtudied not only as there, but even as
they themſelves ſtudy other things of
leſs concern, and all comprehended
in the ſhort life of one man. I do
not write this with any reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our own age, tho I muſt own that
we have as great a ſhare in this, as
our Anceſtors, when the telling a
pleaſant ſtory, a piece of wit, a
gloomy and ſullen melancholy alone
can entitle us to the fame of great
Phyſicians; and which is worſe,
pretence and impudence are the only
ſtock and furniture of ſome. There
can be no remedy for this till Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
ſhou'd become fit judges of
their Phyſicians, which is never to
be expected. But ſince we ſee that
<pb facs="tcp:105646:8"/>
Obſervations are ſo neceſſary and
uſeful a piece of Medicin, let us
but ſee what helps the Authors of
this kind of Learning give us. We
ought to look back into all the ages
of Medicin, if we were to be exact
in this matter, but the talk has
been ſo difficult, that it has been
either induſtriouſly ſhunn'd or very
ill performed hitherto by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that have lived before us, till at
this time the learned Monſieur <hi>Le
Clerc</hi> has undertaken this work,
and has already favour'd the world
with his firſt Tome, where he gives
us hope of his carrying it on to our
time. 'Twere needleſs to manage
the matter in his way, tho a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
would admit of it; ſince the
daily complaints of practitioners are
about the ſhort coming of ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
to their daily buſineſs,
and how often they loſe their way
in ſuch dark paths. But let us
compare the Obſervations of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
with a rule which we ought to
make to our ſelves, about an exact
<pb facs="tcp:105646:9"/>
and genuin ennmeration of ſymptoms,
numbers and force of pulſes, colours
and quantity of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin, its conſiſtency,
time of breaking and the like,
the time of the year, the Patient's
age, the time of the diſeaſe when
we ſee him, what medicins are given,
how kept, and what is the event,
and how the medicins took their
effect, with other more particular
queſtions that may more particularly
ſettle the difference of the Diſeaſe.
I ſay, if we compare the Books of
obſervations with this Rule, Im a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
we will find them of very little
uſe, not only <hi>Foreſtus, Hollerius,
Horſtius, Platerus. &amp;c.</hi> but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Maſters of greater antiquity
ſinking under the apprehenſions of
being tried by this general rule;
'tis not many Names, many Countries,
and many Streets of any one City,
that make an obſervation compleat,
but a little more: and really looking
into all the modern and ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Obſervations, I muſt own that
'tis my opinion that our own Dr <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105646:9"/>
has writ in the moſt exact
and particular way, tho he has not
come quite up to the former Rule.
'Tis ſurely in Medicin as in all other
other Phyſical knowledge, the more
circumstances we know, the better
judgment we are able to make. This
is the ſcheme I have laid to my ſelf
in writing my Obſervations last year,
and this, which I have endeavour'd
to purſue as far as the conveniency
of the place I was in did allow, and
tho I ſaw people in all the Ships of
my diviſion yet I only thought fit to
relate my Obſervations in 3 or 4,
where I was moſt capable to ſatisfy
the particulars of my own rule, as I have
expreſly ſaid, in the beginning of the
2d part of my Sea-ſickneſſes, tho one
or two who pretend more to the way of
Writing than the way of Medicin,
laid this as a heavy charge to my
door, but the little, one of them writ,
eſpecially in his own profeſſion, may
evidently convince the world, that he's
almoſt as wretched a Writer as he's a
weak Phyſician: 'Tis true, his
<pb facs="tcp:105646:10"/>
Trade's to be a Phyſician, but his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
are to Wit. I have ſpent too
much time upon a thing that's the
diverſion of the Apothecarie's Boy,
in every Bill he ſends him, which
he's forc'd to model in another way;
ſince I neither ſtand nor fall by his
cenſure, I neither value the Book
more or leſs for his character, which
I knew he would give it, without a
reading. I firſt began a book of this
ſubject, becauſe it was wanting, and
'twas my particular province; and
I must acknowledge my obligations
to the world for the entertainment
they gave it; tho it came abroad in
the Summer, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when the interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Currency of money did ſo
much diſcourage all ſorts of Trade:
but above all, if I was to value the
Book, I would upon the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it had in the moſt famous and
learned <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the
Glory of all <hi>Europe</hi> for its noble
fabrick, but a great deal more for
theſe famous and ſhining lights
ſhe ſends abroad at all times, and
<pb facs="tcp:105646:10"/>
in ſo great and ſo ſingular a number,
that ſhe's but deſervedly the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole earth. But 'twas
neither fame nor a deſire of praiſe
that put me upon this task, but an
inclination of doing good in the way
providence has put me into; and all
my wiſhes are only, that this and the
former book may be able to men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſome of the many miſtakes I found,
in that buſineſs, and if I am ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as in theſe Obſervations, to lay
one firm Step, by which others may
advance to a greater certainty
in their practice, I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to a perfect enjoyment of my

            <head>A
CONTINUATION
OF THE
Hiſtory of the Diſeaſes
IN HIS
Majeſty's Navy, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Endeavour'd laſt year, to give a
genuin and true account of the
riſe and nature of the Sickneſſes
at Sea, from conſiderations about the
way of their living; and the Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Cure, which were the reſults
of that Reaſoning: and to theſe I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the hiſtorical obſervations of that
year, which made a more particular
and practical part of that Book:<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation.</note> And
now being to illuſtrate that firſt part,
and perform my promiſe in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105646:13"/>
I will confine my ſelf to the
Method I propoſed for relating theſe
Obſervations, and purſue it with all
the Candidneſs and Integrity that can
be expected, without repeating any
thing that has been mention'd alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
and therefore I muſt deſire every
one that will judge of <hi>this,</hi> to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the general Theory in the <hi>firſt,</hi>
and the moſt reaſonable Indications
in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Part, as the beſt way to
prevent miſtakes and obſcurity. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I muſt confeſs, that tho I have put
it beyond exception, by arguments
from reaſon and experience, that
Evacuation in the caſe of Fevers is
abſolutely neceſſary towards their
Cure, and tho I have alſo declar'd
that this Evacuation is to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to the interrupted perſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that cauſes our Fevers, that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the ſame quantity, with the
detained ſteams, or at leaſt in ſuch a
quantity as may procure more liberal
ſecretions; ſo that if the quantity
that is evacuated be not equal to the
quantity of detain'd ſteams, yet mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſecretions more freely, there
may be a quantity evacuated equal to
theſe ſteams, by the ſecretions that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105646:13"/>
are now begun: Yet, I ſay, I muſt
confeſs that I may ſeem to be wanting
in ſetting a ſtandard, or certain mark,
which may direct our Surgeons in the
difficult ſtages of theſe Evacuations,
with as much certainty as a fix'd mark
in the Heavens directs our Sailers in
their Voyages. 'Tis true I might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that the profound intricacy of
ſo particular a part of knowledge,
and the many blunders I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in the moſt learned Authors
that have but touch'd upon theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
tho never ſo ſlightly, have
deterr'd me from venturing upon ſo
nice a Task; and after ſo reaſonable
an excuſe I cou'd not be blam'd for
any conſiderable neglect or omiſſion.
But ſince this knowledge, tho never
ſo hard, is extremely neceſſary for the
fixing of a certain Method of practice,
I'le ſet out for once, and if I do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry,
'twill be in good company, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the maſterly Heroes in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin.</p>
            <p>Since the quantity to be evacuated
is proportionable to the detain'd
ſteams,<note place="margin">The requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites for this Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation.</note> and the quantity of ſtaems
may be very eaſily valued, (as I hope
I ſhall prove in its proper place), as I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105646:14"/>
have already intimated in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that it exceeds not two or three
pounds; 'tis plain that either two or
three pounds are actually to be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated,
or ſuch a quantity that may
procure new ſecretions which will
evacuate the requir'd quantity. And
'tis no leſs certain that this is to be
perform'd according to the different
ſtrength and conſtitutions of our Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and with ſuch Inſtruments as
may not require a larger Evacuation
by rarefying and giving a new motion
to the Blood. 'Tis here the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
lyes, to know what quantity our
Patients ſtrength will allow to be
evacuated, and to make an eſtimate
of the inſtruments we uſe on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
and of the effects they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
beſides our primary intention.
Now 'tis the uncertainty of the <hi>Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Medicins</hi> we uſe for compaſſing our
deſign of evacuation that occaſions
this great difficulty in our firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becauſe ſometimes they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
without any ſucceſs, but heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the <hi>Pulſe,</hi> and encreaſe the other
ſevere <hi>ſymptoms</hi> we ſee in <hi>Fevers;</hi> and
at other times taking effect, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
an exceſſive evacuation through
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105646:14"/>
the pores of our Body, they ſend our
patients out of the world another
way, inſtead of curing them by a due
quantity, which no man can pretend
to expel by theſe Medicins, which we
are ſo little Maſters of, that we are
not able to foretel, with any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
exactneſs, the <hi>quantity</hi> of <hi>ſteams</hi>
diſcharg'd that way, nor the <hi>additional
heat</hi> produc'd by their ſmall parts.
Next to them are purging medicins, of
which tho we are a great deal more
certain, yet they are not exempted
from ſome of the difficulties that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the others. So that the ſureſt
inſtrument for performing our deſign
is <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> or <hi>Bleeding,</hi> tho' even
this may create a <hi>ſtronger pulſe,</hi> a
greater <hi>heat,</hi> and the like, than
was before, after loſing ten or twelve
ounces of blood in a certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which I ſhall have occaſion to
ſpeak of here. And therefore <hi>bleeding</hi>
being the moſt certain way, I will for
once ſuppoſe all the <hi>reſt</hi> as certain,
or at leaſt ſignify by this more certain
way what we intend by the reſt when
we apply them them to evacuate the
quantity we deſire, according to the
ſtrength and conſtitution of our patient.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105646:15"/>
And now when I am to apply <hi>Veneſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to this deſign, I muſt confeſs I can
hardly forbear running out into a long
digreſſion concerning ſome noble
Theore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s about the great and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
effects of bleeding, that depend
entirely upon the infinitely uſeful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of the circulation of the
Blood, that crowd into my thoughts;
but I muſt at preſent reſtrain my
ſelf now, becauſe the general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
we find in Authors about
bleeding, are only as it evacuates ſuch
a quantity;<note place="margin">The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have given of Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> I will ſhew in the firſt
place how imperfect and uſeleſs the
advices of our great Maſters are in
this affair, and then inform the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what other ways are to be taken
for attaining a greater certainty, tho
the more particular account can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be properly apply'd in this place;
and this will exactly anſwer what I
propoſed.</p>
            <p>The Rules and Advices which Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in Medicine have given us in this
matter, are to let blood according to
the <hi>ſtrength of the Patient; till he faint
away, till we have taken away enough,</hi>
and till it change its colour from
<hi>worſe</hi> to <hi>better,</hi> from <hi>black</hi> to <hi>red;</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105646:15"/>
laſtly, ſome others who think they
have given the laſt touch to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
take their marks from the <hi>big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
and <hi>fulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Veſſels,</hi> and ſo
take away as much as a man may be
ſuppoſed to loſe in a day without
dying, and this way they pretend to
confirm by ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſtances from pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
in which, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I hope they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in their own practice, yet I
doubt not but I ſhall convince the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
of the unhappy ſtate of thoſe ſick
people that are drain'd of their Blood,
by ſuch unſteady and uncertain rules.<note place="margin">What is to be thought of the firſt Rule.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But to enquire into the firſt of
theſe, which adviſes us to let our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
blood according to their <hi>ſtrength,</hi>
'tis certain that muſt never be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
yet there are a great many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
in bleeding, in which that is
not ſo often to be reſpected. Not
but that if the quantity to be let,
ſhould exceed the Patient's ſtrength,
that conſideration would become the
firſt and greateſt; yet, I ſay, there
are a great many deſigns in bleeding,
that the quantity to be taken away
is ſo ſmall, that the ſtrength of the
Patient can never be brought into
queſtion: For inſtance, in making a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105646:16"/>
revulſion, and old and confirmed ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and practice, tho never to be
accounted for, but by ſuppoſing
<hi>Harvey</hi>'s noble Theorem of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the Blood, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that Doctrine, the moſt of
our modern Phyſitians have been
pleaſed to think it. I ſay in making
a <hi>revulſion,</hi> or by determining the
motion of the Blood, more towards
one part than another, which is to be
practiced upon a thouſand occaſions;
the quantity to be let, if other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
are obſerved, very often
exceeds not ſix or eight Ounces in
the ſtrongeſt conſtitutions; now ſuch
a quantity can never be ſuppoſed to
bring our Patients ſtrength into doubt,
'tis evident that in ſuch caſes this
great rule is, (I had almoſt ſaid) of
no uſe at all to us. But next, if our
Patient be troubl'd with a Diſtemper
that proceeds from too much blood,
and we deſire to be ſo nice, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him of all the offending quantity,
and not to impair his ſtrength, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
others ſickneſſes that require <hi>Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy</hi>
for their cure, and the ſtrength
of the patient comes in competition,
ſo that is never to be injur'd; yet th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Rule is ſo precariouſly injoin'd, that
no Phyſician can be inſtructed, how
to put it in practice; which the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Galen</hi> willingly confeſſes. <hi>Nullam

more evidently by Phyſicians Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in acute Diſeaſes, concerning
a healthy young Man affected, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
with a <hi>Fever, Pleuriſie,</hi> or
<hi>Quinſie,</hi> they all agree, and are of one
judgment, that nothing can ſo ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſcue him from this imminent
danger, than the taking away of as
much blood as his ſtrength can bear:
yet aſſoon as the Vein is opened, and
the Patient has loſt ſome nine or ten
ounces of blood, one of 'em begins
immediately to try by his Pulſe how
far his ſtrength is impaired; and after
a round Trial has been made by them
all, they can come to no poſitive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
about their Rule; while one
thinks there is too much, another too
little, and a third juſt enough taken
away; ſo that however they ſeem'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105646:17"/>
agreed about letting him blood in the
general, and in as great a quantity as
his ſtrength could bear; yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
condeſcend about the time of
of ſtopping it, and the riſe of all this
difference is only from their ignorance
of their Patient's ſtrength, which they
thought ſo eaſy, as to ſettle it for a
Rule in this operaration.</p>
            <p>Now perhaps they are to meaſure
the ſtrength of the Patient by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him till he faint away;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> other falſe.</note> and if this
be ſet up, as more evident than the
firſt, 'tis ſo far from being ſo, that 'tis
a great deal more obſcure: for very
many who are to be let blood till they
put on this emblem of pale Death,
faint away, not only after loſing a
very moderate quantity, but even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the loſs of two or three ounces, or
immediately after the vein is cut; or
even by ſeeing any other perſons
blood, or the Lancet it ſelf. What's
then to be done? nothing; but the
wound muſt be tied up, and the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delay'd till a ſitter opportunity.
'Tis true, the bleeding may be put off,
but the cauſe of the Diſeaſe will not
adjourn, but double its force and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the command of the ſubject. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105646:17"/>
the other hand, there are many
who could ſuffer all the blood in their
Body to run out, before they faint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
which often happens to thoſe
whoſe dreſſings fall off in their ſleep,
and make their Bed ſwim with blood,
tho ſometimes they themſelves reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>The third rule is juſt as ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as the other two;<note place="margin">What of the third.</note> for when they
adviſe us to let ſo much as we may
think enough, it is evident that there
will be as many opinions about this
<hi>enough</hi> as there are Phyſicians, and
perhaps more; for while ſome are
for bleeding and others not, they
that agree in their judgments for
letting Blood, differ about the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
and very often the buſineſs is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by him, whom age alone gives
the killing authority, or an habituated
impudence has taught to overtalk
the reſt; ſo that we may very well
ſay with the learned <hi>Galen,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi> Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum

               </q>
               <q>That ſick perſon is very lucky who
falls into the hands of a good Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105646:18"/>
or whom fortune or rather God
Almighty favours ſo much, that he
makes that opinion prevail, which is
the moſt uſeful.</q> Now this third Rule
is certainly true, but at the ſame time
'tis very obſcure and hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;
this is an aim or deſign in
every bodies eye, but it is not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
performed by moſt Phyſicians, for
the reaſons we gave before, and
what more learning does a Doctor
ſhow, when he orders a Surgeon to let
ſo much as is ſufficient, than a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who ſeeing the blood run out,
deſires them to take no more than
may be enough. Yet this <hi>enough</hi> is
only preſum'd to be known, by the
other ſigns we have juſt now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
and therefore 'tis plain, how
well 'tis like to be done; and how
certain a Rule this will prove.</p>
            <p>And when they perſuade us, with
<hi>Hippoc.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hippocrat,</hi> Rule very uncertain.</note> to make the <hi>colour</hi> of the <hi>blood</hi>
the rule and ſtandard of the quantity
that is to be taken away, they confine
this uſeful and noble operation within
too narrow bounds; and to ſay no
more, if the blood was only to be
taken away when it is black, tough,
and ſeizie, and till it become red:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105646:18"/>
the redneſs of the blood being the
mark beyond which we are not to go,
'tis evident that when the blood is ſo,
there will be no want of bleeding.
Yet, in a great many <hi>Apoplexies, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
&amp;c. the blood is not often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured,
at leaſt not very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and yet this operation is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſeful and neceſſary. Beſides, when
one of the beſt habit of body has juſt
fallen from a high place, a wiſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
eaſily foreſees that the veſſels of
thoſe parts that come firſt to the
ground, will be conſiderably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
and that by this compreſſion the
blood cannot move ſo eaſily through
thoſe parts, and by its ſtopping there,
will produce terrible ſymptoms, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the greatneſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and the office of the part
whoſe veſſels are thus compreſ'sd:
And therefore, he thinks it neceſſary,
both for leſſening the quantity, and
perhaps quickening the motion, to
cauſe this perſon to be let blood, and
that in a conſiderable quantity, with
very great ſucceſs. Yet the blood in
thoſe people, immediately after the
fall, is not much, if at all, altered
from what it was before the fall, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105646:19"/>
being then ſuppos'd to be of a good
colour, or red, 'tis evident that by
this Rule he could not loſe an ounce,
and the conſeque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce would be, moſt
troubleſome and dangerous <hi>contuſions,
Apoplexies, Rheumatical</hi> and <hi>Pleuritical</hi>
pains, <hi>difficulties</hi> of <hi>breathing,</hi> a <hi>Fever,</hi>
and the like, which we ſee happen
upon ſuth occaſions. But upon the
other hand, let us ſuppoſe that blood
was never to be taken away, but in
this ill colour of the blood (which we
ſee is not ſo) and till it has acquir'd
a better one, yet they cannot ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify
this Rule, that we may know the
degrees of this ill colour, and how
much blood we may take away before
it acquires a better one, and whether
the blood that ſeems neceſſary to be
evacuated, can be ſpared by the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
which would have been highly
uſeful, and even neceſſary for making
their Rule complete; whereas by our
hiſtorical account of the laſt year, 'tis
evident that the blood may be mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chang'd by an <hi>interruption</hi> of <hi>perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and now in caſe of a <hi>fall,</hi> in leſs
than 24 hours, and that bleeding may
actually diſpoſe the blood for beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
better, by promoting the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105646:19"/>
and recovering its colour and

            <p>Now one that ſpeaks very high on
this ſubject, and whom the rational
bleeders at this time follow, ſays we
can never fail, if we have reſpect to
the fulneſs of the veſſels, and the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of blood a man may be reckoned
to ſpare.<note place="margin">This the moſt falſe.</note> But this Rule is too general
to be put in practice: 'tis true, as he
ſays, that fat people, whoſe veins are
generally ſmall, and conſequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
contain much blood, if they be
drain'd of an indifferent quantity, will
feel the inconveniences of the want of
blood, or of a diſpirited blood, very
ſoon and fatally, by cachectical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
and a Dropſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet it is no leſs

or women that are troubled with <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,</hi>
whoſe veſſels are generally wide,
and actually contain a great deal of
blood, and by this Rule can ſpare the
moſt; yet they, for the moſt part, can
never bear ſo large a bleeding, even
as thoſe fat people we juſt now ſpoke
of, and very ſeldom can endure the
loſs of ten or twelve ounces of blood
without a <hi>ſinking</hi> in their heart (as they

this Rule. Now, I would
gladly ask any of thoſe Authors, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or not the other part of the Rule,
<hi>What a man can ſpare,</hi> be not the ſame
with that of <hi>the ſtrength of the Patient,</hi>
which we find to be very true, but
not plain enough to be of any uſe: Or
if they think they may take as much
blood away, as we find people have
loſt by <hi>wounds, bleeding</hi> at the <hi>Noſe,
Piles, &amp;c.</hi> without loſing their Life;
they may if they pleaſe, but I ſhall
never think it reaſonable to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to a Remedy, which no leſs
than the diſtemper muſt always require
the help of a Phyſician.<note place="margin">An Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ation.</note> 'Twas upon
this precarious and general way of
practice, I ſaw a learned man, and a
Phyſician too, who had been ſick of
a Looſeneſs for ſome weeks, if I may
not ſay months, by which he was
brought to a very low condition; yet
I know not what odd fancy poſſeſt
him who was call'd to his aſſiſtance,
to take from him 12 or 14 ounces of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105646:20"/>
blood at that time, and I think re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
it next day, contrary to the
rules of common ſenſe, as well as of
Phyſick, with as great boldneſs as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion,
and of which the Sufferer
was ſo ſenſible, that when I was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to be ſent for by ſome of his
friends, he ſaid he was convinc'd of
their miſtake, but that it would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
men of their Character and
Dotard Seniority to ſend for a younger
Phyſician; and ſo he ended his days
with a vaſt deal of Ceremony. I am
ſorry I muſt relate ſo ungrateful a
ſtory, but 'tis but one of too many I
have ſeen, tho I muſt confeſs there
are as great miſtakes, and greater,
occaſion'd by the neglect of bleeding;
and therefore ſince on both ſides, <hi>they</hi>
are <hi>fatal</hi> and <hi>pernicious,</hi> 'twou'd be
needleſs to obſerve, that there ought
to be a great deal of care taken about
it, not only in performing the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the eaſieſt that can be,
by an Inſtrument; but in determining
the juſt quantities in different Patients,
which you ſee Authors have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by deſiring us to let them
blood according <hi>to their ſtrength, as
much as is ſufficient, as much as they can
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105646:21"/>
ſpare,</hi> which are all the ſame thing; only
I think better expreſs'd in the firſt. But
the queſtion at firſt ask'd was, <hi>what
will the Patients ſtrength hear, what is
ſufficient,</hi> and <hi>what may he ſpare,</hi> which
is left in as great obſcurity as when
they begun it.</p>
            <p>Now to clear this a little better than
it has been by others, 'twould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
not only to write a <hi>Book</hi> of
<hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> but for greater diſtinctneſs
to apply the <hi>conſequences</hi> of its noble
<hi>Theorems</hi> to <hi>particular diſeaſes, constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of our <hi>Patients, ſeaſons</hi> of the year,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which 'tis plain are foreign to my
ſubject. Yet to direct my Brethren
in the Navy in their thoughts and
practice, as well and ſhortly as this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
will allow me, that they
may make evacuations fit to diſcharge
the exceſſive quantities of detained
ſteams, without impairing or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſtrength of the Patient, I
ſhall propoſe theſe two ways,<note place="margin">Propoſals for better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> which
if rightly enquir'd into and thought
upon, cannot miſs of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>And firſt, ſince the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and
<hi>velocity</hi> of the <hi>blood,</hi> is to be underſtood
by the <hi>Pulſe,</hi> 'tis to <hi>That</hi> we muſt have
regard, that we may know how far
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105646:21"/>
they either exceed or are lower than
their ordinary meaſure; and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
to the number of pulſes, more
than in a natural ſtate, ſo to let blood,
that the blood after veneſection may
come to a greater coheſion, may not
be ſo much attrited and broken down,
and ſo there may not be ſeparated ſo
great a quantity of animal ſpirits. Or
the pulſe being <hi>depreſs'd,</hi> very <hi>full,</hi> and
not ſo <hi>frequent,</hi> we ought to let blood,
not only in a quantity able to raiſe
the pulſe, and make it more frequent,
but even afterwards to abate this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency
by a larger bleeding as before:
For there is nothing more ordinary
than in the moſt natural fullneſs (if
I may ſo ſay) where there is a <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora
ad vaſa</hi> (as Phyſicians term it) a
great abundance of the beſt blood, the
fitteſt, of its own nature, to make
animal ſpirits, and to produce all the
conſequences that follow upon good
blood and a great abundance of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
I ſay there is nothing more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
than to have a depreſs'd pulſe as
I deſcrib'd but now, in a <hi>natural</hi> or
<hi>artificial</hi> fullneſs; for the blood is ſo
confin'd within its own veſſels, and its
parts ſo crowded one upon another,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105646:22"/>
that there is not a ſufficient ſecretion
of its fine and ſubtle parts, but ev'n
by this great quantity the diſtractile
blood-pipes being very much diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
compreſs the nerves over all the
body, and hinder the conveyance of
the animal ſpirits into, and thro theſe
veſſels, according to their force of
going outwards, and the reſiſtence of
theſe in the different parts; ſo that
tho there is a greater quantity of blood
contain'd in the veſſels, yet that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
propell'd or driven forwards with
leſs force, will occaſion a full, tho
ſlow, pulſe: and therefore ſince this
leſs ſecretion of animal ſpirits, their
ſlower motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceeds entirely
from the quantity of blood contain'd
in the veins, but eſpecially the arteries,
and produces the effects of a real want,
yet its motion is only to be heightned,
its <hi>ſenſe of greatneſs</hi> to be advanced, by
taking off ſuch a quantity that may
remove this huddling up of the blood,
and make the ſecretions more free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that ſo there may be a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of ſpirits deriv'd into, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
thro, the whole ſeries of the
nerves, upon which there will follow
a quicker and greater pulſe; tho if it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105646:22"/>
exceeds its natural ſtate in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
another bleeding muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in purſuance of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
deſign, which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the uſe of bleeding in Fevers, as
we uſe a charm to blood, and that
all.</p>
            <p>Now in both theſe caſes you ſee
the <hi>natural</hi> pulſe is the <hi>ſtandard,</hi> and
before you can know whether it is
<hi>depreſs'd, ſlower</hi> or <hi>quicker,</hi> you muſt
know that which is natural to which
the reſt are referr'd; and not only ſo,
but before you can determine any
quantity of blood to be taken away in
either of theſe caſes, you ought to
know what <hi>coheſion,</hi> what <hi>looſoneſs</hi> is fit
to make the pulſe ſo much quicker,
or depreſs'd, or to make an eſtimate
of the number of pulſes by the blood
in the beſt ſtate, and of their ſtrength:
the laſt of which I intend to attempt
in a Review of my <hi>O Economia Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
that it may want nothing of the
perfection I can give it, and may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more worthy of the learned
Mr. <hi>Bridgeman,</hi> under whoſe protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ventur'd into the world with ſo
great advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:105646:23"/>
Yet the firſt is very conſiderable,
and ev'n neceſſary for its uſe; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we know the natural pulſe of
every ſingle Man, we are call'd to,
we can never know, when it is ſickly
and defective; for example, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that more eſpecially the number
of pulſes pecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iar to men were of
three ſorts, as I have endeavoured to
prove them to be in my Animal Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy,
<hi>viz.</hi> from 55 to 65 in ſome,
from 60 to 70 in others, from 70 to
80 in a third ſort, and all in the ſame
part of time, <hi>viz.</hi> a minute; 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that if he who has ſixty for his
natural pulſe, comes ever to beat
eighty, the motion of his blood muſt
certainly be more than naturally aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
that is, he has a Fever; ſince
that is only an immoderate velocity or
quickneſs of the motion of the blood,
accompany'd with heat. 'Tis no leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
when a pulſe that beats naturally
80 in a minute, comes down to 60,
that the perſon labours under ſome
cachectical Diſtemper, and a want of
ſpirits, except his pulſe be depreſs'd:
yet both theſe are the natural pulſes
of ſeveral people, beyond which 'tis
not convenient to go, and to which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105646:23"/>
their other pulſes are to be compar'd.
And therefore it would be neceſſary
to ſettle this affair, and to enquire
into the peculiar pulſes of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
that by them and other
concurring ſigns, we may be infallibly
guided, not only in Evacuations, but
other adminiſtrations in Medicin.
However, I ſhall forbear to proceed
in this Enquiry, ſince I have treated
deſignedly, and at large upon that
ſubject, in my <hi>O Economia Corporis Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis,</hi>
to which I refer thoſe that love
to be informed, and do hope to ſee
that matter more fully done, in ſome
practical Treatiſe of pulſes, with
which ſome generous Promoter of
uſeful Knowledge may one day ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the public.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing I would propoſe
as uſeful in this matter, is the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Thermometer; for ſince
the warmth of our blood, another
pathognomical ſign of a Fever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
depends upon its motion, as I
have often proved; if we can ſettle
the warmth that is proper to every
conſtitution, or proportion the warmth
to the certain numbers of pulſes in
the particular conſtitutions; we may,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105646:24"/>
by applying the Thermometer, not
only know how far the blood has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
its natural motion and warmth,
but even, in other caſes, how much
it has fallen from them too; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the only difficulty in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
this exceſs and diminution, may
conſiſt in the compariſon with that
warmth, which is peculiar to every
conſtitution and number of pulſes,
which has never been particularly
conſider'd, I will endeavour to lay
down my obſervations on this ſubject.
And firſt, the heat of a man's body,
whoſe pulſe is of the firſt ſort raiſes
the Oil in the Thermometer to about
16 or 16¾ degrees, the pulſe of the
ſecond to 17⅝ degrees, and that of
the third to about 20 or 21¼ degrees.
And therefore the differences of the
degrees will not only make up the
true warmth and different pulſes, but
comparing the warmths upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Fevers we can find how much
more it is than that which is natural,
and even the exceeding numbers of
pulſes, which will not only be of
infinite uſe for evacuating in Fevers
which we propoſe, but if we compare
the different and vaſt exceſſes of heat
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105646:24"/>
that may be in our body, will ſoon
be convinc'd, that the moſt violent
ſymptoms may proceed from them,
tho they ſeem never ſo oppoſite to
each other in the judgmen of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful:
and this ſtill the more eaſily, if
we obſerve how different the effects
ſeem to be, which proceed from the
various degrees of the Sun's heat; for
example, the Summer's heat in the air
raiſes the Oyl in the Thermometer
to 7 gr. ½, The heat of a man's skin
whoſe natural Pulſe is ſixty in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
to 16 ¾ gr., The heat of boiling
water, to 52 gr. The heat of red hot
Iron, to 156; wherefore according to
this calculation, our natural heat is
double the Summer's heat, and ſcalding
water is only ſomewhat above three
times hotter than our skin; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the heat of red hot Iron is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ten times greater than the heat
of our Skin; yet there are no ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
in a Fever ſo different, as theſe
which are produced by the heat
of our Skin, and that of red-hot Iron,
tho they only differ in degree. But
not to inſiſt further upon this uſe,
I may conclude that the true mark of
letting Blood, or evacuating in Fevers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105646:25"/>
is more truely regulated by theſe
ways, I have now hinted, which are
truly the <hi>Strength</hi> of the Patient, we
are all puzzled ſo much about, yet
never otherwiſe to be known; and
I hope I have explained them too as
fully, as my time and ſubject, and
my reſolution to avoid incroaching
too far upon the true doctrine of
Pulſes and Phlebotomy will allow:
and therefore I ſhall proceed to the
Cure of our ſickneſſes this year,
which is the main deſign of this
work.</p>

was ſo very ſtormy for 5 days, that
no Boats could go off from a Ship. On
the tenth, the Sea not being ſo great,
they ſent their Boat for me, and
when I came aboard, I found he had

deſir'd he might continue the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
preſcrib'd before, and the drink,
of which he ſhould not only drink as

order'd ſtrong bliſtering Plaiſters to
be apply'd; one to the nape of his
Neck, and one behind each Ear, to
be removed next morning, applying
to the ſore part the ſimple Melilot
Plaiſter: before I left the Ship, I ſaw
the Surgeon mix the Plaiſter, but
when he ſpread it upon the Leather,
'twas not bigger than a Filberd nut,
ſo I ſhap'd the Leather and ſpread
him large Plaiſters, leaving him to
apply them, and intended next day
to ſee the ſick perſon, but it blew ſo
very hard, that I had not opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to ſee him, till at our return to
the <hi>Downs,</hi> it proving eaſie weather,
I went on board that Ship, and tho
it was leaſt three days ſince I was
there before, the Plaiſters were not
remov'd: the two behind his ears
had riſen very well, but the largeſt
that was to be apply'd to the nape
of his Neck, being laid among the
hair, the skin lookt ſcalded, but
had never riſen. He had not even
then taken his Medicins as directed,
yet his pulſe was ſlower and great
enough, aud he was not quite ſo
delirious. I deſir'd the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105646:27"/>
to be more careful about the
uſe of the former Medicins, to ſhave
his Neck, and to apply there a great

took leave; but after we came into

as in that caſe, he vomited ſix

the preceding teſtaceous Powders for

               <p>He had eight ſtools with this, and
was very eaſy; in a day or two he
began to crawl about upon Deck, an
hour or two in the warmeſt time of
the day; but, coming up a little too
ſoon, he catch'd cold and relapſed on
the 24th, and was obliged to go over
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105646:29"/>
the former courſe, as near as his
weaker body would allow; but on
the 27th he turn'd very delirious, and
had a very quick Pulſe; he could not
ſleep and had an unſatiable drought.
I allowed him as much of the Barley-decoction
as he would drink, and
ordered his Meſs mate who attended
him, to give it him unaskt, if it was
a great while before he askt it. On
the 28th in the evening, I cauſed a
large and ſtrong Bliſter to be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the nape of his Neck and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
which roſe very well, and was
removed, applying a Plaiſter of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilot

mightily relieved by it, his Delirium

the ill conſequences of Opium, or

upon the Theory of this ſymptom, as

I could not think of any thing that

a double Linnen Cloth dipt in Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat
round his head, which I ordered
to be done with ſo great ſucceſs, that

                  <hi>'Tis plain from this deſcription,
that this Man was taken ill of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the ſymptoms of which I have

hard it may be, and maintain my

thoſe who are giddy or vertiginous,

truly this Phaenomenon, tho it may

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105646:31"/>
the good fortune to be ſufficiently

three, I may venture to ſay, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ſo many thouſand Authors who
have written Medicinal Treatiſes there
is not one that has ſpoken common
ſenſe upon this ſubject; we may hear
what a late learned Author, who is
thought to ſpeak the fulleſt and moſt
ſatisfactorily, ſays;</hi> that the immediate
ſubject of this diſeaſe are the animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
the more mediate thoſe parts of the
Brain, where imagination and common
ſenſe reſide, and from whence the neareſt
way is into the Nervous kind, which are
the callous and ſtrious Bodies; for in
theſe parts they love to range and divert
themſelves as in a ſpacious field, and paſs
thro all the pores and thickeſt paſſages of
the Marrow, with full force like a ray
of light: hence it is that, while they glide
along in the ſame Line, from the utmoſt
borders of the Callous Body towards its
middle part, they repreſent pleaſant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
and imaginations; and whilst
they ſlow, in another line, (perhaps thro
other paſſages, from the middle of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Body into the <hi>gyri</hi> of the Brain) they
transfer thither the marks of Notions to be
laid up for our future remembrance; and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105646:31"/>
whilst they paſs into the Strious Bodies,
and the beginning of the Nerves, they
actuate all the moving parts, and carry

the motions they are to perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>But in the Vertigo theſe equal emanations
of the Spirits ſeem to be intercepted, and

               <p>Here is a moſt poetical flaſh of a
deſcription, but how true, every one
muſt ſee, that will give himſelf the
trouble to remember the Anatomy
of the Brain, and ſince its make will
not at all allow of ſuch a roving and
ſporting expanſion, or ſo melancholy
a circumgyration or turning round,
we muſt ſeek its cauſe ſome where
elſe, and yet this ſenſe is not afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us from the object it ſelf, which
we ſuppoſe to be, and often is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,
and therefore, ſince this
ſenſe is not cauſed by a turning round
of the Animal Spirits, nor by the
object that is thought to turn round,
it can be no where elſe than in the

from the left to the right; for the

the object be moved while the
Eye is quiet, or the object be quiet
while the Eye is moved, the rays
that come from the object, will not
fall upon the ſame part of the bottom
of the Eye; and therefore ſince we
judge of the change of place where
the object exiſts, by the change of
place upon which the object is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd,
'tis plain that the object which
has no motion will ſeem to move,
and may be thought to turn round to
the Eyes that are moved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moreover,
the object and Eye may be both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105646:32"/>
for if the optick nerve be
only moved, the rays will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
fall upon it in the ſame ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and therefore ſince a direct and
oblique falling do not affect the
Nerves alike, but excite different
ſorts of motions; then, the object
that is quiet will ſeem to have
chang'd its place, when only the optick
nerve is mov'd, the repreſentation of
the place where it was being changed.
And therefore 'tis evident that any
thing that can move the <hi>Eye, Optick
nerve,</hi> or <hi>Retina</hi> may cauſe this <hi>Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs,</hi>
tho the object be not moved.
Now there are a thouſand things that
may produce this effect, but nothing
can more readily preſs upon the Brain
than the diſtended arteries that are
next the optick nerve; and ſince we
have ſeen how the fulneſs of all the
veſſels is occaſioned by an interruption
of perſpiration, the cauſe of our Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
there can be no further doubt,
but that this fulneſs may occaſion the
<hi>Retina</hi>'s being remov'd from its place,
together with the optick nerve, ſo
that it cannot receive the rays from
the objects at the ſame part of the
bottom of the Eye; and conſequently
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105646:33"/>
while the Images change their place
in the <hi>Retina,</hi> the objects are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

at night the Linnen wet as before

next morning was hunger, which

ſixty in a minute, complain'd

in his Bones, his Pulſe beat ſix and
forty in a minute, he was coſtive,

as his pains went off, the warmth

higher, that once when I felt it I
reckon'd eighty ſtrokes in one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute;
he was very dry, and could

               <p>On the 27th of <hi>July</hi> he was let xiv

which, being well aſſiſted with

On the 29th he began the teſtaceous

this obſervation in opening the Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
which they have acknowledg'd
to have practic'd often with the like
ſucceſs; but there being one thing
that happen'd to Mr <hi>Chapman,</hi> who is
a careful and an expert Surgeon, eaſie
to follow an advice when reaſonably
given: I ſay one thing very ſingular
happen'd to him and me, in the caſe
of a man who had been treated after
the ſame way while I was on board
the <hi>London;</hi> yet in warmer weather
he was very delirious; Mr <hi>Chapman</hi>
went to let him blood in the Jugular
in the morning, but the Vein would
not riſe: he try'd to bleed him in
the Arm, but with the like ſucceſs;
he immediately ſends for me, I felt
his pulſe, which was very depreſs'd,
and beat not above 30 times in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
and while I look'd upon his
failing ſenſes, and dim eyes, and
feeling it again, it beat but 27.
Things being at ſuch a paſs, I order'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105646:42"/>
two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cupping glaſſes to be apply'd,
with Scarification, which was done;
but he ſcarify'd very deep before the
blood appear'd; yet getting about
ſix ounces out of the lower part of
his Neck, the pulſe immediately
grew quicker; and in two hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he let him eight ounces of blood
out of his Arm with a very eaſie Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature;
by which, and other things,
as given before, he recovered. This
is a very unuſual accident, and not to
be accounted for, but by a thorough

yet the inſtruments we uſe in
voiding this quantity by ſweat, being
ſo uncertain, that either not having
the expected effect, they make the

Their paroxyſms made not
their approach with a ſhaking and

following; but the ſick perſon was
affected in that very way, as if he

which, nevertheleſs was nothing elſe
but the Fever it ſelf attacking his
head. However, it imitated that
diſeaſe, as was moſt evident by a
great many ſigns, but more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
by the colour of the Urine,
which, in Agues, is commonly of
a deep red, ſuch as that is in thoſe

not quite ſo red, and likewiſe breaks
into a ſediment almoſt like Brickduſt.

in this place; yet to make the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of cure to be better underſtood,
'twill be neceſſary to ſay ſomething,
in the general, of its production:
and therefore, let us only conſider
what we obſerve upon this and the
like occaſions; we have here a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and univerſal deprivation of ſenſe
and motion, except thoſe already
mentioned in the foregoing Hiſtory;
ſo that whatſoever is capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
this univerſal and ſudden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,
is the immediate cauſe of
this Diſeaſe. Again, let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that when I prov'd in my <hi>O Econ.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105646:56"/>
Anim.</hi> that there was a liquor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
through the Nerves which we
might call Animal Spirits, I did it
upon an experiment of a part's loſing
its ſenſe and motion by making a
ligature upon the nerve with which
that part is provided; and now ſince
we ſee that a member, or a particular
muſcle may loſe their ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by making ligatures upon their
Nerves; if ſo many ligatures or
ſomething that produces the ſame
effect, be ſuppos'd to affect every
Nerve and ail its parts, or all the
Nerves in their Original, which may
be more eaſily done, 'twill not be
difficult to apprehend this univerſal
and ſudden deprivation of ſenſe and
motion, which is requir'd.</p>
               <p>Now any thing that may depreſs
the ſmall and tender Nerves in their
riſe, in the Brain, and <hi>Medulla oblon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata,</hi>
will hinder this derivation of
animal ſpirits thro the Nerves and
cauſe an Apoplexy; whether the
ſides of the Arteries be ſtuff'd with
too much blood (thro its viſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

too great quantity, or its being too
much rarefied) bending outward
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105646:56"/>
with greater force than theſe Nerves
have reſiſtance; or whether theſe
Nerves are thus depreſt, by any of
the veſſels of the Brain being broken,
and their liquors driven thro all the
brain by the force that propell'd
thoſe liquors; extraneous bodies
bred in the brain, a depreſſion of the
skull, which compreſſes theſe veſſels,
and the whole ſubſtance of the brain;
all which may produce the required
effect.</p>
               <p>Now if the compreſſion be of
ſuch a kind that either few animal
ſpirits are derived, or none at all;
if the laſt, the conſequence is <hi>death,</hi>
becauſe of the abſolute and perfect
want of thoſe ſpirits that diſtribute
ſenſe over all the body, and motion
to all its veſſels and liquors: but
when theſe ſpirits are conveyed in
a very ſmall quantity, they go
with no unequal force into all the
muſcles, and conſequently they
effect equally, as to our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the whole muſcles; and
becauſe the muſcles of the whole
body are counterpoiſed by their
Antagoniſtical Muſcles, except the
Heart which has no Antagoniſtical
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105646:57"/>
Muſcle, and they being equally
affected with this ſmall quan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ity
of animal ſpirits, their powers will
be equal, and all detain'd in <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librio,</hi>
except the Heart whoſe
faint motion, from ſo few ſpirits,
does continue; and the pulſe too,
which depends upon the motion
of the Heart. Now from this
Theory 'twere eaſy to eſtabliſh the
Cure, according to the different
ways of the production of this
Diſeaſe; as that an Apoplexy from
extravaſated liquors or extraneous
bodies bred in the brain is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
becauſe we know of no
way to bring back theſe liquors
into their veſſels, or to deſtroy
theſe growing and compreſſing
bodies in the brain: and that that
from a depreſſion of the skull
requires the raiſing of the skull,
and a practice according to the
hurt the brain has receiv'd by this
depreſſion. But the Cure of that
which is occaſioned by the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
of the blood in the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Brain, and <hi>Medulla
Oblongata,</hi> can only be perform'd
by ſuch means as may put this
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105646:57"/>
blood into motion, and empty
thoſe veſſels from the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
quantities; upon which views,
ſtraight come into our mind all
ſorts of Evacuations, as <hi>Bleeding,
Vomiting, Purges, Clyſters, Sweating
Medicins, &amp;c.</hi> then ſuch Medicins
as cauſe <hi>pain,</hi> which occaſions the
veſſels and muſcles to be more
violently contracted, that ſo the
ſtuffing liquors may be the more
eaſily caſt off. Now, tho Authors
do mightily depend upon ſuch
evacuating Medicins for curing the
paroxyſm of an Apoplexy, yet it
were eaſy to demonſtrate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfulneſs
of that practiſe, by
proving how ſuch Medicins can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
affect the body in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
and therefore can afford
but a very weak help; but this
not being my deſign, I will only
put 'em in mind of an inſtance of
daily experience, and defer other
Arguments to a more proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion;
and that is, if we give
a very ſtrong Vomit to any one
in a Quartan Ague when the cold
fit is begun, we find it never has
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105646:58"/>
its effect till the cold fit, which
may laſt three or four hours, is over;
the vomitive parts of any medicin
not being capable to affect the Blood
or animal Spirits, in this viſcid ſtate
of the Blood, or when it has a ſlower
motion in the cold fit of an Ague,
ſo as to produce their natural and
conſtant effect; yet ſo ſoon as that
is over, we find that, in a reaſonable
time, this ſmall quantity of a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin
that has been in reſerve, for
ſome hours, in a place, that uſes to
digeſt our moſt ſolid food, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
its healthful juices into the blood
for our ſuſtenance in leſs time, at
length, and then only begins to move
us; and ſince this is the conſtant fate
of vomits taken in ſuch circumſtances,
'twill be very plain to thoſe that can
ſee into the reaſon of this obvious
obſervation, what we are to expect
from this medicin in the fit of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexy,
where all feeling and ſenſe
ſeem to be at a final period, the
equable and exact motion of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
interrupted, the <hi>Pitcher broken
at the Fountain,</hi> and the ſpring
and origin of motion taken off:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105646:58"/>
And if all this happens to vomits,
the medicins, that of all others
have the moſt violent effects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, what muſt the weaker helps
of the other medicins be thought
to perform? juſt nothing; and if
we can cram them into him, 'tis
only to plague him after he has
recovered without our help. Now,
if this is all that internal medicins
can do, even when we are to
uſe violence upon our Patients to
make 'em receive them; we muſt
certainly depend upon external o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
for any ſervice we can
expect to do, as anointings,
which can do leaſt, ſmelling at
things that may affect our Senſes
and create pain, which may do
more; but if we can hinder a
greater afflux of Blood to that
which already ſtagnates, and even
take off ſome of the ſtagnating
power, we may reaſonably hope
that the Heart may recover ſuch
force, as may propel the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
Liquors in the Brain, and
Medulla Oblongata, or that we
may relieve our Patients with a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105646:59"/>
great deal of certainty and in
a ſhort time, and to put

And this may be done by
ſuch ways of bleeding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the blood being determined
more to one part than another,
more to the place where there
is no cauſe for obſtruction, than
to one where it already is,
there may be ſome of the obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
force taken off, or it may
be done by <hi>Revulſion</hi> and <hi>Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

reaſon was never to be aſſigned,
but by ſuppoſing <hi>Harvey</hi>'s moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Theorem, the <hi>Circulation of
the blood,</hi> Whatever; contrary
uſe ſome of our Modern Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
have pleas'd to make of it,
without any reaſon. For, if the
Blood's motion is quicker by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and in that Veſſel where
the wound is made, than it
is in any other Veſſel of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105646:59"/>
the oppoſite ſide, and that
has no communion with this,
or even in the ſame Veſſel;
before the bleeding; 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that there will a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
quantity of blood flow thro
that Veſſel than there does in
its oppoſite Veſſel in the ſame
ſpace of time, or did throw
it ſelf before the Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſection;
and that if this emiſſary is made
upon a Vein that is continued with
an obſtructed Artery, this new out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
of the Blood will take off ſome
hundreds of degrees of reſiſtance
that it had from the blood contained
in its Channel; or by the different
ways of bleeding there will be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion</hi>
and <hi>Derivation</hi> as was to be
proved. Now the blood's motion
muſt be quicker, becauſe the powers
that propel the blood, or rather the
blood it ſelf, does not communicate,
or does not loſe, by a great deal, ſo
much of its force, when it moves
thorough a Veſſel, or its proceſſes
even to the Heart, as where there is
an emiſſary made, where there is
none. This is moſt evident upon
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105646:60"/>
this account, becauſe the parts of
blood that are next to the Heart pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
the parts that are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
loſe a thouſand times more
of their motion when they propel
the blood thorough a whole Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
than when the Veſſel has a large
emiſſary made upon it, the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betwixt the column of blood
as it runs in a continued courſe (the
parts of blood being contiguous
one to another in their motion from
the left Ventricle of the Heart, till
they return into the right) and as it
runs thorough an emiſſary into the
air being as 1 to 1000, or by ſome
calculations as 1 to 1200 or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.
But not to inſiſt upon this,
and that ſome who are accuſtomed
to more nice calculations, may be
capable to conceive the truth of this
propoſition we advance; let them
but call into their thoughts what
happens conſtantly in bleeding;
where we may ſee run out of one
Vein ſome ten or twelve ounces of
blood in little more than a minute,
and ſhewing ſuch quantities over all
the body, then conſidering the Maſs
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105646:60"/>
and bigneſs of the Veſſels, and ſo
he'll find this exceſſive velocity is
either to be allowed, or elſe his
quantity of Blood muſt grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
upon him, and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
beyond a reaſonable allowance.
And now it being clear, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Doctrin of Revulſion</hi> and <hi>Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
is to be accounted for by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the Circulation of the Blood,
but even that they who believe that
this Doctrin is contrary to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,

I will add no more Obſervations
of this Nature, but rather divert
our ſelves a little with ſome Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
about its Antiquity, which, in

Hiſtory, but more eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Comodians. Tho' this has
ſeem'd to be very obſcure, and we
are contented to refer its Original
to the Siege of <hi>Naples;</hi> yet to lay

I will only alledge that an Account
of may eaſily be found in the Holy
Scriptures themſelves, and by the
way of expreſſing it there; this

ſeems to be as Ancient as the time of

The firſt method in any Cough, that

Fevers and Sickneſſes of that ſort;
and as the third is preſcrib'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a deſign, ſo it never produces
any good effect, but prolongs the
Diſeaſe, ſo that if it does not go
off in ſpite of the Med'cins, it ends
in a decay. But whoever will give
himſelf the trouble to remember the
time wherein we are moſt apt to
catch cold, may eaſily diſcern that it
is the too great <hi>lightneſs</hi> of the Air
that occaſions the ſlower motion of
the Blood, which is the immediate
cauſe of this Diſtemper; for the
Blood being more ſlowly mov'd,
does eſpecially produce that larger
diſcharge of <hi>Lympha</hi> in the Salival

ſeparated in a great abundance
about the Mouth, Throat, or in the

the Lungs, does very often by
its own weight provoke the Lungs
into that action we know by the
Name of Cough; tho' this be not

that this large diſcharge of <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phae,</hi>

that this greater quantity is to
be leſſen'd, and the Blood's motion
heighten'd by ways that are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to one another, which may
be done by the foregoing method,
tho' the reaſon is to be deduc'd in a

The Hiſtory of theſe Symptoms,
plainly declares what this Diſeaſe
is, that it is a Dropſie, and of that
ſort they call an <hi>Anaſarca</hi> or <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophlegmatia:</hi>
The ancient Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
thinking that it was entirely
Phlegm ſubſiſting ſome way between
the Muſcles that gave this white or
pale colour, and made the Fleſh
capable to retain the print of any
thing, that was preſs'd upon it,
for ſome time. 'Tis certainly a
very great weakneſs of the whole
maſs of Blood, ev'n ſo great, that
it ſeems the Heart is not ſupplied
with a ſufficient quantity of Spirits
to propel the maſs of Blood, and
to accommodate the thing to their
way of ſpeaking, ſeems to be full
of Phlegm; but we muſt believe,
that when the Sickneſs goes no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than an <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> there is no
breach of the Veſſels, none of this
ſtuff lodg'd between the interſtices
of the Muſcles; becauſe it would
produce quite other effects than
we ſee. This weakneſs may be
procur'd many ways, either becauſe
the Spirits are mightily exhauſted
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> too great evacuations, made by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105646:75"/>
our ſelves or ſuch as may be cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
or critical, or becauſe there are
not ſufficient quantities of Spirits
made, through an ill way of living,
or the Blood may ev'n be made ſo
thick by ſome uſual evacuations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuppreſs'd, that this defect of
Spirits may be very ſenſible. In all
theſe Circumſtances, this weakned
Blood not having that quantity of
motion, I have prov'd neceſſary
for making the Perſpiration; the
ſteems that are daily voided that
way in a great abundance being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in a great meaſure, and
heightning the bulk of this ſordid
maſs of Blood that was not eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd,
muſt needs loſe of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by this daily addition, and
ſubſiſt in the ſmaller and more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary
Veſſels, eſpecially in extream
parts of the Body, and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
to this addition, the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſwelling will be.</p>
               <p>Now, for the Cure of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
the want of Spirits we muſt
endeavour to ſupply, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the viſcidity and toughneſs of
of the Blood: Upon theſe deſigns,
Authors have advis'd ſweating
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105646:75"/>
Med'cins, which ſeldom have their
effect in this Diſeaſe; and I muſt
believe very hurtful, if they had,
by carrying off ſome of the more
ſpirituous parts of the Blood; and
'tis certain that when this Diſeaſe
ſucceeds any immoderate evacuations
that the fam'd purgatives are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
as letting of Blood: tho'
when it comes from a ſuppreſſion of
ſome uſual evacuations, purgatives
conveniently uſed may be of great
advantage: Yet Vomits for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

Ship's Beer or rather in <hi>Flip</hi> or <hi>Punch,</hi>
it becomes a moſt wholeſome and

and way of living. For this is it that
theſe <hi>dry Drams</hi> drank at Sea or a

and Membranous parts of our
Body, by which our Stomachs is
made leſs ſenſible of hunger, and
uncapable of performing its office in
digeſting our Victuals, our Veins,
Arteries and Nerves are dried up, ſo
that they are not ſo eaſily contracted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105646:78"/>
and bent outwards, which of it ſelf
creates old Age, and a thouſand other
inconveniences: Theſe <hi>dry Drams</hi>
with their looſe <hi>Spirit,</hi> that's ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put in motion where ever it is,
diſperſes and deſtroys the native and
benign Spirits of our Blood, and ſo
diſpoſes it to a leſſer motion. But
not to inſiſt upon the infinite misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
that attend theſe <hi>dried</hi> and <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
Veſſels,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Arteries;</hi>
how by their not being Contracted
and Diſtended, the Blood may want
ſome conſiderable determinations in
its Motion, the ſecretions over all
the Body may be diminiſhed, and
the Liquors ſeparated even not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
through their proper ducts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their proper Receptacles or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into the Air; but I ſay, not to
inſiſt upon theſe inconveniences,
which are ſo conſiderable, that upon
them only depends the well being,
nay indeed the <hi>being</hi> at all of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
yet if the Veſſels be thus hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

&amp;c. they are not at all fitted either
to the Motions we are to perform,
or the greater or leſſer quantity of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105646:78"/>
the Blood; for the Blood muſt either
never be rarefied or poſſeſs greater
ſpace, or we never change our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
elſe theſe Veſſels muſt break;
becauſe, when the Veſſels are ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and proceeding, as we may
conceive them, in different ſhapes
from the Heart through the whole
Body, they cannot remain whole
and entire, except they keep the
ſame Poſture; but that cannot be,
if the parts thorough which they run
change their Poſture, and this is
chang'd in every one of their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the ſame may be alledg'd of the
Blood's taking up more ſpace in its
augmentation. But in this hardning
of theſe Veſſels we cannot apprehend
them to be rigid Bodies, perfectly
ſtiff, and ſo not to break as matter
in that circumſtance; yet being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and not ſo pliable as muſculous
Membranes or parts made up of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres

no wonder if conſiderable quantities
of Serum are thus diſcharged into

or on the Brain it ſelf, as it may

me but little hopes of any advantage

authority of that great Phyſician
makes always this appearance moſt
ominous; for, that the Urin may
be intercepted by the Ileum, this
Gut muſt be ſo ſwoln as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs

we cannot be poſitively ſure of the

does not at all proceed from any

from ſome naſty, ſharp ſtuff
lodg'd in the ſtomach, by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
things that may be antecedent
cauſes to it, which being affixt to

and by the greater ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this matter affecting the
upper part of the ſtomach, and
the pylorus makes this violent vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
and purging. This matter
brought upwards, is thought of ſome
to be ſincere bile, contrary to all
reaſon or any thought of how
it ought to be ſupplied: Indeed,
the ſmall quantity of bile, that is
preſt out of the Gall bladder, and
brought into the ſtomach by this
reverſe motion, is very capable to
colour a great deal of <hi>Lympha</hi> that's
ſqueez'd out of the <hi>glands</hi> of the

and to affect it with its bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs,
without bringing us into
a needleſs neceſſity of ſuppoſing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105646:81"/>
this impoſſible ſupply of Bile. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the other ſide, there are ſome
who ſeeing how cloſely the <hi>Pylorus</hi>
is ſhut, in the caſe of vomiting,
will not allow that any Bile can at
all be convey'd into the ſtomach,
from the Gall-bladder; and would
rather have all this quantity to be
given from ſome ſmall glands we
may ſometimes diſcover in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and which contain a yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
liquor, not very bitter, and of
no quantity. But not only the
greater quantity we ſee voided here,
and ſometimes three or four Mouth
fuls of pure gall, brought up in the
end of an artificial Vomit, convince
us clearly that theſe are not the
fountains, and ſource of ſo great a
proviſion, whereſoever it is to be
brought from: But it were eaſie
to make it very plain, how the Gall
is convey'd into the ſtomach, if this
were the proper place; and I will
only remember them of ſomething
of greater bulk that uſes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd,
without diſpute, from the
Guts, in an Iliack paſſion.</p>
               <p>Now, ſince the whole cauſe of
this Diſeaſe, is entirely lodg'd and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105646:82"/>
confin'd to the Stomach, and he had
ſtrength enough left to proceed in
the ſureſt method; I reſolv'd to
promote the evacuation with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was no Vomit of it ſelf,
but that waſhing away the ſharp
ſtuff lodg'd in the Stomach, it
might be carried off by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
courſe of vomiting; and
when this ſtore was exhauſted, the
Cure might reaſonably be expected
to ſucceed; and therefore I advis'd
him to drink large draughts of
Ship's-beer made blood warm, which
he did to ſo great an advantage,
that he had not drank and vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

moſt pleaſant and diverting, to ſee
what abſurdities, theſe patrons of
an unreaſonable ferment ſuppos'd
to be lodg'd in a certain and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
part, are brought into; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Chimerical Exiſtence of this
Notion evidently made out in the
mention'd Book, they are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oblig'd to maintain a ferment to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105646:87"/>
every one of theſe ferments
<hi>in Infinitum</hi> in every one of theſe
Solutions; or elſe to fix upon ſome
ſingle one that was implanted in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of theſe Parts, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and at the firſt minute of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
which nevertheleſs muſt be
diminiſh'd in part, by its action up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe Liquors it diſſolves, melts
down and precipitates; and yet it
muſt never be intirely waſted; and
if it is intirely exhauſted, there
can no way be aſſign'd how it is
to be recruited and rapair'd; but
even, if we be ſick by any of theſe
<hi>Ferments</hi> falling from their natural
ſtate, they are never to be <hi>repair'd</hi>
by the force of any <hi>remedy,</hi> except
it be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the Blood,
<hi>without</hi> the help of any <hi>ferment,</hi>
for if no ſolution can be in the
Blood, without the help of a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
neither will any ſpecifick
Med'cin give its force to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
Ferment; becauſe it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
that the ſpecifick Med'cin of
every one of theſe Ferments be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
into their Cells, and that
this may be done, it muſt be mixt
with the Blood, and ſeparated from
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105646:87"/>
the Blood into theſe different Cells,
and ſo be mixt with the languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ferment; but, by the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
there can be no ſecretion,
without a Ferment, and, becauſe
the Ferment is decay'd, waſted
or ſpent; therefore this ſpecifick
remedy for recovering this Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cannot be ſeparated from
the Blood and mixt with it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the languiſhing Ferment can
never be repair'd by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſpecifick
Med'cin that is tranſmitted to the
Blood.</p>
               <p>And if it be true, that our Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
by the taking of ſuch Med'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins
do recover their Health, we
may conclude from hence, that
ſuch peculiar and ſpecifick Ferments
are meer Chimera's, and have no
real being, and that the cauſe of
the Diſeaſe was not thro' the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of any decay'd Ferment; ſince
the ſick Perſon does recover his
Health, without the Med'cins that
they ſuppos'd to be the recruiter
of the languiſhing Ferment, arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Ferment it ſelf; and
therefore the concluſion is evident,
that there are Secretions without a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105646:88"/>
Ferment, and that peculiar Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are no leſs confidently than
weakly eſtabliſh'd by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons.
I might have eaſily paſs'd
by this, in perfect ſilence, but that
this ſuppoſition of a Ferment is
ſuch among the Chymiſts, and of
that conſequence, that they make
the whole Art of Phyſick turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; and yet 'tis plain to any
one how great difficulties they
put themſelves upon, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and ſuppoſe theſe ſpecifick or
peculiar Ferments; and with how
weak and uncertain a Foundation
he's contented with, who ſets up
with a dependance upon this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of Ferments.</p>
               <p>The more I reflect upon the way
of making Secretions from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Velocities of the Blood, as it is
found aſſerted in my <hi>Oecon. Animal.</hi>
I do not only think it infinitely to
be prefer'd before this precarious
way by ſpecifick ferments, but ev'n
before any other hitherto alledged,
as I have prov'd at great length:
But it ſeems the moſt natural in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
Phaenomena of the Secreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and the more ſo, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105646:88"/>
that it is ſufficient and only neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that the make of a Glandul is
ſuch, that the parts of any Liquor
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lows mixt, but looſe, into its
Cavity may be deriv'd into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
duct; not entirely and in
the confus'd maſs, but ſuch and ſuch
parts only as come nearer to their
ſeparation, by conſequence of the
different velocities the Liquor has in
its departure from the Heart: And
we muſt ſtill more readily aſſent to
this, that we bring into our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the common accidents that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to Blood every Day, by Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy.
The red part of the Blood
that ſeem'd to fill up all the Porren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in time of the Operation, does
as 'twere contract it ſelf by degrees
towards the centre, and removes
peace-meal tho' ſenſibly from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
and the growing ſpace which it
leaves a'top, is fill'd with a clear Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
that congeals upon the Fire,
and we commonly call the <hi>Serum</hi> of
the <hi>Blood.</hi> All this while, the redder
part of the Blood which thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
it ſelf in the centre of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
becomes <hi>Hard</hi> or grows toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and if we hold our Noſe and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105646:89"/>
opened Mouth over theſe Liquors,
they ſend up ſuch ſteams that affect
our ſmelling very ungratefully, and
create in us a very unpleaſant and
nauſeous Taſte. We ſee here what
ſecretions are perform'd, without
a Ferment? And that That which
affects our Tongue, and Noſtrils,
riſes out of the ſame very Veſſel,
and offends both theſe ſenſes with
its ungrateful touch; yet this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
(which by the bye cannot be
thought Homogeneous) is ſeparated
from the other Liquors, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

was contain'd in the Blood, and if
it had been brought into a Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dul,
fit to receive this inviſible
ſteam, it might have been as eaſily
ſeperated in this Glandul without
a Ferment, as we ſee it is ſeparated
in the Veſſel. And ſo we might
reaſon about the other parts. But
if we conceive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
