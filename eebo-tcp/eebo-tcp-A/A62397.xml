         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>But the Doctors of this <hi>ſupernatural doctrine,</hi> ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <hi>That the Witch doth all theſe things by vertue of her Charms;</hi> ſometimes, <hi>that a Spiritual;</hi> ſometimes, <hi>that a Corporal Devil doth accompliſh it;</hi> ſometimes they ſay, <hi>that the Devil doth but make the Witch believe ſhe doth that which he himſelf hath wrought;</hi> ſometimes, <hi>that the Devil ſeemeth to do that by compulſion, which he doth moſt willingly:</hi> Finally, the Writers hereupon are ſo eloquent, and full of variety, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they write, <hi>that the Devil doth all this by God's permiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only;</hi> ſometimes, <hi>by his licence;</hi> ſometimes, <hi>by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> ſo as (in <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>truth</hi>) not the <hi>Devil,</hi> but the <hi>high and mighty King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of hoſts,</hi> even <hi>God himſelf,</hi> ſhould this way be made <hi>obedient</hi> and <hi>ſervile</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>commandement</hi> of a malicious old <hi>Witch,</hi> and <hi>miraculouſly</hi> to anſwer her <hi>appetite,</hi> as well in every <hi>trifling vanity,</hi> as in <hi>moſt horrible executions;</hi> as the <hi>revenger</hi> of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting old womans imagined <hi>wrongs,</hi> to the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of many <hi>innocent children,</hi> and as a <hi>ſupporter</hi> of her <hi>paſsions,</hi> to the <hi>undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of many a <hi>poor ſoul.</hi> And I ſee not, but a <hi>Witch</hi> may as well <hi>inchant</hi> when ſhe <hi>will,</hi> as a <hi>lyer</hi> may <hi>lye</hi> whey he <hi>liſt;</hi> and ſo ſhould we poſſeſs nothing, but by a Witches <hi>licence</hi> and <hi>permiſsion.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving found out two ſuch <hi>civil Magiſtrates,</hi> as for <hi>direction</hi> of <hi>judgment,</hi> and for <hi>ordering matters</hi> concerning <hi>Juſtice</hi> in this <hi>Commonwealth</hi> (in my poor opinion) are very <hi>ſingular perſons,</hi> who (I hope) will accept of my good will, and examine my <hi>book</hi> by their <hi>experience,</hi> as unto whom the matter therein contained doth greatly appertain: I have now again conſidered of two other <hi>points;</hi> namely, <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> whereupon the <hi>ground-work</hi> of my book is laid. Wherein although I know them to be very ſufficiently <hi>informed,</hi> yet doth not the <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>cenſure</hi> of thoſe cauſes ſo properly appertain to them as unto you, whoſe <hi>fame</hi> therein hath gotten <hi>preeminence</hi> above all others that I know of your callings: and in that reſpect I am bold to <hi>joyn</hi> you with them, being all good <hi>neighbours</hi> together in this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and loving <hi>friends</hi> unto me. I do not preſent this unto you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>meet</hi> for you; but for that you are <hi>meet</hi> for it (I mean) to <hi>judge</hi> upon it, to <hi>defend</hi> it, and if need be to <hi>correct</hi> it; knowing that you have learned of that grave Councellor <hi>Cato, Not to ſhame or diſcountenance any body.</hi> For if I thought you as <hi>ready,</hi> as <hi>able,</hi> to diſcharge me from mine inſufficiency; I ſhould not have been <hi>haſty</hi> (knowing your learning) to have written unto you: but if I ſhould be <hi>abaſhed</hi> to write to you, I ſhould ſhew my ſelf <hi>ignorant</hi> of your <hi>courteſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know mine own <hi>weakneſs,</hi> which if it have been able to maintain this <hi>argument,</hi> the <hi>cauſe</hi> is the ſtronger. Eloquent words may pleaſe the ears, but ſufficient matter perſwadeth the heart. So as if I exhibit wholeſome <hi>drink</hi> (though it be ſmall) in a <hi>terrene diſh</hi> with a <hi>faithful hand,</hi> I hope it will be as well <hi>accepted,</hi> as <hi>ſtrong wine</hi> offered in a <hi>ſilver bowl</hi> with a <hi>flattering heart.</hi> And ſurely it is a point of great <hi>liberality</hi> to receive a ſmall thing <hi>thankfully,</hi> as to <hi>give</hi> and <hi>diſtribute</hi> great and coſtly gifts <hi>bountifully:</hi> for there is more ſupplyed with <hi>courteous anſwers</hi> than with <hi>rich rewards.</hi> The tyrant <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was not ſo hated for his <hi>tyranny,</hi> as for his <hi>churliſh</hi> and <hi>ſtrange behaviour.</hi> Among the poor <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſacrifices, God was <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with the <hi>tenth part</hi> of an <hi>Ephah</hi> of flour, ſo as it were <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> Chriſt liked well of the poor <hi>widows mite.

                  </p>
                  <p>Some be ſuch <hi>dogs</hi> as they will <hi>barke</hi> at my <hi>writings,</hi> whether I <hi>maintain</hi> or <hi>refute</hi> this argument: as <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſnarled both at the <hi>Rhodians</hi> and at the <hi>Lacedaemonians:</hi> at the one, becauſe they were <hi>brave;</hi> at the other, becauſe they were <hi>not brave.

                  <p>But now to the matter. My queſtion is not (as many fondly ſuppoſe) <hi>Whether there be Witches, or nay?</hi> but, <hi>Whether they can do ſuch miraculous works as are imputed unto them?</hi> Good Maſter Dean, is it poſſible for a man to <hi>break his faſt</hi> with you at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and to <hi>dine</hi> that day at <hi>Durham</hi> with Maſter Doctor <hi>Matthew;</hi> or can your enemy <hi>maime</hi> you, when the <hi>Ocean Sea</hi> is betwixt you? What real <hi>community</hi> is betwixt a <hi>ſpirit</hi> and a <hi>body?</hi> May a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> body become <hi>temporal</hi> at his pleaſure? Or may a <hi>carnal</hi> body become <hi>inviſible?</hi> Is it likely that the <hi>lives</hi> of all <hi>Princes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> ſhould depend upon the <hi>will,</hi> or rather the <hi>wiſh</hi> of a poor mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb facs="tcp:53058:7"/>
                     <hi>doting old fool;</hi> and that power exempted from the wiſe, the rich, the learned, the godly? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Finally, is it poſſible for a <hi>man</hi> or <hi>woman</hi> to do any of thoſe miracles expreſſed in my book, and ſo conſtantly <hi>reported</hi> by great Clerks? If you ſay, No; then am I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. If you ſay, that God <hi>abſolutely,</hi> or by <hi>means</hi> can accompliſh all <hi>thoſe,</hi> and <hi>many more,</hi> I go with you. But <hi>Witches</hi> may well ſay they can do theſe things, howbeit they cannot ſhew how they do <hi>them.</hi> If I for my part ſhould ſay I could do thoſe things, my very <hi>adverſaries</hi> would ſay that I <hi>lyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O Maſter <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> is it not pitty, that that which is ſaid to be done with the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power</hi> of the moſt high God, and by our <hi>Saviour</hi> his only Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, ſhould be referred to a baggage old Womans <hi>nod</hi> or <hi>wiſh?</hi> &amp;c. Good Sir, is it not one manifeſt kind of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for them that <hi>labour</hi> and are <hi>laden</hi> to come unto <hi>Witches</hi> to be <hi>refreſhed?</hi> If <hi>Witches</hi> could <hi>help</hi> whom they are ſaid to have made <hi>ſick,</hi> I ſee no reaſon, but <hi>remedy</hi> might as well be required at their <hi>hands,</hi> as a <hi>purſe</hi> demanded of him that hath <hi>ſtolen</hi> it. But truly it is manifold <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to ask that of a <hi>creature,</hi> which none can give but the <hi>Creator.</hi> The <hi>Papiſt</hi> hath ſome colour of Scripture to maintain his <hi>Idol</hi> of <hi>Bread;</hi> but no <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> diſtinction can cover the <hi>Witchmongers</hi> idolatry in this behalf. Alas, I am ſorry and aſhamed to ſee how many <hi>die,</hi> that being ſaid to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched,</hi> only ſeek for <hi>Magical cures,</hi> whom <hi>wholeſome diet,</hi> and <hi>good medicines</hi> would have recovered. I dare aſſure you both, that there would be none of theſe <hi>coſening</hi> kind of <hi>Witches,</hi> did not <hi>Witchmongers</hi> maintain them, follow them, and believe in them and their Oracles; whereby indeed all <hi>good learning</hi> and <hi>honeſt arts,</hi> are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown: For theſe that moſt <hi>advance</hi> their power, and <hi>maintain</hi> the skill of theſe <hi>Witches,</hi> underſtand no part thereof; and yet being many times <hi>wiſe</hi> in other matters, are made <hi>fools</hi> by the moſt <hi>fools</hi> in the world.</p>
                  <p>Me thinks theſe <hi>Magical Phyſitians</hi> deal in the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> much like as a certain kind of <hi>Cynical</hi> people do in the Church, whoſe <hi>ſevere ſayings</hi> are accompted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome ſuch <hi>Oracles,</hi> as may not be doubted of; who in ſtead of <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (which they make contemptible) do feed the people with their own <hi>devices</hi> and <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> which they prefer before all other <hi>Divinity:</hi> and labouring to erect a Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own fanſies, wherein all order is <hi>condemned,</hi> and only their <hi>Magical</hi> words and <hi>curious</hi> directions <hi>advanced,</hi> they would utterly overthrow the true Church. And even as theſe inchanting <hi>Paracelſians</hi> abuſe the people, leading them from the true or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Phyſick</hi> to their <hi>Charms:</hi> ſo do theſe other (I ſay) diſſwade from hearkning to <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> and whiſper in mens ears to teach them their <hi>Fryer-like</hi> traditions. And of this ſect the chief author at this time is one <hi>Brown,</hi> a <hi>fugitive,</hi> a meet <hi>cover for ſuch a cup:</hi> as heretofore the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and the <hi>Franciſcan Fryers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly not only <hi>nature,</hi> being the <hi>foundation</hi> of all <hi>perfection;</hi> but alſo <hi>Scripture,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> and <hi>director</hi> thereof, and of all <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> is <hi>beautified</hi> with <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>learning:</hi> For as <hi>nature</hi> without <hi>diſcipline</hi> doth naturally incline unto <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and as it were ſuck up <hi>errors;</hi> ſo doth the <hi>word,</hi> or rather the <hi>letter</hi> of the Scripture without underſtanding,<note place="margin">

                  <p>TO you that are wiſe and diſcreet, few words may ſuffice;<note place="margin">Iſa. <hi>11.</hi> Prov. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> for ſuch a one judgeth not at the firſt ſight, nor Reproveth by hearſay; but patiently heareth, and thereby increaſeth in underſtanding: which patience bringeth forth experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereby true judgement is directed. I ſhall not need therefore, to make any further ſuite to you, but that it would pleaſe you to read my Book, without the prejudice of time, or former conceit; and having obtained this at your hands, I ſubmit my ſelf unto your cenſure. But to make a ſolemn ſuit to you that are partial Readers, deſiring you to ſet aſide partiality, to take in good part my writing, and with indifferent eyes to look upon my Book, were labour loſt, and time ill imployed: For I ſhould no more prevail herein, then if a hundred years ſince I ſhould have intreated your predeceſſors to believe, that <hi>Robin Good-fellow,</hi> that great and ancient Bull-begger, had been but a coſening Merchant, and no Devil indeed.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhould go to a Papiſt, and ſay, I pray you believe my writings, wherein I will prove all Popiſh Charms, Conjurations, Exorciſms, Benedictions and Curſes, not only to be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and of none effect, but alſo to be impious and contrary to God's Word: I ſhould as hardly therein win favour at their hands, as herein obtain credit at yours. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I doubt not, but to uſe the matter ſo, that as well the <hi>Maſſemonger</hi> for his part, as the <hi>Witchmonger</hi> for his, ſhall both be aſhamed of their Profeſſions.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Robin Good-fellow</hi> ceaſeth now to be much feared, and Popery is ſufficiently diſcovered. Nevertheleſs, Witches Charms, and Conjurors Coſenages are yet though effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. Yea, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have eſpyed the fraud of their coſening Oracles, and our cold Prophets and Inchanters make us fools ſtill, to the ſhame of us all, but ſpecially of Papiſts, who conjure every thing, and thereby bring to paſs nothing. They ſay to their Candles, <hi>I conjure you to endure for ever;</hi> and yet they laſt not a <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> while the longer. They conjure <hi>water to be wholeſome both for body and ſoul;</hi> but the body (we ſee) is never the better for it, nor the ſoul any whit reformed by it. And therefore I marvel, that when they ſee their own Conjurations confuted and brought to nought, or at the leaſt void of effect, that they (of all other) will yet give ſuch credit, countenance, and authority to the vain coſenages of Witches and Conjurors; as though their Charms and Conjurations could produce more apparent, certain, and better effects then their own.</p>
                  <p>But my requeſt unto all you that read my Book ſhall be no more, but that it would pleaſe you to conferr my words with your own ſenſe and experience, and alſo with the Word of God. If you finde your ſelves reſolved, and ſatisfied, or rather, reformed and qualified in any one point or opinion, that heretofore you held contrary to truth, in a matter hitherto undecided, and never yet looked into; I pray you take that for advantage: and ſuſpending your judgement, ſtay the ſentence of condemnation againſt me, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the reſt, at your further leiſure. If this may not ſuffice for to perſwade you, it cannot prevail to annoy you: and then, that which is written without offence, may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed without any grief.</p>
                  <p>And although mine aſſertion, be ſomewhat differing from the old inveterate opinion, which I confeſs hath many gray hairs, whereby mine adverſaries have gained more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then reaſon, towards the maintenance of their preſumptions, and old wives fables; yet ſhall it fully agree with God's glory, and with his holy Word. And albeit there be hold taken by mine Adverſaries, of certain few words or ſentences in the Scripture that make a ſhew for them; yet when the whole courſe thereof maketh againſt them, and impugneth the ſame; yea, and alſo their own places rightly underſtood, do nothing at all relieve them: I truſt their glorious title and argument of Antiquity, will appear as ſtale and corrupt as the Apothecaries Drugs, or Grocers Spice, which the longer they be preſerved,
<pb facs="tcp:53058:8"/>
the worſe they are. And till you have peruſed my Book, ponder this in your mind, to wit, that <hi>Sagae, Theſſalae, Striges, Lamiae</hi> (which words and none other being in uſe do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifie our Witches) are not once found written in the old or new Teſtament: and that Chriſt himſelf, in his Goſpel, never mentioned the name of a Witch. And that neither he, nor <hi>Moſes</hi> ever ſpake any one word of the Witches bargain with the Devil, their hagging, their riding in the Air, their transferring of Corn or Graſs from one field to another, their hurting of Children or Cattel with words or charms, their bewitching of Butter, Cheeſe, Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor yet their tranſubſtantiation; inſomuch as the writers hereupon are not aſhamed to ſay,<note place="margin">Mal. Malef. part. 2. quaeſt. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>That it is not abſurd to affirm, that there were no Witches in</hi> Jobs <hi>time: The reaſon is, that if there had been ſuch Witches then in being,</hi> Job <hi>would have ſaid, he had been bewitched.</hi> But indeed men took no heed in thoſe dayes to this doctrine of Devils;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1.</note> to wit, to theſe <hi>fables</hi> of Witchcraft, which <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſhall be much regarded and hearkned unto in the latter dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Howbeit, how ancient ſoever this barbarous conceit of Witches Omnipotency is, Truth muſt not be meaſured by Time; for every old Opinion is not ſound. Verity is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, how long ſoever it be ſuppreſſed: but is to be ſearched out, in how dark a corner ſoever it lye hidden; for it is not like a cup of Ale that may be broached toe rathe. Finally,<note place="margin">Danaeus in ſuo prologo.</note> time bewrayeth old errors, and diſcovereth new matters of truth. <hi>Danaeus</hi> himſelf ſaith, that <hi>this queſtion hitherto hath never been handled; nor the Scriptures concerning this matter have never been expounded.</hi> To prove the antiquity of the cauſe, to confirm the opinion of the ignorant, to inforce mine Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Arguments, to aggravate the Puniſhment, and to accompliſh the Confuſion of theſe old women, is added the vanity and wickedneſs of them which are called Witches; the arrogancy of thoſe which take upon them to work Wonders; the deſire that people have to hearken to ſuch miraculous matters, unto whom moſt commonly an impoſſibility is more credible than a verity; the ignorance of natural cauſes; the ancient and univerſal hate conceived againſt the name of a Witch; their ill-favoured faces; their ſpiteful words; their curſes and imprecations; their charmes made in rime, and their beggery; the fear of many fooliſh folk; the opinion of ſome that are wiſe; the want of <hi>Robin Good-fellow</hi> and the <hi>Fairies,</hi> which were wont to maintain that, and the common peoples talk in this behalf; the authority of the Inquiſitors; the learning, cunning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and eſtimation of Writers herein; the falſe tranſlations and fond interpretations uſed, ſpecially by Papiſts, and many other like cauſes. All which toyes take ſuch hold upon mens fancies, as thereby they are led and enticed away from the conſideration of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, to the condemnation of that which they know not.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, I will (by God's grace) in this my Book, ſo apparently decipher and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute theſe Cavils, and all other their Objections, as every Witchmonger ſhall be abaſhed, and all good men thereby ſatisfied. In the mean time, I would wiſh them to know, that if neither the eſtimation of God's Omnipotency, nor the tenor of his Word, nor the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, or rather the impoſſibility of the caſe, nor the ſmall proofs brought againſt them, nor the rigor executed upon them, nor the pitty that ſhould be in a Chriſtian heart, nor yet their ſimplicity, impotency, or age, may ſuffice to ſuppreſs the rage or rigor wherewith they are oppreſſed; yet the conſideration of their ſex or kind, ought to move ſome miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of their puniſhment. For if nature (as <hi>Pliny</hi> reporteth) hath taught a Lyon not to deal ſo roughly with a Woman as with a Man, becauſe ſhe is in body the weaker veſſel, and in heart more inclined to pitty (which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in his <hi>Lamentations</hi> ſeemeth to confirm) what ſhould a Man do in this caſe,<note place="margin">

                  <p>God that knoweth my heart is witneſs, and you that read my Book ſhall ſee, that my drift and purpoſe in this enterpriſe tendeth only to theſe reſpects. Firſt, that the glory and power of God be not ſo abridged and abaſed, as to be truſt into the hand or lip of a

lewd old Woman; whereby the work of the Creator ſhould be attributed to the power of ae Creature. Secondly, that the Religion of the Goſpel may be ſeen to ſtand without ſuch peeviſh trumpery. Thirdly, that lawful favour and Chriſtian compaſſion be rather uſed towards theſe poor ſouls, than rigor and extremity. Becauſe they which are commonly accuſed of Witchcraft, are the leaſt ſufficient of all other perſons, to ſpeak for themſelves; as having the moſt baſe and ſimple education of all others; the extremity of their age giving them leave to dote, their poverty to leg, their wrongs to chide and threaten (as being void of any other way of revenge) their humor Melancholical, to be full of imaginations, from whence chiefly proceedeth the vanity of their confeſſions; as that they can transform themſelves and others, into Apes, Owls, Aſſes, Dogs, Cats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they can flie in the Air, kill Children with Charms, hinder the coming of Butter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for ſo much as the Mighty help themſelves together, and the poor Widows cry,<note place="margin">Eccluſ. <hi>35.15.</hi>
                     </note> though it reach to heaven, is ſcarce heard upon earth; I thought good (according to my poor ability) to make interceſſion, that ſome part of common rigor, and ſome points of haſty judgement may be adviſed upon. For the world is now at that ſtay (as <hi>Brentius</hi> in a moſt godly Sermon in theſe words affirmeth) <hi>that even as when the Heathen perſecuted the Chriſtians, if any were accuſed to believe in Chriſt, the common people cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Ad Leonem: So now, if any Woman, be ſhe never ſo honeſt, be accuſed of Witchcraft, they cry <hi>Ad Ignem.</hi> What difference is between the raſh dealing of unskilful people, and the grave counſel of more diſcreet and learned perſons, may appear by a tale of <hi>Danaeus</hi> his own telling; wherein he oppoſeth the raſhneſs of a few Townſmen, to the counſel of a whole Senate; preferring the Folly of the one, before the Wiſdom of the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>At</hi> Orleance <hi>on</hi> Loyre (ſaith he) <hi>there was a Man-witch, not only taken and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, but alſo convicted and condemned for Witchcraft, who appealed from thence to the high Court of</hi> Paris: <hi>Which accuſation the Senate ſaw inſufficient, and would not allow, but laughed thereat, lightly regarding it; and in the end ſent him home</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as accuſed of a frivolous matter: And yet for all that, the Magiſtrates of</hi> Orleance <hi>were ſo bold with him, as to hang him up within a ſhort time after, for the ſame or the very like offence.</hi> In which example is to be ſeen the nature, and as it were the diſeaſe of this cauſe; wherein (I ſay) the ſimpler and undiſcreetor ſort are alwayes more haſty and furious in judgments, than men of better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and knowledge. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Eunichius</hi> ſaith, <hi>that theſe three things, to wit, what is to be thought of Witches, what their Incantations can do, and whether their puniſhment ſhould extend to death, are to be well conſidered. And I would</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they were as well known, as they are raſhly believed, both of the learned and unlearned.</hi> And further he ſaith, <hi>That almoſt all Divines, Phyſicians and Lawyers, who ſhould beſt know theſe matters, ſatisfying themſelves with old cuſtom, have given too much credit to theſe fables, and too raſh and unjuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death upon Witches. But when a man pondreth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that in times paſt, all that ſwarved from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>were judged Hereticks; it is the leſs marvel, though in this matter they be blind and ignorant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſurely, if the Scripture had been longer ſuppreſſed, more abſurd fables would have ſprung up, and been believed. Which credulity though it is to be derided with laughter, yet this their cruelty is to be lamented with tears: For (God knoweth) many of theſe poor wretches had more need to be releived than chaſtiſed; and more meet were a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to admoniſh them, than a Jaylor to keep them; and a Phyſician more neceſſary to help them, than an Executioner or Tormentor to hang or burn them. For proof and due tryal hereof, I will requite <hi>Danaeus</hi> his tale of a Man-witch (as he termeth him) with another Witch of the ſame ſex or gender.</p>

                     <hi>Cardanus</hi> from the mouth of his own Father reporteth, <hi>That one</hi> Bernard,<note place="margin">Lib. 15. cap. 18. de varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatib. rerum.</note> 
                     <hi>a poor ſervant, being in wit very ſimple and rude, but in his ſervice very neceſſary and diligent (and in that reſpect dearly beloved of his Maſter) profeſſing the Art of Witchcraft, could in no wiſe be diſſwaded from that profeſſion, perſwading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he knew all things, and could bring any matter to paſs; becauſe certain Countrey-people reſorted to him fof help and counſel, as ſuppoſing by his own talk, that he could do ſomewhat. At length he was condemned to be burned; which torment he ſeemed more willing to ſuffer, than to loſe his eſtimation in

that behalf. But his Maſter having compaſſion upon him, and being himſelf in his Princes favour, perceiving his conceit to proceed of Melancholy, obtained reſpit of execution for twenty dayes. In which time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>his Maſter boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully fed him with good fat meat, and with four eggs at a meal, as alſo with ſweet Wine: which diet was beſt for ſo groſs and weak a body. And being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſo in ſtrength, that the humor was ſuppreſſed, he was eaſily won from his abſurd and dangerous opinions, and from all his fond imaginations: and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his error and folly, from the which before no man could remove him by any perſwaſions, having his pardon, he lived long a good member of the Church, whom otherwiſe the cruelty of judgement ſhould have caſt away and deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This hiſtory is more credible than <hi>Sprengers</hi> fables, or <hi>Bodins</hi> bables, which reach not ſo far to the extolling of Witches Omnipotency, as to the derogating of God's glory. For if it be true, which they affirm, <hi>that our life and death lyeth in the hand of a Witch;</hi> then is it falſe, <hi>that God maketh us to live or die, or that by him we have our being, our terme of time appointed, and our dayes numbred.</hi> But ſurely their Charmes can no more reach to the hurting or killing of Men or Women, that their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations can extend to the ſtealing and carrying away of Horſes and Mares.<note place="margin">Amos <hi>3.6.</hi> Lam. <hi>3.38.</hi> Iſa. <hi>45.9.</hi> Rom. <hi>9.20.</hi>
                     </note> Neither hath God given remedies to ſickneſs or griefs, by Words or Charms, but by Hearbs and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which he himſelf hath created upon earth, and given Men knowledge of the ſame; that he might be glorified, for that therewith he doth vouchſafe that the Maladies of Men and Cattel ſhould be cured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if there be no affliction nor calamity, but is brought to paſs by him; then let us defie the Devil, renounce all his works, and not ſo much as once think or dream upon this ſupernatural power of Witches, neither let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them with ſuch deſpight, whom our fancy condemneth, and our reaſon acquitteth: our evidence againſt them conſiſting in impoſſibilities, our proofs in unwritten verities, and our whole proceedings in doubts and difficulties.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe I miſlike the extream cruelty uſed againſt ſome of theſe ſilly ſouls (whom a ſimple Advocate having Audience and Juſtice, might deliver out of the hands of the Inquiſitors themſelves) it will be ſaid, <hi>That I deny any puniſhment at all to be due to any Witch whatſoever.</hi> Nay, becauſe I bewray the folly and impiety of them, which attribute unto Witches the power of God: theſe Witchmongers will report, that I deny <hi>there are any Witches at all; and yet behold</hi> (ſay they) <hi>how often is the word</hi> [Witch] <hi>mentioned in the Scripture?</hi> Even as if an Idolater ſhould ſay, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Images and Idols, to them which deny their power and godhead, and inveigh againſt the reverence done unto them, <hi>How dare you deny the power of Images, ſeeing their names are ſo often repeated in the Scriptures?</hi> But truly I deny not that there are Witches or Images; but I deteſt the Idolaters opinions conceived of them; referring that to God's work and ordinance, which they impute to the power and malice of Witches; and attributing that honour to God which they aſcribe to Idols. But as for thoſe that in very deed are either Witches or Conjurors, let them hardly ſuffer ſuch puniſhment as to their fault is agreeable, and as by the grave judgement of law is provided.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Fables of Witchcraft have taken ſo faſt hold and deep root in the heart of man, that few or none can (now adaies) with patience indure the hand and correction of God. For if any adverſity, grief, ſickneſs, loſs of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, corn, cattel, or liberty, happen unto them; by and by they exclaim upon Witches:<note place="margin">Job 5.</note> As though there were no God in Iſrael that ordereth all things according to his will, puniſhing both juſt and unjuſt with griefs, plagues, and afflictions in manner and form as he thinketh good: but that certain old women here on earth, called Witches, muſt needs be the contrivers of all mens calamities; and as though they themſelves were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, and had deſerved no ſuch puniſhments. Inſomuch as they ſtick not to ride and go to ſuch, as either are injuriouſly termed Witches, or elſe are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo to be accounted, ſeeking at their hands comfort and remedy in time of their tribulation, contrary to Gods Will and Commandement in that behalf,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> who bids us reſort to him in all our neceſſities.</p>
                     <p>Such faithleſs people (I ſay) are alſo perſwaded, that neither hail nor ſnow, thunder nor lightning, rain nor tempeſtuous winds, come from the Heavens at the commandement of God; but are raiſed by the cunning and power of Witches and Conjurers; inſomuch as a clap of thunder, or a gale of wind is no ſooner heard, but either they run to ring bells, or cry out to burn Witches; or elſe burn conſecrated things, hoping by the ſmoak thereof, to drive the Devil out of the air, as though ſpirits could be fraid away with ſuch external toies: howbeit, theſe are right inchantments, as <hi>Brentius</hi> affirmeth.<note place="margin">In concione.</note>

Eccleſ. 43.</note>But certainly, it is neither a Witch, nor Devil, but a glorious God that maketh the thunder. I have read in the Scriptures, that God maketh the bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempeſts and whirl-winds: and I find that it is the Lord that altogether dealeth with them, and that they blow according to his will. But let me ſee any of them all rebuke and ſtill the ſea in time of tempeſt, as Chriſt did; or raiſe the ſtormy wind, as God did with his word; and I will believe in them. Hath any Witch or Conjurer, or any creature entred into the treaſures of the ſnow; or ſeen the ſecret places of the hail, which God hath prepared againſt the day of trouble, battel, and war? I for my part alſo think with Jeſus Sirach, that at Gods only commandement the ſnow falleth; and that the wind bloweth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will,<note place="margin">Levit. 26.3, 4.</note> who only makeh all ſtorms to ceaſe; and who (if we keep his ordinances) will ſend us rain in due ſeaſon, and make the land to bring forth her increaſe, and the trees of the field to give their fruit.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 78.23.</note>But little think our Witch-mongers, that the Lord commandeth the clouds above, or openeth the doors of heaven, as <hi>David</hi> affirmeth; or that the Lord goeth forth in the tempeſts and ſtorms,<note place="margin">Nahum. 1.</note> as the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> reporteth: but rather that Witches and Conjurers are then about their buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Marcioniſts</hi> acknowledged one God the Author of good things, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ordainer of evil: but theſe make the Devil a whole God, to create things of nothing, to know mens cogitations, and to do that which God never did; as to tranſubſtantiate men into beaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which thing, if Devils could do, yet followeth it not, that Witches have ſuch power. But if all the Devils in Hell were dead, and all the Witches in <hi>England</hi> were burned or hanged; I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you we ſhould not fail to have rain, hail, and tempeſts, as now we have: according to the appointment and will of God, and according to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elements, and the courſe of the Planets, wherein God hath ſet a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and perpetual order.</p>
                     <p>I am alſo well aſſured, that if all the old women in the world were Witches; and all the Prieſts Conjurers; we ſhould not have a drop of rain, nor a blaſt of wind the more or the leſs for them:<note place="margin">Job 26.8. Job 37. Pſal. 135. Jer. 10. &amp; 15. Oſe. 13.</note> For the Lord hath bound the waters in the clouds, and hath ſet bounds about the waters, until the day and night come to an end: yea, it is God that raiſeth the winds and ſtilleth them: and he ſaith to the rain and ſnow, Be upon the earth, and it falleth. The wind of the Lord, and not the wind of Witches, ſhall deſtroy the treaſures of their pleaſant veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and dry up the fountains; ſaith <hi>Oſeas.</hi> Let us alſo learn and confeſs with the Prophet <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 39. &amp;c.</note> that we our ſelves are the cauſes of our afflictions; and not exclaim upon Witches, when we ſhould call upon God for mercy.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The inconvenience growing by mens Credulity herein, with a reproof of ſome Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which are inclined to the common conceived opinion of Witches Omnipotencie, and familiar example thereof.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt the world is now ſo bewitched and over-run with this fond error, that even where a man ſhould ſeek comfort and counſel, there ſhall he be ſent (in caſe of neceſſity) from God to the Devil; and from the Phyſitian to the coſening Witch, who will not ſtick to take upon her by words to heal the lame (which was proper only to Chriſt; and to them whom he aſſiſted with his divine power) yea, with her familiar and charms ſhe will take upon her to cure the blind:<note place="margin">Joh. 10.21.</note> though in the tenth of S. <hi>John</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel it be written, that the Devil cannot open the eyes of the blind. And they attain ſuch credit, as I have heard (to my grief) ſome of the miniſtery affirm, that they have had in their Pariſh at one inſtant, 17 or 18 Witches, meaning ſuch as could work Miracles ſupernaturally. Whereby they manifeſted as well their infidelity and ignorance, in conceiving Gods Word; as their negligence and error in inſtructing their flocks: For they themſelves might underſtand, and alſo teach their pariſhioners, that <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 72. &amp; 136.

                        <hi>and ſhall give heed to Spirits of Errors, and Doctrins of Devils, which ſpeak lies, (as Witches and Conjurers do) but caſt thou away ſuch prophane and old wives fables.</hi> In which ſenſe <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith; Who ſo giveth heed to Inchanters, harkeneth to a fabulous and frivilous thing. But I will rehearſe an example, whereof I my ſelf am not only <hi>Oculatus teſtis,</hi> but have examined the cauſe, and am to juſtifie the truth of my report: not becauſe I would diſgrace the Miniſters that are godly, but to confirm my former aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this abſurd error is grown into the place, which ſhould be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel all ſuch ridiculous folly and impiety.</p>
                     <p>At the Aſſizes holden at <hi>Rocheſter, Anno</hi> 1581. one <hi>Margaret Simons,</hi>

                     <p>His ſon (being an ungracious boy, and prentiſe to one <hi>Robert Scotchford</hi> clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier, dwelling in that Pariſh of <hi>Brenchly</hi>) paſſed on a day by her houſe; at whom by chance her little Dog barked. Which thing the boy taking in evil part, drew his knife, and purſued him therewith even to her door: whom ſhe rebuked with ſome ſuch words as the boy diſdained, and yet nevertheleſs would not be perſwaded to depart in a long time. At the laſt he returned to his Maſters houſe, and within five or ſix days fell ſick. Then was called to mind the fray betwixt the Dog and the Boy: inſomuch as the Vicar (who thought himſelf ſo

priviledged, as he little miſtruſted that God would viſit his children with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) did ſo calculate; as he found, partly through his own judgement, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) as he himſelf told me) by the relation of other Witches, that his ſaid ſon was by her bewitched. Yea, he alſo told me, that this his ſon (being, as it were, paſt all cure) received perfect health at the hands of another Witch.</p>
                     <p>He proceeded yet further againſt her, affirming, that alwayes in his Pariſh-Church, when he deſired to read moſt plainly, his voyce ſo failed him, as he could ſcant be heard at all; Which he could impute, he ſaid, to nothing elſe, but to her inchantment. When I advertiſed the poor woman hereof, as being deſirous to hear what ſhe could ſay for her ſelf; ſhe told me, that in very deed, his voyce did much fail him, ſpecially when he trained himſelf to ſpeak lowdeſt. Howbeit, ſhe ſaid that at all times his voyce was hoarſe and low, which thing I perceived to be true. But Sir; ſaid ſhe, you ſhall underſtand, that this our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car is diſeaſed with ſuch a kind of hoarſeneſs, as divers of our neighbours in this Pariſh not long ſince, doubted that he had the French-Pox; and in that reſpect utterly refuſed to communicate with him: until ſuch time as (being thereunto injoyned by M.D. <hi>Lewen</hi> the ordinary) he had brought from <hi>London</hi> a certificate, under the hands of two Phyſitians, that his hoarſeneſs proceeded from a diſeaſe in the lungs. Which certificate he publiſhed in the Church, in the preſence of the whole Congregation: and by this means he was cured, or rather excuſed of the ſhame of his diſeaſe; And this I know to be true by the relation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers honeſt men of that Pariſh: And truly, if one of the Jury had not been wiſer than the other, ſhe had been condemned thereupon, and upon other as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matters as this.

                     </argument>
                     <p>ONe ſort of ſuch as are ſaid to be Witches, are women which be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly old, lame, blear-eyed, pale, fowl, and full of wrinckles; poor, ſullen, ſuperſtitious, and Papiſts; or ſuch as know no Religion: in whoſe drouſie minds the Devil hath gotten a fine ſeat; ſo as, what miſchief, miſchance, calamity, or ſlaughter is brought to paſs, they are eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the ſame is done by themſelves; imprinting in their minds an earneſt and conſtant imagination thereof.<note place="margin">Cardan de var. rerum.</note> They are lean and deformed, ſhewing melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly in their faces, to the horrour of all that ſee them. They are doting, ſcolds, mad, devilliſh, and not much differing from them that are thought to be poſſeſſed with ſpirits, ſo firm and ſtedfaſt in their opinions, as whoſoever ſhall only have reſpect to the conſtancy of their words uttered, would eaſily believe they were true indeed.</p>
                     <p>Theſe miſerable wretches are ſo odious unto all their neighbours; and ſo feared, as few dare offend them, or deny them any thing they ask: whereby they take upon them; yea, and ſometimes think, that they can do ſuch things as are beyond the ability of humane nature. Theſe go from houſe to houſe, and from door to door for a pot full of milk, yeſt, drink, pottage, or ſome ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; without the which they could hardly live: neither obtaining for their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and pains, nor yet by their art, nor yet at the Devils hands (with whom they are ſaid to make a perfect and viſible bargain) either beauty, money, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, wealth, worſhip, pleaſure, honour, knowledg, learning, or any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit whatſoever.</p>

                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53058:12"/>It falleth out many times, that neither their neceſſities, nor their expectation is anſwered or ſerved, in thoſe places where they beg or borrow; but rather their lewdneſs is by their neighbors reproved. And further, in tract of time the Witch waxeth odious and tedious to her neighbours; and they again are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and deſpited of her: ſo as ſometimes ſhe curſeth one, and ſometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that from the Maſter of the houſe, his wife, children, cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the little Pig that lieth in the ſtie. Thus in proceſs of time they have all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed her, and ſhe hath wiſhed evil luck unto them all; perhaps with curſes and imprecations made in form. Doubtleſs (at length) ſome of her neighbours die, or fall ſick; or ſome of their children are viſited with diſeaſes that vex them ſtrangely: as Apoplexies, Epilepſie, Convulſions, hot Fevers, Worms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which by ignorant Parents are ſuppoſed to be the vengeance of Witches. Yea and their opinions and conceits are confirmed and maintained by unskilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, according to the common ſaying: <hi>Inſcitiae pallium malleficium &amp; incantatio,</hi> Witchcraft and Inchantment is the cloke of Ignorance: whereas indeed evil humors, and not ſtrange words, Witches, or Spirits, are the cauſes of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: Alſo ſome of their Cattel periſh, either by diſeaſe or miſchance: Then they upon whom ſuch adverſities fall, weighing the fame that goeth upon this woman, her words, diſpleaſure, and curſes, meeting ſo juſtly with their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, do not only conceive, but alſo are reſolved that all their miſhaps are brought to paſs by her only means.</p>
                     <p>The Witch on the other ſide expecting her neighbors miſchances, and ſeeing things ſometimes come to paſs according to her wiſhes, curſes, and incantations, (for <hi>Bodin</hi> himſelf confeſſeth,<note place="margin">J. Bodin. lib. <hi>2.</hi> de damon. cap. <hi>8.</hi>

                     <p>Another ſort of Witches there are, which be abſolutely coſeners. Theſe take upon them either for glory, fame, or gain, to do any thing which God or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil can do: either for fore-telling of things to come, bewraying of ſecrets, curing of maladies, or working of miracles.

                        </note> of three ſorts of Witches; and the ſame is affirmed by all the Writers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, new and old.

Theſe be they (ſaith he) that raiſe hail, tempeſts, and hurtful weather; as Lightning, Thunder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe be they that procure barrenneſs in Man, Woman, and Beaſt.

Theſe can paſs from place to place in the air inviſible. Theſe can ſo alter the mind of Judges, they can have no power to hurt them. Theſe can procure to themſelves and to others, taciturnity and inſenſibility in their torments. Theſe can bring trembling to the hands, and ſtrike terror into the minds of them that apprehend them. Theſe can manifeſt unto others, things hidden and loſt, and foreſhew things to come, and ſee them as though they were preſent. Theſe can alter mens minds to inordinate love or hate.

                     <p>BUt whatſoever is reported or conceived of ſuch manner of Witchcrafts, I dare avow to be falſe and fabulous (coſenage, dotage, and poyſoning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted:) neither is there any mention made of theſe kind of Witches in the Bible. If Chriſt had known them, he would not have pretermitted to inveigh againſt their preſumption, in taking upon them his Office: as, to heal and cure

diſeaſes; and to work ſuch miraculous and ſupernatural things, as whereby he himſelf was ſpecially known, believed and publiſhed to be God; his actions and cures conſiſting (in order and effect) according to the power by our Witchmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers imputed to Witches. Howbeit, if there be any in theſe dayes afflicted in ſuch ſtrange ſort, as Chriſts cures and patients are deſcribed in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have been: we fly from truſting in God to truſting in Witches, who do not only in their coſening art take on them the office of Chriſt in this behalf; but uſe his very phraſe of ſpeech to ſuch Idolaters, as come to ſeek divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance at their hands, ſaying; <hi>Go thy wayes, thy ſon or thy daughter,</hi>

                     <p>It will not ſuffice to diſſwade a Witchmonger from his credulity, that he ſeeth the ſequel and event to fall out many times contrary to their aſſertion; but in ſuch caſe (to his greater condemnation) he ſeeketh further to Witches of greater fame.

                        <p>A further confutation of Witches miraculous and omnipotent power, by invincible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and authorities, with diſſwaſions from ſuch fond credulity.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IF Witches could do any ſuch miraculous things, as theſe and other which are imputed to them, they might do them again and again, at any time or place, or at any mans deſire: for the devil is as ſtrong at one time as at another, as buſie by day as by night, and ready enough to do all miſchief, and careth not whom he abuſeth: And inſomuch as it is confeſſed, by the moſt part of Witchmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers themſelves, that he knoweth not the cogitation of mans heart, he ſhould (me thinks) ſometimes appear, unto honeſt and credible perſons, in ſuch groſs and corporal form, as it is ſaid he doth unto Witches: which you ſhall never hear to be juſtified by one ſufficient witneſs. For the devil indeed entreth into the mind, and that way ſeeketh mans confuſion.</p>
                     <p>The art alwayes preſuppoſeth the power; ſo as, if they ſay they can do this or that, they muſt ſhew, how and by what means they do it; as neither the Witches nor the Witchmongers are able to do: For, to every action is required the faculty and ability of the agent or doer; the aptneſs of the patient or ſubject; and a convenient and poſſible application. Now the Witches are mortal, and their power dependeth upon the analogy and conſonancy of their minds and bodies; but with their minds they can but will and underſtand; and with their bodies they can do no more, but as the bounds and ends of terrene ſenſe will ſuffer: and therefore their power extended not to do ſuch miracles, as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth their own ſenſe, and the underſtanding of others which are wiſer than they; ſo as here wanteth the vertue and power of the efficient. And in reaſon, there can be no more vertue in the thing cauſed, than in the cauſe, or that which proceedeth of or from the benefit of the cauſe. And we ſee, that ignorant and impotent women, or Witches, are the cauſes of incantations and charms;<note place="margin">Ariſtot. de anima lib. <hi>2. Acts 8.</hi>

and ſenſe unabuſed, the rules of Philoſophy, or the Word of God. For alas! What an unapt inſtrument is a toothleſs, old, impotent, and unwieldy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to flie in the air; Truely, the Devil little needs ſuch inſtruments to bring his purpoſes to paſs.</p>

                        </note>It is ſtrange, that we ſhould ſuppoſe, that ſuch perſons can work ſuch feats: and it is more ſtrange, that we will imagine that to be poſſible to be done by a witch; which to nature and ſenſe is impoſſible; ſpecially when our neighbours life dependeth upon our credulity therein; and when we may ſee the defect of ability, which alwayes is an impediment both to the act, and alſo to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption thereof. And becauſe there is nothing poſſible in law, that in nature is impoſſible; therefore the judge doth not attend or regard what the accuſed man ſaith; or yet would do: but what is proved to have been committed, and naturally falleth in mans power and will to do. For the law ſaith, that to will a thing impoſſible, is a ſign of a mad-man, or of a fool, upon whom no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or judgement taketh hold. Furthermore, what Jury will condemn, or what Judge will give ſentence or judgement againſt one for killing a man at <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> when they themſelves, and many other ſaw that man at <hi>London,</hi> that very day, wherein the murther was committed; yea though the party confeſs himſelf guilty therein, and twenty witneſſes depoſe the ſame: But in this caſe alſo I ſay the Judge is not to weigh their teſtimony, which is weakened by Law; and the Judges authority is to ſupply the imperfection of the caſe, and to maintain the right and equity of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore that ſome other things might naturally be the occaſion and cauſe of ſuch calamities as witches are ſuppoſed to bring; let not us that profeſs the Goſpel and knowledge of Chriſt, be bewitched to believe that they do ſuch things,<note place="margin">An objection anſwered.</note> as are in nature impoſſible, and in ſenſe and reaſon incredible; If they ſay it is done through the Devils help, who can work miracles; why doe not theeves bring their buſineſs to paſs miraculouſly, with whom the Devil is as converſant as with the other: Such miſchiefs as are imputed to witches, happen where no witches are, yea and continue when witches are hanged and burnt: why then ſhould we attribute ſuch effect to that cauſe, which being taken away, happeneth nevertheleſs?</p>

                     <p>And this I have alſo noted, that when any one is coſened with a coſening toye of witch-craft, and maketh report thereof accordingly, verifying a matter moſt impoſſible and falſe as it were upon his own knowledge, as being overtaken with ſome kind of illuſion or other (which illuſions are right inchantments) even the ſelf-ſame man will deride the like proceeding out of another mans mouth, as a fabulous matter unworthy of credit. It is alſo to be wondered, how men (that have ſeen ſome part of witches coſenages detected, and ſee alſo therein the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53058:14"/>
impoſſibility of their own preſumptions, and the folly and falſhood of the witches confeſſions) will not ſuſpect, but remain unſatisfied, or rather obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately defend the reſidue of witches ſupernatural actions: like as when a jugler hath diſcovered the ſlight and illuſion of his principal feats, one would fondly continue to think, that his other petty juggling knacks of legierdemain are done by the help of a familiar: and according to the folly of ſome Papiſts, who ſeeing and confeſſing the Popes abſurd Religion, in the erection and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Idolatry and Superſtition, ſpecially in Images, Pardons, and Reliques of Saints, will yet perſevere to think, that the reſt of his doctrine and trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is holy and good. Finally, many maintain and cry out for the execution of witches, that particularly believe never a whit of that which is imputed unto them; if they be therein privately dealt withall, and ſubſtantially oppoſed and tryed in argument.</p>

                        </note> that the cauſe of ſuch credulity conſiſteth in three points; to wit, in the imagination of the melancholick, in the conſtancy of them that are corrupt therewith, and in the deceit of the Judges; who being inquiſitors themſelves againſt hereticks and witches, did both accuſe and condemn them, having for their labour the ſpoil of their goods: So as theſe inquiſitors added many fables hereunto, leſt they ſhould ſeem to have done injury to the poor wretches, in condemning and executing them for none offence. But ſithence (ſaith he) the ſpringing up of <hi>Luthers</hi> ſect, theſe Prieſts have tended more diligently upon the execution of them; becauſe more wealth is to be caught from them: inſomuch as now they deal ſo looſly with witches (through diſtruſt of gains) that all is ſeen to be malice, folly or avarice that hath been practiſed againſt them: And whoſoever ſhall ſearch into this cauſe, or read the chief writers hereupon, ſhall find his words true.</p>
                     <p>It will be objected,<note place="margin">An Objection anſwered.</note> that we here in <hi>England</hi> are not now directed by the Popes Laws; and ſo by conſequence our witches not troubled or convented by the Inquiſitors <hi>Haereticae pravitatis.</hi> I anſwer, that in times paſt here in <hi>England,</hi> as in other nations, this order of diſcipline hath been in force and uſe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though now ſome part of the old rigour be qualified by two ſeveral Statutes made in the firſt of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and 33 of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight. Nevertheleſs the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the omnipotency of their words or charmes ſeemeth in thoſe ſtatutes to be ſomewhat maintained, as a matter hitherto generally received; and not yet ſo looked into, as that it is refuted and decided.

And moſt certain it is, that in what point ſoever any of theſe extremities, which I ſhall rehearſe unto you, be mitigated, it is through the goodneſs of the Queens Majeſty, and her excellent Magiſtrates placed amongſt us: For as touching the opinion of our Writers therein in our age; yea in our Countrey, you ſhall ſee it doth not only agree with foreign cruelty, but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth it far.

                     <p>Another caution is, that after ſhe hath been racked, and paſſed over all tortures deviſed for that purpoſe; and after that ſhe hath been compelled to drink holy water, ſhe be conveyed again to the place of torture: and that in the midſt of her torments, her accuſations be read unto her; and that the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes (if they will) be brought face to face unto her: and finally, that ſhe be asked, whether for trial of her innocency ſhe will have judgment, <hi>Candentis ferri,</hi>

                     <p>Another caution is, that after the Witch hath confeſſed the annoying of men and beaſts, ſhe be asked how long ſhe hath had <hi>Incubus,</hi> when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, the faith, and made the real league, and what that league is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is indeed the chief cauſe of all their incredible and impoſſible confeſſions: for upon the rack, when they have once begun to lye, they will ſay what the Tormentor liſt.</p>

                        <p>A refutation of the former ſurmiſed Crimes patched together by <hi>Bodin,</hi> and the only way to eſcape the Inquiſitors.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IF more ridiculous or abominable crimes could have beeen invented, theſe poor women (whoſe chief fault is that they are ſcolds) ſhould have been charged with them.</p>
                     <p>In this libel you do ſee, is contained all that Witches are charged with; and all that alſo, which any Witchmonger ſurmiſeth, or in malice imputeth unto Witches power and practiſe.</p>
                     <p>Some of theſe crimes may not only be in the power and will of a Witch, but may be accompliſhed by natural means: and therefore by them the matter in queſtion is not decided, to wit;<note place="margin">The queſtion or matter in controverſie: that is to ſay, the propoſition or theme.</note> whether a Witch can work wonders ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally; For many a knave and whore doth more commonly put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thoſe lewd actions, than ſuch as are called Witches, and are hanged for their labour.</p>
                     <p>Some of theſe crimes alſo laid unto Witches charge, are by me denyed, and by them cannot be proved to be true, or committed by any one Witch. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of theſe crimes likewiſe are ſo abſurd, ſupernatural, and impoſſible, that they are derided almoſt of all men, and as falſe, fond, and fabulous reports condemned: inſomuch as the very Witchmongers themſelves are aſhamed to hear of them.</p>
                     <p>If part be untrue, why may not the reſidue be thought falſe: For all theſe things are laid to their charge at one inſtant, even by the greateſt Doctors and Patrons of the Sect of Witchmongers, producing as many proofs for Witches ſupernatural and impoſſible actions, as for the other: So as, if one part of their accuſation be falſe, the other part deſerveth no credit. If all be true that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of their doings, why ſhould we believe in Chriſt, becauſe of his miracles, when a Witch doth as great wonders as ever he did?</p>
                     <p>But it will be ſaid by ſome; As for thoſe abſurd and Popiſh writers, they are not in all their allegations, touching theſe matters, to be credited.<note place="margin">A general er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> But I aſſure you, that even all ſorts of writers herein (for the moſt part) the very Doctors of the Church to the School-men, Proteſtants, and Papiſts, learned and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Poets and Hiſtoriographers, Jews, Chriſtians, or Gentiles agree in theſe impoſſible and ridiculous matters. Yea and theſe writers, out of whom I gather moſt abſurdities, are of the beſt credit and authority of all writers in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The reaſon is, becauſe it was never throughly looked into; but every fable credited; and the word (Witch) named ſo often in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>They that have ſeen further of the Inquiſitors orders and cuſtoms, ſay alſo;<note place="margin">The only way for Witches to avoid the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors hands.</note> that there is no way in the world for theſe poor women to eſcape the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors hands, and ſo conſequently burning: but to gild their hands with money, whereby oftentimes they take pity upon them, and deliver them, as ſufficiently purged: For they have authority to exchange the puniſhment of the body with the puniſhment of the purſe, applying the ſame to the office of their Inquiſition: whereby they reap ſuch profit, as a number of theſe ſilly women pay them year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penſions, to the end they may not be puniſhed again.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>COrnelius Agrippa</hi> ſaith, that while he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> many Inquiſitors in the Dutchie of <hi>Millen</hi> troubled divers moſt honeſt and noble Matrons, privily wringing much money from them, until their knavery was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected: Further he ſaith, that being an Advocate or Counſellor in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Maeſtright</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> he had ſore contention with an Inquiſitor, who through unjuſt accuſations drew a poor woman of the Country into his butchery, and to an unfit place; not ſo much to examine her, as to torment her, whom when <hi>C.

Now when <hi>Agrippa</hi> replyed, affirming that this Article was impertinent, and ought to be refuſed by the Judg, as being the deed of another; alledging to the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor reaſons and law for the ſame: he replyed again, that this was true, becauſe they uſed to ſacrifice their children to the Devil, aſſoon as they were born; and alſo becauſe they uſually conceived by ſpirits transformed into mans ſhape, and that thereby witchcraft was naturally ingraffed into this child, as a diſeaſe that cometh by inheritance.</p>

                        <hi>C. Agrippa</hi> replying againſt the Inquiſitors folly and ſuperſtitious blindneſs, ſaid; O thou wicked Prieſt! Is this thy Divinity?

Doſt thou with ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences judge others to be Hereticks, thou being more a Heretick than either <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> or <hi>Donatus?</hi> Be it as thou ſayeſt, Doſt thou not fruſtrate the grace of Gods Ordinance; namely Baptiſm? Are the words in Baptiſm ſpoken in vain? Or ſhall the Devil remain in the child, or it in the power of the Devil, being there and then conſecrated to Chriſt Jeſus, in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy-Ghoſt? And if thou defend their falſe opinions, which affirm, that Spirits accompanying with women, can ingender; yet doteſt thou more than any of them, which never believed that any of thoſe Devils, together with their ſtoln ſeed, do put part of that their ſeed or nature into the creature. But though indeed we be born the children of the Devil and damnation, yet in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, through grace in Chriſt, Satan is caſt out, and we are made new creatures in the Lord, from whom none can be ſeparated by another mans deed. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor being hereat offended, threatned the Advocate to proceed againſt him, as a ſupporter of Hereticks or Witches; yet nevertheleſs, he ceaſed not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ſilly woman, and through the power of the Law he delivered her from tho claws of the bloudy Monk, who with her accuſers, were condemned in a great ſum of money to the Charter of the Church of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and remained infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous after that time almoſt to all men.</p>

Or what availeth it her, to perſevere in the denial of ſuch matters as are laid to her charge unjuſtly; when on the one ſide there is never any end of her torments; on the other ſide, if ſhe continue in her aſſertion, they ſay ſhe hath charms for taciturnity or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> (I ſay) in the preſence of his Lord and Maſter Chriſt, who had inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him in true knowledge many years, being forewarned, not paſſing four or five hours before, and having made a real league, and a faithful promiſe to the contrary, without any other compulſion than (as hath been ſaid) by a queſtion propoſed by a girl; againſt his conſcience, forſook, thrice denied, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned his ſaid Maſter; and yet he was a man illuminated, and placed in dignity aloft, and neerer to Chriſt by many degrees, than the Witch, whoſe fall could not be ſo great as <hi>Peters;</hi> becauſe ſhe never aſcended half ſo many ſteps. A Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors declination is much more abominable than the going aſtray of any of his ſheep: as an Ambaſſadours conſpiracy is more odious, than the falſhood of a common perſon; or as a Captains treaſon is more miſchievous, than a private ſouldiers mutiny. If you ſay, <hi>Peter</hi> repented; I anſwer, that the Witch doth ſo likewiſe ſometimes; and I ſee not in that caſe, but mercy may be imployed upon her. It were a mighty temptation to a ſilly old woman, that a viſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (being in ſhape ſo ugly,<note place="margin">

The poor old Witch is commonly unlearned, unwarned, and unprovided of counſel and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, void of judgement and diſcretion to moderate her life and communication, her kind and gender more weak and frail than the maſculine, and much more ſubject to melancholy; her bringing up and company is ſo baſe, that nothing is to be looked for in her, ſpecially of theſe extraordinary qualities; her age alſo is commonly ſuch, as maketh her decrepite, which is a diſeaſe that moveth them to theſe follies.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Chriſt did clearly remit <hi>Peter,</hi> though his offence was committed both againſt his divine and humane nature; yea afterwards he did put him in truſt to feed his ſheep, and ſhewed great countenance, friendſhip, and love unto him: And therefore I ſee not, but we may ſhew compaſſion upon theſe poor ſouls, if they ſhew themſelves ſorrowful for their miſconceipts and wicked ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The double bargain of Witches with the Devil.</note>The order of their bargain or profeſſion is double; the one ſolemn and pulick, the other ſecret and private. That which is called ſolemn or publick, is where Witches come together at certain aſſemblies, at the times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, and do not only ſee the Devil in viſible form; but confer and talk familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him. In which conference the Devil exhorteth them to obſerve their fidelity unto him, promiſing them long life and proſperity. Then the Witches aſſembled, commend a new diſciple (whom they call a novice) unto him: and if the Devil find that young Witch apt and forward in renunciation of Chriſtian Faith, in deſpiſing any of the ſeven Sacraments, in treading upon Croſſes, it ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the time of the elevation, in breaking their faſt on faſting-daies, and faſting on Sundaies; the Devil giveth forth his hand, and the novice joyning hand in hand with him, promiſeth to obſerve and keep all the Devils comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
                     <p>This done, the Devil beginneth to be more bold with her, telling her plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all this will not ſerve his turn; and therefore requireth homage at her hands: yea he alſo telleth her, that ſhe muſt grant him both her body and ſoul to be tormented in everlaſting fire;<note place="margin">Mal. Malef. de modo profeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note> which ſhe yieldeth unto: Then he chargeth her, to procure as many men, women, and children alſo, as ſhe can, to enter into this ſociety. Then he teacheth them to make ointments of the bowels and members of children, whereby they ride in the air, and accompliſh all their deſires: So as, if there be any children unbaptized, or not guarded with the ſign of the croſs, or orizons; then the Witches may and do catch them from their mothers ſides in the night, or out of their cradles, or otherwiſe kill them with their ceremonies; and after burial ſteal them out of their graves, and ſeeth them in a chaldron, until their fleſh be made potable. Of the thickeſt whereof they make ointments, whereby they ride in the air, but the thinner potion they put into flaggons, whereof whoſoever drinketh, obſerving cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ceremonies, immediately becometh a maſter, or rather a miſtreſs in that practiſe and faculty.</p>

The firſt is, when the ſoul is abſolutely yielded to the Devil and hell fire: the other is, when they have but bargained to obſerve certain ceremonies and ſtatutes of the Church; as to conceal faults at Shrift, to faſt on Sundaies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is done either by oath, proteſtation of words, or by obligation in writing, ſometimes ſealed with wax, ſometimes ſigned with bloud, ſometimes by kiſſing the Devils bare but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks; as did a Doctor called <hi>Edlin,</hi> who (as <hi>Bodin</hi> ſaith) was burned for Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.</p>

                     <p>A part of their league is, to ſcrape off the oyl, which is received in extream folly (unction I ſhould have ſaid): But if that be ſo dangerous, they which ſock the corps had need to take great care, that they rub not off the oyl, which divers other waies may alſo be thruſt out of the forehead; and then I perceive all the vertue thereof is gone, and farewell it. But I marvel how they take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to preſerve the water powred on them in Baptiſm, which I take to be largely of as great force as the other; and yet I think is commonly wiped and waſhed off, within four and twenty hours after baptiſm: but this agreeth with the reſidue of their folly.</p>
                     <p>And this is to be noted, that the Inquiſitors affirm, that during the whole time of the Witches excourſe, the Devil occupieth the room and place of the Witch, in ſo perfect a ſimilitude, as her husband in his bed, neither by feeling, ſpeech, nor countenance, can diſcern her from his wife.

                     <argument>
                        <p>How Witches are ſummoned to appear before the Devil, of their riding in the air, of their accompts, of their conference with the Devil, of his ſupplies, and their conference; of their farewel and ſacrifices, according to <hi>Danaeus, Pſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HItherto for the moſt part, are the very words contained in <hi>M. Mal.</hi> or <hi>Bodin,</hi> or rather in both; or elſe in the new <hi>M.

                        </note> But <hi>Danaeus</hi> ſaith, the Devil oftentimes in the likeneſs of a ſummoner, meeteth them at Markets and Fairs, and warneth them to appear in their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, at a certain hour in the night, that he may underſtand whom they have ſlain, and how they have profited. If they be lame, he ſaith the Devil delivereth them a ſtaff, to convey them thither inviſibly through the air; and that then they fall a dancing and ſinging of bawdy-ſongs, wherein he leadeth the dance himſelf: Which dance, and other conferences being ended, he ſupplieth their wants of powders and roots to intoxicate withal; and giveth to every novice a mark, either with his teeth, or with his claws, and ſo they kiſs the Devils bare but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, and depart: not forgetting every day afterwards to offer to him, Dogs, Cats, Hens, or bloud of their own. And all this doth <hi>Danaeus</hi> report as a truth,<note place="margin">Idem Ibidem. Idem in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> and as it were upon his own knowledge. And yet elſewhere he ſaith, In theſe matters they do but dream, and do not thoſe things indeed, which they confeſs through their diſtemperature, growing of their melancholick humor: and therefore (ſaith he) theſe things, which they report of themſelves, are but meer illuſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pſellus</hi> addeth hereunto, that certain magical hereticks, to wit; the <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyans,</hi> aſſemble themſelves every Good-friday at night; and putting out the candles, do commit inceſtuous adultery, the father with the daughter, the ſiſter with the brother, and the ſon with the mother; and the ninth moneth they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and are delivered; and cutting their children in pieces, fill their pots with their bloud; then burn they the carkaſſes, and mingle the aſhes therewith, and ſo preſerve the ſame for Magical purpoſes. <hi>Cardanus</hi> writeth (though in mine opinion not very probably) that theſe excourſes,<note place="margin">Card. lib. de var. rerum <hi>15.</hi> cap. <hi>80.</hi>
                        </note> dancings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had their beginning from certain Hereticks called <hi>Dulcini,</hi> who deviſed thoſe feaſts of <hi>Bacchus</hi> which are named <hi>Orgia,</hi> whereunto theſe kind of people openly aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; and beginning with riot, ended with this folly: Which feaſts being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, they nevertheleſs haunted them ſecretly; and when they could not do ſo, then did they it in cogitation only; and even to this day (ſaith he) there remaineth a certain image or reſemblance thereof among our melancholick women.</p>

                     <p>For the beginning of the credit hereof, reſteth upon the confeſsion of a baggage young fellow, condemned to be burnt for Witchcraft;<note place="margin">Upon what ground this real league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow in credit.</note> who ſaid to the Inquiſitors (of likelihood to prolong his life, if at leaſtwiſe the ſtory be true, which is taken out of <hi>Nider;</hi>) If I wiſt (quoth he) that I might obtain pardon: I would diſcover all that I know of Witchcraft: The which condition being accepted, and pardon promiſed (partly in hope thereof, and partly to be rid of his wife) he ſaid as followeth.</p>
                     <p>The novice or young diſciple goeth to ſome Church, together with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of that profeſsion; upon a Sunday morning, before the conjuration of holy water, and there the ſaid novice renounceth the faith, promiſeth obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in obſerving, or rather omitting of ceremonies in meetings, and ſuch other follies; and finally, that they do homage to their young maſter the Devil, as they covenanted.</p>
                     <p>But this is notable in that ſtory; that this young Witch, doubting that his wives examination would bewray his knavery, told the Inquiſitor: that in truth his wife was guilty as well as he, but ſhe will never, I am ſure (quoth he) though ſhe ſhould be burned a thouſand times, confeſs any of theſe circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>And this is in no wiſe to be forgotten, that <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> his contrition, his confeſsion, and his accuſation of his own wife (contrary to the inquiſitors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and oath) he and his wife were both burned at a ſtake, being the firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers of this notable league, whereupon the fable of Witchcraft is maintained; and whereby ſuch other confeſsions have been from the like perſons, ſince that time, extorted and augmented.</p>

                     <p>THe manner of their private league is ſaid to be,<note place="margin">The manner of Witches pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate league with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</note> when the Devil inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſometimes viſile, in the midſt of the people talketh with them privately; promiſing, that if they will follow his counſel, he will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all their neceſsities, and make all their endeavours proſperous; and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth with ſmall matters: whereunto they conſent privily, and come not into the fayries aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>And in this caſe (me thinks) the Devil ſometimes, in ſuch external or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſhape, ſhould meet with ſome that would not conſent to his motions, (except you will ſay he knoweth their cogitations) and ſo ſhould be bewrayed.

But theſe bargains, and theſe aſſemblies do all the writers hereupon maintain; and <hi>Bodin</hi> confirmeth them with a hundred and odd lies; among the number whereof I will (for divers cauſes) recite one.</p>
                     <p>There was (ſaith he) a noble Gentlewoman at <hi>Lions,</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53058:23"/>
Which when he ſaw, he was abaſhed, and ſaid; In the name of God, what make I here? And upon thoſe words the whole aſſembly vaniſhed away, and left him there alone ſtark naked; and ſo was he fain to return to <hi>Lions:</hi> But he had ſo good a conſcience, for you may perceive by the firſt part of the hiſtory, he was a very honeſt man, that he accuſed his true lover for a Witch, and cauſed her to be burned: And as for his adultery, neither, <hi>M.

                     <p>It appeareth throughout all <hi>Bodins</hi> book, that he is ſore offended with <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Agrippa,</hi> and the rather, as I ſuppoſe, becauſe the ſaid <hi>C.

For admit that the conſtitution of a Devils body (as <hi>Tatian</hi> and other affirm) conſiſteth in ſpiritual congelations, as of fire and air; yet it cannot be perceived of mortal creatures. What credible witneſs is there brought at any time, of this their corporal, viſible, and incredible bargain; ſaving the confeſſion of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſeaſed both in body and mind, wilfully made, or injuriouſly conſtrained? It is marvel that no penitent Witch that forſaketh her trade, confeſſeth not theſe things without compulſion. Me thinketh their covenant made at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with God before good witneſſes, ſanctified with the Word, confirmed with his Promiſes, and eſtabliſhed with his Sacraments, ſhould be of more force then that which they make with the Devil, which no body ſeeth or knoweth: For God deceiveth none, with whom he bargaineth: neither doth he mock or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint them, although he dance not among them.</p>
                     <p>The oath, to procure into their league and fellowſhip as many as they can (whereby every one Witch, as <hi>Bodin</hi> affirmeth, augmenteth the number of fifty) bewrayeth greatly their indirect dealing.<note place="margin">The author ſpeaketh upon due proof and trial.</note> Hereof I have made trial; as alſo of the reſidue of their couſening deviſes, and have been with the beſt, or rather the worſt of them, to ſee what might be gathered out of their counſels; and have cunningly treated with them thereabouts: and further, have ſent certain old perſons to indent with them, to be admited into their ſociety: But as well by their excuſes and delaies, as by other circumſtances, I have tried and found all their trade to be meer coſening.</p>

                     <p>I my ſelf have known, that where ſuch a one could not prevail, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as a ſufficient witneſs againſt himſelf, he preſently went and threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a pond of water, where he was drowned. But the law ſaith; <hi>Volenti mori non eſt habenda fides,</hi> that is, His word is not to be credited that is deſirous to dye.

                     <p>If they confeſs that, which hath been indeed committed by them, as poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any other kind of murther, which falleth into the power of ſuch perſons to accompliſh; I ſtand not to defend their cauſe.

                        <p>What folly it were for Witches to enter into ſuch deſeprate peril, and to endure ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable tortures for no gain or commodity, and how it comes to paſs that Witches are overthrown by their confeſſions.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>A Las! if they were ſo ſubtil, as Witchmongers make them to be, they would eſpie that it were meer folly for them, not only to make a bargain with the Devil to throw their ſouls into hell fire, but their bodies to the tortures of temporal fire and death, for the accompliſhment of nothing that might benefit themſelves at all: but they would at the leaſtwiſe indent with the Devil, both to enrich them, and alſo to enable them; and finally to endue them with all worldly felicity and pleaſure; which is furtheſt from them of all other. Yea, if they were ſenſible, they would ſay to the Devil, Why ſhould I hearken to you, when you will deceive me? Did you not promiſe my neighbour mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dutton</hi> to ſave and reſcue her; and yet lo ſhe is hanged? ſurely this would oppoſe the Devil very ſore. And it is a wonder, that none, from the beginning of the world, till this day, hath made this and ſuch like objections, whereto the Devil could never make anſwer. But were it not more madneſs for them, to ſerve the Devil, under theſe conditions; and yet to endure whippings with iron rods at the Devils hands: which (as the Witch-mongers write) are ſo ſet on, that the print of the laſhes remain on the Witches body ever after, even ſo long as ſhe hath a day to live?</p>
                     <p>But theſe old women being daunted with authority, circumvented with guile, conſtrained by force, compelled by fear, induced by error, and deceived by ignorance, do fall into ſuch raſh credulity, and ſo are brought unto theſe abſurd confeſſions.

                     <argument>
                        <p>How melancholy abuſeth old women, and of the effects thereof by ſundry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IF any man adviſedly mark their words, actions, cogitations, and geſtures, he ſhall perceive that melancholy abounding in their head, and occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their brain, hath deprived, or rather depraved their judgements and all their ſenſes: I mean not of couſening Witches, but of poor melancholick wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; which are themſelves deceived. For you ſhall underſtand, that the force which melancholy hath; and the effects that it worketh in the body of a man, or rather of a woman, are almoſt incredible. For as ſome of theſe melancholick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons imagine, they are Witches, and by Witchcraft can work wonders, and do what they liſt: ſo do others troubled with this diſeaſe, imagine many ſtrange, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, and impoſſible things: Some, that they are Monarchs and Princes, and that all other men are their ſubject: ſome, that they are brute beaſts: ſome, that they be urinals or earthen pots, greatly fearing to be broken: ſome, that very one that meeteth them, will convey them to the gallowes; and yet in the end hang themſelves. One thought that <hi>Atlas</hi> whom the Poets feign to hold up heaven with his ſhoulders, would be weary, and let the skie fall upon him: another would ſpend a whole day upon a ſtage, imagining that he both heard and ſaw interludes, and therewith made himſelf great ſport. One <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> a Phyſician, otherwiſe ſound enough of mind (as it is ſaid) imagined that he heard and ſaw muſicians continually playing on inſtruments, in a certain place of his houſe. One <hi>Beſſus,</hi> that had killed his father, was notably detected, by imagining that a Swallow upbraided him therewith: ſo as he himſelf thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the murther.</p>
                     <p>But the notableſt example hereof is, of one that was in great perplexity;<note place="margin">Of one that through me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy was induced to think that he had a noſe as big as a houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> imagining that his noſe was as big as a houſe; inſomuch as no friend nor Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an could deliver him from this conceipt, nor yet either eaſe his grief, or ſatisfie his fancy in that behalf: till at the laſt, a Phyſician more expert in this humour than the reſt, uſed this deviſe following. Firſt, when he was to come in at the chamber door being wide open, he ſuddenly ſtayed and withdrew himſelf; ſo as he would not in any wiſe approach nearer then the door. The melancholick perſon muſing her eat, asked him the cauſe why he ſo demeaned himſelf? Who anſwered him in this manner: Sir, your noſe is ſo great, that I can hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into your chamber but I ſhall touch it, and conſequently hurt it. Lo (quoth he) this is the man that muſt do me good; the reſidue of my friends flatter me, and would hide my infirmity from me. Well (ſaid the Phyſician) I will cure you, but you muſt be content to indure a little pain in the dreſſing: which he promiſed patiently to ſuſtain, and conceived certain hope of recovery. Then entred the Phyſician into the chamber, creeping cloſe by the walls, ſeeming to fear the touching and hurting of his noſe. Then did he blind-fold him, which being done, he caught him by the noſe with a pair of pincers, and threw down into a tub, which he had placed before his patient, a great quantity of bloud, with many pieces of bullocks livers, which he had conveyed into the chamber, whileſt the others eyes were bound up, and then gave him liberty to ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſame. He having done thus again two or three times, the melancholick humour was ſo qualified, that the mans mind being ſatisfied, his grief was eaſed, and his diſeaſe cured.</p>

                     <p>But if they may imagine, that they can transform their own bodies, which nevertheleſs remain in the former ſhape: how much more credible is it, that they may falſly ſuppoſe they can hurt and infeeble other mens bodies; or which is leſs, hinder the coming of butter? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what is it that they will not imagine, and conſequently confeſs that they can do? eſpecially being ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly perſwaded thereunto, ſo ſorely tormented, ſo craftily examined, with ſuch promiſes of favour, as whereby they imagine, that they ſhall ever after live in great credit and wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Which thing though it grieved him; yet he was loth to make it ſo appear, as either his wife might be troubled or diſcontented therewith, or his neighbours informed thereof; leſt ill husbandry ſhould be laid to his charge (which in theſe quarters is much abhorred. But when ſhe grew from penſiveneſs, to ſome perturbation of mind; ſo as her accuſtomed reſt began in the night ſeaſon to be withdrawn from her, through ſighing and ſecret lamentation; and that, not without tears, he could not but demand the cauſe of her conceit and extraordinary mourning; But although at that time ſhe cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame, acknowledging nothing to be amiſs with her: ſoon after notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhe fell down before him on her knees, deſiring him to forgive her, for ſhe had grievouſly offended (as ſhe ſaid) both God and him. Her poor husband being abaſhed at this her behaviour, comforted her, as he could; asking her the cauſe of her trouble and grief: who told him, that ſhe had, contrary to Gods Law, and to the offence of all good Chriſtians, to the injury of him, and ſpecially
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53058:25"/>
to the loſs of her own ſoul, bargained and given her ſoul to the Devil, to be delivered unto him within ſhort ſpace. Whereunto her husband anſwered,<note place="margin">Note the Chriſtian comfort of the husband to his wife.</note> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wife, be of good cheer, this thy bargain is void and of none effect: for thou haſt ſold that which is none of thine to ſell; ſith it belongeth to Chriſt, who hath bought it, and deerly paid for it, even with his bloud which he ſhed upon the Croſs; ſo as the Devil hath no intereſt in thee. After this, with like ſubmiſſion, tears, and penitence, ſhe ſaid unto him; Oh husband, I have yet committed another fault, and done you more injury: for I have bewitched you and your children.

                     <p>And (as truly as the Lord liveth) this was the tenor of his words unto me, which I know is true, as proceeding from unfained lips, and from one that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God.

And ſhe (for her part) ſo conſtantly perſwaded her ſelf to be a Witch, that ſhe judged her ſelf worthy of death, inſomuch as being retained in her chamber, ſhe ſaw not any one carrying a faggot to the fire, but ſhe would ſay it was to make a fire to burn her for Witchery. But God knoweth ſhe had bewitched none, neither inſued there any hurt unto any by her imagination, but unto her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And as for the rumbling, it was by occaſion of a ſheep, which was flayed,<note place="margin">A comical ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe.</note> and hung by the wals, ſo as a Dog came and devoured it; whereby grew the noiſe which I before mentioned: and ſhe being now recovered, remaineth a right honeſt woman, far from ſuch impiety, and aſhamed of her imaginations, which ſhe perceiveth to have grown through melancholy.</p>

                     <p>But why ſhould there be more credit given to Witches, when they ſay they have made a real bargain with the Devil, killed a Cow, bewitched Butter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled a Child, fore-ſpoken her neighbour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than when ſhe confeſſeth that ſhe tranſubſtantiateth her ſelf, maketh it rain or hail, flyeth in the air, goeth inviſible, transferreth Corn in the Graſs from one field to another? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you think that in the one their confeſſions be ſound, why ſhould you ſay that they are corrupt in the other; the confeſſion of all theſe things being made at one inſtant, and affirmed with like conſtancy, or rather audacity?

                     <p>We read in <hi>M.

He asked where ſhe learned it: She ſaid, of her Mother, who forbad her to tell any body thereof: He asked her how her Mother taught her? She anſwered, that her Mother committed her to a Maſter, who would at any time do any thing for her: Why then, ſaid he, make it rain but only in my field: And ſo ſhe went to the ſtream, and threw up water in her Maſters name, and made it rain preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And proceeding further with her father, ſhe made it hail in another field, at her fathers requeſt: Hereupon he accuſed his wife, and cauſed her to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and then he new chriſtened his child again: which circumſtance is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among Papiſts, and Witch-mongers: And howſoever the firſt part hereof was proved, there is no doubt, but the latter part was throughly executed. If they could indeed bring theſe things to paſs at their pleaſure, then might they alſo be impediments unto the courſe of all other natural things, and Ordinances appointed by God: as, to cauſe it to hold up, when it ſhould rain;<note place="margin">He that can ly, can ſteal, as he that can work can play.</note> and to make midnight, of high noon; and by thoſe means, I ſay, the Divine power ſhould become ſervile to the will of a Witch, ſo as we could neither eat nor drink, but by their permiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Me thinks <hi>Seneca</hi> might ſatisfie theſe credulous or rather idolatrous people, that run a whore-hunting, either in body or phanſie, after theſe Witches; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all that is attributed unto them, to the derogation of Gods glory.

and ſhowers might be procured and ſtayed by Witches charms and inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: of which kind of things, that there can nothing be wrought, it is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that we need not go to any Philoſophers School, to learn the confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.</p>

And although this could have no credit at the firſt, yet in the end, one of theſe Witches was taken Priſoner, and confeſſed the whole matter; ſo as (ſaith he) the threads, and the line, and the characters were found in the highway and water-plaſhes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> addict themſelves wonderfully to the credit and practiſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; inſomuch as they affirm, that not only their children, but their cattel,<note place="margin">Eye-biting Witches.</note> are (as they call it) eye-bitten, when they fall ſuddenly ſick, and tearm one ſort of their Witches eye-biters; only in that reſpect: yea and they will not ſtick to affirm, that they can rime either man or beaſt to death.

The trial of the Archers ſiniſter dealing, and a proof thereof expreſſed, is; for that he never lightly failed when he ſhot, and for that he killed them; by three a day; and had ſhot three arrows into a rod. This was he that ſhot at a peny on his ſons head, and made ready another Arrow, to have ſlain the Duke of <hi>Remgrave</hi> that commanded it. And doubtleſs, becauſe of his ſingular dexterity in ſhooting, he was reputed a Witch, as doing that which others could not do, nor think to be in the power of man to do: though indeed no miracle, no witchcraft, no impoſſibility nor difficulty conſiſted therein.</p>
                     <p>But this later ſtory I can requite with a familiar example:<note place="margin">A skilful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher puniſhed by an unskilful Juſtice.</note> For at Town <hi>Malling</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> one of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Juſtices, upon the complaint of many wiſe men, and a few fooliſh boys, laid an Archer by the heels; becauſe he ſhot ſo neer the white at Buts: For he was informed and perſwaded, that the poor man played with a Fly, otherwiſe called a Devil or familiar: And becauſe he was certified that the Archer aforeſaid ſhot better than the common ſhooting, which he before had heard of, or ſeen, he conceived it could not be in Gods Name, but by Inchantment; whereby this Archer (as he ſuppoſed by abuſing

                     <p>ALas! what creature being found in ſtate of mind,<note place="margin">It is not likely they would ſo do; <hi>ergo,</hi> a lie.</note> would (without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, make ſuch manner of confeſſions as they do, or would for a trifle, or nothing, make a perfect bargain with the Devil, for her ſoul to be yielded up unto his tortures and everlaſting flames, and that within a very ſhort time; ſpecially being through age moſt commonly unlike to live one whole year? The terrour of hell-fire muſt needs be to them diverſly manifeſted, and much more terrible, becauſe of their weakneſs, nature, and kind, than to any other: as it would appear, if a Witch were but asked, Whether ſhe would be contented to be hanged one year hence, upon condition her diſpleaſure might be wreaked upon her enemy preſently? As for theeves, and ſuch other, they think not to go to hell-fire; but are either perſwaded there is no hell, or that their crime deſerveth it not, or elſe that they have time enough to repent: ſo as, no doubt, if they were perfectly reſolved hereof, they would never make ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures. Neither do I think, that for any ſum of money, they would make ſo direct a bargain to go to hell-fire. Now then I conclude, That confeſſion in this

                        </note> For, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Iſidore,</hi> with the reſt of the ſounder divines, ſay, that theſe perſtigious things, which are wrought by Witches, are fantaſtical: ſo do the ſounder decrees of Councels and Canons agree, that in that caſe, there is no place for criminal action. And the law ſaith, That the confeſſion of ſuch perſons as are illuded, muſt needs be erroneous, and therefore is not to be admitted; for, <hi>Confeſſio debet tenere verum &amp; poſſibile.</hi> But theſe things are oppoſite both to law and nature, and therefore it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, Becauſe theſe Witches confeſs ſo, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is ſo: for the confeſſion differeth from the act, or from the poſſibility of the act. And whatſoever is contrary to nature faileth in his principles, and therefore is naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                     <p>The Law alſo ſaith, <hi>In criminalibus regulariter non ſtatur ſoli confeſſioni rei:</hi> In criminal caſes, or touching life, we muſt not abſolutely ſtand to the confeſſion of the accuſed party: but in theſe matters proofs muſt be brought more clear than the light it ſelf: And in this crime no body muſt be condemned upon preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And where it is objected and urged, that ſince God only knoweth the thoughts, there is none other way of proof but by confeſſion: It is anſwered thus in the law, to wit: Their confeſſion in this caſe containeth an outward act, and the ſame impoſſible both in the law and nature, and alſo unlikely to be true; and therefore <hi>Quod veriſimile non eſt, attendi non debet.</hi> So as, though their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions may be worthy of puniſhment, as whereby they ſhew a will to commit ſuch miſchief, yet not worthy of credit, as that they have ſuch power. For, <hi>Si factum abſit, ſolaque opinione laborent, è ſtultorum genere ſunt;</hi> If they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a fact performed but in opinion, they are to be reputed among the number of fools. Neither may any man by law be condemned for criminal cauſes, upon preſumptions, nor yet by ſingle witneſſes: neither at the accuſation of a capital enemy; who indeed is not to be admitted to give evidence in this caſe; though it pleaſe <hi>M.

But beyond all equity, theſe Inquiſitors have ſhifts and deviſes enough, to plague and kill theſe poor ſouls; for (they ſay) their fault is greateſt of all others, becauſe of their carnal copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with the Devil, and therefore they are to be puniſhed as Hereticks, four manner of wayes; to wit, with Excommunication, deprivation, loſs of goods, and alſo with death.</p>
                     <p>And indeed they find law, and provide means thereby to maintain this their bloudy humor. For it is written in their Popiſh Canons, That as for theſe kind of Hereticks, how much ſoever they repent and return to the faith, they may not be retained alive, or kept in perpetual priſon, but be put to extream death.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of Four capital Crimes objected againſt Witches, all fully anſwered and confuted us frivolous.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIrſt therefore, they lay to their charge Idolatry; but alas, without all reaſon; for, ſuch are properly known to us to be Idolaters, as do exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal worſhip to Idols or ſtrange gods: The furtheſt point that Idolatry can be ſtretched unto, is, that they which are culpable therein, are ſuch as hope for, and ſeek ſalvation at the hands of Idols, or of any other than God: or fix their whole mind and love upon any creature, ſo as the power of God is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and contemned thereby. But Witches neither ſeek nor believe to have ſalvation at the hands of Devils, but by them they are only deceived, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of their fantaſie being corrupted, and ſo infatuated, that they ſuppoſe, confeſs, and ſay, they can do that, which is as far beyond their power and nature to do, as to kill a man at <hi>York</hi> before noon, when they have been ſeen at <hi>London</hi> in that morning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if theſe latter Idolaters, whoſe Idolatry is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and committed only in mind, ſhould be puniſhed by death; then ſhould every covetous man or other, that ſetteth his affection any way too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an earthly creature be executed, and yet perchance the Witch might eſcape ſcot-free.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Apoſtaſie is laid to their charge, whereby it is inferred,<note place="margin">2. Apoſtaſie confuted.</note> that they are worthy to die. But Apoſtaſie is, where any of ſound judgement forſake the Goſpel, learned and well known unto them, and do not only imbrace impiety and infidelity, but oppugne and reſiſt the truth erſt-while by them profeſſed. But alas, theſe poor women go not about to defend any impiety, but after good admonition repent.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They would have them executed for ſeducing the people.<note place="margin">3. Seducing of the people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> But God knoweth, they have ſmall ſtore of Rhetorick or art to ſeduce; except, to tell a tale of <hi>Robin Good-fellow,</hi> to be deceived and ſeduced: Neither may their age or ſex admit that oppinion or accuſation to be juſt; for they themſelves are poor ſeduced ſouls. I for my part (as elſe-where I have ſaid) have proved this point to be falſe in moſt apparent ſort.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, as touching the accuſation,<note place="margin">4. Carnal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation with <hi>Incubus,</hi> confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> which all the Writers uſe herein againſt them for their carnal copulation with <hi>Incubus:</hi> the folly of mens credulity is as much to be wondered at and derided, as the others vain and impoſſible confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the Devil is a Spirit, and hath neither fleſh nor bones, which are to be uſed in the performance of this action. And ſince he alſo lacketh all inſtruments, ſubſtance and ſeed engendred of bloud, it were folly to ſtay overlong in the confutation of that, which is not in the nature of things: And yet muſt I ſay ſomewhat herein, becauſe the opinion hereof is ſo ſtrongly and univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the fables hereof ſo innumerable, whereby <hi>M. Mal. Bodin, Hemingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Hyperius, Danaeus, Eraſtus,</hi> and others that take upon them to write herein, are ſo abuſed, or rather ſeek to abuſe others, as I wonder at their fond cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity in this behalf: For, they affirm undoubtedly,<note place="margin">How the Devil playeth <hi>Succu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> and <hi>Incubus.</hi>
                        </note> that the Devil playeth <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubus</hi> to the man, and carryeth from him the ſeed of Generation, which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth as <hi>Incubus</hi> to the Woman, who many times that way is gotten with child; which child will very naturally (they ſay) become a Witch, and ſuch a one, they affirm, <hi>Merlin</hi> was.</p>

ſaith truly; for that in paradiſe, betwixt the Devil and Man, all wickedneſs was ſo contrived, that man ever ſince hath ſtudied wicked arts; yea, and the Devil will be ſure to be at the middle, and at both ends of every miſchief.

If ſhe be barren, then doth <hi>Incubus</hi> uſe her without deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſeed; becauſe ſuch ſeed ſhould ſerve for no purpoſe. And the Devil avoideth ſuperfluity as much as he may; and yet for her pleaſure and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation together, he goeth to work with her. But by the way, if the Devil were ſo compendious, what ſhould he need to uſe ſuch circumſtances, even in theſe very actions, as to make theſe aſſemblies, conventicles, ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when he hath already bought their bodies, and bargained for their ſouls?

                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt as touching the Devils viſible or inviſible execution of Lechery, it is written, that to ſuch Witches, as before have made a viſible league with the Prieſt, (the Devil I ſhould ſay) there is no neceſſity that <hi>Incubus</hi> ſhould appear inviſible:<note place="margin">This was done at <hi>Ravenſpurge.</hi>

For proof hereof, <hi>James Sprenger</hi> and <hi>Inſtitor</hi> affirm, That many times Witches are ſeen in the fields and woods proſtituting themſelves uncovered and naked up to the navil, wagging and moving their members in every part, according to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of one being about that act of concupiſcence, and yet nothing ſeen of the beholders upon her; ſaving, that after ſuch a convenient time as is required about ſuch a piece of work, a black vapor, of the length and bigneſs of a man, hath been ſeen, as it were, to depart from her, and to aſcend from that place. Nevertheleſs,<note place="margin">Mal. malef.</note> many times the husband ſeeth <hi>Incubus</hi> making him cuckhold, in the likeneſs of a man, and ſometimes ſtriketh off his head with his ſword: but becauſe

the body is nothing but air: it cloſeth together again: ſo as, although the good-wife be ſometimes hurt thereby; yet ſhe maketh him believe he is mad or poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that he doth he knoweth not what. For ſhe hath more pleaſure and delight (they ſay) with <hi>Incubus</hi> that way, than with any mortal man; whereby you may perceive that Spirits are palpable.</p>

                        <p>That the power of Generation is both outwardly and inwardly impeached by Witches, and of divers that had their genitals taken from them by Witches, and by the ſame means again reſtored.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THey alſo affirm, That the virtue of Generation is impeached by Witches, both inwardly, and outwardly: for, intrinſecally they repreſs the courage, and they ſtop the paſſage of the mans ſeed, ſo as it may not deſcend to the veſſels of generation: alſo they hurt extrinſecally, with images, hearbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to prove this true, you ſhall hear certain ſtories out of <hi>M. Mal.</hi> worthy to be noted.</p>
                     <p>A young Prieſt at <hi>Meſpurge,</hi> in the Dioceſs of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> was Bewitched,<note place="margin">Mal. malef. cap. <hi>6.</hi> quae. par. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> ſo as he had no power to occupy any other or mo women than one: and to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out or that thraldom, ſought to flie into another Countrey, where he might uſe that Prieſtly occupation more freely; but all in vain; for evermore he was brought as far backward by night, as he went forward in the day before; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by land, ſometimes in the air, as though he flew. And if this be not true, I am ſure that <hi>James Sprenger</hi> doth lie.</p>
                     <p>For the further confirmation of our belief in <hi>Incubus, M. Mal.</hi> citeth a ſtory of a notable matter executed at <hi>Ravenſpurge,</hi> as true and as cleanly as the reſt. A young man lying with a wench in that Town (ſaith he) was fain to leave his inſtruments of Venery behind him, by means of that preſtigious art of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, ſo as in that place nothing could be ſeen or felt but his plain body. This young man was willed by another Witch, to go to her whom he ſuſpected, and by fair or foul means to require her help: who ſoon after meeting with her, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her fair, but that was in vain; and therefore he caught her by the throat, and with a towel ſtrangled her, ſaying, Reſtore me my tool, or thou ſhalt die for it: ſo as ſhe being ſwoln and black in the face, and through his boiſterous handling ready to die, ſaid, Let me go, and I will help thee: and whileſt he was loſing the towel, ſhe put her hand into his Cod-piece, and touched the place, ſaying, Now haſt thou they deſire: and even at that inſtant he felt himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> A reverend Father, for his life, holineſs, and knowledge notorious,<note place="margin">Ja. Sprenger in Mal. malef. par. <hi>2.</hi> quae. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> being a fryer of the order and company of <hi>Spire,</hi> reported, that a young man at <hi>ſtrift</hi> made lamentable moan unto him for the like loſs; but his gravity ſuffered him not to believe lightly any ſuch reports, and therefore made the young man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſs his cod-piece-point, and ſaw the complaint to be true and juſt. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he adviſed, or rather enjoyned the youth to go to the Witch whom he ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and with flattering words to intreat her, to be ſo good unto him, as to reſtore him his inſtrument: which by that means he obtained, and ſoon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to ſhew himſelf thankful, and told the holy father of his good ſucceſs in that behalf: but he ſo believed him, as he would needs be <hi>Oculatus teſtis,</hi> and made him pull down his Breeches, and ſo was ſatisfied of the truth and certainty thereof.</p>
                     <p>Another young man being in that very taking,<note place="margin">Mal. malef. cap. <hi>7.</hi> par. <hi>2.</hi> quae. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> went to a Witch for the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution thereof, who brought him to a tree, where ſhe ſhewed him a neſt, and bad him climb up and take it.

Nay (quoth ſhe) that is our Pariſh Prieſts tool, but take any other which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53058:32"/>
thou wilt. And it is there affirmed, That ſome have found 20 and ſome 30 of them in one neſt, being there preſerved with provender, as it were at the rack and manger, with this note, wherein there is no contradiction (for all muſt be true that is written againſt Witches) that if a Witch deprive one of his Privities, it is done only by preſtigious means,<note place="margin">Note.</note> ſo as the ſenſes are but illuded.

I ſmild (quoth <hi>Jaſon</hi>) and told him that he was vexed with a diſeaſe called <hi>Incubus,</hi> or the mare, and the reſidue was phantaſie and vain imagination.<note place="margin">The Prieſt is opinionative in the error of his fantaſie.</note> Nay (ſaid the Prieſt) it cannot be ſo; for by our bleſſed Lady, I tell you nothing but that which waking I ſaw with mine eyes, and felt with mine hands; I ſee her when ſhe cometh upon me, and ſtrive to repel her; but I am ſo infeebled that I cannot; and for remedy I have run about from place to place, but no help I could get: At length I went to an old Fryer that was counted an odd fellow, and thought to have had help at his hands; but the Devil a whit had I of him, ſaving, that for remedy, he willed me to pray to God; whom, I am ſure, I wearied with my tedious prayers long before. Then went I unto an old woman, quoth the Prieſt, who was ſaid to be a cunning Witch; and ſhe willed me, that the next morning, about the dawning of the day, I ſhould piſs, and immediately ſhould cover the piſs-pot, or ſtop it with my right nether-ſtock, and before night the Witch ſhould come to viſit me.

                     <argument>
                        <p>A confutation of all the former follies touching <hi>Incubus,</hi> which by examples and proofs of like ſtuffe is ſhewed to be flat knavery, wherein the carnal copulation with Spirits is overthrown.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THus are Lecheries covered with the cloke of <hi>Incubus</hi> and Witchcraft, contrary to nature and verity: and with theſe fables is maintained an opinion, that men have been begotten without carnal copulation, as <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perius,</hi> and others write that <hi>Merlin</hi> was, <hi>An.</hi> 440. ſpecially to excuſe and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the knaveries and lecheries of idle Prieſts, and bawdy Monks,<note place="margin">Merlin <hi>begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of</hi> Incubus.</note> and to cover the ſhame of their lovers and concubines.</p>
                     <p>And alas! when great learned men have been ſo abuſed, with the imagination of <hi>Incubus</hi> his carnal ſociety with Women, miſconſtruing the Scriptures, to wit, the place in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. to the ſeducing of many others; it is the leſſe wonder, that this error hath paſſed ſo generally among the common people.</p>
                     <p>But to uſe few words herein, I hope you underſtand that they affirm and ſay, that <hi>Incubus</hi> is a Spirit, and I truſt you know that a Spirit hath no fleſh nor bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he neither doth eat nor drink. Indeed your gran-dames maids were wont to ſet a bowl of milk before him and his couſin <hi>Robin Goodfellow,</hi> for grinding of Malt or Muſtard, and ſweeping the houſe at midnight: and you have alſo heard, that he would chafe exceedingly, if the maid or good-wife of the houſe, having compaſſion of his nakedneſs, laid any clothes for him, beſides his meſs of white bread and milk, which was his ſtanding fee. For in that caſe he ſaith, What have we here? Hemton hamten, here will I never more tread nor ſtampen.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed in this confutation. Where there is no meat eaten,<note place="margin">Quia humor ſpermaticus ex ſucco alimentari provenit.</note> there can be no ſeed which thereof is gendred; although it be granted, that <hi>Rohin</hi> could both eat aed drink, as being a couſening idle Fryer, or ſome ſuch Rogue, that wanted nothing either belonging to Lechery or Knavery, <hi>&amp;c. Item,</hi> Where the Genital members want, there can be no luſt of the fleſh: neither doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture give any deſire of Generation, where there is no propagation or ſucceſſion required. And as Spirits cannot be grieved with hunger, ſo can they not be inflamed with luſts. And if men ſhould live ever, what needed ſucceſſion or heirs? For that is but an ordinance of God, to ſupply the place, the number, the world, the time, and ſpecially to accompliſh his will.<note place="margin">Ad facultatem generandi tam internae quam externa organa requiruntur.</note> But the power of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration conſiſteth not only in members, but chiefly of vital ſpirits, and of the heat; which ſpirits are never in ſuch a body as <hi>Incubus</hi> hath, being but a body aſſumed, as they themſelves ſay. And yet the moſt part of writers herein affirm, That it is a palpable and viſible body, though all be phanſies and fables that are written hereupon.</p>

For many Poets affirm it, yea, and if you look well into the matter (ſaith he) you ſhall find it eaſie to do. <hi>Item,</hi> he ſaith, that as natural Wolves perſecute beaſts; ſo do theſe Magical Wolves devour men, women and children.<note place="margin">Levit. 6.</note> And yet God ſaith to the People, I trow, and not to the Cattel of <hi>Iſrael, If you obſerve not my commandements, I will ſend among you the beaſts of the field,</hi>

But at <hi>Argentine</hi> there was a wonderful matter done, by three Witches of great wealth, who transforming themſelves into three Cats, aſſaulted a Faggot-maker; who having hurt them all with a faggot-ſtick, was like to have been put to death. But he was miraculouſly delivered, and they worthily puniſhed; as the ſtory ſaith from whence <hi>Bodin</hi> had it.</p>

                        <p>Of a Man turned into an Aſſe, and returned again into a man, by one of <hi>Bodin</hi>'s Witches: S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> opinion thereof.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT happened in the City of <hi>Salamin,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus</hi> (wherein is a good haven) that a ſhip loaden with Merchandize ſtayed there for a ſhort ſpace: In the mean time, many of the Soldiers and Marriners went to ſhoar, to provide freſh victuals; among which number, a certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> man,<note place="margin">What the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſhould the Witch mean to make choice of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man?</note> being a ſturdy young fellow, went to a womans houſe, a little way out of the City, and not far from the Sea ſide, to ſee whether ſhe had any egs to ſell: who perceiving him to be a luſty young fellow, a ſtranger, and far from his Countrey (ſo as upon the loſſe of him there would be the leſs miſs or inquiry) ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with her ſelf how to deſtroy him, and willed him to ſtay there a while, ſhe went to fetch a few egs for him: but ſhe tarryed long, ſo as the young man called unto her, deſiring her to make haſte, for he told her that the tide would be ſpent, and by that means the ſhip would be gone, and leave him behind: Howbeit, after ſome detracting of time, ſhe brought him a few egs, willing him to return to her, if the ſhip were gone when he came. The young fellow returned towards the ſhip: but before he went abroad, he would needs eat an egge or twain to ſatisfie his hunger, and within ſhort ſpace he became dumb and out of his wits, as he afterwards ſaid. When he would have entered into the ſhip, the Marriners beat him back with a cudgel, ſaying, What a murren lacks the Aſſe? Whither the Devil will this Aſſe? The Aſſe or young man,<note place="margin">A ſtrange me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis of body, but not of mind.</note> I cannot tell by which name I ſhould tearm him, being many times repelled, and under-ſtanding their words that called him Aſſe, conſidering that he could ſpeak never a word, and yet could underſtand every body; he thought that he was bewitched by the woman, at whoſe houſe he was. And therefore, when by no means he could get into the boat, but was driven to tarry and ſee her departure; being alſo beaten from place to place, as an Aſſe, he remembred the Witches words, and the words of his own fellows that called him Aſſe, and returned to the Wiches houſe, in whoſe ſervice he remained by the ſpace of three years, doing nothing with his hands all that while, but carryed ſuch burthens as ſhe laid on his back; having only this comfort, that although he were reputed an Aſſe among ſtrangers and beaſts, yet that both this Witch, and all other witches knew him to be a man.</p>
                     <p>After three years were paſſed over, in a morning betimes he went to Town before his Dame; who upon ſome occaſion, of like to make water, ſtayed a little behind: in the mean time, being near to a Church,<note place="margin">Note the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Aſs.</note> he heard a little Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caring bell ring, to the elevation to a morrow Maſs, and not daring to go into the Church, leaſt he ſhould have been beaten and driven out with cudgels, in great devotion he fell down in the Church-yard, upon the knees of his hinder legs, and did lift his forefeet over his head, as the Prieſt doth hold the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the elevation. Which prodigious ſight, when certain Merchants of <hi>Genua</hi> eſpyed, and with wonder beheld; anon cometh the Witch with a cudgel in her hand, beating forth the Aſſe. And becauſe, as it hath been ſaid, ſuch kinds of Witchcrafts are very uſual in thoſe parts, the Merchants aforeſaid made ſuch means as both the Aſſe and Witch were attached by the Judge: And ſhe being examined and ſet upon the rack, confeſſed the whole matter, and promiſed that if ſhe might have liberty to go home, ſhe would reſtore him to his old ſhape; and being diſmiſſed, ſhe did accordingly: ſo as, notwithſtanding, they apprehended her again, and burned her, and the young man returned into his Countrey with a joyful and merry heart.</p>

that which the Witch transformed: Fiftly, that the Merchants, the Inquiſitors, and the Tormentors, could not either ſeverally or joyntly do it, but refer the matter to the Witches courteſie and good pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>But where was the young mans own ſhape all theſe three years,<note place="margin">His ſhape was in the woods: where elſe ſhould it be? <hi>Mal.

It is a certain and general rule, that two ſubſtantial forms cannot be in one ſubject <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> both at once, which is confeſſed by themſelves. The form of the beaſt occupied ſome place in the air, and ſo I think ſhould the form of a man do alſo: For to bring the body of a man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling, into ſuch a thin airy nature, as that it can neither be ſeen nor felt, it may well be unlikely, but it is very impoſſible; for the air is inconſtant, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not in one place: ſo as this airy creature would ſoon be carried into another region, as elſewhere I have largely proved, But indeed our bodies are viſible,<note place="margin">In my diſcourſe of Spirits and Devils, being the 17. book of this volume.</note> ſenſitive, and paſſive, and are indued with many other excellent properties, which all the Devils in hell are not able to alter; neither can one hair of our head periſh, or fall away, or be transformed, without the ſpecial providence of God Almighty.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed unto the probability of this ſtory. What luck was it, that this young fellow of <hi>England,</hi> landing ſo lately in thoſe parts, and that old woman of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> being both of ſo baſe a condition, ſhould both underſtand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers communication; <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Cyprus</hi> being ſo many hundred miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and their languages ſo far differing? I am ſure in theſe dayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in traffick is more uſed, and learning in more price; few young or old Mariners in this Realm can either ſpeak or underſtand the language ſpoken at <hi>Salamim</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>Greek;</hi> and as few old women there can ſpeak our language. But <hi>Bodin</hi> will ſay, You hear, that at the Inquiſitors commandement, and through the Tormentors correction, ſhe promiſed to reſtore him to his own ſhape: and ſo ſhe did, as being thereunto compelled. I anſwer, that as the whole ſtory is an impious fable; ſo this aſſertion is falſe, and diſagreeable to their own doctrine, which maintaineth, That the Witch doth nothing but by the permiſſion and leave of God. For if ſhe could do or undo ſuch a thing at her own pleaſure, or at the commandement of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or for fear of the Tormentors, or for love of the party, or for remorſe of conſcience: then is it not either by the extraordinary leave, nor yet by the like direction of God; except you will make him a confederate with old Witches. I for my part wonder moſt, how they can turn and toſſe a mans body ſo, and make it ſmaller and greater to wit, like a Mouſe, or like an Aſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the man all this while to feel no pain.

                        </note> and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed <hi>to be diſſolved,</hi> when he would have been with Chriſt. The body of man is ſubject to divers kinds of Agues, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and infirmities, whereunto an Aſſes body is not inclined; and mans body muſt be fed with bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not with hay. <hi>Bodins</hi> Aſſe-headed man muſt either eat hay or nothing; as appeareth in the ſtory. Man's body alſo is ſubject unto death, and hath his dayes numbred. If this fellow had died in the mean time, as his hour might have been come, for any thing the Devils, the Witch, or <hi>Bodin</hi> knew; I marvel then what would have become of this Aſſe, or how the Witch could have reſtored him to ſhape, or whether he ſhould have riſen at the day of Judgement in an Aſſes body and ſhape: For <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.44.</note> that <hi>that very body which is ſown and buried a natural body, is raiſed a ſpiritual body.</hi> The life of Jeſus is made manifeſt in our mortal fleſh, and not in the fleſh of an Aſſe.</p>
                     <p>God hath endued every man and every thing with his proper nature, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, form, qualities, and gifts, and directeth their wayes. As for the wayes of an Aſſe, he taketh no ſuch care; howbeit, they have alſo their properties and ſubſtance ſeveral to themſelves.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.39.</note> 
                        <hi>For there is one fleſh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>of men, another fleſh of beaſts, another of fiſhes, another of birds:</hi> And therefore it is abſolutely againſt the ordinance of God (who hath made me a man) that I ſhould flie like a Bird, or ſwim like a fiſh, or creep like a worm, or become an Aſſe in ſhape; inſomuch, as if God would give me leave, I cannot do it; for it were contrary to his own order and decree, and to the conſtitution of any body which he hath made.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> Yea, the ſpirits themſelves have their laws and limits preſcribed, beyond the which they cannot paſs one hairs breadth; otherwiſe God ſhould be contrary to himſelf, which is far from him. Neither is Gods omnipotency hereby qualified, but the Devils impotency mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, who hath none other power, but that which God from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath appointed unto him, conſonant to his nature and ſubſtance. He may well be reſtrained from his power and will, but beyond the ſame he cannot paſs, as being Gods miniſter, no further but in that which he hath from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning enabled him to do: which is, that he being a ſpirit, may with Gods leave and ordinance viciate and corrupt the ſpirit and will of man; werein he is very diligent.</p>
                     <p>What a beaſtly aſſertion is it, that a man, whom God hath made according to his own ſimilitude and likeneſs, ſhould be by a Witch, turned into a beaſt? What an impiety is it to affirm, that an Aſſes body is the temple of the holy Ghoſt? Or, an Aſſe to be the child of God, and God to be his Father, as it is ſaid of man? Which <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſo divinely confuteth, who ſaith, <hi>That our bodies are the members of Chriſt:</hi>

                        <hi>MAlleus Maleficarum, Bodin,</hi> and many other of them that maintain Witchcraft, triumph upon the ſtory of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> as though <hi>Circes</hi> had transformed him with her ſorceties into an Ox, as ſhe did others into Swine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer,<note place="margin">Their ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work is as ſure as to hold a quick Eel by the tale. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.</note> that he was neither in body nor ſhape transformed at all, according to their groſs imagination; as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both by the plain words of the text, and alſo by the opinions of the beſt Interpreters thereof; but that he was for his beaſtly government and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, thrown out of his Kingdom and baniſhed for a time, and driven to hide himſelf in the Wilderneſs, there in exile to lead his life in a beaſtly ſort, among beaſts of the field, and fowles of the air (for by the way I tell you it appeareth by the text, that he was rather turned into the ſhape of a fowl than of a beaſt) until he rejecting his beaſtly conditions, was upon his repentance and amendment called home, and reſtored unto his Kingdom. Howbeit, this (by their confeſſion) was neither Devils nor Witches doing; but a miracle wrought by God, whom alone I acknowledge to bring to paſs ſuch works at his pleaſure.

                     <argument>
                        <p>A ſpecial Objection anſwered concerning Tranſportations, with the conſent of divers Writers thereupon.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOr the maintenance of Witches Tranſportations, they object the words of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.8. Luke 3.9.</note> where the Devil is ſaid to <hi>take up Chriſt, and to ſet him on a pinnacle of the Temple, and on a mountain,</hi> &amp;c. which if he had done in manner and form as they ſuppoſe, it followeth not therefore that Witches could do the like; nor yet that the Devil would do it for them at their pleaſure; for they know not their thoughts, neither can otherwiſe communicate with them. But I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſwered to former objection.</note> that if it were ſo groſſely to be underſtood, as they imagine it, yet ſhould it make nothing to their purpoſe: For, I hope, they will not ſay, that Chriſt had made any ointments, or entred into any league with the Devil, and by vertue thereof was tranſported from out of the Wilderneſs, unto the top of the temple at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> or that the Devil could have maſteries over his body, whoſe ſoul he could never lay hold upon, eſpecially when he might (with a beck of his finger) have called unto him, and have had the aſſiſtance of many legions of Angels:<note place="margin">Mat. 26.53.</note> Neither (as I think) will they preſume to make Chriſt partaker of the Devils purpoſe and ſin in that behalf. If they ſay, This was an action wrought by the ſpecial providence of God, and by his appointment, that the Scripture might be fulfilled; then what gain our Witchmongers by this place? Firſt, for that they may not produce a particular example to prove ſo general an argument. And again, if it were by Gods ſpecial providence and appointment, then why ſhould it not be done by the hand of God,<note place="margin">Job 1.11.2.5.</note> as it was in the ſtory of <hi>Job?</hi> Or, if if it were Gods ſpecial purpoſe and pleaſure, that there ſhould be ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a matter brought to paſs by the hand of the Devil; could not God have given to the wicked Angel extraordinary power, and cloathed him with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſhape, whereby he might be made an inſtrument able to accompliſh that matter, as he did to his Angel that carryed <hi>Habacuck</hi> to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and to them that he ſent to deſtroy <hi>Sodome?</hi> But you ſhall underſtand, that this was done in a viſion, and not in verity of action. So as they have a very cold pull of this place, which is the ſpecial piece of Scripture alledged of them for their Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">J. Calvin in Harmon. Evang. in <hi>Mat. 4.</hi> &amp; <hi>Luke 4.</hi>
                        </note>Hear therefore what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith in his Commentary upon that place, in theſe words, <hi>The queſtion is, whether Chriſt were carryed aloft indeed, or whether it were but in a viſion? Many affirm very obſtinately, that his body was truly and really as they ſay taken up; becauſe they think it too great an indignity for Chriſt to be made ſubject to Satans illuſions.</hi> But this objection is eaſily waſhed away: For it is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity to grant all this to be wrought through Gods permiſſion, or Chriſts vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſubjection: ſo long as we yield not to think that he ſuffered theſe temptations inwardly, that is to ſay, in mind or ſoul. And that which is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſet down by the Evangeliſt, where the Devil ſhewed him all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world, and the glory of the ſame, and that to be done (as it is ſaid in <hi>Luke</hi>) in the twinkling of an eye, doth more agree with a viſion, than with a real action: So far are the very words of <hi>Calvin:</hi> Which differ not one ſyllable nor five words from that which I had written therein, before I looked for his opinion in the matter. And this, I hope, will be ſufficient to overthrow the aſſertions of them that lay the ground of their Tranſportations and flying in the air hereupon.</p>
                     <p>He that will ſay, that theſe words, to wit, <hi>that Chriſt was taken up,</hi> &amp;c. can hardly be applyed to a viſion, let him turn to the Propheſie of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and ſee the ſelf ſame words uſed in a viſion, ſaving that where Chriſt is ſaid to be taken up by the Devil,<note place="margin">Ezek 3.12, 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is taken up, and lifted up, and carryed by the Spirit of God, and yet in a viſion. But they have leſs reaſon that built upon this ſandy rock, the ſupernatural frame of Tranſubſtantiation; as almoſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53058:39"/>
all our Witching Writers do. For <hi>Sprenger</hi> and <hi>Inſtitor</hi> ſay, that the Devil in the likeneſs of a Falcon caught him up; <hi>Danaeus</hi> ſaith, it was in the ſimilitude of a man; others ſay, of an Angel painted with wings; others, inviſible; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Devil can take (ſay they) what ſhape he liſt.<note place="margin">Mal.

Certainly the Devil in this and ſuch like caſes is an inſtrument to work Gods will, and not his own; and therefore it is an ignorant and an ungodly ſaying (as <hi>Calvin</hi> judgeth it) to affirm, that God doth but permit and ſuffer the Devil: For if Satan were ſo at his own liberty (ſaith he) we ſhould be overwhelmed at a ſudden. And doubtleſs, if he had power to hurt the body, there were no way to reſiſt: for he would come invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly upon us, and knock us on the heads; yea he would watch the beſt and diſpatch them, whileſt they were about ſome wicked act.

                     <argument>
                        <p>What ſeveral ſorts of Witches are mentioned in the Scriptures, and how the word <hi>Witch</hi> is there applyed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt what ſorts of Witches ſoever <hi>M. Mal.</hi> or <hi>Bodin</hi> ſay there are; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake only of four kinds of impious Coſeners or Witches (whereof our Witchmongers, old women, which dance with the Fairies, <hi>&amp;e.</hi> are none.) The firſt were <hi>Praeſtigiatores Pharaonis,</hi> which (as all Divines,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> Praeſtigiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Pharaonis.</note> both He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews and others conclude) were but Coſeners and Juglers, deceiving the Kings eyes with illuſions and ſleights, and making falſe things to appear as true; which nevertheleſs our Witches cannot do. The ſecond is <hi>Mecaſapha,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Mecaſapha.</note> which is ſhe that deſtroyeth with poyſon. The third are ſuch as uſe ſundry kinds of Divinations, and hereunto pertain theſe words, <hi>Kaſam, Onen, Ob, Idoni.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> Kaſam, Onen, Ob, Idoni.</note> The fourth is <hi>Habar,</hi> to wit, when Magicians,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>4.</hi> Habar.</note> or rather ſuch as would be reputed cunning therein, mumble certain ſecret words, wherein is thought to be great efficacy.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are all Coſeners and Abuſers of the people in their ſeveral kinds. But becauſe they are all termed of our tranſlators by the name of Witches in the Bible; therefore the lyes of <hi>M. Mal.</hi> and <hi>Bodin,</hi> and all our old Wives tales are applyed unto theſe names, and eaſily believed of the common people, who have never hitherto been inſtructed in the underſtanding of theſe words. In which reſpect, I will (by Gods grace) ſhew you (concerning the ſignification of them) the opinion of the moſt learned in our age; ſpecially of <hi>Johannes Wierus;</hi> who though he himſelf were ſingularly learned in the tongues, yet for his ſatisfaction and full reſolution in the ſame, he ſent for the judgement of <hi>Andraeas Maſſius,</hi> the moſt famous <hi>Hebrician</hi> in the World, and had in it ſuch ſenſe and order, as I mean to ſet down unto you. And yet I give you this note by the way,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft or Inchantment is diverſly taken in the Scriptures; ſometimes nothing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch end as it is commonly thought to do: For,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.23. 2 Reg. 9.22. Gal. 3.1. Mat. 2.1.</note> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. it is all one with Rebellion. <hi>Jeſabel</hi> for her idolatrous life, is called a Witch. Alſo in the new Teſtament, even S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Galathians</hi> are bewitched, becauſe they were ſeduced and led from the true underſtanding of the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> ſometimes it is taken in good part, as the Magicians that came to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and offer to Chriſt; and alſo where <hi>Daniel</hi> is ſaid to be an Inchanter,<note place="margin">Daniel 4.</note> yea a principal Inchanter; which title being given him in divers places of that ſtory, he never ſeemed to refuſe or diſlike; but rather intreateth for the pardon and qualification of the rigor towards other Inchanters, which were meer coſeners indeed; as appeareth in the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 2.8.</note> where you may ſee that the King eſpyed their fetches.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes, ſuch are called Conjurers, as being but Rogues, and lewd people,<note place="margin">Acts 19.</note> would uſe the name of Jeſus to work miracles, whereby, though they being faithleſs could work nothing; yet is their practice condemned by the name
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53058:41"/>
of Conjuration. Sometimes Juglers are called Witches. Sometimes alſo they are called Sorcerers,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.18. Exo. 7.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Acts 13. Exod. 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Act. 13. &amp; 19. Cant. 4.9. Deut. 18.2. Jerem. 27. Acts 8.</note> that impugne the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſeduce others with violent perſwaſions. Sometimes a Murtherer with poyſon, is called a Witch. Sometimes they are ſo termed by the very ſignification of their names; as <hi>Elymas,</hi> which ſignifies a Sorcerer. Sometimes becauſe they ſtudy curious and vain arts. Sometimes it is taken for wounding or grieving of the heart. Yea the very word <hi>Magus,</hi> which is Latin for a Magician, is tranſlated a Witch; and yet it was heretofore alwayes taken in the good part. And at this day it is indifferent to ſay in the Engliſh tongue; She is a Witch; or, She is a wiſe Woman.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes obſervers of Dreams, ſometimes Soothſayers; ſometimes the obſervers of the flying of fowls, of the meeting of toads, the falling of ſalt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are called Witches. Sometimes he or ſhe is called a Witch, that take upon them either for gain or glory, to do miracles; and yet can do nothing. Sometimes they are called Witches in common ſpeech, that are old, lame, curſt, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike, as a nick name. But as for our old Women, that are ſaid to hurt children with their eyes, or Lambs with their looks, or that pull down the Moon out of heaven, or make ſo fooliſh a bargain, or do ſuch homage to the Devil; you ſhall not read in the Bible of any ſuch Witches, or of any ſuch actions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And becauſe I will avoid prolixity and contention both at once, I will admit that <hi>Veneficae</hi> were ſuch Witches, as with their poyſons did much hurt among the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and I will not deny that there remain ſuch unto this day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching men, and making them believe that by vertue of words, and certain Ceremonies, they bring to paſs ſuch miſchiefs, and intoxications, as they indeed accompliſh by poyſons. And this abuſe in coſenage of people, together with the taking of Gods name in vain, in many places of the Scripture is reproved eſpecially by the name of Witchcraft, even where no poyſons are. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſenſe which St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſed to the <hi>Galathians</hi> in theſe words, where he ſheweth plainly, that the true ſignification of Witchcraft is coſenage,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.1.</note> 
                        <hi>O ye fooliſh Galathians</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who hath be witched you?</hi> to wit, <hi>coſened or abuſed you, making you believe a thing which is neither ſo nor ſo!</hi> Whereby he meaneth not to ask of them, who hath with Charmes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or with poyſons deprived them of their health, life, cattel, or children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but whom hath abuſed or coſened them, to make them believe lyes.

                        <hi>which uſed Witchcraft, and bewitched the people of</hi> Samaria, <hi>ſaying that he himſelf was ſome great man.</hi> I demand, in what other thing here do we ſee any Witchcraft, than that he abuſed the people, making them believe he could work miracles, whereas in truth he could do no ſuch thing; as manifeſtly may appear in the 13 and 19 <hi>ver.</hi> of the ſame <hi>chap.</hi> where he wondered at the miracles wrought by

the Apoſtles, and would have purchaſed with mony the power of the holy Ghoſt to work wonders.</p>
                     <p>It will be ſaid, the people had reaſon to believe him, becauſe it is written, <hi>That he of long time had bewitched them with Sorceries.</hi>

                        <p>The place of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> expounded,<note place="margin">Deut. 8.19, 11.</note> wherein are recited all kind of Witches; alſo their opinions confuted, which hold, that they can work ſuch Miracles as are imputed unto them.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe greateſt and moſt common objection is, that if there were not ſome, which could work ſuch miraculous or ſupernatural feats, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or by their Devils, it ſhould not have been ſaid, <hi>Let none be found among you, that maketh his ſon or his daughter to go through the fire, or that uſeth Witchcraft, or is a regarder of times, or a marker of the flying of fowles, or a Sorcerer, or a Charmer, or that counſelleth with Spirits, or a Soothſayer, or that asketh counſel of the dead, or</hi> (as ſome tranſlate it) <hi>that raiſeth the dead.</hi> But as there is no one place in the Scripture that ſaith, they can work Miracles; ſo it ſhall be eaſie to prove, that theſe were all Coſeners, every one abuſing the people in his ſeveral kind; and are accurſed of God. Not that they can do all ſuch things indeed,<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.8. Pſal. 24.8, 10.</note> as there is expreſſed; but for that they take upon them to be the mighty power of God, and to do that which is the only work of him, ſeducing the people, and blaſpheming the Name of God, who will not give his glory to any creature, being himſelf the King of Glory and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I ask, What miracle was wrought by their paſſing through the fire? Truly it cannot be proved that any effect followed; but that the people were bewitched, to ſuppoſe their ſins to be purged thereby; as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> think of ſcourging and whipping themſelves: ſo as Gods power was imputed to that action, and ſo forbidden as an Idolatrous Sorcery. What wonders work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the regarder of times? What other Devil dealeth he withal, than with the ſpirit of Superſtition? Doth he not deceive himſelf and others, and therefore is worthyly condemned for a Witch? What ſpirit uſeth he, which marketh the flying of Fowls? Nevertheleſs, he is here condemned as a practiſer of Witchcraft, becauſe he coſeneth the people, and taketh upon him to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; impiouſly referring Gods certain ordinances to the flittering feathers and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53058:42"/>
uncertain wayes of a bird? The like effects produceth Sorcery, Charming, conſultation with Spirits, Sooth-ſaying, and conſulting with the dead; in every of the which Gods power is obſcured, his glory defaced, and his commandement infringed.</p>
                     <p>And to prove that theſe Sooth-ſayers and Witches are but lying mates and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeners; note theſe words pronounced by God himſelf,<note place="margin">Deut. 8.14.

As touching the reſurrection and reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the body, read <hi>John 5.</hi> and you ſhall manifeſtly ſee, that it is the only work of the Father, who hath given the power thereof to the Son, and to none other, <hi>&amp;c. Dominus percutit, &amp; ipſe medetur: Ego occidam, &amp; ego vivefaciam.</hi> And in many other places it is written, that God giveth life and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all. Although <hi>Plato,</hi> with his Maſter <hi>Socrates,</hi> the chief pillars of theſe vanities ſay, That one <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was called up out of hell, who when he came among the people, told many incredible tales concerning infernal actions. But herein I take up the Proverb, <hi>Amicus Plato, amicus Socrates, ſed major amica veritas.</hi>

                     <p>So as this laſt precept, or laſt part thereof, extending to that which neither can be done by Witch nor Devil, may well expound the other parts and points thereof. For it is not meant hereby, that they can do ſuch things indeed; but that they make men believe they do them, and thereby coſen the people, and take upon them the office of God, and therewithal alſo blaſpheme his holy name, and take it in vain; as by the words of charmes and conjurations doth appear, which you ſhall ſee, if you look into theſe words <hi>Habar</hi> and <hi>Idoni.</hi>

And the Reaſon is therewithal expreſſed in the Canon, to wit, Becauſe hereby is attributed to a creature, that which pertaineth to God only and alone. So as, under this one ſentence <hi>[Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Poyſoner or a Witch to live]</hi> is forbidden both mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Witchcraft; the murther conſiſting in poyſon; the Witchcraft in coſenage or blaſphemy.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of divers poyſoning practices, otherwiſe called <hi>Veneficia,</hi> committed in <hi>Italy, Genua, Millen, Wittenberge,</hi> alſo how they were diſcovered and executed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ANother practice, not unlike to that mentioned in the former Chapter,<note place="margin">Venefica <hi>in</hi> Italy.</note> was done in <hi>Caſſalis</hi> at <hi>Salaſſia</hi> in <hi>Italy, Anno</hi> 1536. where 40 <hi>Veneficae,</hi> or Witches being of one confederacy, renewed a Plague which was then almoſt ceaſed, beſmeering with an ointment and a powder, the poſts and doors of mens houſes; ſo as thereby whole families were poyſoned; and of that ſtuffe they had prepared above 40 crocks for that purpoſe. Herewithal they conveyed inheritances as it pleaſed them, till at length they killed the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and only ſon of one <hi>Necus</hi> (as lightly none died in the houſe but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and their children) which was much noted; and therewithal that one <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drogina</hi> haunted the houſes, ſpecially of them that died: and ſhe being ſuſpected, apprehended, and examined, confeſſed the fact, conſpiracy, and circumſtance, as hath been ſhewed. The like villany was afterwards pactiſed at <hi>Genua,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Veneficae <hi>in</hi> Genua <hi>and</hi> Millen.</note> and execution was done upon the offenders. At <hi>Millen</hi> there was another like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that took none effect. This art conſiſteth as well in poyſoning of Cattel as Men; and that which is done by poyſons unto Cattel, towards their deſtruction, is as commonly attributed to Witches charmes as the other. And I doubt not, but ſome that would be thought cunning in Incantations, and to do miracles, have experience in this behalf: For it is written by divers Authors, that if Wolves dung be hidden in the mangers, racks, or elſe in the hedges about the paſtures, where cattel go (through the antipathy of the nature of the Wolf and other cattel) all the beaſts that ſavour the ſame do not only forbear to eat, but run about as though they were mad, or (as they ſay) bewitched.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Wierus</hi> telleth a notable ſtory of a <hi>Veneficus,</hi> or deſtroyer of cattel, which I thought meet here to repeat.<note place="margin">Of a Butcher a right Venefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Witch.</note> There was (ſaith he) in the Dukedom of <hi>Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge,</hi> not far from <hi>Tubing,</hi> a Butcher, <hi>Anno</hi> 1564. that bargained with a Town for all their hides which were of ſterven cattel, called in theſe parts <hi>Morts.</hi> He with poyſon privily killed in great numbers, their bullocks, ſheep, ſwine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by his bargain of the hides and tallow he grew infinitely rich: And at laſt being ſuſpected, was examined, confeſſed the matter and manner thereof, and was put to death with hot tongs, wherewith his fleſh was pulled from his bones. We for our parts would have killed five poor Women, before we would ſuſpect one rich Butcher.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is objected, That if <hi>Veneficium</hi> were comprehended under the title of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter, it had been a vain repetition, and a diſordered courſe undertaken by <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſet forth a law againſt <hi>Veneficas</hi> ſeverally. But it might ſuffice to anſwer any reaſonable Chriſtian, that ſuch was the pleaſure of the holy Ghoſt, to inſtitute a particular Article hereof, as of a thing more odious, wicked and dangerous, then any other kind of Muther. But he that ſhall read the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Teſtament of Chriſt himſelf, ſhall find this kind of repetition and reiteration of the law moſt common: For, as it is written, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt not grieve nor afflict a ſtranger, for thou was a ſtranger in the land of Aegypt:</hi> ſo are the ſame words found repeated in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.33. Polling and ſhaving of heads and beards is forbidden in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. which was before prohibited in 22. It is written in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal:</hi> and it is repeated in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. and and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. Murther is generally forbidden in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. and likewiſe in 22. and repeated in <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. But the apteſt example is, that Magick is forbidden in three ſeveral places, to wit, once in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. and twice in <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. For the which a man might as well cavil with the holy Ghoſt, as for the other.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AS touching this kind of Witchcraft, the principal part thereof conſiſteth in certain confections prepared by lewd people to procure love; which indeed are meer poyſons, bereaving ſome of the benefit of the brain, and ſo of the ſenſe and underſtanding of the mind. And from ſome it taketh away life, and that is more common then the other. Theſe be called <hi>Philtra,</hi> or <hi>Pocula amatoria,</hi> or <hi>Venenoſa pocula,</hi> or <hi>Hippomanes,</hi> which bad and blind Phyſitians rather practiſe, than Witches or Conjurers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But of what value theſe bables are, towards the end why they are provided, may appear by the opinions of Poets themſelves, from whence was derived the eſtimation of that ſtuffe.

Satan, ſaid he: What doth old <hi>Alice</hi> call thee? ſaid we: Partner, ſaid he: What doth ſhe give thee? ſaid we: Her will, ſaid he: How many haſt thou killed for her? ſaid we: Three, ſaid he: Who are they? ſaid we: A man and his child, ſaid he: What were their names? ſaid we: The childs name was <hi>Edward,</hi> ſaid he: What more then <hi>Edward?</hi> ſaid we: <hi>Edward Ager,</hi> ſaid he: What was the mans name? ſaid we: <hi>Richard,</hi> ſaid he: What more? ſaid we: <hi>Richard Ager,</hi> ſaid he: Where dwelt the man and the child? ſaid we: At <hi>Dig,</hi> at <hi>Dig,</hi> ſaid he: This <hi>Richard Agar</hi> of <hi>Dig,</hi> was a Gentleman of forty pounds land by the year, a very honeſt man, but would often ſay, he was bewitched, and languiſhed long before he dyed: Whom elſe haſt thou killed for her? ſaid we: <hi>Woltons</hi> wife, ſaid he: Where did ſhe dwel? In <hi>Weſtwell,</hi> ſaid he: What elſe haſt thou done for her? ſaid we: What ſhe would have me, ſaid he: What is that? ſaid we: To fetch her meat, drink, and corn, ſaid he: Where hadſt thou it? ſaid we: In every houſe, ſaid he: Name the houſes, ſaid we: At <hi>Petmans,</hi> at <hi>Farmes,</hi> at <hi>Millens,</hi> at <hi>Fullers,</hi> and in every houſe. After this, we commanded Satan in the name of Jeſus Chriſt to depart from her, and never to trouble her any more, nor any man elſe: Then he ſaid, He would go, he would go; but he went not: Then we commanded him as before with ſome more words. Then he ſaid, I go, I go; and ſo he departed. Then ſaid the maid, He is gone, Lord have mercy upon me, for he would have killed me. And then we kneeled down and gave God thanks, with the maiden; praying that God would keep her from Satans power, and aſſiſt her with his

grace. And noting this in a piece of paper, we departed. Satans voice did differ much from the maids voice, and all that he ſpake, was in his own name: Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed thus:</p>

The Princes and Monarchs of the earth repoſed no ſmall confidence therein: the Prieſts, which lived thereupon, were ſo cunning, as they alſo overtook almoſt all the godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men of that age; partly with their doubtful anſwers, as that which was made unto <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Aio te Aeacida Romanos vincere poſſe;</hi>

And if it were, yet ſhould there be ſuch conditions annexed thereunto,<note place="margin">The ſubtilty of our Oracles.</note> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remained unto them a ſtarting hole, and matter enough to cavil upon, as that the party ſacrificed muſt be a Virgin, no baſtard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Furthermore, of two things only propoſed, and where yea or nay only doth anſwer the queſtion, it is an even lay, that an Idiot ſhall conjecture right: So as, if things fell out contrary, the fault was alwayes in the Interpreter, and not in the Oracle or the Prophet. But what marvel (I ſay) though the multitude and common people have been abuſed herein, ſince Lawyers, Philoſophers, Phyſitians, Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Divines, General Councels, and Princes, have with great negligence and ignorance been deceived and ſeduced hereby, as ſwallowing up and devouring an inveterate opinion, received of their elders, without due examination of the circumſtance?</p>
                     <p>Howbeit, the godly and learned Fathers (as it appeareth) have alwayes had a ſpecial care and reſpect, that they attributed not unto God ſuch deviliſh devices; but referred them to him who indeed is the inventer and author, though not the perſonal executioner, in manner and form as they ſuppoſed: ſo as the matter of faith was not thereby by them impeached. But who can aſſure himſelf not to be deceived in matters concerning Spirits, when the Apoſtles themſelves were ſo far from knowing them, as even after the Reſurrection of Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 20.9.</note> having heard him preach and expound the Scriptures, all his life time, they ſhewed themſelves not only ignorant therein, but alſo to have miſconceived thereof? Did not the Apoſtle <hi>Thomas</hi> think that Chriſt himſelf himſelf had been a Spirit, until Chriſt told him plainly, that a Spirit was no ſuch creature as had fleſh and bones, the which (he ſaid) <hi>Thomas</hi> might ſee to be in him? And for the further certifying and ſatisfying of his mind, he commended unto him his hands to be ſeen, and his ſides to be felt. <hi>Thomas,</hi> if the anſwer be true that ſome make hereunto, to wit, that Spirits take formes and ſhapes of bodies at their pleaſure, might have anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Chriſt, and remaining unſatisfied might have ſaid, Oh Sir, what do you tell
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53058:48"/>
me that Spirits have no fleſh and bones? Why they can take ſhapes and formes, and ſo perchance have you done. Which argument all the Witchmongers in the World ſhall never he able to anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Some of them that maintain the Creation, the Transformation, the Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Tranſubſtantiation of Witches, object that Spirits are not palpable, though viſible, and anſwer the place by me before cited: ſo as the feeling and not the ſeeing ſhould ſatisfie <hi>Thomas.</hi> But he that ſhall well weigh the text and the circumſtances thereof, ſhall perceive, that the fault of <hi>Thomas</hi> his increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was ſecondly bewrayed, and condemned, in that he would not truſt his own eyes, nor the view taken by his fellow-Apoſtles, who might have been thought too credulous in this caſe,<note place="margin">John 20.29.</note> if Spirits could take ſhapes at their pleaſure. <hi>Jeſus ſaith to him, becauſe thou haſt ſeen</hi> (and not, becauſe thou haſt felt) <hi>thou believeſt. Item,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are they that believe and ſee not,</hi> (and not, they that believe and feel not.) Whereby he noteth, that our corporal eyes may diſcern betwixt a Spirit and a natural body; reproving him, becauſe he ſo much relyed upon his exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſenſes, in caſes where faith ſhould have prevailed; and here, in a matter of faith revealed in the Word, would not credit the miracle which was exhibited unto him in a moſt natural and ſenſible ſort.</p>

The Spirit taking compaſſion on the Prieſts caſe, and upon his grief of mind in this behalf, appeared unto him, and told him flatly, that his late gueſt <hi>Gregory</hi> was the cauſe of all his miſery: For (ſaith the Devil) he hath baniſhed me, ſo that I cannot return without a ſpecial licenſe or paſport from him.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53058:48"/>
of his good chear; and ſaid, that if he would not be ſo good unto him, as to write his Letter to the Devil in his behalf, he ſhould be utterly undone: To be ſhort, his importunity was ſuch, that he obtained of <hi>Gregory</hi> his Letter to the Devil, who wrote unto him in manner and form following, word for word, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitto tibi redire in locum tuum, &amp; agere qua conſueviſti:</hi> which is in Engliſh, <hi>I am content thou return into thy place, and do as thou waſt wont.</hi> Immediately upon the receipt of this Letter, the Idol ſpake as before.

                           <hi>Apollo,</hi> who was called <hi>Pytho,</hi> compared to the Rood of Grace: <hi>Gregories</hi> Letter to the Devil confuted.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHat need many words to confute this fable? For if <hi>Gregory</hi> had been an honeſt man, he would never have willingly permitted, that the people ſhould have been further Coſened with ſuch a lying ſpirit; or if he had been half ſo holy as <hi>Euſebius</hi> maketh him, he would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented or yielded to ſo lewd a requeſt of the Prieſt, nor have written ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Letter, no not though good might have come thereof: And therefore as well by the impoſſibility and folly contained therein, as of the impiety (whereof I dare excuſe <hi>Gregory</hi>) you may perceive it to be a lye. Me thinks they which ſtill maintain that the Devil made anſwer in the Idol of <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. may have ſufficient perſwaſion to revoke their erroneous opinions, in that it appeareth in record, that ſuch men as were skilful in <hi>Augury,</hi> did take upon them to give Oracles at <hi>Delphos</hi> in the place of <hi>Apollo;</hi> of which number <hi>Tiſanius</hi> the ſon of <hi>Antiochus</hi> was one: But vain is the anſwer of Idols. Our <hi>Rood of grace,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Zach. 10.</note> with the help of little S. <hi>Rumbal,</hi> was not inferior to the Idol of <hi>Apollo;</hi> for theſe could not work eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miracles, but manifeſt the internal thoughts of the heart, I believe with more lively ſhew, both of humanity and alſo of Divinity, then the other. As, if you read M. <hi>Lamberts</hi> book of the perambulation of <hi>Kent,</hi> it ſhall partly appear.<note place="margin">W. Lambert in titulo Boxley.</note> But if you talk with them that have been beholders thereof, you will be ſatisfied herein. And yet in the blind time of Popery, no man might under pain or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor without danger of death, ſuſpect the fraud. Nay, what Papiſts will yet confeſs they were Idols, though the wiers that made their eyes gogle, the pins that faſtened them to the poſts to make them ſeem heavy, were ſeen and burnt together with the Images themſelves, the knavery of the Prieſts bewrayed, and every circumſtance thereof detected and manifeſted?</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>That <hi>Samuel</hi> was not raiſed indeed, and how <hi>Bodin</hi> and all Papiſts dote herein, and that ſouls cannot be raiſed by Witchcraft.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FUrthermore, it is not likely that God would anſwer <hi>Saul</hi> by dead <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he would not anſwer him by living <hi>Samuel;</hi> and moſt unlikely of all, that God would anſwer him by a Devil, that denyed to do it by a Prophet. That he was not brought up <hi>per force,</hi> the whole courſe of the Scripture witneſſeth, and proveth; as alſo our own reaſon may give us to underſtand. For what quiet reſt could the ſouls of the elect enjoy or poſſeſs in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, if they were to be plucked from thence at a Witches call and commandement? But ſo ſhould the Devil have power in heaven, where he is unworthy to have any place himſelf, and therefore unmeet to command others.</p>
                     <p>Many other of the Fathers are flatly againſt the raiſing up of <hi>Samuel;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his book <hi>De anima: Juſtin Martyr, In explicatione, quae.</hi> 25. <hi>Rabanus, In epiſtolis ad Bonoſ.

                        </note> in maintenance thereof, falleth into many abſurdities, proving by the ſmall faults that <hi>Saul</hi> had committed, that he was an elect; for the greateſt matter, ſaith he, laid unto his charge, is the reſerving of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was an elect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> confirming his opinion with many ridiculous fables, and with this argument, to wit, his fault was too little to deſerve damnation; for <hi>Paul</hi> would not have the inceſtuous man puniſhed too ſore, that his ſoul might be ſaved. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in another place was not only deceived in the actual raiſing up of <hi>Samuels</hi> ſoul, but affirmed, that all the ſouls of the Prophets and juſt men are ſubject to the power of Witches. And yet were the <hi>Heathen</hi> much more fond herein, who (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> affirmeth) boaſted that they could call up the ſouls of the dead, and yet did think that their ſouls dyed with their bodies. Whereby is to be ſeens how alwayes the world hath been abuſed in the matters of Witchcraft and Conjuration. The Necromancers affirm, that the ſpirit of any man may be called up, or recalled (as they term it) before one year be paſt, after their departure from the body: Which <hi>C. Agrippa,</hi> in his book <hi>De occulta Philoſophia</hi> ſaith, may be done by certain natural forces and bonds. And therefore corpſes in times paſt were accompanied and watched with lights, ſprinkled with holy water, perfumed with incenſe, and purged with prayer all the while they were above ground: otherwiſe the Serpent (as the Maſters of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay) would devour them, as the food appointed him by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. alledging alſo this place, <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep,</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>That neither the Devil nor <hi>Samuel</hi> was raiſed, but that it was a meer coſenage, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the guiſe of our <hi>Pythoniſts.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AGain, if the Devil appeared, and not <hi>Samuel,</hi> why is it ſaid in <hi>Eccl.</hi> that <hi>he ſlept?</hi> for the Devil neither ſleepeth nor dyeth. But in truth we may gather, that it was neither the Devil in perſon, nor <hi>Samuel:</hi> but a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is here deſcribed according to the deceived opinion and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Saul.</hi> Howbeit <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that both theſe ſides may eaſily be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But we ſhall not need to fetch an expoſition ſo far off: for indeed (me thinks) it is <hi>Longe petita;</hi> nor to deſcend ſo low as hell, to fetch up a Devil to expound this place.<note place="margin">Pompanacius lib. de incant. cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> For it is ridiculous (as <hi>Pompanacius</hi> ſaith) to leave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt things, and ſuch as by natural reaſon may be proved, to ſeek un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known things, which by no likelihood can be conceived, nor tryed by any rule of reaſon. But inſomuch as we have liberty by S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> rule, in ſuch places of Scripture as ſeem to contain either contrariety or abſurdity, to vary from the letter, and to make a godly conſtruction agreeable to the word; let us confeſs that <hi>Samuel</hi> was not raiſed, for that were repugnant to the word, and ſee whether this illuſion may not be contrived by the art and cunning of the Woman, without any of theſe ſupernatural devices; for I could cite a hundred Papiſtical and coſening practices, as difficult as this, and as cleanly handled. And it is to be ſurely thought, if it had been a Devil, the text would have noted it in ſome place of the ſtory,<note place="margin">J. Bod. lib. de dam. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> as it doth not: But <hi>Bodin</hi> helpeth me exceedingly in this point, wherein he forſaketh, he ſaith, <hi>Auguſtine, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>D.

                        <p>The objection of the Witchmongers concerning this place fully anſwered, and what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are to be conſidered for the underſtanding of this ſtory, which is plainly opened from the beginning of <hi>1 Sam. 28.</hi> to ver. <hi>12.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHere ſuch a ſupernatural miracle is wrought, no doubt it is a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of truth,<note place="margin">P. Martyr in comment. in <hi>1 Sam. 28.9.</hi>
                        </note> as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> affirmeth. And in this caſe it ſhould have been a witneſs of lyes; for, ſaith he, a matter of ſuch weight cannot be attributed to the Devil, but it is the mighty power of God that doth accompliſh it. And if it lay in a Witches power to call up a Devil; yet it lyeth not in a Witches power to work ſuch miracles;<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.8.</note> for, <hi>God will not give his power and glory to any creature.</hi> To underſtand this place, we muſt diligently examine the circumſtance thereof: It was well known, that <hi>Saul,</hi> before he reſorted to the Witch, was in deſpair of the mercies and goodneſs of God; partly for that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> told him long before, that he ſhould be overthrown, and <hi>David</hi> ſhould have his place; and partly, becauſe God before had refuſed to anſwer him, either by <hi>Samuel</hi> when he lived, or by any other Prophet, or by <hi>Urim</hi> or <hi>Thummim,</hi> &amp;c. And if you deſire to ſee this matter diſcuſſed,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.</note> turn to 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. and confer my words therewith.</p>

                        <hi>Saul</hi> ſeeing the hoſt of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> come upon him, which thing could not be unknown to all the people, fainted, becauſe he ſaw their ſtrength, and his own weakneſs, and ſpecially that he was forſaken: ſo as being now ſtrait of mind, deſperate, and a very fool, he goeth to certain of his ſervants that ſaw in what taking he was, and asked them for a Woman that had a familiar
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53058:50"/>
Spirit, and they told him by and by, that there dwelt one at <hi>Endor.</hi> By the way you ſhall underſtand, that both <hi>Saul</hi> and his Servants, meant ſuch a one as could by her Spirit raiſe up <hi>Samuel,</hi> or any other that was dead and buryed: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſee they were deceived, though it were true, that ſhe took upon her ſo to do. To what uſe then ſerved her familiar ſpirit, which you conceive ſhe had, becauſe <hi>Sauls</hi> ſervants ſaid ſo? Surely, as they were deceived and abuſed in part, ſo doubtleſs were they in the reſt; for to what purpoſe, I ſay, ſhould her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſerve, if not for ſuch intents as they reported, and ſhe undertook? I think you will grant, that <hi>Sauls</hi> men never ſaw her familiar; for I never heard any yet of credit ſay, that he was ſo much in the Witches favour, as to ſee her Devil; although indeed we read amongſt the Popiſh trumpery,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Cicilies</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar.</note> that S. <hi>Cicilie</hi> had an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to her familiar, and that ſhe could ſhew him to whom ſhe would, and that ſhe might ask and have what ſhe or her friend liſt; as appeareth in the leſſon read in the Popiſh Church on S. <hi>Cicilies</hi> day. Well, I perceive the Woman of <hi>Endors</hi> ſpirit was a counterfeit, and kept belike at her cloſet at <hi>Endor,</hi> or in the bottle, with mother <hi>Alices</hi> Devil at <hi>Weſtwell,</hi> and are now bewrayed and fled together to <hi>Limbo patrum,</hi> &amp;c. And though <hi>Saul</hi> were bewitched and blinded in the matter, yet doubtleſs a wiſe man would have perchance eſpied her knavery.

                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Burcot.

This fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by the name of <hi>Feats</hi> was a Jugler, by the name of <hi>Hilles</hi> a Witch or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, every way a Coſener; his qualities and feats were to me, and many others, well known and detected: And yet the opinion conceived of him, was moſt ſtrange and wonderful, even with ſuch and in ſuch caſes, as it grieveth me to think of; ſpecially becauſe his knavery and coſenage reached to the ſhedding of innocent blood. But now forſooth, <hi>Saul</hi> covereth himſelf with a net;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.8.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not be known, he put on other garments: but to bring that matter to paſs, he muſt have been cut ſhorter by the head and ſoulders,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ibid.</hi> 10.23.</note> for by ſo much he was higher then any of the people: and therefore whatſoever face the crafty quean did ſet upon it, ſhe knew him well enough. And for further proof thereof, you may underſtand, that the Princes of the <hi>Jews</hi> were much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with the people. And it appeareth manifeſtly, that <hi>Saul</hi> dwelt very near to <hi>Endor,</hi> ſo as ſhe ſhould the rather know him; for in the evening he went from his lodging unto her houſe: neither ſhould it ſeem that ſhe was gone to bed when he came; but becauſe that may be uncertain, you may ſee in the proceſs of the text, That in a piece of the night he went from his houſe to hers,<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>28.8.</hi>
                        </note> and with much ado intreated her to conſent to his requeſt.

But ſo divine a ſentence maketh much for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Witches credit, and to the advancement of her gains.

Truly, if all ſuch Oracles, as that of <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. (before the coming of Chriſt) had been true, and done according to the report, which hath been brought through divers ages, and from far Countries unto us,

without Prieſtly fraud or guil, or as the ſpirits of Propheſie, and working of Miracles, had been inſerted into a Idol, as hath been ſuppoſed; yet we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may conceive, that Chriſts coming was not ſo fruitleſs and prejudicial in this point unto us, as to take away his ſpirit of Propheſie and Divination from out of the mouth of his elect people, and good Prophets, giving no anſwer of any thing to come by them, nor by <hi>Urim</hi> nor <hi>Thummim,</hi> as he was wont, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet to leave the Devil in the mouth of a Witch, or an Idol to Propheſie or work Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the hinderance of his glorious Goſpel, to the diſcountenance of his Church, and to the furtherance of Infidelity and falſe religion; whereas the working of Miracles was the only,<note place="margin">The true end of Miracles.</note> or at leaſt, the moſt ſpecial means that moved men to believe in Chriſt, as appeareth in ſundry places of the Goſpel, and ſpecially in <hi>John,</hi>

Now is not our dead carcaſe raiſed any more up by Miracle, but our dead bodies be ſtill in the grave, and our ſouls are raiſed to life by Chriſt. Now the ears of the deaf are not opened by Miracle, but they which had their ears ſhut before, have them now opened to their ſalvation. The miraculous healing of the ſick, by anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſpoken of by S. <hi>James,</hi> is objected by many, ſpecially by the Papiſts,<note place="margin">James 5.15.</note> for the maintenance of their Sacrament of Extream Unction; which is apiſhly and vainly uſed in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, as though the miraculous gift had continuance till this day: Herein you ſhall ſee what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaketh in his Inſtitutions,<note place="margin">J.

Euſebius</hi> (in his firſt book <hi>De praedicatione Evangelii,</hi> the title whereof is this, <hi>That the power of Devils is taken away by the coming of Chriſt</hi>) ſaith, All anſwers made by Devils, all Soothſayings and Divinations of men are gone and vaniſhed away. <hi>Item,</hi> he citeth <hi>Porphyry,</hi> in his book againſt Chriſtian Religion, wherein theſe words are rehearſed, <hi>It is no marvel, though the Plague be ſo hot in this City; for ever ſince Jeſus hath been worſhipped, we can obtain nothing that good is at the hands, of our Gods.</hi> And of this defection and ceaſing of Oracles writeth <hi>Cicero</hi> long before, and that to have happened alſo before his time. Howbeit, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lone ſince <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Apollo</hi> was forced to grant, that ſo long as any relike of a Martyr was held to his noſe, he could not make any anſwer or Oracle. So as one may perceive, that the Heathen were wiſer in this behalf then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians, who in times paſt were called <hi>Oppugnatores incantamentorum,</hi> as the Engliſh Princes are called <hi>Defenſores fidei. Plutarch</hi> calleth <hi>Boeotia</hi> (as we call bablers) by the name of <hi>Many words,</hi> becauſe of the multitude of Oracles there; which now (ſaith he) are like to a ſpring or fountain which is dryed up. If any one remained, I would ride five hundred miles to ſee it: but in the whole world there is not one to be ſeen at this hour; Popiſh coſenages excepted.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, That the cauſe of this defection of Oracles, was the Devils death, whoſe life he held to be determinable and mortal, ſaying, they dyed for very age; and that the divining Prieſts were blown up with a Whirle-winde, and ſunk with an earthquake.<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>PLutarch</hi> ſaith, That his Countreyman <hi>Epitherſes</hi> told him, that as he paſſed by Sea into <hi>Italy,</hi> many paſſengers being in his boat, in an evening when they were about the Iſlands <hi>Echinadae,</hi> the wind quite ceaſed, and the ſhip driving with the tide, was brought at laſt to <hi>Pax;</hi> and whileſt ſome ſlept, and others quaft, and otherſome were awake (perhaps in as ill caſe as the reſt) after ſupper ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly a voyce was heard calling <hi>Thamus,</hi> in ſuch ſort as every man marvelled. This <hi>Thamus</hi> was a Pilot born in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Thamus</hi> having little to do, thought to play with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whom he might eaſily overtake with ſuch a jeſt.</note> unknown to many that were in the ſhip: wherefore being twice called, he anſwered nothing; but the third time he anſwered: and the other with a lowder voyce commanded him, that when he came to <hi>Palodes,</hi> he ſhould tell them, That the great God <hi>Pan</hi> was departed. Whereat every one was aſtonyed (as <hi>Epitherſes</hi> affirmed.) And being in conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation what were beſt to do, <hi>Thamus</hi> concluded, that if the wind were high, they muſt paſs by with ſilence; but if the weather were calme, he muſt utter that which he had heard. But when they came to <hi>Palodes,</hi> and the weather calme, <hi>Thamus</hi> looking out toward the land, cryed aloud, that the great God <hi>Pan</hi> was deceaſed; and immediately there followed a lamentable noiſe of a multitude of people, as it were, with great wonder and admiration. And becauſe there were many in the ſhip, they ſaid, the fame thereof was ſpeedily brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Thamus</hi> ſent for by <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor, who gave ſuch credit thereto, that he diligently inquired and asked who that <hi>Pan</hi> was. The learned men about him ſuppoſed, that <hi>Pan</hi> was he who was the ſon of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Penelope,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Euſebius</hi>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:53058:55"/>
ſaith, That this chanced in the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour, when Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all Devils, <hi>&amp;c. Paulus Martius,</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Ovids Faſti,</hi> ſaith, that this voyce was heard out of <hi>Paxe,</hi> that very night that Chriſt ſuffered, in the year of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the nineteenth. Surely, this was a merry jeſt deviſed by <hi>Thamus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A detection of <hi>Thamus</hi> his knavery.</note> who with ſome confederates thought to make ſport with the paſſengers, who were ſome aſleep, and ſome drunk, and ſome other at play, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whiles the firſt voice was uſed: And at the ſecond voyce, to wit, when he ſhould deliver his meſſage, he being an old Pilot, knew where ſome noiſe was uſual, by means of ſome Eccho in the Sea, and thought he would (to the aſtoniſhment of them) accompliſh his device, if the weather proved calm: Whereby may appear, that he would in other caſes of tempeſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> rather attend to more ſerious buſineſs, then to that ridiculous matter; for why elſe ſhould he not do his errand in rough weather, as well as in calm? or, what need he tell the Devil thereof, when the Devil told it him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and with much more expedition could have done the errand himſelf?</p>
                     <p>But you ſhall read in the Legend a fable, an Oracle I would ſay,<note place="margin">Legend aur. in vita ſancti An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreae. fol. <hi>39.</hi>

A Woman in her travel ſent her Siſter to <hi>Diana,</hi> which was the Devil in an Idol (as all thoſe Oracles are ſaid to be) and willed her to make her Prayers, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a requeſt, to know of her ſafe delivery; which thing ſhe did: But the Devil anſwered, Why prayeſt thou to me? I cannot help thee,<note place="margin">A gentle and a godly Devil.</note> but go pray to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew</hi> the Apoſtle, and he may help thy ſiſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lo, this was not only a gentle, but a godly Devil, pittying the Womans caſe, who revealing his own diſability, enabled S. <hi>Andrew</hi> more. I know ſome Proteſtants will ſay, That the Devil, to maintain Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> referred the Maid to S. <hi>Andrew:</hi> But what anſwer will the Papiſts make, who think it great piety to pray unto Saints, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence a honeſt courteſie in the Devil, to ſend her to S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> who would not fail to ſerve her turn, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>

                        </note> This practice began in the Oaks of <hi>Dodona,</hi> in the which was a wood, the Trees thereof (they ſay) could ſpeak. And this was done by a knave in a hollow-tree, that ſeemed ſound unto the ſimple people. This Wood was in <hi>Moloſſus</hi> a part of <hi>Greece,</hi> called <hi>Epyrus,</hi> and it was named <hi>Dodonas</hi> Oracle. There were many Oracles in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> namely, of <hi>Hercules,</hi> of <hi>Apollo,</hi> of <hi>Minerva,</hi> of <hi>Diana,</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and of the Ox <hi>Apys,</hi> who was the ſon of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but his image was worſhipped in the likeneſs of an Ox. <hi>Latona,</hi> who was the Mother of <hi>Apollo,</hi> was an Oracle in the City of <hi>Bute.</hi> The Prieſts of <hi>Apollo,</hi> who alwayes counterfeited fury and madneſs, gave Oracles in the Temple called <hi>Clarius,</hi> within the City of <hi>Colophon</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> At <hi>Thebes</hi> in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Loebadia, Trophonius</hi> was the chief Oracle. At <hi>Memphis,</hi> a Cow; at <hi>Corinth,</hi> an Ox, called <hi>Mineus;</hi> in <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> a Crocodile; in <hi>Athens,</hi> a Prophet called <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> who indeed dyed at <hi>Thebes,</hi> where they ſay, the earth opened and ſwallowed him up quick. At <hi>Delphos</hi> was the great Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> where De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils gave Oracles by maids (as ſome ſay) though indeed it was done by Prieſts. It was built upon <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> hill in <hi>Greece.</hi> And the defenders of Oracles ſay, that even as rivers oftentimes are diverted to another courſe; ſo likewiſe the ſpirit, which inſpired the chief Prophets, may for a time be ſilent, and revive again by revolution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſaith, That the ſpirits which attended on Oracles, waxed weary of the peoples curioſity and importunity, and for ſhame forſook the Temple. But as one that of late hath written againſt Propheſies,<note place="margin">

But whereas theſe great Doctors ſuppoſe, that the cauſe of their diſpatch was the coming of Chriſt; if they mean that the Devil dyed, ſo ſoon as He was born; or, that then he gave over his occupation, they are deceived: For the Popiſh Church hath made a continual practice hereof, partly for their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate profit, lucre, and gain; and partly to be had in eſtimation of the World, and in admiration among the ſimple. But indeed, men that have learned Chriſt, and been converſant in his Word, have diſcovered and ſhaken off the vanity and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination hereof. But if thoſe Doctors had lived till this day, they would have ſaid and written, that Oracles had ceaſed, or rather been driven out of <hi>England,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight,<note place="margin">In whoſe dayes Oracles ceaſed in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> and of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Daughter; who have done ſo much in that behalf, as at this hour, they are not only all gone, but forgotten here in this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, where they ſwarmed as thick as they did in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> or in any other place in the world. But the credit they had, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended not upon their deſert, but upon the credulity of others.

                     <p>THere are Books carryed about concerning this matter, under the name of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who (as <hi>Philo, in lib. gigantum,</hi> ſaith) was the inventor of the expoſition of Dreams; and ſo likewiſe of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi> But <hi>Cicero, in lib. de divinatione,</hi> confuteth the vanity and folly of them that give credit to Dreams.

                     <p>Certainly, men never lightly fail to Dream by night, of that which they medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate by day: and by day they ſee divers and ſundry things, and conceive them ſeverally in their minds: Then thoſe mixed conceits being laid up in the cloſet of the memory, ſtrive together; which, becauſe the phantaſie cannot diſcern nor diſcuſs, ſome certain thing gathered of many conceits is bred and contrived in one together.

                     <p>IT is held and maintained by divers, and gathered out of the 12 of <hi>Numbers,</hi> that all which was written or ſpoken by the Prophets, among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (Moſes excepted) was propounded to them by Dreams.

And if we expect revelations in our Dreams, now, when Chriſt is come, we ſhall deceive our ſelves; for in him are fulfilled all Dreams and Propheſies.<note place="margin">J.

Theſe Sacrifices were full of Ceremonies, they were powdered with conſecrated Salt, and kindled with fire, which was preſerved in the Tabernacle of the Lord: which fire (ſome think) was ſent down from heaven.

The like folly is to be imputed unto them that obſerve (as true or probable) old verſes, wherein can be no reaſonable cauſe of ſuch effects which are brought to paſs only by Gods power, and at his pleaſure. Of this ſort be theſe that follow:

                     <p>NAtural Augury is a Phyſical or Philoſophical obſervation; becauſe humane and natural reaſon may be yielded for ſuch events: as if one hear the Cock crow many times together, a man may gueſs that rain will follow ſhortly, as by the crying of Rooks, and by their extraordinary uſing of their wings in their flight, becauſe through a natural inſtinct, provoked by the impreſſion of the heavenly bodies, they are moved to know the times, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſpoſition of the weather, as it is neceſſary for their natures. And therefore <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, <hi>Milvus in coelo cognovit tempus ſuum.</hi> The Phyſitian may argue a ſtrength towards his patient, when he heareth him ſneeze twice, which is a natural cauſe to judge by, and conjecture upon.

Neither can the chance for the right or left ſide be good or bad luck in it ſelf. Why ſhould any Occurrent or Augury be good, becauſe it cometh out of that part of the Heavens, where the good or beneficial Stars are placed?

Tacitus</hi> ſaith, That they are a people diſloyal to Princes, deceiving them that believe them. And <hi>Varro</hi> ſaith, That the vanity of all ſuperſtitions floweth out of the boſome of Aſtrology. And if our life and fortune depend not on the Stars, then it is to be granted, that the Aſtrologers ſeek where nothing is to be found. But we are ſo fond, miſtruſtful and credulous, that we fear more the fables of <hi>Robin Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow,</hi> Aſtrologers, and Witches, and believe more the things that are not, than the things that are. And the more unpoſſible a thing is, the more we ſtand in fear thereof; and the leſs likely to be true, the more we believe it. And if we were not ſuch, I think with <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> that theſe Diviners, Aſtrologers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers, and Coſeners would dye for hunger.</p>
                     <p>And our fooliſh light belief, forgetting things paſt, neglecting things preſent, aad very haſty to know things to come, doth ſo comfort and maintain theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeners; that whereas in other men, for making one lye, the faith of him that ſpeaketh is ſo much miſtruſted, that all the reſidue being true is not regarded: Contrariwiſe, in theſe coſenages among our Divinors, one truth ſpoken by hap, giveth ſuch credit to all their lyes, that ever after we believe whatſoever they ſay, how incredible, impoſſible or falſe ſoever it be.

And that Chriſt himſelf did uſe the election of hours in his Miracles; ſo as the <hi>Jews</hi> could not hurt him whileſt he went to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore that he ſaid to his Diſciples that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him to go, <hi>Are there not twelve hours in the day?</hi>

                     <p>THat which is forbidden in the Scriptures touching inchantment or Witchcraft is not the wonderful working with words: For where words have had miraculous operation, there hath been alwayes the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence, power and grace of God uttered to the ſtrengthening of the faith

                     <p>THough it be apparent, that the Holy-Ghoſt forbiddeth this Art,<note place="margin">A common and univerſal error.</note> becauſe of the abuſe of the Name of God, and the coſenage comprehended therein: yet I confeſs, the Cuſtoms and Laws almoſt of all Nations do declare, that all theſe miraculous works before by me cited, and many other things more wonderful, were attributed to the power of Witches. The which Laws, with the executions and judicials thereupon, and the Witches confeſſions, have beguiled almoſt the whole world. What abſurdities concerning Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft are written in <hi>The Laew of the Twelve Tables,</hi> which was the higheſt and moſt ancient Law of the <hi>Romans?</hi> Whereupon the ſtrongeſt argument of Witches omnipotent power is framed; as that the wiſdom of ſuch Law-givers could not be abuſed.

                     </argument>
                     <p>YOu ſee in theſe verſes, the Poets (whether in earneſt or in jeſt, I know not) aſcribe unto Witches and to their Charms, more than is to be found in Humane or Diabolical Power.

                        </note> although the moſt learned of mine adverſaries (for lack of Scripture) are fain to produce theſe Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries for proofs, and for lack of judgment, I am ſure, do think, that <hi>Actaeons</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was true. And why not as well as the Metamorphoſis or Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> his companions into Swine, which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Clerks credit and report?</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, Popiſh Writers (I confeſs) have advantage herein of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants: for (beſides theſe Poetical proofs) they have (for advantage) the word and authority of the Pope himſelf, and others of that holy crew, whoſe Charms, Conjurations, Bleſſings, Curſings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mean in part (for a taſte) to ſet down; giving you to underſtand, that Poets are not altogether ſo impudent as Papiſts herein, neither ſeem they ſo ignorant, prophane, oe impious.<note place="margin">The Authors tranſition to his purpoſed ſcope.</note> And therefore I will ſhew you how lowd alſo they lie, and what they on the other ſide aſcribe to their Charms and Conjurations; and together will ſet down with them all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Witches Charms, as conveniently as I may.</p>

                     <p>If you look in the Popiſh, Pontifical,<note place="margin">In Eccleſia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications.</note> you ſhall ſee how they make their holy Water; to wit, in this ſort: <hi>I conjure thee thou creature of Water in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghoſt, that thou drive the Devil out of every corner aend hole of this Church, and Altar; ſo as he remain not within our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts that are juſt and righteous.</hi>

affirmeth, that it is an honeſt mans part to cure the ſick, by hook or by crook, or by any means whatſoever. Yea, he ſaith that <hi>Galen</hi> (who indeed wrote and taught that <hi>Incantamenta ſunt muliercularum figmenta,</hi> and be the only cloaks of bad Phyſitians) affirmeth, that there is vertue and great force in Incantations.

Marry <hi>M. Ferrarius</hi> (although he allowed and practiſed this kind of Phyſick) yet he proteſteth that he thinketh it none otherwiſe effectual, than by the way of conſtant opinion: ſo as he affirmeth, that neither the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, nor the Charm, nor the Witch, nor the Devil accompliſh the cure; as (ſaith he) the experiment of the Tooch-ach will manifeſtly declare, wherein the cure is wrought by the confidence or diffidence as well of the Patient, as of the Agent, according to the Poets ſaying:

This (ſaith he) cometh to the unlearned, through the opinion which they conceive of the Characters and holy words: but the learned that know the force of the mind and imagination, work miracles by means thereof; ſo as the unlearned muſt have external helps, to do that which the learned can do with a word only.

                        <p>Of the Effects of Amulets, the drift of <hi>Argerius Ferrarius</hi> in the commendation of Charms, <hi>amp;c.</hi> four ſorts of Homerical Medicines, and the choyce thereof; of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>

                     <p>AS touching mine opinion of theſe Amulets, Characters, and ſuch other bables, I have ſufficiently uttered it elſewhere: and I will bewray the vanity of the ſuperſtitious trifles more largely hereafter. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at this time I only ſay, that thoſe Amulets which are to be hanged or carried about one, if they conſiſt of Herbs, Roots, Stones, or ſome other metal, they may have divers medicinable operations; and by the vertue given to them by God in their creation, may work ſtrange effects and cures: and to impute this vertue to any other matter is Witchcraft. And whereas <hi>A. Ferrarius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth certain Amulets that have no ſhew of Phyſical operation, as a nail taken from a Croſs, Holy-water, and the very ſign of the Croſs, with ſuch like Popiſh ſtuffe: I think he laboureth thereby rather to draw men to Popery, than to teach or perſwade them in the truth of Phyſick or Philoſophy. And I think thus the rather, for that he himſelf ſeeth the fraud hereof; confeſſing that where theſe Magical Phyſitians apply three ſeeds of three-leaved

graſs to a Tertian Ague, and four to a Quartain, that the number is not material.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Four ſorts of Homerical medicins, and which is the principal.</note>But of theſe Homerical medicines, he ſaith, there are four ſorts, whereof A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulets, Characters, and Charms, are three: howbeit he commendeth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth the fourth above the reſt; and that he ſaith conſiſteth in illuſions, which he more properly calleth ſtratagems. Of which ſort of illuſions he alledgeth for example, how <hi>Philodotus</hi> did put a Cap of Lead upon ones head who imagined he was headleſs, whereby the party was delivered from his diſeaſe or conceit. <hi>Item,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The force of fixed fanſie opinion, or conceipt.</note> Another cured a woman that imagined, that a Serpent or Snake did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually gnaw and tear her entrails; and that was done only by giving her a Vomit, and by foiſting into the matter vomited a little Serpent or Snake, like unto that which ſhe imagined was in her belly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> Another imagined that he alwayes burned in the fire, under whoſe bed a fire was privily conveyed, which being taken out before his face, his fanſie was ſatisfied, and his heat allayed. Hereunto pertaineth, that the Hickot is cured with ſudden fear or ſtrange news: yea by that means Agues and many other ſtrange and extream diſeaſes have been healed. And ſome that have lien ſo ſick and ſore of the Gowt, that they could not remove a joynt, through ſudden fear of fire, or ruin of houſes, have forgotten their infirmities and griefs and have run away. But in my tract upon melancholy, and the effects of imagination, and in the diſcourſe of Natural Magick, you ſhall ſee theſe matters largely touched.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>Concerning the charming of Serpents and Snakes, mine Adverſaries (as I have ſaid) think they have great advantage by the words of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. and by <hi>Jer.</hi> chap. 8. expounding the one Prophet by <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> the other by <hi>Ovid.</hi> For the words of <hi>David</hi> are theſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 58.4, 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Their poyſon is like the poyſon of a Serpent, and like a deaf Adder, that ſtoppeth his Ear, and heareth not the voyce of the Charmer, charm he never ſo cunningly.</hi> The words of <hi>Virgil</hi> are theſe, <hi>Frigidus in pratis cantando rumpitur anguis.</hi> As if he might ſay, <hi>David</hi> thou lieſt;<note place="margin">Virg. eclog. <hi>8.</hi>
                        </note> for the cold-natured Snake is by the Charms of the Inchanters broken all to pieces in the field where he lieth. Then cometh <hi>Ovid,</hi> and he taketh his Country mans part, ſaying in the name and perſon of a Witch,<note place="margin">Ovid. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morph. <hi>7.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Vipereas rumpo verbis &amp; carmine fauces;</hi> I with my words and Charms can break in ſunder the Vipers jaws. Marry <hi>Jeremy</hi> on the other ſide encountreth this Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Witch, and he not only, defendeth, but expoundeth his fellow Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets words, and that not in his own Name, but in the Name of Almighty God, ſaying, <hi>I will ſend Serpents and Cockatrices,</hi>

                        <hi>among you which cannot be charmed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now let any indifferent man (Chriſtian or Heathen) Judge whether the words and minds of the Prophets do not directly oppugn theſe Poets words. (I will not ſay minds) for that I am ſure therein they did but jeſt and trifle, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common fabling of lying Poets. And certainly, I can encounter them two with other two Poets, namely <hi>Propertius</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> the one merrily deriding, the other ſeriouſly impugning their, fantaſtical Poetries, concerning the power and Omnipotency of Witches, For where <hi>Virgil, Ovid,</hi> &amp;c. write that Witches with their Charms fetch down the Moon and Starrs from heaven, <hi>&amp;c. Propertius</hi> mocketh them in theſe words following:

The Aſs immediately fell down to the ground, and by all ſigns ſhewed himſelf to be ſick, and at length to give up the ghoſt: ſo as the Juggler begged of the Aſſembly money towards his loſs. And having gotten all that he could, he ſaid; Now my Maſters, you ſhall ſee mine Aſs is yet alive, and doth but counterfeit, becauſe he would have ſome money to buy him provender, knowing that I was poor, and in ſome need of relief. Hereupon he would needs lay a wager, that his Aſs was alive, who to every mans ſeeming was ſtark dead. And when one had laid money with him thereabout, he commanded the Aſs to riſe, but he lay ſtill as though he were dead: then did he beat him with a Cudgel, but that would not ſerve the turn, until he addreſſed his ſpeech to the Aſs, ſaying (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in open audience; The <hi>Sultan</hi> hath commanded, that all the people ſhall ride out to morrow, and ſee the triumph, and that the fair Ladies will then ride upon the faireſt Aſſes, and will give notable provender unto them, and every Aſs ſhall drink of the ſweet water of <hi>Nilus:</hi> and then lo the Aſs did preſently ſtart up, and advance himſelf exceedingly.

Then ſaid his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, I perceive you love young pretty wenches: at which words he looked up, as it were with joyful cheer.

When all the Serpents were gathered together, as he ſtood upon the brink of the pit, there came at the laſt a great and horrible Serpent, which would not be gotten down with all the force of his Incantations: ſo as (all the reſt being dead) he flew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Inchanter, and claſped him in the midſt, and drew him down into the ſaid Dike, and there killed him. You muſt think that this was a Devil in a Serpents likeneſs, which for the love he bare to the poor Snakes, killed the Sorcerer; to teach all other Witches to beware of the like wicked practice. And ſurely, if this be not true,<note place="margin">Mal. Malef. part. <hi>2.</hi> qu. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi> Johan. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinus.</note> there be a great number of lyes contained in <hi>M. Mal.</hi> and <hi>J. Bodin.</hi> And if this be well weighed, and conceived, it beateth down to the ground all thoſe Witchmongers arguments, that contend to wring witching mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles out of this place. For they diſagree notably, ſome denying, and ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that Serpents may be bewitched. Nevertheleſs becauſe in every point you ſhall ſee how Popery agrees with Paganiſm, I will recite certain Charms

Otherwiſe, For a greater miſchief, the like Image is made in the form of a man or woman, upon whoſe head is written the certain Name of the party; and on his or her ribs theſe words, <hi>Ailif, caſyl, zaze, hit, mel meltat;</hi> then the ſame muſt be buried.

To be utterly rid of the Witch, and to hang her up by the hair, you muſt prepare an Image of the earth of a dead man to be baptized in another mans name, whereon the name, with a Character, muſt be written: then muſt it be perfumed with a rotten bone, and then theſe Pſalms read backward; <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Dominus noſter, Dominus illuminatio mea, Domine exaudi orationem meam, Deus laudem meam ne tacueris;</hi> and then bury it, firſt in one place, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in another.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53058:83"/>
the twenty ſecond Article of that Council, that it is as great an Error to believe thoſe things, as to do them.</p>
                        <p>But concerning theſe Images, it is certain that they are much feared among the people, and much uſed among couſening Witches, as partly appeareth in this diſcourſe of mine elſewhere, and as partly you may ſee by the Contents of this Story following.<note place="margin">A proved Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concerning the Premiſes.</note> Not long ſithence, a young Maiden (dwelling at <hi>New Romny</hi> here in <hi>Kent</hi>) being the Daughter of one M. <hi>L.

Nevertheleſs the Witch told them that there was great cauſe of their ſuſpition: for the ſame, ſaid ſhe, is the very party that wrought the Maidens deſtruction, by making a heart of wax, and pricking the ſame with pins and needles; affirming alſo that the ſame Neighbour of hers had beſtowed the ſame in ſome ſecret corner of the Houſe. This being believed, the Houſe was ſearched by credible Perſons, but nothing could be found. The Witch or Wiſe woman being certified hereof, continued her Aſſertion, and would needs go to the Houſe where ſhe her ſelf (as ſhe affirmed) would certainly find it. When ſhe came thither, ſhe uſed her Cunning, as it chanced, to her own confuſion, or at leaſtwiſe to her detection; for herein ſhe did, as ſome of the wiſer ſort miſtruſted that ſhe would do, laying down privily ſuch an Image, as ſhe had before deſcribed, in a corner, which by others had been moſt diligently ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and looked into, and by that means her Couſenage was notably bewrayed.

Then ſet a <hi>Porrenger</hi> full of <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in a circle, wherein muſt be made croſſes every way, as many as can ſtand in it; upon the which muſt be written, Chriſt overcometh, Chriſt reigneth, Chriſt commandeth. The Porrenger alſo muſt be ſigned with a Croſs, and a form of Conjuration muſt be pronounced. Then each ſtone muſt be thrown into the water, in the name of the ſuſpected.

                        <p>This terrible curſe with Bell, Book, and Candle added thereunto, muſt needs work wonders: howbeit among Thieves it is not much weighed, among wiſe and true men it is not well liked, to them that are robbed it bringeth ſmall relief: the Prieſts ſtomach may well be eaſed, but the goods ſtoln will never the ſooner be reſtored.

And therefore the next Sunday, Sir <hi>John</hi> got him to the Pulpit, with his Surplice on his back, and his Stole about his neck, and pronounced theſe words following in the audience of the people.

                        <p>THere was a jolly fellow that took upon him to be a notable Chirurgion, in the Dutchy of <hi>Mentz,</hi> 1567. to whom there reſorted a Gentleman that had been vexed with Sickneſs, named <hi>Elibert,</hi> having a Kerchief on his head, according to the guiſe of ſick folk. But the Chirurgion made him pull off his Kerchief, and willed him to drink with him freely. The ſick man ſaid he durſt not; for he was forbidden by Phyſicians ſo to do. Tuſh (ſaid this Cunning man) they know not your Diſeaſe, be ruled by me, and take in your drink luſtily. For he thought that when he was well tippled, he might the more eaſily beguile him in his Bargain, and make his reward the greater, which he was io receive in part aforehand. When they had well drunk, he called the ſick man aſide, and told him the greatneſs and danger of his Diſeaſe, and how that it grew by means of Witchcraft, and that it would be univerſally ſpread in his Houſe, and among all his Cattel, if it were not prevented: and impudently perſwaded the ſick man to receive cure of him. And after Bargain made,<note place="margin">See <hi>J. Wier. cap.</hi> 11. <hi>conf.</hi> The Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here moſt impudently ſetteth his Knavery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broach.</note> he demanded of the ſick man, whether he had not at any home, whom he might aſſuredly truſt? The ſick man anſwered, that he had a Daughter and a Servant. The Couſener asked how old his Daughter was? The Patient ſaid twenty. Well (ſaid the Couſener) that is fit for our turn. Then he made the Mother and Father to kneel on their knees to their Daughter, And to deſire her in all things to obey the Phyſitian, and that ſhe would do in every thing as he commandeſt her; Otherwiſe her Father could not be reſtored to his health. In which reſpect her Parents humbly beſought her on their knees ſo to do. Then he aſſigned her to bring him into his Lodging her Fathers hair, and her Mothers, and of all thoſe which he kept in his Houſe, as well of men and women, as alſo of his cattel. When ſhe came therewith unto him, according to the match made, and her Parents Commandment, he led her down into a low Parlour, where having made a long ſpeech, he opened a Book that lay on the boord, and layeth thereon two Knives acroſs, with much circumſtance of words.<note place="margin">A pretended Conjuration.</note> Then conjureth he, and maketh ſtrange Characters, and at length he maketh a circle on the ground, wherein he cauſeth her to ſtick one of thoſe conjured Knives; and after many more ſtrange words, he maketh her ſtick the other Knife beſide it. Then fell down the maid in a a ſwoon for feat; ſo as he was fain to frote her, and put a ſop into her mouth, after the receipt whereof ſhe was fore troubled and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Then he made her breaſts to be uncovered, ſo as when they were bare, he dallied with with them, diverſly and long together. Then he made her lie right upward, all uncovered, and bare below her paps. Wherein the Maid being loth to obey him, reſiſted, and in ſhame forbad that villany. Then ſaid the Knave; Your Fathers deſtruction is at hand; for except you will be ruled, he and all

In the mean time he miniſtred ſo cruel Medicines to the ſick man, that through the Torments thereof he feared preſent death, and was fain to keep his bed, whereas he walked about before very well and luſtily. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in his Torments calleth unto him for Remedy, who being ſlack and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in that behalf, made room for the Daughter to accompany her Father, who asked her what ſhe thought of the Cure, and what hope ſhe had of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery? Who with tears remained ſilent, as being oppreſſed with grief; till at the laſt in abundance of ſorrow ſhe uttered the whole matter to her Father.

                        </note> that they be even ſuch as cannot be bewitched. In the number of whom firſt be the Inquiſitors, and ſuch as exerciſe publick juſtice upon them. Howbeit, <note n="*" place="margin">Whereof look more in a little Book ſet forth in print.</note> a Juſtice in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whom for divers reſpects I have left unnamed, not long ſince thought he was bewitched, in the very inſtant whiles he examined the Witch, ſo as his leg was broken thereby, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which either was falſe, or elſe this rule untrue, or both rather injurious unto Gods Providence. Secondly, ſuch as obſerve duly the Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the holy Church, and worſhip them with reverence, through the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of holy Water, and receiving conſecrated Salt, by the lawful uſe of Candles hallowed on <hi>Candlemas</hi>-day, and green leaves conſecrated on <hi>Palm</hi>-ſunday (which things they ſay the Church uſeth for the qualifying of the Devils power) are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from Witchcraft.

                     <p>But I may not omit here the reaſons which they bring to prove what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. are the more apt and effectual to execute the art of faſcination.

And therefore he ſaith (in the favour of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) that is the cauſe that women are oftner found to be Witches than men. For (ſaith he) they have an unbridled force of fury and concupiſcence naturally, that by no means it is poſſible for them to temper or moderate the ſame. So as upon every trifling occaſion, they (like brute beaſt) fix their furious eyes upon the party whom they bewitch.<note place="margin">Much like the Eye-biting Witches, of whom we have elſewhere ſpoken.</note> Hereby it cometh to paſs, that whereas women ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a marvellous ſickle nature, what grief ſoever happeneth unto them, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately all peaceableneſs of mind departeth; and they are ſo troubled with evill humours, that outgo their venemous exhalation, ingendered through their ill-favoured dyet; and increaſed by means of their pernicious excrements which they expel.

Marry he ſaith, that hot, ſubtil, and thin bodies are moſt ſubject to be bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they be moiſt, and all they generally, whoſe veins, pipes, and paſſages of their bodies are open. And finally he ſaith, that all beautiful things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are ſoon ſubject to be bewitched; as namely goodly young men, fair wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſuch as are naturally born to be rich, goodly Beaſts, fair Horſes, rank Corn, beautiful Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea a friend of his told him, that he ſaw one with his eye break a precious ſtone in pieces.

                     </argument>
                     <p>IF I ſhould go about to recite all Charms, I ſhould take an infinite work in hand: For the Witching Writers hold opinion, that any thing almoſt may be thereby brought to paſs; and that whether the words of the Charm be underſtandable or not, it skilleth not: ſo the Charmer have a ſteddy intention to bring his deſire about.

                        </note> that old women have infeebled and killed Children with words, and have made women with child miſcarry; they have made men pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to death; they have killed Horſes, deprived Sheep of their Milk; <note n="*" place="margin">According to <hi>Ovid</hi>'s ſaying of <hi>Proteus</hi> and <hi>Medea;</hi> which he indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Nunc a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua, nunc ales, modò bos, modo cervus abibat.</hi>

Inſomuch as he ſaith, that with certain words ſpoken in a Bulls ear by a Witch, the Bull hath fallen down to the ground as dead. Yea ſome by vertue of words have gone upon a ſharp ſword, and walked upon hot glowing coals, without hurt; with words (ſaith he) very heavy weights and burthens have been lifted up; and with words wild Horſes and wild Bulls have been tamed, and alſo mad Dogs; with words they have killed Worms and other Vermin, and ſtayed all manner of Bleeding and Fluxes: with words all the diſeaſes in mans body are healed, and wounds cured; Arrows are with wonderful ſtrangeneſs and cunning plucked out of mens bones. Yea (ſaith he) there be many that can heal all bitings of Dogs, or ſtingings of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, or any other poyſon: and all with nothing but words ſpoken. And that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53058:89"/>
which is moſt ſtrange, he ſaith, that they can remedy any ſtranger, and him that is abſent, with that very Sword wherewith they are wounded. Yea and that which is beyond all admiration, if they ſtroke the Sword upwards with their fingers, the party ſhall feel no pain: whereas if they draw their finger down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thereupon, the party wounded ſhall feel intolerable pain, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other cures, done altogether by the vertue and force of words uttered and ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Where, by the way, I may not omit this ſpecial note given by <hi>M. Mal.</hi> to wit,<note place="margin">M.

                        </note> that holy Water may not be ſprinkled upon bewitched Beaſts, but muſt be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into their mouths. And yet he and alſo <hi>Nider</hi> ſay, that it is lawful to bleſs and ſanctifie beaſts as well as men; both by Charms written, and alſo by holy words ſpoken: For (ſaith <hi>Nider</hi>) if your Cow be bewitched, three Croſſes, three Pater-noſters, and three Aves will certainly cure her; and likewiſe all other Ceremonies Eccleſiaſtical. And this is a ſure Maxime, that they which are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Witchcraft by ſhrift, are ever after in the night much moleſted (I believe by their ghoſtly Fathers.)

Whereas indeed there are in Milk three ſubſtances commixed; to wit, Butter, Cheeſe and Whey; if the ſame be kept too long, or in an evil place, or be ſluttiſhly uſed, ſo as it be ſtale and ſower, which happeneth ſometimes in the Winter, but oftner in the Summer; when it is over the fire, the Cheeſe and Butter runneth together, and congealeth, ſo as it will rope like Birdlime, that you may wind it about a ſtick, and in ſhort ſpace it will be ſo dry, as you may beat it to powder. Which alteration being ſtrange, is wondered at and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Witches. And herehence ſometimes proceedeth the cauſe why Butter cometh not, which when the countrey people ſee that it cometh not, then get they out of the ſuſpected Witches houſe a little But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereof muſt be made three Balls, in the Name of the holy Trinity; and ſo if they be put into the Chern, the Butter will preſently come, and the Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft will ceaſe; <hi>Sic ars deluditur arte.</hi> But if you put a little Sugar or Sope into the Chern, among the Cream, the Butter will never come, which is plain Witchcraft, if it be cloſely, cleanly, and privily handled.

                     <argument>
                        <p>How the Philoſophsrs in times paſt travelled for the knowledge of Natural Magick; of <hi>Solomons</hi> knowledge therein; Who is to be called a Natural Magician, a diſtinction thereof, and why it is condemned for Witchcraft.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>MAny Philoſophers, as namely <hi>Plato, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> &amp;c. travelled over all the world to finde out and learn the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Art: and at their return they preached and taught, profeſſed and publiſhed it. Yea, it ſhould appear by the Magicians that came to adore Chriſt, that the knowledge and reputation thereof was greater than we conceive or make account of. But of all other, <hi>Solomon</hi> was the greateſt Traveller in this Art, as may appear throughout the Book of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtes;</hi> and ſpecially in the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> where he ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">Sap. 7.17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</note> God hath given me the true Science of things, ſo as I know how the world was made, and the power of the Elements, the beginning and the end, and the midſt of times, how the times alter, and the change of ſeaſons, the courſe of the year, and the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Stars, the nature of living things and the furiouſneſs of Beaſts, the power of the wind, and the imaginations of men, the diverſities of Plants, and the vertues of Roots, and all things both ſecret and known, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Finally, he was ſo cunning in this Art,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Jidoni.</note> that he is ſaid to have been a Conjurer or a Witch, and is ſo reputed in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church at this day. Whereby you may ſee, how Fools and Papiſts are inclined to credit falſe accuſations in matters of Witchcraft and Conjuration. The leſs knowledge we have in this Art, the more we have it in contempt: in which reſpect <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith truly to <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> They make Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy a mockery,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.25.</note> that deliver it to prophane and rude people. Certainly the Witchcraft, Conjuration, and Inchantment that is imputed to <hi>Solomon,</hi> is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of theſe his words following; <hi>I applyed my minde to knowledge, and to ſearch and ſeek out Science, wiſdom and underſtanding, to know the fooliſhneſs of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the error of doting fools.</hi> In this Art of Natural Magick (without great heed be taken) a ſtudent ſhall ſoon be abuſed: For many (writing by report, without experience) miſtake their Authors, and ſet down one thing for another. Then the concluſion being found falſe, the experiment groweth into contempt, and in the end ſeemeth ridiculous, though never ſo true. <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Albert</hi> being curious Writers herein, are often deceived; inſomuch as <hi>Pliny</hi> is called a noble lyer, and <hi>Albert</hi> a ruſtical lyer; the one lying by hearſay, the other by authority.</p>

An Aggat (they ſay) hath vertue againſt the bitings of Scorpions or Serpents. It is written (but I will not ſtand to it) that it maketh a man eloquent, and procureth the favour of Princes; yea that the fume thereof doth turn away Tempeſts. <hi>Alectorius</hi> is a Stone about the bigneſs of a Bean, as clear as the Chryſtal taken out of a Cocks belly which hath been gelt or made a Capon four years.<note place="margin">

It will not be contained in a cloſe Room, but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an open and free place. It would not willingly reſt or ſtay here below on the Earth, but alwayes laboureth to aſcend up into the Air. If one preſs it down with his hand, it reſiſteth, and ſtriketh very ſharply. It is beautiful to behold, without either ſpot or blemiſh, and yet very unpleaſant to taſte or feel. If any part thereof be taken away, it is never a whit diminiſhed, the form thereof being inconſtant, and at every moment mutable. Theſe two things laſt rehearſed are ſtrange, and ſo long wondred at, as the myſtery and morality thereof remaineth undiſcovered: but when I have diſcloſed the matter, and told you that by the lump of Earth a Man is meant, and ſome of his qualities deſcribed; and that that which was contained in the far fetcht Stone, was fire, or rather flame: the doubt is reſolved, and the miracle ended.

And hereby is to be noted, that even a part of this Art, which is called natural or witching Magick, conſiſteth as well in the deceit of words, as in the ſleight of hand; wherein plain lying is avoided with a figurative ſpeech, in the which either the words themſelves, or their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation have a double or doubtful meaning, according to that which hath been ſaid before in the Title <note n="*" place="margin">Being in the 7.

                     </argument>
                     <p>SOme have taught, and others have written certain experiments; in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing whereof they have uſed ſuch words of Equivocation, as whereby many have been overtaken and abuſed through raſh credulity: ſo as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (I ſay) they have reported, taught, and written that which their capacity took hold upon, contrary to the truth and ſincere meaning of the Author.<note place="margin">A Jeſt among Water-men touching <hi>Stone</hi>-Church in <hi>Kent,</hi> as light at midnight as at mid-day.</note> It is a common jeſt among the Water-men of the <hi>Thames,</hi> to ſhew the Pariſh Church of <hi>Stone</hi> to the Paſſengers, calling the ſame by the name of the Lanthorn of <hi>Kent;</hi> affirming, and that not untruly, that the ſaid Church is as light (meaning in weight and not in brightneſs) at midnight, as at noonday. Whereupon ſome credulous perſon is made believe, and will not ſtick to affirm and ſwear, that in the ſame Church is ſuch continual light, that any man may ſee to read there at all times of the Night without a Candle.</p>
                     <p>An excellent Philoſopher, whom (for reverence unto his Fame and Learning) I will forbear to name, was overtaken by his Hoſteſs at <hi>Dover;</hi> who merrily told him, that if he could retain and keep in his mouth certain pibbles (lying at the ſhoar ſide) he ſhould not perbreak until he came to <hi>Calice,</hi> how rough and rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſo ever the Seas were. Which when he had tried, and being not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſickneſs to vomit, nor to loſe his ſtones, as by vomiting he muſt needs do, he thought her Hoſteſs had diſcovered unto him an excellent ſecret, nothing doubting of her amphibological ſpeech: and therefore thought it a worthy note to be recorded among miraculous and medicinable ſtones; and inſerted it accordingly into his Book, among other Experiments collected with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, learning, travel, and judgement. All theſe Toyes help a ſubtile Coſener to gain credit with the multitude. Yea, to further eſtimation, many will whiſper Prophecies of their own invention into the ears of ſuch as are not of quickeſt capacity; as to tell what Weather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall follow.<note place="margin">A ſlender ſhift to ſave the credit of their cunning.</note> Which if it fall out true, then boaſt they and triumph, as though they had gotten ſome notable conqueſt; if not, they deny the matter, forget it, excuſe it, or ſhift it off; as that they told another the contrary in earneſt, and ſpake that but in jeſt. All theſe helps might <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Jugglers have to maintain their Coſenages and Illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, towards the hardening of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto belong all manner of Charms, Periapts, Amulets, Characters, and ſuch other Superſtitions, both popiſh and prophane: whereby (if that were true, which either, Papiſts, Conjurors, or Witches undertake to do) we might daily ſee the very miracles wrought indeed, which <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians ſeemed

                     <p>BUt as theſe notable and wonderful Experiments and Concluſions that are found out in Nature it ſelf (through wiſdom, learning and induſtry) do greatly oppoſe and aſtoniſh the capacity of man: ſo (I ſay) when deceit and illuſion is annexed thereunto, then is the Wit, the Faith, and Conſtancy of Man ſearched and tried.<note place="margin">The inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opinion, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſſeth our Capacity, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> For if we ſhall yield that to be divine, ſupernatural, and miraculous, which we cannot comprehend; a Witch, a Papiſt, a Conjuror, a Coſener, and a Jugler may make us believe they are Gods: or elſe with more impiety we ſhall aſcribe ſuch power and omnipotency unto them, or unto the Devil, as only and properly appertained to God. As for example; By Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy or Coſenage (as before I have ſaid) I may ſeem to manifeſt the ſecret thoughts of the heart, which (as we learn in Gods Book) none, knoweth or ſearcheth, but God himſelf alone. And therefore, whoſoever believeth that I can do as I may ſeem to do, maketh a God of me, and is an Idolater. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, whenſoever we hear Papiſt, Witch, Conjuror, or Coſener, take upon him more than lieth in humane power to perform, we may know and boldly, ſay it is a knack of Knavery; and no miracle at all.

Howbeit, ſuch things as God hath laid up ſecretly in Nature, are to be weighed with, great admiration, and to be ſearched out with ſuch induſtry as may become a Chriſtian man: I mean, ſo as neither God, nor our Neighbour he offended thereby, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect doubtleſs <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> never had.

The words uſed in ſuch caſe are uncertain, and to be recited at the pleaſure of the Witch or Coſener.<note place="margin">To ſet an horſes or an aſſes head on a mans neck and ſhoulders.</note> But the concluſion of this, cut off the head of a Horſe or an Aſs (before they be dead, otherwiſe the vertue or ſtrength there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will be the leſs effectual) and make an earthen veſſel of fit capacity to contain the ſame, and let it be filled with the oyl and fat thereof, cover it cloſe, and dawb it over with lome; let it boyl over a ſoft fire three days continually, that the fleſh boyled may run into oyl, ſo as the bare bones may be ſeen, beat the hair into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and mingle the ſame with the oyl; and annoint the heads of the ſtanders by, and they ſhall ſeem to have Horſes or Aſſes heads. If Beaſts heads be anointed with the like oyl made of a mans head, they ſhall ſeem to have mens faces, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Authors ſoberly affirm. If a Lamp be anointed herewith, every thing ſhall ſeem moſt monſtrous. It is alſo written, that if that which is called <hi>Sperma</hi> in any beaſt be burned, and any bodies face therewithal anointed he ſhall ſeem to have the like face as the Beaſt had. But if you beat Arſenick very fine, and boyl it with a little ſulphur in a covered pot, and kindle it with a new candle, the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by will ſeem to be headleſs. <hi>Aqua compoſita</hi> and ſalt being fired in the night, and all other lights extinguiſhed, make the ſtanders by ſeem as dead.

                        <note place="margin">Strange things to be done by perſpective glaſſes.</note> But the wondrous devices, and miraculous ſights, and conceits, made and contained in glaſs, do far exceed all other; whereto the Art perſpective is very neceſſary.

There be clear Glaſſes, that make great things ſeem little; things far off to be at hand; and that which is near to be far off; ſuch things as are over us, to ſeem under us; and thoſe that are under us, to be above us. There are ſome Glaſſes alſo, that repreſent things in divers colours, and them moſt gorgeous, ſpecially any white thing. Finally, the thing moſt worthy of admiration concerning theſe Glaſſes, is, that the leſſer Glaſs doth leſſen their ſhape; but how big ſoever it be, it maketh the ſhape no bigger then it is.

If any object and ſay, that our Witches can do ſuch feats with Words and Charms, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians did by their Art, I deny it; and all the world will never be able to ſhew it.

                        <note place="margin">Exod. 10.</note> For God did put the Spirit of Truth into <hi>Baalams</hi> mouth, who was hired to curſe his People.

                        </note> Likewiſe in this caſe it might well ſtand with Gods glory, to uſe the hands of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians, towards the hardening of their Maſters heart; and to make their illuſions and ridiculous conceits to become ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. For God had promiſed and determined to harden the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> As for the miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> did, they mollified it ſo, as he alwayes relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſight of the ſame. For unto the greatneſs of his miracles were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch modeſty and patience, as might have moved even a heart of ſteel or flint. But <hi>Pharaohs</hi> frowardneſs alwayes grew upon the Magicians actions: the like example, or the reſemblance whereof, we find not again in the Scriptures. And though there were ſuch people in thoſe dayes ſuffered and uſed by God, for the accompliſhment of his Will and ſecret Purpoſe: yet it followeth not, that now, when Gods Will is wholly revealed to us in his Word, and his Son exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited (for whom, or rather for the manifeſtation of whoſe coming, all thoſe things were ſuffered or wrought) ſuch things and ſuch people ſhould yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. So as I conclude, the cauſe being taken away, the thing proceeding thence remaineth not. And to aſſign our Witches and Conjurers their room, is to mock and contemn Gods wonderful Works; and to oppoſe againſt them Coſenages, jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling knacks and things of nought. And therefore, as they muſt confeſs, that none in theſe dayes can do as <hi>Moſes</hi> did; ſo it may be anſwered, that none in theſe dayes can do as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> did: who, if they had been falſe Prophets, as they were Juglers, had yet been more priviledged to exceed our old Women or Conjurers, in the accompliſhing of miracles, or in prophecying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For who may be compared with <hi>Balaam?</hi> Nay, I dare ſay, that <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs wrought a greater miracle, and more ſupernatural, then either the Pope or all the Conjurers and Witches in the world can do at this day.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, it is to be avouched (and there be proofs manifeſt enough) that our Juglers approach much nearer to reſemble <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians, then

Laſtly,<note place="margin">Theſe feats are nimbly, cleanly and ſwiftly to be conveyed; ſo as the eyes of the beholders may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the drift.</note> the ſame Ball is to be practiſed in the palm of the hand, and by uſe you ſhall not only ſeem to put any one Ball from you, and yet retain it in your hand; but you ſhall keep four or five as cleanly as one.

                     <p>Lay three or four Balls before you, and as many ſmall Candleſticks, Bols, Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller covers, which is the beſt.

Then take up one Candleſtick with one hand, and blow, ſaying, Lo, you ſee that is gone: and ſo likewiſe look under each Candleſtick with like grace and words, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders will wonder where they are become.<note place="margin">

But it will ſeem wonderful ſtrange, if alſo in ſhewing how there remaineth nothing under another of thoſe Candleſticks, taken up with your left hand, you leave behind you a great Ball, or any other thing, the miracle will be the greater.

I dare not (as I could) ſhew the lewd juggling that Cheaters practice, leſt it miniſter ſome offence to the well diſpoſed, to the ſimple hurt and loſſes, and to the wicked occaſion of evil doing. But I would wiſh all Gameſters to beware, not only with what Card and Dice they play, but eſpecially with whom and where they exerciſe gaming. And to let Dice paſs (as whereby a man may be inevitably coſened) one that is skilful to make and uſe Bumcards, may undo a hundred wealthy men that are given to gaming: but if he have a confederate preſent, either of the players or ſtanders by, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief cannot be avoided. If you play among ſtrangers, beware of him that ſeems ſimple or drunken; for under their habit the moſt ſpecial coſeners are preſented, and while you think by their ſimplicity and imperfections to beguile them (and thereof perchance are perſwaded by their confederates, your very friends as you

Hereby you ſhall ſeem to work wonders; for it will be eaſie for you to ſee or ſpie one Card, which though you be perceived to do, it will not be ſuſpected, if you ſhuffle them well afterwards.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And this note I muſt give you, that in reſerving the bottom Card, you muſt alwayes (whileſt you ſhuffle) keep him a little before or a little behind all the Cards lying underneath him, beſtowing him (I ſay) either a little beyond his fellows before, right over the fore-finger, or elſe behind the reſt, ſo as the little finger of the left hand may meet with it: which is the eaſier, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyer, and the better way.

Provided always, that your fore-finger, if the pack be laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or the little finger, if the pack lye behinde, creep up to meet with the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom Card, and not lye betwixt the Cards: and when you feel it, you may there hold it, until you have ſhuffled over the Cards again, ſtill leaving your kept Card below. Being perfect herein, you may do almoſt what you liſt with the Cards. By this means what pack ſoever you make, though it conſiſt of eight, twelve, or twenty Cards, you may keep them ſtill together unſevered next to the neather Card, and yet ſhuffle them often to ſatisfie the curious beholders.

                        <p>MAke a Pack of theſe eight Cards; to wit, four Knaves and four Aces: and although, all the eight Cards muſt lye immediately together, yet muſt each Knave and Ace be evenly ſevered, and the ſame eight Cards muſt lye alſo in the loweſt place of the bunch.<note place="margin">You muſt be well adviſed in the ſhuffling of the bunch, leſt you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoot your ſelf.</note> Then ſhuffle them ſo, as alwayes at the ſecond ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, or at leaſtwiſe at the end of your ſhuffling the ſaid pack, and of the pack one Ace may lie neathermoſt, or ſo as you may know where he goeth and lyeth: and alwayes (I ſay) let your foreſaid pack with three or four Card more lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable together immediately upon and with that Ace.

And therefore, to reform that diſordered Card, as alſo for a grace and countenance to that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, take of the uppermoſt Card of the bunch, and thruſt it into the midſt of the Cards; and then take away the neathermoſt Card, which is one of your ſaid Aces, and beſtow him likewiſe.

                        <head>The Concluſion, wherein the Reader is referred to certain Patterns of Inſtruments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with divers Feats here ſpecified are to be executed.</head>
                        <p>HErein I might wade infinitely, but I hope it ſufficeth, that I have delivered unto you the principles, and alſo the principal feats belonging to this Art of Juggling, ſo as any man conceiving throughly hereof may not only do all theſe things, but alſo may deviſe other as ſtrange, and vary every of theſe devices into other forms as he can beſt conceive. And ſo long as the power of Almighty God is not tranſported to the Juggler, nor offence miniſtred by his uncomely ſpeech and behaviour, but the action performed in paſtime, to the delight of the beholders, ſo as alwayes the Juggler confeſs in the end that theſe are no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural actions, but devices of men, and nimble conveyances, let all ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conceited men as cannot afford their neighbours any comfort or commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ſuch as pleaſeth their melancholick diſpoſitions, ſay what they liſt; for this will not be only found among indifferent actions, but ſuch as greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the power and glory of God, diſcovering their pride and falſehood that take upon them to work miracles,<note place="margin">Among what actions jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling is to be counted.</note> and to be the mighty power of God, as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> and alſo <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did.</p>
                        <p>If any man doubt of theſe things, as whether they be not as ſtrange to behold as I have reported,<note place="margin">A matchleſs fellow for Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gierdemain.</note> or think with <hi>Bodin,</hi> that theſe matters are performed by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars or Devils; let him go into S. <hi>Martins,</hi> and enquire for one <hi>John Cautares</hi> (a <hi>French</hi> man by birth, in converſation an honeſt-man) and he will ſhew as much and as ſtrange actions as theſe, who getteth not his living hereby, but laboureth for the ſame with the ſweat of his brows, and nevertheleſs hath the beſt hand and conveyance (I think) of any man that liveth this day.</p>
                        <p>Neither do I ſpeak (as they ſay) without Book herein. For if time, place, and occaſion ſerve, I can ſhew ſo much herein, that I am ſure <hi>Bodin, Spinaeus,</hi> and <hi>Vairus,</hi> would ſwear I were a Witch, and had a familiar Devil at Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But truly my ſtudy and travel herein hath only been employed to the end I might prove them fools, and find out the fraud of them that make them fools, as whereby they may become wiſer, and God may have that which to him belongeth.</p>

                           <pb n="199" facs="tcp:53058:109"/>And becauſe the manner of theſe juggling conveyances is not eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by diſcourſe of words;<note place="margin">Touching the patterns of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers juggling Inſtruments.</note> I have cauſed to be ſet down divers forms of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments uſed in this Art; which may ſerve for patterns to them that would throughly ſee the ſecrets thereof, and make them for their own private practices, to try the event of ſuch devices, as in this Tract of Legierdemain are ſhewed. Where note, that you ſhall find every Inſtrument that is moſt neceſſarily occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in the working of theſe ſtrange feats, to bear the juſt and true number of the page, where the uſe hereof is in ample words declared.</p>
                        <p>Now will I proceed with another coſening point of Witchcraft, apt for the place, neceſſary for the time, and in mine opinion meet to be diſcovered, or at the leaſt to be defaced among deceitful Arts. And becauſe many are abuſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to their utter undoing, for that it hath had paſſage under the protection of learning, whereby they pretend to accompliſh their works, it hath gone freely without general controlment through all Ages, Nations, and People.</p>

At the length he borrowed money of the Prieſt, which is the third part of the Art, without which the Profeſſors can do no good, nor indure in good eſtate. Then he at his day repayed the money, which is the moſt difficult point in this Art, and a rare experiment.

And this is the moſt common point in this Science; for herein they muſt be skilful before they can be famous, or attain to any credit. The Prieſt diſliked not his proffer, ſpecially becauſe it tended to his profit, and embraced his courteſie. Then the Chanon willed him forthwith to ſend for three ounces of Quick-ſilver, which he ſaid he would tranſubſtantiate (by his Art) into perfect ſilver. The Prieſt thought that a man of his profeſſion could not diſſemble, and therefore with great joy and hope accompliſhed his requeſt.</p>
                     <p>And now (forſooth) goeth this jolly Alchymiſt about his buſineſs and work of Multiplication, and cauſeth the Prieſt to make a fire of coals, in the bottom whereof he placeth a Croſlet; and pretending only to help the Prieſt to lay the coals handſomly, he foiſteth into the middle ward or lane of coals, a Beechen coal, within the which was conveyed an Ingot of perfect ſilver; which (when the coal was conſumed) ſlipt down into the Croſlet, that was (I ſay) directly under it. The Prieſt perceived not the fraud,<note place="margin">The Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts bait to catch a fool.</note> but received the Ingot of ſilver, and was not a little joyful to ſee ſuch certain ſucceſs proceed from his own handy work wherein could be no fraud (as he ſurely conceived) and therefore very willingly gave the Chanon forty pounds for the receipt of this experiment, who for that ſum of money taught him a leſſon in Alchymiſtry, but he never returned to hear repetitions, or to ſee how he profitted.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of a Yeoman of the Countrey coſened by an Alchymiſt.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Could cite many Alchymiſtical coſenages wrought by Doctor <hi>Burcot, Feates,</hi> and ſuch other; but I will paſs them over, and only repeat three experiments of that Art; the one practiſed upon an honeſt Yeoman in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> the other upon a mighty Prince, the third upon a covetous Prieſt. And firſt touching the Yeoman, he was overtaken and uſed in manner and form following, by a notable coſening Varlet, who profeſſed Alchymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, Juggling, Witchcraft, and Conjuration: and by means of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Confederates diſcuſſed the ſimplicity and ability of the ſaid Yeoman, and found out his eſtate and humour to be convenient in this purpoſe; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came a woing (as they ſay) to his daughter, to whom he made love cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly in words, though his purpoſe tended to another matter. And among other illuſions and tales concerning his own commendation, for wealth, parentage, inheritance, allyance, activity, learning, pregnancy, and cunning, he boaſted of his knowledge and experience in Alchymiſtry, making the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple man beleive that he could multiply, and of one Angel make two or three. Which ſeemed ſtrange to the poor man, inſomuch as he became willing enough to ſee that concluſion: whereby the Alchymiſter had more hope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to attain his deſire,<note place="margin">Note the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening covey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Alchymiſtical practitioner.</note> than if his daughter had yielded to have marryed him. To be ſhort, he in the preſence of the ſaid Yeoman, did include within a little Ball of Virgin-Wax, a couple of Angels; and after certain Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and conjuring words he ſeemed to deliver the ſame unto him: but in truth
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53058:112"/>
(through Legierdemain) he conveyed into the Yeomans hand another ball of the ſame ſcantling, wherein were incloſed many more Angels than were in the ball which he thought he had received. Now (forſooth) the Alchymiſter bad him lay up the ſame ball of Wax, and alſo uſe certain ceremonies (which I thought good here to omit.) And after certain dayes, hours, and minutes, they returned together, according to the appointment, and found great gains by the multiplication of the angels. Inſomuch as he, being a plain man, was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by perſwaded, that he ſhould not only have a rare and notable good ſon-in-law, but a companion that might help to adde unto his wealth much treaſure, and to his eſtate great fortune and felicity. And to increaſe this opinion in him, as alſo to win his further favour; but ſpecially to bring his cunning Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, or rather his lewd purpoſe to paſs, he told him that it were folly to multiply a pound of Gold, when as eaſily they might multiply a million: and therefore counſelled him to produce all the money he had, or could borrow of his neighbours and friends; and did put him out of doubt, that he would multiply the ſame, and redouble it exceedingly, even as he ſaw by experience how he dealt with the ſmall ſumm before his face.<note place="margin">A notable fool.</note> This Yeoman in hope of gains and preferment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſented to this ſweet motion, and brought out and laid before his feet, not the one half of his goods, but all that he had, or could make or borrow any manner of way. Then this juggling Alchymiſter, having obtained his purpoſe, folded the ſame in a ball, in quantity far bigger than the other, and conveying the ſame into his boſom or pocket, delivered another ball (as before) of the like quantity unto the Yeoman, to be reſerved and ſafely kept in his cheſt; whereof (becauſe the matter was of importance) either of them muſt have a key, and a ſeveral lock, that no interruption might be made to the Ceremony, nor abuſe by either of them, in defrauding each other. Now (forſooth) theſe circumſtances and Ceremonies being ended,<note place="margin">A couſening device by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away to ſave the credit of the art.</note> and the Alchymiſters purpoſe thereby performed; he told the Yeoman that (untill a certain day and hour limited to return) either of them might imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about their buſineſs and neceſſary affairs; the Yeoman to the Plough, and he to the City of <hi>London,</hi> and in the mean time the Gold ſhould multiply, &amp;c. But the Alchymiſter (belike) having other matters of more importance came not juſt at the hour appointed, nor yet at the day, nor within the year: ſo as although it were ſomewhat againſt the Yeomans conſcience to violate his promiſe, or break the league; yet partly by the longing he had to ſee, and partly the deſire he had to enjoy the fruit of that excellent experiment, having (for his own ſecurity) and the others ſatisfaction, ſome teſtimony at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, to witneſs his ſincere dealing, he brake up the coffer, and lo he ſoon eſpyed the ball of Wax, which he himſelf had laid up there with his own hand: So as he thought (if the hardeſt ſhould fall) he ſhould find his principal: and why not as good increaſe hereof now, as of the other before? But alas! when the Wax was broken, and the metall diſcovered, the Gold much abaſed, and became perfect lead.</p>

But before he began, he found the means to receive by vertue of the Kings Warrant, a great ſum of money in preſt, aſſuring the King and his Councell, that he would ſhortly return, and accompliſh his promiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Soon after, the Kings Fool among other jeſts, fell into a diſcourſe and diſcovery of fools, and handled that common place ſo pleaſantly, that the King began to take delight therein, and to like his merry vein.

                     <p>So he cauſed the Kings name to be firſt ſet down, and next him all the names of his Privy Council.

Then the fool being asked why he ſo ſawcily accuſed the King and his Council of principal folly, anſwered; Becauſe he ſaw one fooliſh knave beguile them all, and to couſen them of ſo great a maſs of Money, and finally to be gone out of their reach.

He in a certain dialogue intituled <hi>Alchymiſtica</hi> doth finely bewray the knavery of this crafty art; wherein he propoſeth one <hi>Balbine,</hi> a very wiſe, learned, and devout prieſt, howbeit ſuch a one as was bewitched, and mad upon the art of Alchymiſtry. Which thing another coſening Prieſt perceived, and dealt with him in manner and form following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A flattering and clawing preamble.</note>Mr. Doctor <hi>Balbine</hi> (ſaid he) I being a ſtranger unto you may ſeem very ſaucy to trouble your worſhip with my bold ſuit, who alwayes are buſied in great and divine ſtudies. To whom <hi>Balbine,</hi> being a man of few words, gave a nodde: which was more then he uſed to every man. But the Prieſt knowing his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſaid; I am ſure Sir, if you knew my ſuit, you would pardon my impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. I pray thee good Sir <hi>John</hi> (ſaid <hi>Balbine</hi>) ſhew me thy minde, and be brief. That ſhall I doe Sir (ſaid he) with a good will, You know Mr. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, through your skill in Philoſophy, that every mans deſtiny is not alike; and I for my part am at this point, that I cannot tell whether I may be counted happy or infortunate. For when I weigh mine own caſe, or rather my
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53058:113"/>
ſtate, in part I ſeem fortunate, and in part miſerable. But <hi>Balbine</hi> being a man of ſome ſurlineſs, alwayes willed him to draw his matter to a more compendious form: which thing the Prieſt ſaid he would doe, and could the better perform, becauſe <hi>Balbine</hi> himſelf was ſo learned and expert in the very matter he had to repeat, and thus he began.</p>
                     <p>I have had, even from my childhood, a great felicity in the art of Alchymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which is the very marrow of all Philoſophy. <hi>Balbine</hi> at the naming of the word Alchymiſtry, inclined and yielded himſelf more attentively to hearken unto him: marry it was only in geſture of body; for he was ſpare of ſpeech, and yet he bade him proceed with his tale. Then ſaid the Prieſt, wretch that I am, it was not my luck to light on the beſt way: for you Mr. <hi>Balbine</hi> know (being ſo univerſally learned) that in this art there are two wayes, the one called Longation, the other Curtation; and it was mine ill hap to fall upon Longation. When <hi>Balbine</hi> asked him the difference of thoſe two waves; Oh Sir,<note place="margin">Longation and Curtation in Alchymiſtry.</note> ſaid the Prieſt, you might count me impudent, to take upon me to tell you that of all other are beſt learned in this Art, to whom I come, moſt humbly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to teach me that lucky way of Curtation. The cunninger you are, the more eaſily you may teach it me: and therefore hide not the gift that God hath given you, from your brother, who may periſh for want of his deſire in this behalf; and doubtleſs Jeſus Chriſt will inrich you with greater bleſſings and endowments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Balbine</hi> being abaſhed partly with his importunity, and partly with the ſtrange circumſtance, told him that (in truth) he neither knew what Longation or Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation meant; and therefore required him to expound the meaning of theſe words. Well (quoth the Prieſt) ſince it is your pleaſure, I will do it, though I ſhall thereby take upon me to teach him that is indeed much cunninger than my ſelf. And thus he began: Oh Sir,<note place="margin">Note how the Couſener cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumventeth <hi>Balbine.</hi>
                        </note> they that have ſpent all the dayes of their life in this divine faculty, do turn one nature and form into another, two wayes; the one is very brief, but ſomewhat dangerous; the other much longer, marry very ſafe, ſure, and commodious. Howbeit, I think my ſelf moſt unhappy that have ſpent my time and travel in that way which utterly miſliketh me, and never could get any one to ſhew me the other that I ſo earneſtly deſire. And now I come to your worſhip, whom I know to be wholly learned and expert herein, hoping that you will (for charities ſake) comfort your brother, whoſe felicity and well-doing now reſteth only in your hands; and therefore I beſeech you relieve me with your counſel.</p>
                     <p>By theſe and ſuch other words when this couſening Varlot had avoided ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of guile, and aſſured <hi>Balbine</hi> that he was perfect and cunning in the other way: <hi>Balbine</hi>'s fingers itched, and his heart tickled, ſo as he could hold no longer, but burſt out with theſe words: Let this Curtation go to the Devil, whoſe name I did never ſo much as once hear of before, and therefore do much leſs underſtand it. But tell me in good faith, do you exactly underſtand Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation? Yea, ſaid the Prieſt, doubt you not hereof: but I have no fanſie to that way, it is ſo tedious. Why (quoth <hi>Balbine</hi>) what time is required in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of this work by way of Longation? Too too much ſaid the Alchymiſter, even almoſt a whole year: but this is the beſt,<note place="margin">Fair words make fools fain, and large offers blind the wiſe.</note> the ſureſt and ſafeſt way, though it be for ſo many moneths prolonged, before it yield advantage for coſt and charges expended thereabouts. Set your heart at reſt (ſaid <hi>Balbine</hi>) it is no matter, though it were two years, ſo as you be well aſſured to bring it then to paſs.</p>
                     <p>Finally, it was there and then concluded, that preſently the Prieſt ſhould go in hand with the work, and the other ſhould bear the charge, the gains to be indifferently divided betwixt them both, and the work to be done privily in <hi>Balbine</hi>'s houſe. And after the mutual oath was taken for ſilence, which is uſual and requiſite alwayes in the beginning of this myſtery, <hi>Balbine</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red money to the Alchymiſter for Bellowes, Glaſſes, Coals, &amp;c. which ſhould ſerve for the erection and furniture of the Forge. Which money the Alchymiſter
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53058:114"/>
had no ſooner fingered, but he ran merrily to the Dice, to the Alehouſe, and to the Stewes, and who there ſo luſty as couſening Sir <hi>John!</hi> who indeed this way made a kind of Alchymiſtical transformation of Money. Now <hi>Balbine</hi> urged him to go about his buſineſs, but the other cold him, that if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were once begun, it were half ended: for therein conſiſted the greateſt difficulty.</p>
                     <p>Well, at length he began to furniſh the furnace; but now forſooth a new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Gold muſt be made, as the ſeed and ſpawn of that which muſt be engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and grow out of this work of Alchymiſtry. For even as a fiſh is not caught without a bait, no more is Gold multiplyed without ſome parcels of Gold: and therefore Gold muſt be the foundation and ground-work of that art, or elſe all the fat is in the fire. But all this while <hi>Balbine</hi> was occupied in calculating, and muſing upon his accompt; caſting by Arithmetick, how that if one ounce yield fifteen, then how much gains two thouſand ounces might yield: for ſo much he determined to employ that way.</p>
                     <p>When the Alchymiſt had alſo conſumed this Money, ſhewing great travell a moneth or twain, in placing the bellowes, the coals, and ſuch other ſtuffe, and no whit of profit proceeding or coming thereof. <hi>Balbine</hi> demanded how the world went; our Alchymiſt was as a man amazed. Howbeit he ſaid at length; Forſooth even as ſuch matters of importance commonly do go forward, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto there is alwayes very difficult acceſs. There was (ſaith he) a fault (which I have now found out) in the choyce of the coals, which were of Oak, and ſhould have been of Beech. One hundred Duckets were ſpent that way, ſo as the Dicing houſe and the Stewes were partakers of <hi>Balbines</hi> charges. But after a new ſupply of Money, better coals were provided, and matters more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly handled.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Balbine</hi> was bewitched with deſire of gold, &amp;c.</note> Howbeit, when the forge had travelled long, and brought forth nothing, there was another excuſe found out; to wit, that the glaſſes were not tempered as they ought to have been. But the more Money was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed hereabouts, the worſe willing was <hi>Balbine</hi> to give over, according to the Dicers vein, whom fruitleſs hope bringeth into a fools paradiſe.</p>
                     <p>The Alchymiſt, to caſt a good colour upon his knavery, took on like a man moonſick, and proteſted with great words full of forgery and lyes, that he never had ſuch luck before. But having found the errour, he would be ſure enough never hereafter to fall into the like overſight, and that henceforward all ſhould be ſafe and ſure, and throughly recompenſed in the end, with large increaſe. Hereupon the Work-houſe is now the third time repaired, and a new ſupply yet once again put into the Alchymiſts hand;<note place="margin">Notable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenage.</note> ſo as the glaſſes were changed. And now at length the Alchymiſt uttered another point of his art and cunning to <hi>Balbine;</hi> to wit, that thoſe matters would proceed much better, if he ſent our Lady a few French Crowns in reward; for the art being holy, the matter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proſperouſly proceed, without the favour of the Saints. Which counſell exceedingly pleaſed <hi>Balbine,</hi> who was ſo devout and religious, that no day eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him but he ſaid our Lady Mattens.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Alchymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter bringeth <hi>Balbine</hi> into a fools para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</note>Now our Alchymiſter having received the offering of money, goeth on his holy pilgrimage, even to the next Village, and there conſumeth it every penny, among Bawds and Knaves: and at his return, he told <hi>Balbine</hi> that he had great hope of good luck in this buſineſs; the holy Virgin gave ſuch favourable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and ſuch attentive ear unto his prayers and vowes. But after this, when there had been great travell beſtowed, and not a dram of Gold yeelded not levied from the forge; <hi>Balbine</hi> began to expoſtulate, and reaſon ſomewhat roundly with the couſening fellow; who ſtill ſaid he never had ſuch filthy luck in all his life before, and could not deviſe by what means it came to paſſe, that things went ſo overthwartly. But after much debating betwixt them upon the matter, at length it came into <hi>Balbine</hi>'s head to ask him if he had not foreſlowed to hear Maſs, or to ſtay his hours; which if he had done, nothing could proſper under his hand. Without doubt (ſaid the couſener) you have hit the nail on the head. Wretch that I am! I remember once or twice being
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53058:114"/>
at a long feaſt, I omitted to ſay mine <hi>Ave Mary</hi> after dinner. So ſo (ſaid <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>) no marvell then that a matter of ſuch importance hath had ſo ill ſucceſs. The Alchymiſter promiſed to do penance; as to hear twelve maſſes for two that he had foreſlowed; and for every <hi>Ave</hi> overſlipped, to render and repeat twelve to our Lady.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this, when all our Alchymiſters money was ſpent, and alſo his ſhifts failed how to come by any more, he came home with this device, as a man wonderfully frayed and amazed, piteouſly crying and lamenting his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. Whereat <hi>Balbine</hi> being aſtoniſhed, deſired to know the cauſe of his complaint. Oh (ſaid the Alchymiſter) the Courtiers have ſpied our enterpriſe;<note place="margin">Here the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſter ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious point of couſening kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</note> ſo as I for my part look for nothing but preſent impriſonment. Whereat <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine</hi> was abaſhed, becauſe it was flat fellony to goe about that matter, without ſpeciall licenſe. But (quoth the Alchymiſter) I fear not to be put to death, I would it would fall out ſo; marry I fear leſt I ſhould be ſhut up in ſome caſtle or tower, and there ſhall be forced to tug about this work and broil in this buſineſs all the dayes of my life.</p>
                     <p>Now the matter being brought to conſultation, <hi>Balbine,</hi> becauſe he was cunning in the art of Rhetorick, and altogether ignorant in law, beat his brains in deviſing how the accuſation might be anſwered, and the danger avoided. Alas (ſaid the Alchymiſter) you trouble your ſelf all in vain, for you ſee the crime is not to be denyed, it is ſo generally bruited in Court: neither can the fact be defended, becauſe of the manifeſt law publiſhed againſt it. To be ſhort, when many wayes were deviſed, and divers excuſes alleadged by <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine,</hi> and no ſure ground to ſtand on for their ſecurity; at length the Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſter having preſent want and need of money, framed his ſpeech in this ſort; Sir, ſaid he to <hi>Balbine,</hi> we uſe flow counſel, and yet the matter requireth haſte.<note place="margin">Mark how this Alchymiſter goeth from one degree of couſenage to another.</note> For I think they are coming for me ere this time to hale me away to priſon; and I ſee no remedy but to die valiantly in the cauſe. In good faith (ſaid <hi>Balbine</hi>) I know not what to ſay to the matter. No more do I, (ſaid the Alchymiſter) but that I ſee theſe Courtiers are hungry for Money, and ſo much the readier to be corrupted and framed to ſilence. And though it be a hard matter to give thoſe rakehells till they be ſatisfied, yet I ſee no better counſel or advice at this time. No more could <hi>Balbine,</hi> who gave him thirty ducats of gold to ſtôp their mouths, who in an honeſt cauſe would rather have given ſo many teeth out of his head, than one of thoſe pieces out of his pouch. This coin had the Alchymiſter, who for all his pretenſes and gay gloſes was in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, other than for lack of Money to loſe his Leman or Concubine, whoſe acquaintance he would not give over, nor forbear her company, for all the goods that he was able to get, were it by never ſo much indirect dealing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull means.</p>
                     <p>Well, yet now once again doth <hi>Balbine</hi> newly furniſh the forge, a prayer being made before to our Lady to bleſs the enterpriſe, and all things being provided and made ready according to the Alchymiſters own a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Our Alchymiſter forſooth uſed a little extraordinary lewd company with a Courtiers wife, whiles he was from home, who ſuſpecting the matter, came to the door unlooked for, and called to come in, threatning them that he would break open the doors upon them. Some preſent device (you ſee) was now requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and there was none other to be had, but ſuch as the opportunity offered; to wit, to leap out at a back window; which he did, not without great hazard, and ſome hurt. But this was ſoon blazed abroad, ſo as it came to <hi>Balbine</hi>'s ear,<note place="margin">The mildeſt and ſofteſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſooneſt abuſed.</note> who ſhewed in countenance that he had heard thereof, though he ſaid nothing. But the Alchymiſter knew him to be devout, and ſomewhat ſuperſtitious; and ſuch men are eaſie to be intreated to forgive, how great ſoever the fault be, and deviſed to open the matter in manner and form following.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:53058:115"/>O Lord (ſaith he before <hi>Balbine</hi>) how unfortunately goeth our buſineſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward! I marvell what ſhould be the cauſe. Whereat <hi>Balbine,</hi> being one other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that ſeemed to have vowed ſilence, took occaſion to ſpeak, ſaying; It is not hard to know the impediment and ſtop hereof: for it is ſin that hindereth this matter; which is not to be dealt in but with pure hands. Whereat the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſter fell upon his knees, beating his breaſt, and lamentably cryed, ſaying; Oh maſter <hi>Balbine,</hi> you ſay moſt truely, it is ſin that hath done us all this diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; not your ſin Sir, but mine own, own good maſter <hi>Balbine.</hi> Neither will I be aſhamed to diſcover my filthineſs unto you, as unto a moſt holy and ghoſtly father. The infirmity of the fleſh had overcome me, and the Devil had caught me in his ſnare. Oh wretch that I am! Of a Prieſt I am become an Adulterer. Howbeit, the Money that erſt while was ſent to our Lady, was not utterly loſt; for if ſhe had not been, I had certainly been ſlain. For the good man of the houſe brake open the door, and the window was leſs than I could get out thereat. And in that extremity of danger it came into my minde to fall down proſtrate to the Virgin; beſeeching her (if our gift were acceptable in her ſight) that ſhe would,<note place="margin">En immenſa cavi ſpirant mendacia folles.</note> in conſideration thereof, aſſiſt me with her help. And to be ſhort, I ran to the window, and found it big enough to leap out at. Which thing <hi>Balbine</hi> did not only believe to be true, but in reſpect thereof forgave him, religiouſly admoniſhing him to ſhew himſelf thankfull to that pitifull and bleſſed Lady.</p>
                     <p>Now once more again is made a new ſupply of money, and mutual promiſe made to handle this divine matter hence forward purely and holily. To be ſhort, after a great number of ſuch parts played by the Alchymiſter, one of <hi>Balbine</hi>'s acquaintance eſpyed him, that knew him from his childehood to be but a couſening Merchant; and told <hi>Balbine</hi> what he was, and that he would handle him in the end,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Balbine</hi> is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen in a caſe of flat cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenage.</note> even as he had uſed many others; for a knave he ever was, and ſo he would prove. But what did <hi>Balbine,</hi> think you? Did he complain of this counterfeit, or cauſe him to be puniſhed? No, but he gave him money in his purſe, and ſent him away; deſiring him, of all courteſie, not to blab abroad how he had couſened him. And as for the knave Alchimiſter, he need not care who knew it, or what came of it; for he had nothing in goods or fame to be loſt. And as for his cunning in Alchimiſtry, he had as much as an Aſs. By this diſcourſe <hi>Eraſmus</hi> would give us to note, that under the golden name of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſtry there lyeth lurking no ſmall calamity; wherein there be ſuch ſeveral ſhifts and ſuits of rare ſubtleties and deceits, as that not only wealthy men are thereby many times improveriſhed, and that with the ſweet allurement of this art, through their own covetouſneſs, as alſo by the flattering baits of hoped gain: but even wiſe and learned men hereby are ſhamefully overſhot, partly for want of due experience in the wiles and ſubtleties of the world, and partly through the ſoftneſs and pliableneſs of their good nature, which couſening Knaves do commonly abuſe to their own luſt and commodity, and to the others utter undoing.</p>

                     <p>An ancient writer of a religious Order,<note place="margin">Goſchalcus Boll. ordinis S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. in ſuo prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptorlo, fol. <hi>244.</hi> col. b, c.d. &amp; <hi>1.</hi>

Ii is demanded (ſaith he) why the Art of Alchymiſtry doth never prove that in effect, which it pretendeth in precept and promiſe. The anſwer is ready; that if by art gold might be made, then were it behoovefull to know the manner and proceeding of nature in generation; ſith art is ſaid to imitate and counterfeit nature. Again,<note place="margin">No certain ground in the art Alchymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall.</note> it is becauſe of the lameneſs and unperfectneſs of philoſophy, ſpecially concerning minerals: no ſuch manner of proceeding being ſet down by conſent and agreement of Philoſophers in writing, touching the true and undoubted effect of the ſame. Whereupon one ſuppoſeth that gold is made of one kind of ſtuff this way, others of another kind of ſtuff that way. And therefore it is a chance if any attain to the artificial applying of the actives and paſſives of gold and ſilver. Moreover, it is certain, that quickſilver and ſulphur are the materials (as they term them) of metals, and the agent is hear, which directeth; howbeit it is very hard to know the due proportion of the mixture of the materials; which proportion the generation of gold doth require. And admit that by chance they attain to ſuch proportion; yet can they not readily reſume or do it again in another work, becauſe of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den diverſities of materials, and the uncertainty of applying the actives and paſſives.</p>

and as noble men ſometimes take pleaſure in homely and courſe things, ſo the King did not refuſe to eat turneps and rape roots in <hi>Conons</hi> cottage. Shortly after King <hi>Lewes</hi> being at his palace, void of troubles and diſquietneſs, <hi>Conons</hi> wife will'd him to repair to the Court, to ſhew himſelf to the King, to put him in minde of the old entertainment which he had at his houſe, and to preſent him with ſome of the faireſt and choiſeſt rape roots that ſhe had in ſtore. <hi>Conon</hi> ſeemed loth, alledging that he ſhould but loſe his labour: for prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (ſaith he) have other matters in hand, than to intend to think of ſuch trifling courteſies. But <hi>Conons</hi> wife overcame him, and perſwaded him in the end,<note place="margin">A hungry belly will not be bridled.</note> chooſing a certain number of the beſt and goodlyeſt Rape-roots that ſhe had: which when ſhe had given her husband to carry to the Court, he ſet forward on his journey a good trudging pace. But <hi>Conon</hi> being tempted by the way, partly with the deſire of eating, and partly with the toothſomneſs of the meat which he bare, that by little and little he devoured up all the roots ſaving one, which was a very fair and a goodly great one indeed. Now when <hi>Conon</hi> was come to the Court, it was his luck to ſtand in ſuch a place, as the King paſſing by, and ſpying the man, did well remember him, and commanded that he ſhould be brought in. <hi>Conon</hi> very cheerily followed his guide hard at the heels, and no ſooner ſaw the King, but bluntly coming to him, reached out his hand, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the gift to his Majeſty. The King received it with more cheerfulneſs than it was offered, and bad one of thoſe that ſtood next him, to take it, and lay it up among thoſe things which he eſteemed moſt, and had in greateſt accompt. Then he bad <hi>Conon</hi> to dine with him, and after dinner gave the Country-man great thanks for his Rape-root; who made no bones of the matter, but boldly made challenge and claim to the Kings promiſed courteſie.<note place="margin">A Princely Largeſſe.</note> Whereupon the King commanded, that a thouſand Crowns ſhould be given him in recompence for his Root.</p>
                     <p>The report of this bountifulneſs was ſpread in ſhort ſpace over all the Kings houſhold: inſomuch as one of his Courtiers, in hope of the like or a larger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, gave the King a very proper Gennet. Whoſe drift the King perceiving, and judging that his former liberality to the Clown, provoked the Courtier to this covetous attempt, took the Gennet very thankfully: and calling ſome of his Noble men about him, began to conſult with them, what mends he might make his ſervant for his Horſe. Whiles this was a doing, the Courtier conceived paſſing good hope of ſome Princely Largeſs, calculating and caſting his Cards in this manner: If his Majeſty rewarded a ſilly Clown ſo bountifully for a ſimple Rape-root, what will he do to a jolly Courtier for a gallant Gennet? Whiles the King was debating the matter, and one ſaid this, another that, and the Courtier travelled all the while in vain hope, at laſt ſaith the King, even upon the ſudden; I have now bethought me what to beſtow upon him: and calling one of his Nobles to him, whiſpered him in the ear,<note place="margin">Sic ars deludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur arte.</note> and willed him to fetch a thing, which he ſhould finde in his Chamber wrapped up in ſilk. The Root is brought wrapped in ſilk, which the King with his own hands gave to the Courtier, uſing theſe words therewithall, that he ſped well, inſomuch as it was his good hap to have for his Horſe a Jewel that coſt him a thouſand Crowns. The Courtier was a glad man, and at his departing longed to be looking what it was, and his heart danced for joy. In due time therefore he unwrapped the ſilk (a ſort of his fellow-Courtiers flocking about him to teſtifie his good luck) and having unfolded it, he found therein a dry and withered Rape-root. Which ſpectacle though it ſet the ſtanders about in a loud laughter, yet it quailed the Courtiers courage, and caſt him into a ſhrewd fit of penſiveneſs. Thus was the confidence of this Courtier turned to vanity, who upon hope of good ſpeed was willing to part from his Horſe for had I wiſt.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The reaſon of Circles.</note>The reaſon that Magitians give for Circles and their Inſtitution, is, That ſo much ground being bleſt and conſecrated by holy Words, hath a ſecret force to expel all evil Spirits from the bounds thereof; and being ſprinkled with holy water, which hath been bleſſed by the Maſter, the ground is purified from all uncleanneſs; beſides the holy Names of God written all about, whoſe force is very powerful; ſo that no wicked Spirit hath the ability to break through into the Circle after the Maſter and Scholler are entered, and have cloſed up the gap, by reaſon of the antipathy they poſſeſſe to theſe Myſtical Names. And the reaſon of the Triangle is, that if the Spirit be not eaſily brought to ſpeak the truth, they may by the Exorciſt be conjured to enter the ſame, where by virtue of the names of the Sacred Trinity, they can ſpeak nothing but what is true and right.</p>
                        <p>But if Aſtral Spirits as Faries, Nymphs, and Ghoſts of men, be called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Circle muſt be made with Chalk, without any Triangles; in the place whereof the Magical Character of that Element to which they belong, muſt be deſcribed at the end of every Name.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THis experiment muſt be put in practice while the Carcaſs hangs; and therefore the Exorciſt muſt ſeek out for the ſtraighteſt hazel wand that he can find, to the top whereof he muſt binde the head of an Owl, with a bundle of <hi>St. John's Wort,</hi> or <hi>Millies Perforatum:</hi> this done, he muſt be informed of ſome miſerable creature that hath ſtrangled himſelf in ſome Wood or Deſart place (which they ſeldom miſs to do) and while the Carcaſs hangs, the Magitian muſt betake himſelf to the aforeſaid place, at 12 a clock at night, and begin his Conjurations in this following manner.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, ſtretch forth the conſecrated Wand towards the four corners of the World, ſaying, <hi>By the myſteries of the deep, by the flames of <hi>Banal,</hi>

                        <hi>by the power of the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>and the ſilence of the night, by the holy rites of <hi>Hecate,</hi> I conjure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcize thee thou diſtreſſed Spirit, to preſent thy ſelf here, and reveal unto me the cauſe of thy Calamity, why thou didſt offer violence to thy own liege life, where thou art now in beeing, and where thou wilt hereafter be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then gently ſmiting the Carcaſe nine times with the rod, ſay, <hi>I conjure thee thou ſpirit of this</hi> N. <hi>deceaſed, to anſwer my demands that I am to propound unto thee, as thou ever hopeſt for the reſt of the holy ones, and the eaſe of all thy miſery; by the blood of Jeſu which he ſhed for thy ſoul, I conjure and bind thee to utter unto me what I ſhall ask thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then cutting down the Carcaſs from the tree, lay his head towards the Eaſt, and in the ſpace that this following Conjuration is repeating, ſet a Chaſing-diſh of fire at his right hand, into which powre a little Wine, ſome Maſtick, and Gum Aromatick, and laſtly a viol full of the ſweeteſt Oyl, having alſo a pair of Bellows, and ſome unkindled Charcole to make the fire burn bright at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of the Carcaſs's riſing. The Conjuration is this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I conjure thee thou ſpirit of</hi> N. <hi>that thou do immediately enter into thy ancient body again, and anſwer to my demands, by the virtue of the holy reſurrection,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                        <hi>and by the poſture of the body of the Saviour of the world, I charge thee, I conjure thee, I command thee on pain of the torments and wandring of thrice ſeven years, which I by the power of ſacred Magick rites, have power to inflict upon thee; by thy ſighs and groans, I conjure thee to utter thy voice; ſo help thee God and the prayers of the holy Church. Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which Conjuration being thrice repeated while the fire is burning with Maſtick and Gum Aromatick, the body will begin to riſe, and at laſt will ſtand upright before the Exorciſt, anſwering with a faint and hollow voice, the queſtions propoſed unto it. Why it ſtrangled it ſelf; where its dwelling is;<note place="margin">The anſwers of the Spirit.</note> what its food and life is; how long it will be ere it enter into reſt, and by what means the Magitian may aſſiſt it to come to reſt: Alſo, of the treaſures of this world, where they are hid: Moreover, it can anſwer very punctually of the places where Ghoſts reſide, and how to communicate with them; reaching the nature of Aſtral Spirits and helliſh beings, ſo far as its capacity reacheth.</p>
                     <p>All which when the Ghoſt hath fully anſwered,<note place="margin">How to lay the Spirit.</note> the Magitian ought out of commiſeration and reverence to the deceaſed, to uſe what means can poſſibly be uſed for the procuring reſt unto the Spirit. To which effect he muſt dig a grave, and filling the ſame half full of quick Lime, and a little Salt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sulphur, put the Carcaſs naked into the ſame; which experiment, next to the burning of the body into aſhes, is of great force to quiet and end the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the Aſtral Spirit.</p>
                     <p>But if the Ghoſt with whom the Exorciſt conſulteth, be of one that dyed the common death, and obtain'd the ceremonies of burial, the body muſt be dig'd out of the ground at 12 a clock at night; and the Magician muſt have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53058:119"/>
with him, who beareth a torch in his left hand, and ſmiting the Corps thrice with the conſecrated rod, the Exorciſt muſt turn himſelf to all the four winds, ſaying:</p>

                        <hi>Bathin</hi> is of a deeper reach in the ſource of the fire, the ſecond after <hi>Lucifers</hi> familiar, and hath not his fellow for agility and affableneſs, in the whole Infernal Hierarchy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Barma</hi> is a mighty Potentate of the order of <hi>Seraphims,</hi> whom 20 Legions of Infernal Spirits do obey; his property is to metamorphoſe the Magician or whom he pleaſeth, and tranſport into foreign Countreys.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three Spirits, though of various ranks and orders, are all of one power, ability and nature, and the form of raiſing them all is one. Therefore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician that deſireth to conſult with either of theſe Spirits, muſt appoint a night in the waxing of the Moon, wherein the Planet <hi>Mercury</hi> reigns, at 11 a clock at night; not joyning to himſelf any companion, becauſe this particular action will admit of none; and for the ſpace of four dayes before the appointed night, he ought every morning to ſhave his beard,<note place="margin">The Utenſils to be uſed.</note> and ſhift himſelf with clean linnen, providing beforehand the two Seals of the Earth, drawn exactly upon parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having alſo his conſecrated Girdle ready of a black Cats skin with the hair on, and theſe names written on the inner ſide of the Girdle: <hi>Ya, Ya <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Aie, Aaie <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Elibra <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Elohim <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Saday <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Yah Adonay</hi>

                     <p>The three laſt, who had this Spirit into poſſeſſion, were three <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Magicians, the firſt <hi>Honduros</hi> a <hi>Norwegian,</hi> who called it <hi>Philenar,</hi> and commanded it at his pleaſure with a little Bell.</p>

                     <p>Now when the Maſter hath taken this familiar into his cuſtody and ſervice, the Spirit <hi>Balkin</hi> will deſire to depart, being wearied if the action continue longer then an hour. Therefore the Magician muſt be careful to diſmiſs him in this following form:</p>

                        <hi>Becauſe thou haſt diligently anſwered my demands, and been ready to come at my firſt call, I do here licence thee to depart unto thy proper place, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury or danger to man or Beaſt; depart, I ſay, and be ever ready at my call, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duly exorcized and conjured by ſacred Rites of Magick; I charge thee to withdraw with quiet and peace; and peace be continued betwixt me and thee, In the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.

                     </p>

                     </argument>

                        </note> that it comprehendeth all them, which take upon them to know all things part and to come, and to give anſwers accordingly. It alwayes followeth the word <hi>Ob,</hi> and in the Scriptures is not named ſeverally from it, and differeth little from the ſame in ſenſe, and do both concern Oracles uttered by Sririts, poſſeſſed people, or Coſeners. What will not Coſeners or Witches take upon them to do? Wherein will they profeſs ignorance? Ask them any queſtion, they will undertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve you, even of that which none but God knoweth. And to bring their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the better to paſs, as alſo to win further credit unto the counterfeit Art which they profeſs, they procure confederates, whereby they work Wonders. And when they have either learning, eloquence, or nimbleneſs of hands to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company their confederacy, or rather knavery, then (forſooth) they paſs the degree of Witches, and intitle themſelves to the name of Conjurors. And theſe deal with no inferiour cauſes: theſe fetch Devils out of Hell,<note place="margin">Vide Philaſt. Brix.

Theſe I ſay (among the ſimple, and where they fear no law nor accuſation) take upon them alſo the raiſing of Tempeſts, and Earthquakes, and to do as much as God himſelf can do. Theſe are no ſmall fools, they go not to work with a baggage Toad,<note place="margin">J.

whom it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Ezek. 28.13.</note> 
                        <hi>Every pretious ſtone is thy covering. Paimon</hi> is conſtrained by divine virtue to ſtand before the Exorciſt, where he putteth on the likeneſs of a man: he ſitteth on a beaſt called a Dromedary, which is a ſwift runner, and weareth a glorious crown, and hath an effeminate countenance: there goeth before him an hoſt of men with Trumpets and well ſounding Cymbals, and all Muſical Inſtruments. At the firſt he appeareth with a great cry and roaring, as in <hi>Circulo Solomonis</hi> and in the Art is declared. And if this <hi>Paimon</hi> ſpeak ſometimes that the Conjuror underſtand him not, let him not therefore be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed.

And if you will know the diſpoſition of the World, and what the earth is, or what holdeth it up in the water, or any other thing, or what is <hi>Abyſſus,</hi> or where the wind is, or from whence it cometh, he will teach you abundantly. Conſecrations alſo, as well as Sacrifices, as otherwiſe may be reckoned. He giveth dignities and confirmations; he bindeth them that reſiſt him in his own chains, and ſubjecteth them to the Conjuror; he prepareth good familiars,<note place="margin">Cautions for the Exorciſt or Conjuror.</note> and hath the underſtanding of all Arts. Note, that at the calling up of him, the Exorciſt muſt look toward the Northweſt, becauſe there is his houſe. When he is called up, let the Exorciſt receive him conſtantly without fear, let him ask what queſtions or demands he liſt, and no doubt he ſhall obtain the ſame of him. And the Exorciſt muſt beware he forget not the Creator, for thoſe things that have been rehearſed before of <hi>Paimon;</hi> ſome ſay, he is of the order of Dominions; others ſay, of the order of Cherubims. There follow him Two hundred Legions, partly of the order of Angels, and partly of Poteſtates. Note, that if <hi>Paimon</hi> be cited alone by an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering or ſacrifice, two Kings follow him; to wit, <hi>Bebal,</hi> and <hi>Abalam,</hi> and other Potentates; in his hoſt are Twenty five Legions, becauſe the Spirits ſubject to them are not alwayes with them, except they be compelled to appear by divine vertue.</p>

But he tarryeth not one hour in the truth, except he be conſtrained by the Divine power, as is ſaid. He taketh the form of a beautiful Angel, ſitting in a fiery Chariot; he ſpeaketh fair, he diſtributeth preferments of Senatorſhip, and the favour of friends, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent familiars: He hath rule over Eighty Legions, partly of the order of Virtues, partly of Angels; he is found in the form of an Exorciſt in the bonds of Spirits.

                        </note>IN the year of our Lord 1534. at <hi>Orleance</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the Maiors wife dyed, willing and deſiring to be buried without any pomp or noiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Her husband, who reverenced the memorial of her, did even as ſhe had willed him. And becauſe ſhe was buryed in the Church of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> beſides her Father and Grandfather, and gave them in reward only ſix Crowns, whereas they hoped for a greater prey; ſhortly after it chanced, that as he felled certain Woods and ſold them, they deſired to give them ſome part thereof freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, which he flatly denyed. This they took very grievouſly. And whereas before they miſliked him, now they conceived ſuch diſpleaſure as they deviſed this means to be revenged; to wit, that his Wife was damned for ever. The chief workmen and framers of this tragedy were <hi>Colimannus</hi> and <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Aterbatenſis,</hi> both Doctors of Divinity; this <hi>Colimannus</hi> was a great Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and had all his implements in a readineſs, which he was wont to uſe in ſuch buſineſs.<note place="margin">Note how the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> cannot conjure without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate.</note> And thus they handle the matter. They place over the Arches of the Church a young novice; who about midnight when they came to mumble their Prayers, as they were wont to do, maketh a great rumbling and noiſe. Out of hand the Monks began to conjure and to charm, but he anſwered nothing. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requireed to give a ſign, whether he were a dum Spirit or no, he began to rumble again; which thing they took as a certain ſign. Having laid this foundation, they go unto certain Citizens, chief men, and ſuch as favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, declaring that a heavy chance had happened at home in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery; not ſhewing what the matter was, but deſiring them to come to their Mattens at midnight.<note place="margin">O notorious impudency! with ſuch ſhameleſs faces to abuſe ſo worſhipful a company!</note> When theſe Citizens were come, and that Prayers were begun, the counterfeit Spirit beginneth to make a marvellous noiſe in the top of the Church. And being asked what he meant, and who he was, gave ſigns that it was not lawful for him to ſpeak. Therefore they commanded him to make anſwer by tokens and ſigns to certain things they would demand of him. Now there was a hole made in the Vault, through the which he might hear and underſtand the voyce of a Conjuror. And then had he in his hand a little board, which at every queſtion he ſtrake, in ſuch ſort as he might
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53058:142"/>
eaſily be heard beneath. Firſt they asked him, <hi>Whether he were one of them that had been buryed in the ſame place?</hi> Afterwards they reckoning many by name, which had been buryed there, at the laſt alſo they name the Maiors wife, and there by and by the ſpirit gave a ſign that he was her ſoul. He was further asked, <hi>Whether he was damned or no; and if he were, for what cauſe, for what deſert or fault? whether for Covetouſneſs, or wanton luſt, for Pride or want of Charity? or, whether it were for Hereſie, or the Sect of</hi> Luther <hi>newly ſprang up?</hi> alſo, <hi>What he meant by that noiſe and ſtirre he kept there? whether it were to have the body now buryed in holy ground to be digged up again, and laid in ſome other place?</hi> To all which points he anſwered by ſignes, as he was commanded, by the which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed or denyed any thing, according as he ſtrake the board twice or thrice together. And when he had thus given them to underſtand, that the <note n="*" place="margin">The confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſpirit was taught that leſſon before.</note> very cauſe of his damnation was <hi>Luthers</hi> Hereſie, and that the body muſt needs be digged up again: the Monks requeſted the Citizens, whoſe preſence they had uſed, or rather abuſed, that they would bear witneſs of thoſe things which they had ſeen with their eyes; and that they would ſubſcribe to ſuch things as were done before. The Citizens taking good advice on the matter, leſt they ſhould offend the Maior, or bring themſelves into trouble, refuſed ſo to do. But the Monks notwithſtanding take from thence the ſweet bread, which they called the hoſt and and body of our Lord, with all the reliques of Saints, and carry them to another place, and there ſay their Maſs. The Biſhops ſubſtitute Judge (whom they called Official) underſtanding that matter, cometh thither, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with certain honeſt men, to the intent he might know the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance more exactly; and therefore he commandeth them to make Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his preſence; and alſo he requireth certain to be choſen to go up into the top of the vault, and there to ſee whether any Ghoſt appeared or not. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus Aterbatenſis</hi> ſtifly denyed that to be lawful,<note place="margin">For ſo might the confederate be found.</note> and marvellouſly perſwading the contrary, affirmed that the Spirit in no wiſe ought to be troubled. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Official urged them very much, that there might be ſome Conjuring of the Spirit, yet could he nothing prevail.</p>
                     <p>Whileſt theſe things were doing, the Maior, when he had ſhewed the other Juſtices of the City, what he would have them to do, took his journey to the King, and opened the whole matter unto him. And becauſe the Monks refuſed judgement upon plea of their own Laws and Liberties, the King chooſing out certain of the Aldermen of <hi>Paris,</hi> giveth them abſolute and full authority to make enquiry of the matter. The like doth the Chancellor Maſter <hi>Anthonius Pratenſis</hi> Cardinal and Legat for the Pope throughout <hi>France.</hi> Therefore when they had no exception to alledge, they were conveyed unto <hi>Paris,</hi> and there conſtrained to make their anſwer.<note place="margin">An obſtinate and wilful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the denying or not confeſſing of a fault commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> But yet could nothing be wrung out of them by confeſſion, whereupon they were put a part into divers Priſons; the Novice being kept in the houſe of Maſter <hi>Fumanus,</hi> one of the Aldermen, was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times examined, and earneſtly requeſted to utter the truth, but would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding confeſs nothing, becauſe he feared that the Monks would afterward put him to death for ſtaining their order, and putting it to open ſhame. But when the Judges had made him ſure promiſe that he ſhould eſcape puniſhment, and that he ſhould never come into their handling, he opened unto them the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it was done; and being brought before his fellows, avouched the ſame to their faces. The Monks, albeit they were convicted, and by theſe means almoſt taken tardy with the deed doing; yet did they refuſe the Judges, bragging and vaunting themſelves on their priviledges, but all in vain: For ſentence paſſed upon them, and they were condemned to be carryed back again to <hi>Orleance,</hi> and thereto be caſt in Priſon, and ſo ſhould finally be brought forth into the chief Church of the City openly, and from thence to the place of execution, where they ſhould make open confeſſion of their treſpaſſes.</p>
                     <p>Surely this was moſt common among Monks and Fryers, who maintained their Religion, their Luſt, their Liberties, their Pompe, their Wealth, their Eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Knavery by ſuch coſening practices.</p>

Neither was there faſting and praying, without the which that kind of Devils could not be caſt out. For the fourth point, to wit, the fault of the Exorciſt in faith may appear, for that afterwards the Diſciples asked the cauſe of their <hi>impotency therein:</hi> And Jeſus anſwered, <hi>it was for their incredulity,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thut if they had as much faith as a grain of muſtard ſeed, they ſhould move mountains,</hi> &amp;c.

For the proof of the ſixth excuſe it is ſaid, that though the fault be taken away thereby, yet it followeth not that alwayes the puniſhment is releaſed. Laſt of all, it is ſaid, That it is poſſible that the Devil was not conjured out of the party before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm by the Exorciſt; or the midwife hath not baptized him well, but omitted ſome part of the Sacrament. If any object, There was no Exorciſt in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church;<note place="margin">Why there were no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurors in the Primitive Church, with other ſubtil points.</note> It is anſwered, That the Church cannot now erre.

And it is a general rule, that who or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is newly exorciſed, muſt be rebaptized, as alſo ſuch as walk or talk in their ſleep; for (ſay they) call them by their names, and preſently they wake, or fall if they climb; whereby it is gathered that they are not truly name in Baptiſm. <hi>Item,</hi> they ſay, It is ſomewhat more difficult to conjure the Devil out of one bewitched, then out of one poſſeſſed; becauſe in the bewitched he is double; in the other ſingle.

                     <p>SUrely I cannot ſee what difference or diſtinction the Witchmongers do put between the knowledge and power of God and the Devil; but that they think, if they pray, or rather talk to God till their hearts ake, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heareth them; but that the Devil doth know every thought and imagination of their minds, and both can and alſo will do any thing for them. For if any that meaneth good faith with the Devil, read certain conjurations, he cometh up (they ſay) at a trice. Marry if another that hath no intent to raiſe him, read or pronounce the words,<note place="margin">A Conjuror then belike muſt not be timerous or fearful.</note> he will not ſtirr. And yet, <hi>J. Bodin</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>That he is afraid to read ſuch Conjurations as</hi> John Wierus <hi>reciteth, leſt</hi> (belike) <hi>the Devil would come up and ſcratch him with his foul long nails.</hi> In which ſort, I wonder that the Devil dealeth with none other then Witches and Conjurors. I for my part have read a number of their Conjurations, but never could ſee any Devils of theirs,<note place="margin">Where a Witch cureth by Incantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Conjuror by Conjuration.</note> except it were in a Play. But the Devil (belike) knoweth my mind; to wit, that I would be loth to come within the compaſs of his claws. But lo, what reaſon ſuch people have, <hi>Bodin, Bartholomeus, Spineus, Sprenger,</hi> and <hi>Inſtitor,</hi> &amp;c. do conſtantly affirm, that Witches are to be puniſhed with more extremity than Conjurors, and ſometimes with death, when the other are to be pardoned doing the ſame offence; becauſe (ſay they) the Witches make a league with the Devil, and ſo do not Conjurors.

Even in this point many wiſe and learned men have been and are abuſed: whereas, if they would make experience, or duly expend the cauſe, they might be ſoon reſolved; ſpecially when the whole Art and Circumſtance is ſo contrary to Gods Word, as it muſt be falſe, if the other be true. So as you may underſtand, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do not only by their doctrin, in Books and Sermons, teach and publiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations, and the order thereof, whereby they may induce men to beſtow, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſt away their money upon Maſſes and Suffrages for their ſouls; but they make it alſo a parcel of their Sacrament of orders (of the which number a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juror is one) and inſert many forms of Conjurations into their Divine Service; and not only into their Pontificals, but into their Maſſe-books; yea, into the very Canon of the Maſſe.</p>

Methinks it may be a ſufficient argument to overthrow the calling up and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous works of Spirits,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.7. 1 Reg. 8.39. Jer. 17.10. Pſal. 44.21.

                     <p>And if it be ſaid, That in this Conjuration we ſpeak to the Spirits, and they hear us, and therefore need not know our thoughts and imaginations: I firſt ask them, Whether King <hi>Bael,</hi> or <hi>Amaymon,</hi> which are Spirits raigning in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt regions of the Eaſt (as they ſay) may hear a Conjurors voyce, which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for them, being in the extreameſt parts of the Weſt; there being ſuch noiſes interpoſed, where perhaps alſo they may be buſie, and ſet to work on the like affairs? Secondly, Whether thoſe Spirits be of the ſame power that God is, who is everywhere, filling all places, and able to hear all men at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, Whence cometh the force of ſuch words as raiſe the dead, and command Devils? If ſounds do it, then may it be done by a taber and a pipe, or any other inſtrument that hath no life: If the voyce do it, then may it be done by any Beaſts or Birds: If words, then a Parret may do it: if in mans
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53058:145"/>
words only, where is the force, in the firſt, ſecond, or third ſyllable? If in ſyllables, then not in words: If in imaginations, then the Devil knoweth our thoughts. But all this ſtuffe is vain and fabulous.</p>
                     <p>It is written, <hi>All the generations of the earth were healthful,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sap. 1.14. Eccl. 9. Gen. 1.31. Act. 19.14.</note> 
                        <hi>and there is no poyſon of deſtruction in them.</hi> Why then do they conjure wholeſome creatures, as Salt, Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where no Divels are? <hi>God looked upon all his works, and ſaw they were all good.</hi> What effect (I pray you) had the ſeven ſons of <hi>Sceva,</hi> which is the great objection of Witchmongers? They would needs take upon them to conjure Devils out of the poſſeſſed. But what brought they to paſs? Yet that was in the time whileſt God ſuffered miracles commonly to be wrought. By that you may ſee what Conjurors can do.</p>
                     <p>Where is ſuch a promiſe to Conjurors or Witches, as is made in the Goſpel to the faithful? where it is written, <hi>In my name thay ſhall caſt out Devils,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mark 16.17, 18.</note> 
                        <hi>ſpeak with new tongues; if they ſhall drink any deadly thing, it ſhall not hurt them; they ſhall take away Serpents, they ſhall lay hands on the ſick, and they ſhall recover.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promiſe, this grant of miraculous working was performed in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, for the confirmation of Chriſts doctrin, and the eſtabliſhing of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>But as in another place I have proved, the gift thereof was but for a time, and is now ceaſed; neither was it ever made to Papiſt, Witch, or Conjuror. They take upon them to call up and caſt out Devils; and to undo with one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that which another Devil hath done. If one Devil could caſt out another, it were a Kingdom divided, and could not ſtand. Which argument Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maketh; and therefore I may the more boldly ſay, even with Chriſt, <hi>That they have no ſuch power:</hi> For, <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 43.11.</note> 
                        <hi>beſides him there is no Saviour;</hi>

                        <hi>none can deliver out of his hand. Who but he can declare, ſet in order, appoint, and tell what is to come? He deſtroyeth the tokens of Soothſayers, and maketh the Conjecturers fools,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He declareth things to come;</hi> and ſo cannot Witches.</p>
                     <p>There is no help in Inchanters and Soothſayers, and other ſuch vain ſciences: For, <hi>Devils are caſt out by the finger of God;</hi> which <hi>Matthew</hi> calleth, <hi>the Spirit of God;</hi> which is, the mighty power of God, and not by the virtue of the bare name only, being ſpoken or pronounced;<note place="margin">Act. 8.18, 19.</note> for then might every wicked man do it. And <hi>Simon Magus</hi> needed not then to have proffered money to have bought the power to do Miracles and Wonders; for he could ſpeak and pronounce the name of God, as well as the Apoſtles. Indeed they may ſoon throw out all the Devils that are in Frankincenſe, and ſuch like creatures, wherein no Devils are: but neither they, nor all their holy-water, can indeed cure a man poſſeſſed with a Devil, either in body or mind, as Chriſt did. Nay, why do they not caſt out the Devil that poſſeſſeth their own ſouls?</p>
                     <p>Let me hear any of them all ſpeak with new tongues; let them drink but one dram of a potion which I will prepare for them; let them cure the ſick by laying on of hands (though Witches take it upon them, and Witchmongers believe it) and then I will ſubſcribe unto them. But if they which repoſe ſuch certainty in the actions of Witches and Conjurors, would diligently note their deceit,<note place="margin">Mony is the mark whereat all Witches and Conjurors do aime.</note> and how the ſcope whereat they ſhoot is Money (I mean not ſuch Witches as are falſly accuſed, but ſuch as take upon them to give anſwers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as mother <hi>Bungie</hi> did) they ſhould apparently ſee the Coſenage: For they are abuſed, as are many beholders of Juglers, which ſuppoſe they do miraculouſly, that which is done by ſleight and ſubtilty.</p>
                     <p>But in this matter of Witchcrafts and Conjurations, if men would rather truſt their own eyes, then old Wives tales and lies, I dare undertake this matter would ſoon be a ta perfect point; as being eaſier to be perceived than Jugling.

                     </argument>
                     <p>SUrely <hi>Nero</hi> proved all theſe Magical Arts to be vain and fabulous lyes, and nothing but Coſenage and Knavery. He was a notable Prince, having gifts of nature enough to have conceived ſuch matters, treaſure enough to have imployed in the ſearch thereof, he made no conſcience therein, he had ſingular conferences thereabout, he offered, and would have given half his Kingdom to have learned thoſe things which he heard might be wrought by Magicians; he procured all the cunning Magicians in the world to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſearched for books alſo, and all other things neceſſary for a Magician; and never could find any thing in it but Coſenage and Legierdemain. At length he met with one <hi>Tiridates,</hi> the great Magician,<note place="margin">

The matter of his refuſal (I ſay) was, leaſt <hi>Nero</hi> ſhould eſpy the coſening devices thereof.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nero</hi> made laws againſt Conjurors and Conjuratons.</note> Which when <hi>Nero</hi> conceived, and ſaw the ſame, and all the reſidue of that Art to be vain, lying and ridiculous, having only ſhadows of truth, and that their Arts were only ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefical, he prohibited the ſame utterly, and made good and ſtrong laws againſt the uſe and practiſes thereof, as <hi>Pliny</hi> and others do report.

                        <p>Of <hi>Solomons</hi> Conjurations, and of the Opinion conceived of his cunning and practice therein.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is affirmed by ſundry Authors, that <hi>Solomon</hi> was the firſt inventer of thoſe Conjurations; and thereof <hi>Joſephus</hi> is the firſt reporter, who in his firſt Book <hi>De Judaeorum antiquitatibus, cap.</hi> 22. rehearſeth ſoberly this ſtory fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; which <hi>Polydore Virgil,</hi> and many other repeat verbatim, in this wiſe, and ſeem to credit the fable, whereof there is ſcant a true word.</p>
                     <p>Solomon <hi>was the greateſt Philoſopher, and did, Philoſophize about all things, and had the full and perfect knowledge of all their properties: but he had that gift given from above to him, for the profit and health of mankind; which is effectual againſt Devils.

                        <hi>that they never return. And this kind of healing is very common among my Country-men; for I ſaw a neighbour of mine, one</hi> Eleazer, <hi>that in the preſence of</hi> Veſpaſian <hi>and his Sons, and the reſt of the Souldiers, cured many that were poſſeſſed with Spirits. The manner and order of his cure was this. He did put unto the noſe of the poſſeſſed a Ring, under the ſeal whereof was incloſed a kind of root, whoſe vertue</hi> Solomon <hi>declared, and the ſavour thereof drew the Devil out at his noſe; ſo as down fell the man, and then</hi> Eleazer <hi>conjured the Devil to depart, and to return no more to him. In the mean time he made mention of</hi> Solomon, <hi>reciting incantations of</hi> Solomons <hi>own making. And then</hi> Eleazer <hi>being willing to ſhew the ſtanders by his cunning, and the wonderful efficacy of his Art, did ſet not far from thence, a Pot or Baſon full of Water, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Devil that went out of the man, that by the overthrowing thereof, he would give a ſign to the beholders, that he had utterly forſaken and left the man.

he went out of the Town, and finding a convenient place where to pray, ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kneeling on his knees, he prayed among other things, <hi>That God would ſuffer the Devil to appear unto him in viſible form, that according to the example of S.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet, <hi>he might overcome him in battell.</hi> And as he was in the midſt of his prayers, there came into that place a Woman with a hook in her hand, to gather certain herbs which grew there,<note place="margin">Mutual error by means of ſudden ſight.</note> who was dumb born.

Notwithſtanding, becauſe I am noted above a great many others to have had ſome dealings in thoſe vain Arts and wicked practices; I am therefore to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie unto you, and I ſpeak it in the preſence of God, that among all thoſe famous and noted practiſers, that I have been converſant withall theſe xxvi. years, I could never ſee any matter of truth to be done in thoſe wicked Sciences, but only meer coſenings and illuſions. And they whom I thought to be moſt skilful therein, ſought to ſee ſome things at my hands, who had ſpent my time a dozen or fourteen years, to my great loſs and hindrance, and could never at any time ſee any one truth, nor ſparkle of truth therein. Yet at this preſent I ſtand worthily condemned for the ſame; for that contrary to my Princes Laws, and the Law of God, and alſo to mine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, I did ſpend my time in ſuch vain and wicked ſtudies and practices: being made and remaining a ſpectacle for all others to receive warning by. The Lord grant I may be the laſt (I ſpeak it from my heart) and I wiſh it, not only in my native Countrey, but alſo through the whole face of the earth, ſpecially among Chriſtians. For mine own part, I lament my time loſt, and have repented me five years paſt: at which time I ſaw a Book, written in the old Saxon tongue,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>John Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornes</hi> Book detecting the devices of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Howbeit they affirm that they will not tell all, that might make to the manifeſtation of their holineſs: for then ſhould their own praiſe ſtink in their own mouths. And yet God knoweth their whole Book containeth nothing but ſtinking lyes and Popery.

Witchcraft is in truth a coſening Art, wherein the Name of God is abuſed, prophaned, and blaſphemed, and his power attributed to a vile creature.

                     <p>THat Words, Characters, Images, and ſuch other trinkets, which are thought ſo neceſſary Inſtruments for Witchcraft (as without the which no ſuch thing can be accompliſhed) are but bables deviſed by coſeners, to abuſe the people withal, I truſt I have ſufficiently proved.

And this I know, partly of mine own knowledge, and partly by the teſtimony of her husband, and others of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, to whom (I ſay) in her death-bed, and at ſundry other times ſhe proteſted theſe things; and alſo that ſhe never had indeed any material Spirit or Devil (as the voyce went) nor yet knew how to work any ſupernatural matter, as ſhe in her life time made men believe ſhe had and could do.</p>
                     <p>The like many be ſaid of one <hi>T.</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whoſe name I will not literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover, who wonderfully abuſed many in theſe parts, making them think he could tell where any thing loſt became, with divers other ſuch practices, whereby his fame was farr beyond the others. And yet on his death-bed he confeſſed, that he knew nothing more then any other, but by ſleight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, without the aſſiſtance of any Devil or Spirit, ſaving the Spirit of coſenage: and this did he (I ſay) proteſt before many of great honeſty, credit, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who can witneſs the ſame, and alſo gave him good commendations for his godly and honeſt end.</p>
                     <p>Again, who will maintain, that common Witchcrafts are not Coſenages, when the great and famous Witchcrafts, which had ſtoln credit not only from all the common people, but from men of great wiſdom and authority, are diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be beggerly ſleights of coſening varlots: Which otherwiſe might and would have remained a perpetual objection againſt me.

In ſo much as great matters were thought to have been pretended to be done by Witchcraft. But if the Lord preſerve thoſe perſon; (whoſe deſtruction was doubted to have been intended thereby) from all other the lewd practices and attempts of their enemies, I fear not, but they ſhall eaſily withſtand theſe and ſuch like devices, although they ſhould indeed be practiſed againſt them. But no doubt, if ſuch bables could have brought thoſe matters of miſchief to paſs, by the hands of Traitors, Witches, it Papiſts we ſhould long ſince have been deprived of the moſt excellent jewel and comfort that we enjoy in this world. Howbeit, I confeſs, that the fear, conceit, and doubt of ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous pretences may breed inconvenience to them that ſtand in aw of the ſame. And I wiſh, that even for ſuch practices, though they never can or do take effect, the practiſers be puniſhed with all extremity; becauſe therein is manifeſted a traiterous heart to the Queen, and a preſumption againſt God.</p>

                        </note> So it was that one old Coſenor wanting money, deviſed or rather practiſed (for it is a ſtale device) to ſupply his want, by promiſing a young Gentleman, whoſe humor he thought would that way be well ſerved, that for the ſum of forty pounds he would not fail by his cunning in that Art of Witchcraft, to procure unto him the love of any three women whom he would name, and of whom he ſhould make choice at his pleaſure.

                     <p>But alas, <hi>Hemingius</hi> is deceived, as not perceiving the conceit, or rather the deceit thereof.

                     <p>Again, When ſuch as have maintained the Art and Profeſſion of Conjuring, and have written thereupon moſt cunningly, have publiſhed recantations, and confeſſed the deceits thereof, as <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> did, why ſhould we defend it? Alſo, when Heathen Princes, of great renown, authority and learning,<note place="margin">C.

                     <p>Alſo, when the miracles imputed unto them, exceed in quantity, quality and number, all the miracles that Chriſt wrought here upon earth, for the eſtabliſhing of his Goſpel, for the confirmation of our faith, and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his glorious Name; what good Chriſtian will believe them to be true? And when Chriſt himſelf ſaith; <hi>The works that I do, no man elſe can accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh;</hi> why ſhould we think that a fooliſh old Woman can do them all, and many more?</p>
                     <p>Alſo, when Chriſt knew not theſe Witches, nor ſpake one word of them in all time of his being here upon earth, having ſuch neceſſary occaſion (if at leaſt wiſe they with their familiars could do as he did by the Spirit of God, as is conſtantly affirmed) why ſhould we ſuppoſe that they can do as they ſay, but rather that they are deceivers? When they are fain to ſay, that Witches wrought not in that Art, all thoſe thirty three years that Chriſt lived, and that there were none in <hi>Jobs</hi> time, and that the coſening Oracles are now ceaſed; who ſeeth not they are witleſs, and madde fools that maintain it?

                        </note> it manifeſteth to the world their coſenage. When all the places of Scripture, which Witchmongers allow for the proof of ſuch Witches, are proved to make nothing for their purpoſe, their own fables and lies deſerve ſmall credit. When one of the chief points in controverſie; to wit, execution of Witches, is grounded upon a falſe tranſlation; namely, <hi>You ſhall not ſuffer a Witch to live,</hi> (which is in Latine <hi>Veneficam non retinelitis in vita</hi>) where the word in every mans ear ſoundeth to be a Poyſoner, rather than a worker of Miracles, and ſo interpreted by the ſeventy Interpreters, <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and almoſt all the Rabbins which were <hi>Hebrews</hi> born: Why ſhould any of their Interpretations or Allegations be truſted, or well accounted of? When working of Miracles is ceaſed, and the gift of Propheſie alſo; ſo as the godly through invocation of the Holy Spirit, cannot perform ſuch wonderful things, as theſe Witches and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurors by the invocation of Devils and wicked Spirits undertake, and are ſaid to do; what man that knoweth and honoureth God, will be ſo infatuate as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe lies, and ſo prefer the power of Witches and Devils, before the godly indued with God Holy Spirit? When many printed Books are publiſhed, even with Authority, in confirmation of ſuch Miracles wrought by thoſe coſeners, for the detection of Witchcraft; and in fine, all is not only found falſe, and to have been accompliſhed by coſenage, but that there hath been therein a ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to defame honeſt Matrons, as to make them be thought to be Witches: why ſhould we believe <hi>Bodin, M.

                     <argument>
                        <p>How the Devil preached good Doctrin in the ſhape of a Prieſt, how he was diſcovered, and that it is a ſhame (after Confutation of the greater Witchcrafts) for any man to give credit to the leſſer points thereof.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ON a time the Devil went up into a Pulpit, and there made a very Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Sermon: but a holy Prieſt coming to the good ſpeed, by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs perceived that it was the Devil. So he gave good ear unto him,<note place="margin">He ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have asked who gave him Orders and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to Preach.</note> but could find no fault with his Doctrin. And therefore ſo ſoon as the Sermon was done, he called the Devil unto him, demanding the cauſe of his ſincere preaching; who anſwered: <hi>Behold, I ſpeak the truth, knowing that while men be hearers of the Word, and not followers, God is the more offended, and my Kingdom the more inlarged.</hi> And this was the ſtrangeſt device (I think) that ever any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil uſed: for the Apoſtles themſelves could have done no more. Again, when with all their familiars, their Ointments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby they ride Inviſibly, nor with all their charms, they can neither convey themſelves from the hands of ſuch as lay wait for them; nor can get out of Priſon, that otherwiſe can go in and out at a Mouſe-hole; nor finally cap ſave themſelves from the gallows, that can tranſubſtantiate their own and other bodies into Flies or Fleas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who ſeeth not, that either they lie, or are belyed in their miracles? when they are ſaid to transfer their neighbours Corn into their own ground, and yet are perpetual beggers, and cannot inrich themſelves, either with Money or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: who is ſo fooliſh as to remain longer in doubt of their ſupernatural power? When never any yet from the beginning of the world till this day, hath openly ſhewed any other trick, conceit, or cunning point of Witchcraft, than Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gierdemain or coſenage, who will tarry any longer for further tryal? when both the common Law and alſo the injunctions do condemn propheſying, and likewiſe falſe miracles, and ſuch as believe them in theſe days, who will not be afraid to give credit to thoſe knaveries? When hereby they make the Devil to be a God that heareth the Prayers, and underſtandeth the minds of men: who will not be aſhamed, being a Chriſtian, to be ſo abuſed by them? When they that do write moſt frankly of theſe matters, except lying <hi>Sprenger</hi> and <hi>Inſtitor,</hi> have never ſeen any thing herein; inſomuch that the moſt credible proof that <hi>Bodin</hi> bringeth of his wonderful tales of Witchcraft,<note place="margin">Joan. Bodin.</note> is the report of his Hoſt at an Alehouſe where he baited: who will give further ear unto theſe incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fables? When in all the New-Teſtament, we are not warned of theſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily appearances of Devils, as we are of his other ſubtilties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who will be afraid of their bugs? When no ſuch bargain is mentioned in the Scriptures, why ſhould we believe ſo incredible and impoſſible Covenants,<note place="margin">Yet many that bear the ſhew of honeſt men are very credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous herein.</note> being the ground of all Witchmongers Religion, without the which they have no probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the reſt of their fooliſh aſſertions? When as, if any honeſt mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be appealed unto, he muſt confeſs he never ſaw tryal of ſuch Witchcraft or Conjuration to take effect, as is now ſo certainly affirmed: what Conſcience can condemn poor ſouls that are accuſed wrongfully, or believe them that take upon them impiouſly to do or work thoſe impoſſible things? When the whoſe courſe of the Scripture is utterly tepugnant to theſe impoſſible opinions, ſaving a few ſentences, which nevertheleſs rightly underſtood, releive them nothing at all: who will be ſeduced by their fond arguments? When as now that men have ſpied the knavary of Oracles, and ſuch pelf, and that there is not one Oracle in the world remaining; who cannot perceive that all the reſidue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore of thoſe devices, have been coſenages, knaveries, and lyes? When the power of God is ſo impudently transferred to a baſe creature, what good Chriſtian can abide to yield unto ſuch miracles wrought by fools? When the old women accuſed of Witchcraft, are utterly inſenſible, and unable to ſay for themſelves; and much leſs to bring ſuch matters to paſs, as they are accuſed
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53058:155"/>
of: who will not lament to ſee we extremity uſed againſt them? When the fooliſher ſort of people are always moſt miſtruſtful of hurt by Witchcraft, and the ſimpleſt and dotingeſt people miſtruſted to do the hurt: what wiſe man will not conceive all to be but folly? When it were an eaſie matter for the Devil, if he can do as they affirm, to give them great ſtore of money, and make them rich,<note place="margin">Witches are commonly very Beggers.</note> and doth it not; being a thing which would procure him more Diſciples than any other thing in the world; the wiſe muſt needs condemn the Devil of folly, and the Witches of peeviſhneſs, that take ſuch pains, and give their ſouls to Devil to be tormented in Hell fire, and their bodies to the Hangmen to be truſſed on the Gallows, for nichels in a bag.</p>

Neapol. in lib. de natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali magia.</note> as an extermination or expulſion of the Spirits through the Eyes, approaching to the heart of the bewitched, and infecting the ſame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereby is cometh to paſs, that a child, or a young man endued with a clear, whole, ſubtil and ſweet blood, yieldeth the like ſpirits, breath, and vapours ſpringing from the purer blood of the heart. And the lighteſt and fineſt ſpirits, aſcending into the higheſt parts of the head, do fall into the Eyes, and ſo are from thence ſent forth, as being of all other parts of the body the moſt clear, and fulleſt of veins and pores, and with the very ſpirit or vapour proceeding thence, is conveyed out as it were by beams and ſtreams a certain fiery force; whereof he that beholdeth ſore Eyes ſhall have good experience. For the poyſon and diſeaſe in the Eye infecteth the air next unto it, and the ſame proceedeth further,<note place="margin">This is held of ſome for truth.</note> carrying with it the vapour and infection of the corrupted blood, with the contagion whereof the Eyes of the beholders are moſt apt to be infected. By this ſame means it is thought that the Cockatrice depriveth the life, and a Wolf taketh away the voyce of ſuch as they ſuddenly meet withal and beholds.</p>
                     <p>Old women, in whom the ordinary courſe of nature faileth in the office of purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their natural monthly humors, ſhew alſo ſome proof hereof. For (as the ſaid <hi>J. B.P.N.</hi> reporteth, alledging <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for his Author) they leave in a Looking-glaſs a certain froth, by means of the groſs vapours proceeding out of their Eyes, which cometh ſo to paſs, becauſe thoſe vapours or ſpirits, which ſo abundantly come from their Eyes, cannot pierce and enter into the Glaſs, which is hard and without pores, and therefore reſiſteth: but the beams which are carryed in the chariot of conveyance of the ſpirits, from the Eyes of one body to another,<note place="margin">Non eſt in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo res <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And as theſe beams and vapours do proceed from the heart of the one, ſo are they turned into blood about the heart of the other, which blood diſagreeing with the nature of the bewitched party, infeebleth the reſt of his body, and maketh him ſick; the contagion whereof ſo long continueth as the diſtempered blood hath force in the members. And becauſe the infection is of blood, the feaver or ſickneſs will be continual; whereas if it were of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or flegm, it would be intermittent or alterable.</p>

                        </note>BUt as there is Faſcination and Witchcraft by malicious and angry eyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſpleaſure; ſo are there witching Aſpects, tending contrariwiſe to Love, or at the leaſt, to the procuring of good will and liking. For if the Faſcination or Witchcraft be brought to paſs or provoked by the deſire, by the wiſhing and coveting any beautiful ſhape or favour, the venom is ſtrained through the eyes, though it be from a far, and the imagination of a beautiful form reſteth in the heart of the Lover, and kindleth the fire where it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. And becauſe the moſt delicate, ſweet, and tender blood of the beloved doth there wander, his countenance is there repreſented ſhining in his own blood and cannot there be quiet; and is ſo haled from thence, that the blood of him that is wounded, reboundeth and ſlippeth into the wounder, according to the ſaying of <hi>Lucretius</hi> the Poet to the like purpoſe and meaning in theſe verſes;

He held him bound twenty and eight years, and looſe five years. And during the time that he was bound, he told him that there were many Devils or Spirits.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53058:166"/>
him not: howbeit, as he might conjecture by the Devils face, who was 42 years old, and yet appeared very young, he thought they lived two or three hundred years; and they ſaid that their ſouls and ours alſo died with their bodies. They had Schools and Univerſities among them: but he conceived not that any were ſo dull headed, as <hi>Pſellus</hi> maketh them.

                        <hi>PLato</hi> and his followers hold, that good Spirits appear in their own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but that evil Spirits appear and ſhew themſelves in the form of other bodies; and that one Devil reigneth over the reſt, as a Prince doth in every perfect Common-wealth overmen. <hi>Item,</hi> they obtain their purpoſes and deſires, only by intreaty of men and women; becauſe in nature they are their inferiors, and uſe authority over men none otherwiſe than Prieſts by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their function, and becauſe of Religion, wherein (they ſay) they execute the Office of God. Sometimes, they ſay, that the fiery Spirits or ſupreme Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances enter into the purity of the mind, and ſo obtain their purpoſe; ſometimes otherwiſe, to wit, by vertue of holy Charms, and even as a poor man obtaineth for Gods ſake any thing at a Princes hand as it were by importunateneſs.</p>
                     <p>The other ſort of Devils and defiled ſouls are ſo converſant on earth, as that they do much hurt unto earthly bodies, ſpecially in leachery. Gods and Angels (ſay they) becauſe they want all material and groſs ſubſtance, deſire moſt the pure Sacrifice of the Mind. The groſſer and more terreſtrial Spirits deſire the groſſer Sacrifices,<note place="margin">What kind of ſacrifices each Spirit liketh beſt.</note> as Beaſts and Cattel. They in the middle or mean Region de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to have Frankincenſe, and ſuch mean ſtuffe offered unto them, and therefore (ſay they) it is neceſſary to Sacrifice unto them all manner of things, ſo the ſame be ſlain, and dye not of their own accord; for ſuch they abhor. Some ſay, that Spirits fear wonderfully vain threats, and thereupon will depart; as if you tell them that you will cut the Heavens in pieces, or reveal their ſecrets, or complain of them to the gods; or ſay that you will do any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, or ſuch things as they cannot underſtand, they are ſo timerous as they will preſently be gone: and that is thought the beſt way to be rid of them.

                        </note> From which diviſion <hi>Dionyſius</hi> doth not much ſwerve, ſaving that he dealeth (as he ſaith) only with good Spirits, whom he likewiſe divideth into nine parts or offices. The firſt he calleth Seraphim, the ſecond Cherubim, the third Thrones, the fourth Dominations, the fift Vertues, the ſixt Powers, the ſeventh Principalites, the eighth Archangels, the ninth and inferiour ſort he calleth Angels. Howbeit, ſome of theſe (in my thinking) are evil Spirits; or elſe <hi>Paul</hi> gave us evil counſel, when he willed us,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note>

                     <p>THe Witchmongers, which are moſt commonly baſtard Divines, do fondly gather and falſly conceive the Commencement of Devils out of the 14. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where they ſuppoſe <hi>Lucifer</hi> is cited, as the name of an Angel;<note place="margin">Iſa. 14.</note> who on a time being deſirous to be cheekmate with God himſelf, would needs (when God was gone a little aſide) be ſitting down or rather pirking up in Gods own principal and Cathedral Chair; and that therefore God caſt him and all his confederates out of Heaven: ſo as ſome fell down from thence to the bottom of the earth; ſome having deſcended but into the middle Region, and the tail of them having not yet paſſed through the highet Region, ſtayed even then

                     </p>
                     <p>But as theſe opinions are ridiculous and fondly collected; ſo if we have only reſpect to the bare word,<note place="margin">The groſs dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of many at the Bearing of a ſpirit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> or rather to the letter, where Spirit or Devils are ſpoken of in the Scriptures, we ſhall run into as dangerous abſurdities as theſe are. For ſome are ſo carnally minded, that a Spirit is no ſooner ſpoken of, but immediately they think of a black man with cloven feet, a pair of horns, a tail,

For by that means men ſhould have good occaſion and opportunity to flie from him, and to run to God for ſuccour; as the manner is of all them that are terrified, though perchance they thought not upon God a long time before. But in truth we never have ſo much cauſe to be afraid of the Devil, as when he flatteringly inſinuateth himſelf into our hearts, to ſatisfie, pleaſe, and ſerve our humours, enticing us to proſecute our own appetites and pleaſures, without any of theſe external terrours.

                        <p>That the Devils aſſaults are Spiritual and not Temporal; and how groſsly ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe parts of the Scripture.</p>

                     <p>UPon that which hitherto hath been ſaid, you ſee that the aſſaults of Satan are ſpiritual, and not temporal; in which reſpect St. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us not to provide a corſelet of Steel to defend us from his claws;<note place="margin">Eph. 6.11, 12.</note> but biddeth us, <hi>Put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to ſtand againſt the invaſions of the Devil.

                        <hi>To be ſober and watch; for the Devil goeth about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> He meaneth not with carnal teeth; for it followeth thus,<note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Whom reſiſt ye ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> And again St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>That which is ſpiritual,</hi>

                        <hi>only diſcerneth ſpiritual things; for no carnal man can diſcern the things of the ſpirit;</hi> Why then ſhould we think that a Devil, which is a Spirit, can be known, or made tame and familiar unto a natural man; or contrary to nature, can be by a Witch made corporal, being by God ordained to a ſpiritual proportion?</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this groſs conceipt is, that we hearken more diligently to old Wives, and rather give credit to their fables, than to the Word of God; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining by the tales they tell us, that the Devil is ſuch a Bulbegger, as I have before deſcribed. For whatſoever is propoſed in Scripture to us by Parable, or ſpoken figuratively or ſignificatively, or framed to our groſs capacities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is by them ſo conſidered and expounded, as though the bare letter, or rather their groſs imaginations thereupon were to be preferred before the true ſenſe and meaning of the Word.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Equivocation of this word <hi>Spirit;</hi> how diverſly it is taken in the Scriptures, where (by the way) is taught that the Scripture is not alwayes literally to be interpreted, nor yet allegorically to be underſtood.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SUch as ſearch with the the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, ſhall find, that Spirits, as well good as bad, are in the Scriptures diverſly taken: yea they ſhall well perceive, that the Devil is no horned beaſt. For <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 31.1.</note> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Scriptures, <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Devils</hi> are taken for <hi>infirmities of the body:</hi>

                     <p>And to interpret unto us the nature and ſignification of ſpirits, we find theſe words written in the Scripture; to wit, <note n="i" place="margin">Eſai. 11.2.</note> 
                        <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him; The Spirit of counſel and ſtrength; The Spirit of wiſdom and underſtanding; The ſpirit of knowledg and the fear of the Lord.</hi> Again, <note n="k" place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note> 
                        <hi>I will pour out my Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>&amp;c. The Spirit of grace and compaſsion.</hi> Again, <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note> 
                        <hi>Ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage, but the Spirit of adoption.</hi> And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.8, 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                        <hi>To one is given, by the Spirit, the word of wiſdom; to another, the word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by the ſame Spirit, to another, the gift of healing; to another, the gift of faith by the ſame Spirit; to another; the gift of propheſie; to another, the operation of great works: to another, the diſcerning of ſpirits; to another, the diverſity of tongues; to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the interpretation of tongues: and all theſe things worketh one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit:</hi> Thus far the words of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And finally <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <note n="n" place="margin">Iſai. 19.14.</note> that, <hi>The Lord mingled among them the ſpirit of errour.</hi> And in another place. <note n="o" place="margin">Iſai. 29.10.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord hath covered you with a ſpirit of ſlumber.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the ſpirits of divination ſpoken of <note n="p" place="margin">1 Sam. 28. Heſt. 16.</note> in the Scripture, they are ſuch as was in the woman of <hi>Endor,</hi> the <hi>Philippian</hi> woman, the wench of <hi>Weſtwell,</hi> and the holy maid of <hi>Kent;</hi> who were indued with ſpirits or gifts of divination, whereby they could make ſhift to gain money, and abuſe the people by ſleights and crafty inventions. But theſe are poſſeſſed of borrowed ſpirits, as it written <note n="q" place="margin">Sap. 15.13, 29.</note> in the Book of <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> and ſpirits of meer coſenage and deceipt, as I have ſufficiently proved elſewhere. I deny not therefore that there are Spirits and Devils, of ſuch ſubſtance as it hath pleaſed God to create them. But in what place ſoever it be found or read in the Scriptures; a Spirit or Devil is to be underſtood ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and is neither a corporal nor a viſible thing: Where it is written, <note n="r" place="margin">Judg. 9.23.</note> 
                        <hi>That God ſent an evil ſpirit between</hi> Abimelech, <hi>and the men of</hi> Sichem, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he ſent <hi>the ſpirit of hatred,</hi> and not a <hi>Bulbegger.</hi> Alſo where it is ſaid, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Numb. 5.14.</note> 
                        <hi>If the Spirit of jealouſie come upon him:</hi> it is as much as to ſay, If he he be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a jealous mind: and not that a corporal Devil aſſaulteth him. It is ſaid in the Goſpel; <note n="t" place="margin">Luk. 13.11.</note> 
                        <hi>There was a woman which had a ſpirit of infirmity eighteen years, who was bowed together,</hi> &amp;c. whom Chriſt by laying his hand upon her, delivered of her diſeaſe. Whereby it is to be ſeen, that although it be ſaid, <hi>that Satan had bound her, &amp;c.</hi> yet that it was a ſickneſs or diſeaſe of body that troubled her; for Chriſt's own words expound it. Neither is there any word of Witchcraft mentioned, which ſome ſay was the cauſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>There were <note n="u" place="margin">Mark. 16.9.</note> ſeven Devils caſt out of <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> Which is not ſo groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood by the learned, as that there were in her juſt ſeven corporal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, ſuch as I deſcribed before elſewhere; but that by the number of ſeven Devils, a great multitude, and an uncertain number of vices is ſignified; which figure is uſual in divers places of the Scripture. And this interpretation is more agreeable with <note n="x" place="margin">Lev. 26. Prov. 24. Luk. 17.</note> Gods Word then the Papiſtical paraphraſe, which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53058:169"/>
is, <hi>That Chriſt under the name of the ſeven Devils, recounteth the ſeven deadly ſins only.</hi> Others allow neither of theſe Expoſitions; becauſe they ſuppoſe that the efficacy of Chriſts miracle ſhould this way be confounded; as though it were not as difficult a matter, with a touch, to make a good Chriſtian of a vicious perſon; as with a word to cure the Ague, or any other diſeaſe of a ſick body. I think not but any of both theſe cures may be wrought by means, in proceſs of time, without miracle; the one by the Preacher, the other by the Phyſitian. But I ſay that Chriſts work in both was apparently miraculous; for, <note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 8.16. Luk. 4.36. Luk. 7.21.</note> 
                        <hi>with power and authority, even with a touch of his finger, And a word of his mouth, he made the blind to ſee, the halt to go, the lepers clean, the deaf to hear, the dead to riſe again, and the poor to receive the Goſpel;</hi> out of whom (I ſay) he caſt Devils, and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly conformed them to become good Chriſtians, which before were diſſolute livers; to whom he ſaid, <note n="z" place="margin">Joh. 8.11.</note>

                     </argument>
                     <p>JEſus Chriſt, to manifeſt his divine power, <hi>rebuked the winds, and they ceaſed;</hi>

                        <hi>and the waves of water, and it was calm;</hi> which if neither our Divines nor Phyſitians can do, much leſs our Conjurors, and leaſt of all our old Witches can bring any ſuch thing to paſs. But it pleaſed God to manifeſt the power of Chriſt Jeſus by ſuch miraculous and extraordinary means, providing, and as it were, preparing diſeaſes, that none otherwiſe could be cured, that his Sons glory, and his Peoples faith might the more plainly appear; as namely,<note place="margin">Levit. 14.7, 8. Joh. 9.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Lunacy,</hi> and <hi>Blindneſs;</hi> as it is apparent in the Goſpel, where it is ſaid, that the man was not ſtricken with blindneſs for his own ſins, not for any offence of his anceſtors; but that he was made blind, to the intent the works of God ſhould be ſhewed upon him by the hands of Jeſus Chriſt. But Witches with their charms can cure (as Witchmongers affirm) all theſe diſeaſes mentioned in the Scripture, and many other more; as the Gout, the Toothach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we find not that ever Chriſt cured.</p>
                     <p>As touching thoſe that are ſaid in the Goſpel, <hi>to be poſſeſſed of ſpirits,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 4.23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in many places that it is indifferent, or all one, to ſay, <hi>He is poſſeſſed with a Devil;</hi> or, <hi>he is lunatick or phrentick;</hi> which diſeaſe in theſe dayes is ſaid to proceed of melancholy. But if every one that now is lunatick, be poſſeſſed with a real Devil; then might it be thought, that Devils are to be thruſt out of men by medicines. But who ſaith in theſe times, with the woman of <hi>Canaan, My Daughter is vexed with a Devil;</hi> except it be preſuppoſed, that ſhe meant her daughter was troubled with ſome diſeaſe? Indeed we ſay, and ſay truly, to the wicked, the Devil is in him: but we mean not thereby, that a real Devil is gotten into his guts. And if it were ſo, I marvel in what ſhape this real Devil, that poſſeſſeth them, remaineth. Entreth he into the body in one ſhape, and into the mind in another? If they grant him to be ſpiritual and inviſible, I agree with them.</p>
                     <p>Some are of opinion, that the ſaid woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> meant indeed that her daughter was troubled with ſome diſeaſe; becauſe it is written in ſtead of that the Devil was caſt out, that <hi>her daughter was made whole,</hi>

                        <hi>There was brought unto Chriſt one poſſeſſed of a Devil, which was both blind and dumb, and he healed him; ſo as, he that was blind and dumb, both ſpake and ſaw.</hi> But it was the man, and not the Devil, that was healed, and made to ſpeak and ſee.

                        <p>That we being not throughly informed of the Nature of Devils and Spirits, muſt ſatisfie our ſelves with that which is delivered us in the Scriptures touching the ſame; how this word <hi>Devil</hi> is to be underſtood both in the ſingular and plural number; of the Spirit of God, and the ſpirit of the Devil; of tame ſpirits; of <hi>Ahab.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Nature therefore and Subſtance of Devils and Spirits, becauſe in the Scripture it is not ſo ſet down, as we may certainly know the ſame; we ought to content and frame our ſelves faithfully to believe the words and ſenſe there delivered unto us by the high Spirit, which is the Holy Ghoſt, who is Lord of all ſpirits; alwayes conſidering, that evermore ſpirits are ſpoken of in Scripture,<note place="margin">Numb. 27.16.</note> as of <hi>things ſpiritual,</hi> though for the help of our capacities they are ſometime more groſsly and corporally expreſſed, either in Parables or by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tephors, than indeed they are. As for example (and to omit the Hiſtory of <hi>Job,</hi> which elſewhere I handle) it is written;<note place="margin">2 Chron. 18.19, 20, 21.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord ſaid, Who ſhall entice</hi> Ahab, <hi>that he may fall at</hi> Ramoth Gilead? <hi>&amp;c. Then came forth a ſpirit, and ſtood before the Lord, and ſaid; I will go entice him. And the Lord ſaid, Wherewith? And he ſaid; I will go and be a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all his Prophets. Then he ſaid; Go forth, thou ſhalt prevail,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This ſtory is here ſet forth in this wiſe, to bear with our capacities, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with the capacity of that age, that could not otherwiſe conceive of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, than by ſuch corporal demonſtrations. And yet here is to be noted, that one ſpirit, and not many or divers, did poſſeſs all the falſe Prophets at once. Even as in another place, many thouſand Devils are ſaid to poſſeſs one man; &amp; yet it is alſo ſaid even in the ſelf ſame place, that the ſame man was poſſeſſed only with one Devil.<note place="margin">Mark. 5.9.

                     <p>On the other ſide, it is as plainly ſet down in the Scripture, <hi>That ſome are poſſeſſed with the Spirit of God,</hi> as that the others <hi>are endued and bound with the ſpirit of the Devil.</hi> Yea ſometimes we read, <hi>That one good Spirit was put into a great number of perſons;</hi> and again, <hi>That divers Spirits reſted in and upon one man: and yet no real or corporal ſpirit meant.</hi> As for example; <hi>The Lord took of the ſpirit that was upon</hi> Moſes, <hi>and put it upon the ſeventy Elders,</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>SOme hold opinion, that Spirits and Souls can aſſume and take unto them bodies at their pleaſure, of what ſhape or or ſubſtance they liſt; of which mind all Papiſts, and ſome Proteſtants are, being more groſs than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort, which hold that ſuch bodies are made to their hands. Howbeit, theſe do vary in the Elements, wherewith theſe ſpiritual bodies are compoſed. For (as I have ſaid) ſome affirm, <hi>That they conſiſt of fire;</hi> ſome think, <hi>of air;</hi>

                        <p>Certain Popiſh Reaſons concerning Spirits made of Air; of Day-Devils and Night-Devils; and why the Devil loveth no Salt in his Meat.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>MAny affirm (upon a fable cited by <hi>M. Mal.</hi>) that Spirits are of air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been cut (as he ſaith) in ſunder and cloſed preſently again; and alſo becauſe they vaniſh away ſo ſuddenly. But of ſuch Apparitions I have already ſpoken, and am ſhortly to ſay more, which are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeen in the imagination of the weak and diſeaſed, than in verity and truth. Which ſights and apparations, as they have been common among the unfaithful; ſo now, ſince the preaching of the Goſpel they are moſt rare. And as among faint-hearted people; namely, women, children, and ſick folks, they uſually ſwarmd: ſo among ſtrong bodies and good ſtomachs they never uſed to appear; as elſewhere I haved proved; which argueth that they were only phantaſtical and imaginary. Now ſay they that imagine Devils and Spirits to be made of air, that it muſt needs be that they conſiſt of that element; becauſe otherwiſe when they vaniſh ſuddenly away, they ſhould leave ſome earthy ſubſtance behind them. If they were of water, then ſhould they moiſten the place where they ſtand,<note place="margin">Gen. 18. &amp; 19.</note> and muſt needs be ſhed on the floor. If they conſiſted of fire, then would they burn any thing that touched them: and yet (ſay they) <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> waſhed their feet, and were neither ſcalded nor burnt.</p>

                     <p>THere were among the <hi>Romans</hi> twenty idolatrous gods, which were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Dii ſelecti ſive electi,</hi> choſen gods; whereof twelve were male, and eight female, whoſe names do thus follow: <hi>Janus, Saturnus, Jupiter, Genius, Mercurius, Apollo, Mars, Vulcanus, Neptunus, Sol, Orcus</hi> and <hi>Vibar,</hi> which were all he-gods: <hi>Tellus, Ceres, Juno, Minerva, Luna, Diana, Venus</hi> and <hi>Veſta,</hi> were all ſhe-gods. No man might appropriate any of theſe unto himſelf, but they were left common and indifferent to all men dwelling in one Realm, Province, or notable City.

                     <p>NOw if I thought I could make an end in any reaſonable time, I would begin with our antichriſtian gods, otherwiſe called Popiſh idols, which are as rank Devils as <hi>Dii Gentium,</hi> Gods of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſpoken of in the Pſalms: or as <hi>Dii Montinum,</hi> Gods of the Mountains, ſet forth and

                     <p>Surely, there were in the Popiſh Church more of theſe in number, more in common, more in private, more publike, more for lewd purpoſes, and more for no purpoſe, than among all the Heathen, either heretofore, or at this preſent time: for I dare undertake, that for every Heathen Idol I might produce twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out of the Popiſh Church.

                        <p>A Compariſon between the Heathen and the Papiſts, touching their excuſes for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ANd becauſe I know, that the Papiſts will ſay, that their Idols are Saints, and no ſuch Devils as the gods of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were: you may tell them, that not only their Saints,<note place="margin">Divos vocant Grammatici eos qui ex ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus dii facti ſunt.</note> but the very Images of them were called <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi.</hi> Which though it ſignifie gods, and ſo by conſequence Idols or Fiends: yet put but an (l) thereunto, and it is <hi>Divil</hi> in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But they will ſay alſo that I do them wrong to gibe at them; becauſe they were holy men and holy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. I grant ſome of them were ſo, and further from allowance of the Popiſh Idolatry imployed upon them, than grieved with the deriſion uſed againſt that abuſe. Yea even as Silver and Gold are made Idols unto them that love them too well, and ſeek too much for them: ſo are theſe holy men and women made I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols by them that worſhip them, and attribute unto them ſuch honour as to God only appertaineth.</p>
                     <p>The Heathen gods were for the moſt part good men, and profitable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the Common-wealth wherein they lived, and deſerved fame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which reſpect they made gods of them when they were dead; as they made Devils of ſuch Emperours and Philoſophers as they hated, or as had deſerved ill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And is it not even ſo, and worſe, in the Common-wealth and Church of Popery? Doth not the Pope excommunicate, curſe, and condemn for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and drive to the bottomleſs pit of Hell, proclaiming to the very Devils, all thoſe that either write, ſpeak, or think, contrary to his idolatrous doctrin? <hi>Cicero,</hi>

Yea the Infidels that honoured thoſe gods, as hoping to receive benefits for their devotion imployed that way, knew and conceived that tke Statues and Images, before whom with ſuch reverence they poured forth their Prayers, were ſtocks and ſtones, and only pictures of thoſe perſons whom they reſembled: yea they alſo knew, that the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were creatures,<note place="margin">The Papiſts ſee a moth in the eye of others, but no beam in their own.</note> and could not do ſo much as the Papiſts and Witchmongers think the <hi>Rood of Grace,</hi> or mother <hi>Bungie</hi> could do.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The conceit of the Heathen and the Papiſts all one in Idolatry; of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> a notable ſtory of a Hangman arraigned after he was dead and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt Papiſts perchance will deny, that they attribute ſo much to theſe Idols as I report; or that they think it ſo meritorious to pray to the images of Saints as is ſuppoſed; affirming, that they worſhip God, and the Saints themſelves, under the forms of Images. Which was alſo the conceit of the Heathen, and their excuſe in this behalf; whoſe eyeſight and inſight herein reached as far as the Papiſtical diſtinctions publiſhed by Popes and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. Neither do any of them admit ſo groſs Idolatry,<note place="margin">The idolatrous Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                        </note> as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath done, who alloweth that worſhip to the <hi>Rood</hi> that is due to Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and ſo likewiſe of other Images of Saints. I thought it not impertinent therefore in this place to inſert an example taken out of the <hi>Roſarie</hi> of our Lady, in which Book do remain (beſides this) ninety and eight examples to this effect: which are of ſuch authority in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that all Scripture muſt give place unto them. And theſe are either read there as their ſpecial Homilies, or preached by their chief Doctors. And this is the Sermon for this day ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim tranſlated out of the ſaid <hi>Roſarie,</hi> a Book much eſteemed and reverenced among Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>A certain Hangman paſſing by the Image of our Lady, ſaluted her, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending himſelf to her protection. Afterwards, while he prayed before her,<note place="margin">Exempl. <hi>4.</hi>
                           </note> he was called away to hang an offendor; but his Enemies intercepted him, and ſlew him by the way. And lo a certain holy Prieſt, which nightly walked about every Church in the City, roſe up that night, and was going to his Lady, I ſhould ſay, to our Lady-Church. And in the Church-yard he ſaw a great many dead men, and ſome of them he knew, of whom he asked, What the matter was, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who anſwered, That the Hangman was ſlain, and the Devil challenged his ſoul, the which our Lady ſaid was her: and the Judge was even at hand coming thither to hear the cauſe, and therefore (ſaid they) we are now come together. The Prieſt thought he would be at the hearing hereof, and hid himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a tree; and anon he ſaw the judicial ſeat ready prepared and furniſhed,<note place="margin">But our Lady ſpyed him well enough; as you ſhall read.</note> where the Judge, to wit, Jeſus Chriſt, ſate, who took up his mother unto him. Soon after the Devils brought in the Hangman pinnioned, and proved by good evidence, that his ſoul belonged to them. On the other ſide, our Lady pleaded for the Hangman, proving that he at the hour of death commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his ſoul to her. The judge hearing the matter ſo well debated on either ſide, but willing to obey (for theſe are his words) his mothers deſire, and loath to do the Devils any wrong, gave ſentence that the Hangmans ſoul ſhould return to his body, until he had made ſufficient ſatisfaction; ordaining that the Pope ſhould ſet forth a publick form of Prayer for the Hangmans ſoul. It was demanded, who ſhould do the errand to the Popes Holineſs? Marry quoth our Lady, that ſhall yonder Prieſt that lurketh behind the tree. The Prieſt being called forth, and injoyned to make relation hereof,<note place="margin">The Prieſts Arſe made but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons.</note> and to deſire the Pope to take the pains to do according to this decree, asked by what token he ſhould be directed. Then was delivered unto him a Roſe of ſuch beauty, as when the Pope ſaw it, he knew his meſſage was true.</q> And ſo, if they do not well, I pray God we may.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>A Confutation of the Fable of the Hangman; of many other feigned and ridiculous Tales and Apparitions, with a reproof thereof.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BY the tale above mentioned you ſee what it is to worſhip the Image of our Lady. For though we kneel to God himſelf, and make never ſo humble Petitions unto him, without faith and repentance it ſhall do us no pleaſure at all.<note place="margin">Our B.

Nevertheleſs, ſo credulous is the nature of man, as to believe this and ſuch like fables: yea, to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ſuch ſtuffe, is thought among the Papiſts flat hereſie. And though we that are Proteſtants, will not believe theſe toyes, being ſo apparently Popiſh: yet we credit and report other appearances, and aſſuming of bodies by ſouls and ſpirits; though they be as prophane, abſurd, and impious as the other. We are ſure the holy Maid of <hi>Kent</hi>'s Viſion was a very coſenage: but we can credit, imprint, and publiſh for a true poſſeſſion or hiſtory, the knavery uſed by a coſening varlot at <hi>Maidſtone;</hi>

                     <p>THey that contend ſo earneſtly for the Devils aſſuming of bodies and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhapes, do think they have a great advantage by the words uttered in the third of <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 3.14, 15.</note> where they ſay, the Devil entered into a Serpent or Snake; and that by the curſe it appeareth, that the whole diſpleaſure of God lighted upon the poor Snake only. How thoſe words are to be conſidered, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in that it is of purpoſe ſo ſpoken, as our weak capacities may thereby beſt conceive the ſubſtance, tenor, &amp; true meaning of the word, which is there ſet down in the manner of a Tragedy, in ſuch humane and ſenſible form, as wonderfully informeth our underſtanding; though it ſeem contrary to the ſpiritual courſe of Spirits and Devils, and alſo to the nature and divinity of God himſelf; who is infinite, and whom no man ever ſaw with corporal eyes, and lived. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, if the Serpent there had not been taken abſolutely, nor Metaphorically for the Devil, the Holy Ghoſt would have informed us thereof in ſome part of that ſtory. But to affirm it ſometimes to be a Devil, and ſometimes a Snake; whereas there is no ſuch diſtinction to be found or ſeen in the Text, is an invention and a fetch (methinks) beyond the compaſs of all divinity.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.1. 2 Cor. 11.3.</note> Certainly the Serpent was he that ſeduced <hi>Eve;</hi> now whether it were the Devil, or a Snake; let any wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (or rather let the Word of God) judge.

A ſpirit created is a creature, and that is likewiſe of two ſorts; to wit, bodily, and bodileſs. A bodily ſpirit is alſo of two ſorts: for ſome kind of ſpirit is ſo named of ſpiritualneſs, as it is diſtinguiſhed from bodilineſs: otherwiſe it is called</hi> Spiritus a ſpiriando, id eſt, a flando, <hi>of breathing or blowing, as the wind doth. A bodileſs ſpirit is one way ſo named of ſpiritualneſs, and then it is taken for a ſpiritual ſubſtance; and is of two ſorts; ſome make a full and compleat kind, and is called compleat or perfect, as a ſpirit angelical: ſome do not make a full and perfect kind, and is called incompleat or unperfect as the ſoul. There is alſo the ſpirit vital, which is a certain ſubtil or very fine ſubſtance neceſſarily diſpoſing and tending unto life. There be moreover ſpirits natural, which are a kind of ſubtil and very fine ſubſtances, diſpoſing and tending unto equal complexions of bodies. Again, there be ſpirits animal, which are certain ſubtil and very fine ſubſtances diſpoſing and tempering the body, that it might be animated of the form, that is, that it might be perfected of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul.</hi> Thus far he, In whoſe diviſion you ſee a Philoſophical kind of proceeding, though not altogether to be condemned, yet in every point not to be approved.</p>

The ſame Spirit by reaſon of the force and vehemency thereof is termed <hi>fire.</hi> For it doth purifie and cleanſe the wholeman from top to toe, it doth burn out the ſoil and droſs of ſins, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him all in a flaming and hot burning zeal to prefer and further Gods glory. Which plainly appeared in the Apoſtles, who when they had received the Spirit, they ſpake <hi>fiery words,</hi> yea ſuch words as were uncontrollable, in ſomuch as in none more than in them this ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was verified,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.29.</note> 
                        <hi>Nunquid non verba mea ſunt quaſi ignis? Are not my words even as it were fire?</hi> This was declared and ſhewed by thoſe fiery tongues, which were ſeen upon the Apoſtles after they had received the Holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, this Spirit is called <hi>annointing,</hi> or <hi>ointment,</hi> becauſe that as in old time Prieſts and Kings were by annointing deputed to their office and charge, and ſo were made fit and ſerviceable for the ſame; even ſo the elect are not ſo much declared as renewed and made apt by the training up of the Holy Spirit, both to live well and alſo to glorifie God.

                        <hi>And ye have no need that any ſhould teach you, but as the ſame ointment doth teach you.</hi> It is alſo called in Scripture, <hi>The Oil of gladneſs and rejoycing;</hi> whereof it is ſaid in the Book of Pſalms;<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>45.7.</hi> Cyrill. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang.

                        <hi>God even thy God hath annointed thee with the Oil of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. And by this goodly and comfortable name of Oil in the Scriptures is the mercy of God oftentimes expreſſed, becauſe the nature of that doth agree with the property and quality of this. For as Oil doth float and ſwim above all other liquors, ſo the mercy of God doth ſurpaſs and over-reach all his works, and the ſame doth moſt of all diſcloſe it ſelf to miſerable man.</p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe called <hi>the Finger of God,</hi> that is, the might and power of God:<note place="margin">Exod. 8.19.</note> by the vertue whereof the Apoſtles did caſt out Devils; to wit, even by the finger of God. It is called <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> becauſe it maketh men true and faithful in their vocation; and for that it is the touch-ſtone to try all counterfeit devices of mans brain, and all vain Sciences, prophane Practices, deceitful Arts, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Inventions; ſuch as be in general all ſorts of Witchcrafts and Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, within whoſe number are comprehended all thoſe wherewith I have had ſome dealing in my <hi>Diſcovery;</hi> to wit, Charms or Incantations, Divinations, Augury, Judicial Aſtrology, Nativity-caſting, Alchymiſtry, Conjuration, Lot-ſhare, Popery which is meer paltry, with divers other: not one whereof, no nor altogether are able to ſtand to the tryal and examination, which this Spirit of Truth ſhall and will take of thoſe falſe and evil ſpirits. Nay, they ſhall be found, when they are laid into the balance, to be lighter than vanity: very droſs, when they once come to be tryed by the fervent heat of this Spirit; and like chaffe, when this Spirit bloweth upon them, driven away with a violent whirlwind; ſuch is the perfection, integrity, and effectual operation of this <hi>Spirit,</hi> whoſe working as it is <hi>manifold,</hi> ſo it is <hi>marvellous,</hi> and therefore may and is called <hi>the Spirit of ſpirits.</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is this.<note place="margin">2. Objection. <hi>Hilarie</hi> doth not call the Spirit God; neither is he ſo named in the common Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects.</note> 
                        <hi>Hilarie in all his twelve Books of the Trinity doth nowhere write that the Holy Spirit is to be worſhipped; he never giveth thereunto the name of God, neither dares he otherwiſe pronounce thereof, than that it is the Spirit of God.</hi> Beſides this, <hi>There are uſual Prayers of the Church commonly called the Collects, whereof ſome are made to the Father, ſome to the Son, but none to the Holy Spirit; and yet in them all mention is made of the three perſons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereunto, I anſwer, that although <hi>Hilarie</hi> doth not openly call the Holy Spirit, God: yet doth he conſtantly deny it to be a creature.<note place="margin">

I ſuppoſe that <hi>Hilarie,</hi> for himſelf thought well of the Godhead of the Holy Spirit: but this opnion was thruſt and forced upon him by the <hi>Pneumatomachi,</hi> who at that time rightly deeming of the Son, did erewhiles join themſelves to thoſe that were ſound of judgment.<note place="margin">The place is long, and therefore I had rather refer the Reader un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Book than to inſert ſo many lines.</note> There is alſo in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory a little book which they gave <hi>Liberius</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereinto they foiſted the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed. And that <hi>Hilarie</hi> was a friend of the <hi>Pneumatomachi,</hi> it is perceived in his Book <hi>De Synodis,</hi> where he writeth in this manner; <hi>Nihil autem mirum vobis videri debet, fratres chariſſimi, &amp;c.</hi> It ought to ſeem no wonder unto you dear Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for the objection of the Prayers of the Church called the Collects, that in them the Holy Spirit is not called upon by name: we oppoſe and ſet againſt them the Songs of the Church, wherein the ſaid Spirit is called upon. But the Collects are more ancient than the Songs, Hymns, and Anthems. I will not now contend about ancientneſs, neither will I compare Songs and Collects together; but I ſay thus much only, to wit, that in the moſt ancient times of the Church the Holy Spirit hath been openly called upon in the Congregation. Now if I be charged to give an inſtance, let this ſerve.<note place="margin">Collecta in die domin. ſanctae Trinit.</note> In the Collect upon Trinity Sunday it is thus ſaid; <hi>Almighty and everlaſting God, which haſt given unto us thy ſervants grace by the confeſſion of a truth to acknowledg the glory of the eternal Trinity, and in the power of the divine Majeſty to worſhip the Unity; we beſeech thee that through the ſtedfaſtneſs of this faith, we may evermore be defended from all adverſity, which liveſt and reigneſt one God world without end.</hi> Now becauſe that in this Collect, where the Trinity is expreſly called upon, the names of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not expreſſed; but Almighty and Everlaſting God invocated, who abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in Trinity and Unity; it doth eaſily appear elſewhere alſo that the perſons being not named under the Name of Almighty and Everlaſting God, not only the Father is to be underſtood, but God which abideth in Trinity and Unity, that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holyghoſt.</p>

                        <note place="margin">3. Anſwer. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>Whereto I anſwer, firſt by denying the conſequent, The Son prayed to the Father only; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Father only is of us alſo to be prayed unto. For the Son of God is diſtinguiſhed of us both in Perſon and in Office; he as a Mediator maketh Interceſſion for us to the Father; and although the Son and the Holy Spirit do both together receive and take us into favour with God; yet is he ſaid to intreat the Father for us; becauſe the Father is the fountain of all counſels and divine works. Furthermore touching the form of Praying deſcribed by Chriſt, it is not neceſſary that the Fathers name ſhould perſonally be there taken, ſith there is no diſtinction of perſons made; but by the Name of Father indefinitely we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God, or the Eſſence of God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy-Ghoſt. For this name hath not alwayes a reſpect unto the generation of the Son of God; but God is called,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.1:</note>

Therefore when we in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Prayer do advertiſe our ſelves of God's goodneſs towards us, we do not caſt an eye to the Father alone, but alſo to the Son, who gave us the Spirit of Adoption; and to the Holy Spirit in whom we cry <hi>Abba,</hi> Father. And if ſo be that invocation and Prayer were reſtrained to the Father alone, then had the Saints done amiſs, in calling upon, invocating, and praying to the Son of God, and with the Son the Holy Spirit in Baptiſm, according to the form by Chriſt himſelf aſſigned and delivered.</p>

                     </p>

Univerſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions or ſpeeches are to be reſtrained.

The Scripture doth no where ſay, that the Holy Spirit was <hi>made</hi> of the Father or of the Son, but to <hi>proceed,</hi> to <hi>come,</hi> and to be <hi>ſent</hi> from them both. Now if theſe univerſal propoſitions are to ſuffer no reſtraint, it ſhall follow that the Father was made of the Son; than the which what is more abſurd and wicked?</p>
                     <p>Again, they object out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>None knoweth the Son but the Father,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">6. Objection. The ſpirit knoweth not the Father and the Son.</note> 
                        <hi>and none the Father but the Son;</hi> to wit, <hi>of and by himſelf; for otherwiſe both the angels, and to whomſoever elſe it ſhall pleaſe the Son to reveal the Father, theſe do know both the Father and the Son. Now if ſo be the Spirit be not equal with the Father and the Son in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he is not only unequal and leſſer than they, but alſo no God; for ignorance is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident unto God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereto I anſwer,<note place="margin">6. Anſwer. How excluſive propoſitions, or ſpeeches are to be interpreted.</note> that where in holy Scripture we do meet with univerſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions negative or excluſive, they are not to be expounded of one perſon, ſo as the reſt are excluded; but creatures or falſe gods are to be excluded, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe is without or beſide the eſſence and being of God. Reaſons to prove and confirme this interpretation, I could bring very many, whereof I will adde ſome for example. In the ſeventh of <hi>John</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>When Chriſt ſhall come, none ſhall know from whence he is;</hi> notwithſtanding which words the Jews thought that neither God nor his Angels ſhould be ignorant from whence Chriſt ſhould be. In the fourth to the <hi>Galatians; A mans Covenant or teſtament confirmed with authority no body doth abrogate, or adde any thing thereunto.</hi> No juſt man doth ſo; but tyrants and truce-breakers care not for covenants. In <hi>John</hi> eight, <hi>Jeſus was left alone, and the woman ſtanding in the midſt.</hi> And yet it is not to be ſuppoſed that a multitude of people was not preſent, and the Diſciples of Chriſt likewiſe; but the word <hi>Solus,</hi> alone, is referred to the womans accuſers, who withdrew themſelves away every one, and departed. In the ſixt of <hi>Mark, When it was evening, the ſhip was in the midſt of the ſea, and he alone upon land:</hi> he was not alone upon land or ſhore, for the ſame was not utterly void of dwellers; but he had not any of his Diſciples with him, nor any body to carry him a ſhipboard unto his Diſciples. Many phraſes or forms of ſpeeches like unto theſe are to be found in the ſacred ſcriptures, and in authors both Greek and Latin; whereby we underſtand, that neither univerſal negative nor excluſive particles are ſtrictly to be urged, but to be explained in ſuch ſort as the matter in hand will bear. When as therefore the Son alone is ſaid to know the Father, and it is demanded whether the holy Spirit is debarred from knowing the Father; out of other places of Scripture judgment is to be given in this caſe. In ſome places the Holy Spirit is counted and reckoned with the Father and the Son jointly; wherefore he is not to be ſeparated. Elſewhere alſo it is attributed to the holy ſpirit that he alone doth know the things which be of God, and ſearcheth the deep ſecrets of God; wherfore from him the knowing of God is not to be excluded.</p>
                     <p>They do yet further object,<note place="margin">7. Objection. The Spirit prayeth for us.</note>

For if the Spirit when he goeth from the Father and is ſent, changeth his place, then muſt the Father alſo be in a place, that he may leave it and goe to another. And as for the incomprehenſible nature of the Spirit, he cannot leaving his place paſſe unto another. Therefore the ſending of the Spirit is the eternal and unvariable will of God, to do ſomething by the Holy Spirit; and the revealing and executing of this will by the operation and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit. The Spirit was ſent to the Apoſtles; which Spirit was preſent with them, ſith it is preſent every where; but then according to the will of God the Father he ſhewed himſelf preſent and powerful.</p>
                     <p>Some man may ſay, <hi>If ſending be a revealing and laying open of preſence and power, then may the Father be ſaid to be ſent, becauſe he himſelf is alſo revealed.</hi> I anſwer, that when the Spirit is ſaid to be ſent, not only the revealing, but the order alſo of his revealing is declared; becauſe the will of the Father and of the Son, of whom he is ſent, going before, not in time, but in order of perſons, the Spirit doth reveal himſelf, the Father, and alſo the Son. The Father revealeth himſelf by others, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, ſo that his will goeth before. Therefore ſending is the common work of all the three perſons; howbeit, for order of doing, it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by divers names. The Father will reveal himſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And here by the way I give you a note worth reading and conſidering; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how all Nations in a manner, by a kind of heavenly influence, agree in writing and ſpeaking the Name of God with no more than four letters. As for example,<note place="margin">Marfilius Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in arg. in Cratyl. Plat.</note> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> do call him <hi>Theut,</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> call him <hi>Syre,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> expreſs his unſpeakable name as well as they can by the word <hi>Adonai</hi> conſiſting of four vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; the <hi>Arabians</hi> call him <hi>Alla,</hi> the <hi>Mahometiſts</hi> call him <hi>Abdi,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> call him <hi>Theos,</hi> the <hi>Latines</hi> call him <hi>Deus,</hi> &amp;c. This although it be not ſo proper to our preſent purpoſe, (yet becauſe we are in hand with the Holy Spirits Deity) is not altogether impertinent. But why God would have his Name as it were univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bounded within the number of four letters, I can give ſundry reaſons, which requires too long a diſcourſe of words by digreſſion: and therefore I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them for this time. Theſe opinions of Philoſophers I have willingly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that it might appear, that the doctrine concerning the Holy Spirit is very ancient; which they have taken either out of <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, or out of the works of the old Fathers, publiſhed in and ſet forth in Books, though not wholly, fully, and perfectly underſtood and known; and alſo that our <hi>Pneumatomachi</hi> may ſee themſelves to be more doltiſh in divine matters than the Heathen, who will not acknowledg that eſſential and working power of the divinity whereby all things are quickened: which the Heathen did after a ſort ſee; after a ſort (I ſay) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeparated the ſoul of the world (which they alſo call the begotten

mind) from the moſt ſoveraign and unbegotten God, and imagined certain dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of degrees, and (as <hi>Cyrill</hi> ſaith) did <hi>Arrianize</hi> in the Trinity.</p>
                     <p>So then I conclude againſt theſe <hi>Pneumatomachi,</hi> that in ſo much as they imitate the old Gyants,<note place="margin">Ovid. lib. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morph. <hi>1.</hi> fab. <hi>5.</hi> de gigantib. tae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum obfident.</note> who piling up <hi>Pelion</hi> upon <hi>Oſſa,</hi> and them both upon <hi>Olympus,</hi> attempted by ſcaling the Heavens to pull <hi>Jupiter</hi> out of his Throne of Eſtate, and to ſpoil him of his principality, and were notwithſtanding their ſtrength where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were able to carry huge Hills on their ſhoulders, overwhelmed with thoſe Mountains and ſqueized under the weight of them even to the death; ſo theſe <hi>Pneumatomachi,</hi> being Enemies both to the Holy Spirit, and no friends to the Holy Church (for then would they confeſs the Trinity in Unity, and the Unity in Trinity) and conſequently alſo the Deity of the Holy Spirit) deſerve to be conſumed with the fire of his mouth, the heat whereof by no means can be ſlacked, quenched, or avoided. For there is nothing more unnatural, nothing more monſtrous, then againſt the Perſon of the Deity (I mean the Spirit of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) to oppoſe mans power, mans wit, mans policy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was well ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by that Poetical fiction of the Giants, who were termed <hi>Anguipedes,</hi> Snake-footed; which as <hi>Joachimus Camerarius</hi> expoundeth of wicked Counſellours, to whoſe filthy perſwaſions Tyrants do truſt as unto their feet; and <hi>James Sadolet</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth of Philoſophers, who truſting over-much unto their own wits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo bold in challenging praiſe for their wiſdom, that in fine all turneth to folly and confuſion; ſo I expound of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, who either by corrupt doctrine, or by maintaining preciſe opinions, or by open violence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> aſſay to overthrow the true Religion, to break the unity of the Church, to deny <hi>Caeſar</hi> his homage,<note place="margin">Jacob.

                     <p n="2">2. The Nature of Spirits is variouſly to be conſidered,<note place="margin">The nature of Sprits.</note> according to the ſource to which each <hi>Caterva</hi> doth belong: for as ſome are altogether of a divine and celeſtial nature; not ſubject to the abominable Inchantments and Conjurations of vitious mankind; ſo others are the grand Inſtigators, ſtirring up mans heart to attempt the inquiry after the darkeſt, and moſt myſterious part of Magick, or Witchcraft: neither is this their ſuggeſtion without its ſecret end: that is, that by the private inſinuation, and as it were incorporating themſelves into the affection, or deſire of the Witch, or Magician; they may totally convert him into their own nature: reducing him at laſt by conſtant practice, to ſuch obdurateneſs and hardneſs of heart, that he becometh one with them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with their aſſociation, being altogether dead to any motions in himſelf that may be called good.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And if we may credit example, which is the ſureſt proof;<note place="margin">The original of evil eſſences.</note> the very ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and affection of a Magician, doth create an evil Eſſence or Devil; which was not before in being: for, as the Aſtral Spirits are believed by many to Germinate and procreate one another, ſo likewiſe are the infernal Spirits capable of multiplication in their power and eſſence, according to their Orders, Ranks and Thrones; by means of the ſtrong imagination in a Witch, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolous perſon, earneſtly deſiring their aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Not that the Spirits or Devils ſo begotten do any whit add or contribute to the number in general;<note place="margin">Their Germi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> for as they are capable of increaſing into diſtinct and ſeparated ſubſtances, ſo are they likewiſe again contracted, and as it were annihilated; when the force of that Imagination is gone, which was the cauſe of their production: The nature of a ſpirit, whither heavenly or helliſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dilate, or contract themſelves into as narrow compaſs, as they pleaſe; ſo that in a moment they can be as big in circumference as an hundred worlds, and on a ſodain reduce themſelves to the compaſs of an atome.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Neither are they ſo much limited as Tradition would have them;<note place="margin">Their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for they are not at all ſhut up in any ſeparated place: but can remove millions of miles in the twinkling of an eye, yet are they ſtill where they were at firſt: for, out of their own element, or quality, they can never come: go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will, they are in darkneſs: and the cauſe is within them, not without them: as one whoſe mind is troubled here in <hi>England,</hi> can remove

As for the ſhapes and various likeneſſes of Devils, It is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that according to their various capacities in wickedneſs, ſo their ſhapes are anſwerable after a Magical manner: reſembling ſpiritually ſome horrid and ugly monſters, as their conſpiracies againſt the power of God, were high and monſtrous, when they fell from Heaven: for the condition of ſome of them is nothing, but continual horrour and deſpair; others triumph in firie might and pomp, attempting to pluck God from out of his Throne; but the quality of Heaven is ſhut from them, that they can never find it, which doth greatly add to their torment and miſery.</p>

But that they are materially vexed and ſcorched in flames of fire, is inferiour to any to give credit to, who is throughly verſt in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and exiſtence: for their ſubſtance is ſpiritual; yea their power is greater, then to be detain'd or tormented with any thing without them: doubtleſs their miſery is ſufficiently great, but not through outward flames; for their Bodies are able to pierce through Wood and Iron, Stone, and all Terreſtrial things: Neither is all the fire, or fewel of this World able to torment them; for in a moment they can pierce it through and through. But the infinite ſource of their miſery is in themſelves, and is continually before them, ſo that they can never enjoy any reſt, being abſent from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God: which torment is greater to them, then all the tortures of this world combin'd together.</p>

And that they accompany many righteous men Inviſibly, and protect Cities and Countries from Plagues, War, and infeſtings of wicked Spirits, againſt which Principalities and Powers of Darkneſs, it is their place to contend and war, to the confuſion of the Kingdom of Darkneſs.</p>

                        </note>2. Magicians mention three ſeveral wayes of enjoying the ſociety of the <hi>Bonus Genius;</hi> firſt by intellectual aſſociation, when ſecret and mental inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do ariſe in their hearts, to do this or that, and to forbear the other: as in the Manuſcript of <hi>Nagar</hi> the <hi>Indian,</hi> his own teſtimony of himſelf is to this effect: <hi>My bleſſed Guardian <hi>Damilkar,</hi> hath now ſo ſweetly communicated himſelf unto me; That by all the manifeſtations, whereby a holy</hi> Daemon <hi>can attend and converſe with mankind, he appeareth unto me: firſt in the intellectual way, he is ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and every moment prompts me, what to act, what to forbear from acting: Ah had he not ruſhed up through the powers of my ſoul, and ſuddenly warned me in my Travel to</hi> Quianſi <hi>in</hi> China, <hi>through the airy Region, to turn nimbly to the right hand, at an inſtant, a mighty Troop of Devils, whoſe Leader was <hi>Grachnoek,</hi> coming through that tract of air, had cruſht me into a thouſand peices:</hi> This is the firſt degree of its appearing.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <note place="margin">The ſecond way.</note>3. Then he proceedeth in the language of <hi>Sina,</hi> deſcribing the ſecond way of its manifeſtation: <hi>And when the deepeſt ſleep hath over-poured we, I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without him; ſometimes my <hi>Damilkar</hi> ſtands before me like a glorious Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, adminiſtring to me a Cup of the drink of the Gods, which my Intellectual man exhauſteth: ſometimes he brings caeleſtial Companies, and danceth round about me; and when after the wearineſs of the Senſes, through contemplation I fell into gentle ſleep on the holy Mountain of Convocation, which is called</hi> Adan, <hi>he ſhewed me the motion of the Heavens, the nature of all things, and the power of every evil</hi> Daemon.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <note place="margin">The third way of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</note>4. Thirdly, he continueth to deſcribe the External appearance of the <hi>Genius,</hi> to this effect: <hi>Damilkar appears before me at my deſire; for my deſires are as his deſires: When I ſlept a long ſpace in my private dwelling, he appeared outwardly, and watering me with the dew of the fourth Heaven, I awakned, when he had thrice ſaid <hi>Nankin Nagar;</hi> ſo the time being come, we mounted through the Air, unto the holy Mountain of Convocation.</hi>

I have been told of a certain Country-man, in theſe dayes, who was continually peſtered with the company of a woman, diſcerned by none but by himſelf: If he was upon Horſe-back, ſhe would be behind him: if at dinner, ſhe ſate at his elbow; if lying on his bed, there ſhe was alſo preſent; And if at any time he had taken a journey, or gone about ſome unprofitable buſineſs, at ſuch a time ſhe accompanyed him not; and ſeldom eſcaped he ſome miſchief when ſhe was abſent: But at laſt, for all her dutiful pretences, as ſhe accompanyed him, riding through a deep and ſwift running River, ſhe tumbled him into the deepeſt part, and lay upon him till ſhe had ſtrangled or drowned him.</p>

LEaving the Aſtral Kingdome, I will now proceed to deſcribe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and diſtinctions of Infernal Spirits or Devils, and damned Souls, who are to be conſidered according to their ranks, and orders, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſpondent to the Quires, and Hierarchies of the Angels, or Celeſtial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, wherein I will inſiſt upon their names, ſhapes, places, times, orders, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and capacities, proceeding gradually from a general narration, to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Anatomy of every ſort of Spirit in its proper place and order.</p>

As for the Locality or Circumſcription of the Kingdome of darkneſs, it is farr otherwiſe to be conſidered then the vulgar account it, who eſteem the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh habitation, a diſtinct Chaſma or Gulph in a certain place, above, under, or in the Center of the Earth, where innumerable Devils, and wicked Souls inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, who are perpetually ſcorched, and tormented with material flames of fire. This is the opinion which naturally all men are addicted and prone unto. But if we will rightly conſider the Kingdome of Heaven and Hell, in reſpect of one another, we muſt look upon the ſimilitude of light and darkneſs in this outward world, who are not circumſcribed, nor ſeparate as to Locality from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for when the ſun ariſes, the darkneſs of the night diſappeareth, not that it removes it ſelf to ſome other place or Country, but the brightneſs of the light overpowereth it, and ſwallows it up, ſo that though it diſappeareth, yet it is as really there as the light is.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Illuſtrated by a ſimilitude.</note>3. This is alſo to be conſidered in the deſcription of the Habitations of good, or evill beings, that they are really in one another, yet not comprehended of one another, neither indeed can they be, for the evil Spirits if they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ten thouſand miles, yet are they in the ſame quality and ſource, never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to finde out or diſcover where the Kingdome of Heaven is to be found, though it be really through, and through with the dark Kingdome, but in another qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which makes them ſtrangers to one another.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt heaven and hell.</note>4. A ſimilitude hereof we have in the faculties of the humane Life, as to the indowments of the Soul conſidered in the juſt, and in the wicked; for to be good, pure, and holy, is really preſent as a quality in <hi>potentia</hi> with the depraved

ſoul, although at that inſtant the Soul be cloathed with Abominations, ſo that the eye which ſhould behold God or Goodneſs is put out. Yet if the ſoul would but come out of it ſelf, and enter into another ſource or principle, in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it might come to ſee the Kingdome of Heaven within it ſelf, according to the Scripture, and <hi>Moſes, The word is nigh thee, in thy Heart, and in thy Mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. True it is that the Devils and damned Souls cannot ſometimes manifeſt themſelvs in this Aſtral World,<note place="margin">How the Devils can come into this World.</note> becauſe the nature of ſome of them is more near unto the external quality then of others, ſo that although properly the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt and outermoſt darkneſs be their proximate abode, yet they do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently flouriſh, live, move, and germinate in the Aery Region, being ſome of them finite and determinate Creatures.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But according to their fiery nature,<note place="margin">The great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of their appearance.</note> it is very difficult for them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this outward world, becauſe there is a whole principle or gulph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, to wit, they are ſhut up in another quality or exiſtence, ſo that they can with greater difficulty finde out the being of this World, or come with their preſence into the ſame, then we can remove into the Kingdome of Heaven, or Hell with our intellectual man; for if it were otherwiſe, and that the Divels had power to appear unto Mortals as they liſt, how many Towns, Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, and burnt to the ground, how many Infants ſhould be kild by their malicious power! yea few or none might then eſcape in Lives, or Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and ſound minds, whereas now all theſe enjoyments are free amongſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, which proves, that it is exceeding hard for evill Spirits to appear in the third principle of this world, as for a man to live under water, and fiſhes on the Land. Yet muſt we grant, that when the imaginations, and earneſt deſires of ſome particular Wizards, and envious Creatures have ſtirr'd up the center of Hell within themſelvs, that then the Devil hath ſometimes acceſs to this world in their deſires, and continues here to vex, and torment ſo long as the ſtrength of that deſire remains which was the firſt attractive Cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. For the very cauſe of the paucity of appearances in theſe dayes,<note place="margin">The cauſe of few appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces now.</note> is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time, and the brightneſs of Chriſtianity, diſpelling ſuch miſts, as the ſun doth cauſe the clouds to vaniſh, not by any violence or compulſion, but from a natural cauſe; even ſo the Kingdome of Light as it grows over mans ſoul, in power and dominion, doth naturally cloſe up the Center of darkneſs, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the influences of the Devil ſo that his tricks lye in the duſt, and his will at length becomes wholly paſſive as to man.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. In the time of the Law, when the wrath and jealouſie of the Father,<note place="margin">The Devils power in the time of the Law.</note> had the dominion in the Kingdom of Nature, all Infernal Spirits had more eaſie acceſs unto mankind then now they have; for before the Incarnation of Chriſt, the anger of God had more dominion over the ſoul of Man, and was more near in nature unto the ſame; ſo that the Devils could with more facility ſpring up in the element of Wrath, to manifeſt themſelves in this outward principle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the very Baſis and Foundation of Hell beneath, is built and compoſed of the Wrath of God, which is the channel to convey the Devil into this ſublunary World.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. But when Chriſt began to be manifeſt unto the World,<note place="margin">His power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt in the fleſh.</note> the multiplicity of Appearances, and poſſeſſed with Devils, began inſenſibly to decay and vaniſh. And if any ſhould object, <hi>That betwixt the ſpace of his Incarnation and his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, ſuch accidents were rather more frequent than in the times before:</hi> To this I anſwer, That the Devil knowing well that his time was but ſhort; and alſo knowing, that till the great Sacrifice was offered up, he had leave to range and rove abroad the Kingdom of this World; therefore he imployed all his forces and endeavours to torment thoſe miſerable ſouls and captives to whom Chriſt came to Preach Deliverance.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. But after the Partition wall was broken down, and the vail of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Under Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</note> and of the anger of God from off the ſoul in the death of Chriſt, there was a ſenſible and viſible decay of the Devils prancks amongſt mortals, and that little remnant
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53058:192"/>
of Lunaticks and Poſſeſſed, which continued after Chriſt, did the Apoſtles relieve and ſet at liberty, through the influence and virtue of the promiſe of the Son of God (to wit) <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or <hi>the Comforter,</hi> which could not come until he went away: And on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> whilſt they waited in humility for the fulfilling of his promiſe, the very effect of Chriſts birth and ſufferings did firſt manifeſt it ſelf, when the Holy Ghoſt ſprung up amongſt them, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Sin and Satan.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Under Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note>11. And ſo long as the purity of Chriſtianity continued in the Primitive Church, there were very few that the Devil could perſonally or actually lay hold of in the Aſtral Man, for the ſpace of two hundred years after the death of Chriſt, until that from Meekneſs and Abſtinence, the Chriſtians began to exalt themſelves in Loftineſs and Worldly Honours; then the Devil began to exalt his head amongſt the Lip-Chriſtians, bewitching them into every Luſt; and captivating their inward and outward faculties at his pleaſure. As all along in Popery is clearly ſeen.</p>

Such Nations as have never embraced the Chriſtian Faith, are ſtill deluded and bewitched by him; becauſe the center hath never been actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally awakened in any of them, ſo that the Devils power prevails over them mightily, to ſeduce them to worſhip things viſible, and not the true God: For where the moſt darkneſs is in Religion and Worſhip, or in natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, there his power is moſt predominant; As in <hi>Tartary, China,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> alſo in <hi>Lapland, Finland,</hi> and the <hi>Northern Iſlands.</hi>

In which devaſtation, and bloody inquiſition, their Idols were diſcovered with their Oracles and Inchantments, far different from the <hi>European</hi> Conjurers, and any of their Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p n="15">
                        <note place="margin">The variety of Conjurations according to the Countries.</note>15. But that which is the moſt remarkable in the Infernal proceedings, is this, That there is not any Nation under the Sun, but the Devil hath introduced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amongſt them through their Ceremonies and Worſhip, though quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to one another: For in the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> by the ſacrifice of <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Panaak,</hi> he is Conjured and Exorcized through the repetitions of ſeveral Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Invocations to the Sun and Moon. In <hi>Tartary</hi> the Magicians go quite another way to work, with Offerings to the Ocean, to the Mountains, and the Rivers, fuming Incenſe, and divers ſorts of Feathers; by which means the Devils are compelled to appear. So that we ſee how this <hi>Proteus</hi> can diſpoſe himſelf in the divers Kingdoms of this World; being called by other names in <hi>Tartary, China,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> &amp;c. then amongſt the <hi>European</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers. Likewiſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> could Invocate Spirits by Prayers unto the Moon, and divers Sacrifices of Milk, Honey, Vervine, and Blood. And thoſe that are addicted to Conjurations in Chriſtianity, have attained to a more lofty and ample manner of Incantation and Conjuring with Magical Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Fire, Candles, Circles, Aſtrological Obſervations, Invocations, and holy Names of God, according to the <hi>Kaballa</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:53058:192"/>16. So that every diſtinct Nation hath conformed its Conjuration unto the Ceremonies of that Religion which it profeſſeth:<note place="margin">Why few are able to raiſe Spirits.</note> And it is to be obſerved, That from a natural cauſe every Nation hath its Conjurations and Names of Devils, from the Conſtellation under which the Countrey lyeth, and from the Air or Wind to which ſuch particular Dominations do belong; ſo that no effect would follow, if one Countrey ſhould traditionally inure themſelves to the Forms and Exorciſms that are uſed by another Nation. And therefore is it that ſo many attempts are offered in vain amongſt profeſſed Chriſtians to raiſe Spirits, becauſe they have little or nothing from their own Conſtellation, but make uſe of what they have borrowed from the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> or the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Imbecillity of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> Prieſts; I mean, their ſimple forms of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</p>

But wonderful and manifold are the torments which all in general of the Infernal troops,<note place="margin">The Variety thereof.</note> do ſuffer according to the various luſts they reigned in whilſt they lived upon the earth. The cruel Murtherers that died in the boyling ſource of blood and envy, their torment is the greateſt, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Murthering in their imaginations, and ſeeking, like dreaming men, to do what the want of the Organ will not ſuffer them; for according to the ſaying of the wiſeſt upon this Subject, this is the torment and miſery of all the Damned, <hi>That they are continually wiſhing and woulding; and in wouldings they generate Ideas and repreſentations, which are the ſpecies of their continual aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deceiving phanſies.</hi>

Thoſe that were buryed in Luſt and Gluttony,<note place="margin">The Nature thereof.</note> Drunkenneſs and Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs, are alſo in miſerable torments, yet much inferiour to the firſt; they are continually, imagining their former pleaſures in the <hi>Magia</hi> as in a dream, which when they wake, torments them cruelly; they are often hanging, ſtabbing, and mangling themſelves for love, and perpetually ſinking down in ſorrow and deſpair, if they were ſuch as died in love, or in the height of their Aſtral affections, leaving behind them a heap of deſires and luſts, which are the only cauſe of all their torment. And we may well compare the paſſions of Melancholy perſons, or ſuch as in Deſerts, Woods, and Mountains, pine away for love of Women, unto their torments; which indeed being the trouble of the mind, are abſolutely the greateſt and heavieſt that the ſource or property of this World affordeth, I mean, the perturbations of the minde in general.</p>

Alſo theſe that reigned in Pride and Envy, are ever ſeeking to pluck God from his Throne, and towring up in their Imaginations, as men that dream, ſtill ſeeking for the Kingdom of heaven, to inſult and boaſt therein; but the quality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is utterly occult and eſtranged from them; ſo that they can never finde, taſte, hear, nor ſee it, though it be through and through with their own peculiar principle. This adds perpetually to their miſery, and ariſeth at times with horrible pangs and gnawings, like the irkſome and vexatious pains and aches ſubject to Mans body, which ceaſe a while and then begin to ſhoot and ake by intercourſe, as the Gowt, Tooth-ach, Head-ach, Convulſion, Gripings, and the Stone.</p>

                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Fumigations</hi> for <hi>Saturn</hi> are made of Frankincenſe Trees,<note place="margin">

Oyl that hath ſtood under Grapes, being lighted, preſenteth the Chamber full of Grapes.

                     <p n="6">6. Such wonderful effects have natural things being fitted unto their Hours and Conſtellations,<note place="margin">The Candle of life.</note> as alſo when they are uſed to prove ſuch effects as the nature of the things doth produce of it ſelf, though in a weaker degree. To raiſe <hi>Tempeſts</hi> Magicians burn the Liver of a Camaelion on the houſe top. To cauſe <hi>ſtrange ſights</hi> they hang the Gall of an Ox over their Beds; to bring <hi>Apparitions</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> they make a ſtrange fume of a Mans Gall, and the Eyes of a black Cat; <hi>Which, Agrippa</hi> ſaith, <hi>he hath often made experience of.</hi> There is alſo a ſtrange Magical Candle deſcribed amongſt <hi>Chymical</hi> Authors, which being lighted, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells the death of the party to whom it belongs: The manner thereof is thus; <hi>They take a good quantity of the venal blood luke-warm as it came out of the vein, which being Chymically prepared with Spirit of Wine and other Ingredients, is at laſt made up into a Candle, which being once kindled, never goes out till the death of the party whoſe blood it is compoſed of; for when he is ſick, or in danger, it burns dim and troubled; and when he is dead, it is quite extinguiſhed;</hi> of which Compoſition a Learned man hath wrote an intire Tractate, <hi>De Biolychnio,</hi> or, <hi>The Lamp of Life.</hi>

                     <p n="7">7. But to proceed to the nature of <hi>Characters, Sigils,</hi> and other <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">That Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts.</note> we find that not only ſuch as pretend to command over all ſorts of Spirits; but alſo they that do make Compacts, and have ſold themſelves unto him, do make uſe of ſuch; which inſtance is ſufficient to prove what a wiſe man hath aſſerted, that although Evil Spirits have ſo blinded Mens Eyes, as to make them believe they are defended by ſuch Ceremonies, and that theſe Characters are as Munitions againſt the Devils malignancy; Yet theſe very <hi>Characters, Sigils, Lamins,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>Compacts</hi> themſelves, which the Devils did at firſt cunningly diſguiſe with ſtrange Repetitions in uncouth Language.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. So that we have grounds to believe, that none is able abſolutely without <hi>Compact</hi> to call up any <hi>Spirit.</hi> But that whoſoever hath pretended to be famous in

                        <note place="margin">The vanity of Conjuration.</note>10.

                        <note place="margin">By Similitude.</note>11. Which is nothing wonderful, if we minde the <hi>ſympathy</hi> of things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how each deſires its <hi>like,</hi> and hunteth after it as the Loadſtone draws Iron; the male coveteth the female; the evil after the evil, and the good after the good; which is ſeen in wicked Men and their Aſſociation, in Birds and Beaſts of prey; while on the contrary, the Lamb delights not in the Lyon, nor the Sheep in the ſociety of the Wolf; neither doth the nature which is totally depraved and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged from God, care to be forced or drawn compulſively by another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary nature, <hi>viz.</hi> innocent, juſt, and harmleſs.</p>

Neither doth it conſiſt with natural reaſon, That <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the ſociety of thoſe that are their Enemies, who make uſe of the dreadful and holy Names of God in Conjurations to call them up; whereas they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther antidotes againſt Apparations, as may be ſeen in various Examples of holy Men, who by Prayers and Exorciſms have baniſhed <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> in all Ages, which is alſo further evident, in that the very form of <hi>Diſpoſſeſſing</hi> and <hi>Exorciſing</hi> is made up of divers Prayers and Defenſive Bleſſings againſt the obnoxious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of <hi>Infernal Spirits.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Like deſires its like.</note>13. Therefore though I would be far from deſcribing an undenyable courſe of Conjuring Spirits, or of cauſing Apparitions: Yet this I muſt aſſert conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively from what is before alledged, That if any thing would be called or wrought upon, it muſt be with ſomething which is of its own nature, as a bait to catch or tempt it; for in catching Birds, Beaſts, or Fiſhes, ſuch eſculents as are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for theſe Animals, are made uſe of to allure them, neither can mankinde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them by any threats to come into his cuſtody.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <note place="margin">Nothing is compelled by contraries.</note>14. How much leſs is mankind able to compel the <hi>Infernal Spirits,</hi> the very leaſt of which Kingdom, is able, if let looſe, to exterminate a thouſand lives, and utterly over-turn poor mortals and their doings, as various by-paſt accidents can evince: But whoſoever hath compacted with them for body, ſoul, and works, ſuch they are at unity with, and unto ſuch they appear for the advancement of their Kingdom in the deſtruction of others; for they are grafted into them and incorporated into their very heart and ſoul, which unavoidably becomes their wages when the body falls away.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Yet many wayes there be by <hi>Images, Teleſms,</hi> and <hi>Amulets,</hi> which have little or no dependance upon Conjuration, or the ſtrength thereof, being rather effectual from ſympathetical Cauſes, as many natural concluſions prove. And <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſpeaks of a way by the Image of any Bird or Beaſt to deſtroy that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, though at a diſtance; ſo by hair, fat, blood, excrements, excreſcences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of any Animal or Vegetable, the ruin or cure of that thing may be effected.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Which is ſeen in the Armary Unguent, and the Sympathetical Powder. In the inſtance of divers Hiſtories, of ſuch as uſed Waxen Images, compoſed in divers poſtures, and under certain Conſtellations, whereby ſeveral have been tormented and macerated even unto death; and according to the puniſhment or torment which the Magician intends to afflict, accordingly do they diſpoſe the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53058:198"/>
hour of the Compoſition, and the poſture or ſemblance of the Image.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. For if a malitious minded Witch intends to conſume and pine away the Life or Eſtate of any miſerable Man or Woman,<note place="margin">Of Images of Wax, and what is wrought by them.</note> ſhe makes his Image of Wax in ſuch an ominous aſpect as may conduce to her deſign, making ſeveral magical Characters upon the ſides of the head, deſcribing the Character of the hour or Planetary time upon the breaſt of the Image; the name of the party on his forehead; the intended effect to be wrought upon him upon his back. When they cauſe aches, pains, and violent pangs in the ſinews and the fleſh, they ſtick thorns and pins in divers places of their arms, breaſts, and legs. When they caſt them into Feavers and Conſumptions, they ſpend an hour in every day to warm and turn the Image before a doleful and lingring fire, compoſed of divers exotick Gums, and magical Ingredients of ſweet O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and ſtrange Roots of ſhrubs, efficient for their purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Wonderful are the various poſtures and pranks which Magicians play with Images;<note place="margin">Further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Images.</note> neither will I mention the moſt perfect and prevalent part of the practice of Images, and the powerful operations thereof, leaſt the evil mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould work abominations therewith upon the Perſons or Poſſeſſions of their neighbours.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. According to the nature of what they would effect they frame their Images; if by Images they would provoke two parties to love,<note place="margin">Of Images provoking Love.</note> or be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured on one another, they frame their Images naked, with Aſtrological Obſervations and Imbraces of thoſe that are Venereal; to provoke unto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity they place malignant Characters and Aſpects, and the Images in a fighting poſture.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. If their intentions be for good, all their Characters are engraven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foreparts of the body. But if they would afflict the party with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, or with death, they thruſt Needles through the hearts, and engrave their Characters upon their Poſteriors, or upon their ſhoulders, uſing all their Conjurations retrograde, and repeating every Charm oppoſite to the former.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. Thouſands of ſtrange and uncouth Charms might be here deſcribed, according to the exact form wherein Tradition hath left them; But I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſted upon the deſcription of the natures in General; And as by <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Teleſms,</hi> the <hi>Europeans</hi> have effected admirable things: ſo the <hi>Tartars</hi> have a wonderful ways of producing the like effects, by <hi>Botles, Sheep-skins,</hi>
