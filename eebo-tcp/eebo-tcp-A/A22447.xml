         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Kings most Excellent Maiestie, and His Royall Father of</hi>
blessed memory, hauing at seuerall times and vpon seuerall occasions,
published their Proclamations concerning Tobacco, as well that which
hath beene indeauoured to bee planted within this Realme, as that
which is of the growth of <hi>Virginia</hi> and the <hi>Sommer Islands,</hi> and other
English Colonies and Plantations, and also concerning <hi>Spanish</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forraigne Tobacco; And finding that the inordinate desire of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Tobacco, and the unmoderate thirst of gaine, by the planting and
selling of Tobacco, cannot otherwise be allayed or moderated; Hath at
the last, by the aduice of His Priuie Counsell, determined vpon this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
resolution touching all sorts of Tobacco, in manner following.</p>
            <p>First, His Maiestie doth heereby declare His Royall Pleasure to be, and doth heereby Will and
Command, that no person whatsoeuer doe at any time heereafter, plant, cherish, or preserue any
Tobacco, within these His Realmes of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> or any the Isles,
parts, or places, of, or belonging to them or any of them, and if any bee now planted or growing
there, that the same bee presently plucked vp and vtterly destroyed, by the Owners, Planters,
Tenders, or Dressers thereof, and lest they or any of them, should aduenture to neglect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
heereof, His Maiestie doeth further straitly charge and command all Constables, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing-men,
Headboroughs, and other Officers within their seuerall limits and Iurisdictions,
carefully and effectually to see the same executed and performed accordingly. And His Maiestie
doth further Will and Command all Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Sheriffes, and other principall
Officers in their seuerall places, within the compasse of their seuerall Iurisdictions and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
vpon complaint to them made, to cause the same to be duly performed and executed without
partialitie, as they and euery of them will answere their contempts in that behalfe at their vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
perils.</p>
            <p>And that the Tobacco of His Maiesties owne Plantations and Colonies may not bee planted
and imported hither without limitation or measure, or vnder colour thereof, the Tobacco of the
growth of <hi>Spaine</hi> and other forraigne parts, may not be brought into these His Realmes, or sold or
vttered heere, to the ouerthrow of His Colonies abroad, and to the wasting of the wealth and
treasure of His Kingdomes at home. His Maiestie doeth further Will and straitly Command,
that no person whatsoeuer doe at any time heereafter import any Tobacco of the growth of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and other forraigne parts out of His owne Dominions, nor sell, vtter, or offer to sell, or vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or otherwise dispose or keepe any such Tobacco, to the intent to sell or vtter the same without
His Maiesties speciall Commission in that behalfe, vpon paine of confiscation and forfeiture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in whose hands soeuer the same shall be found, and vpon such further paines and penalties, as
by the Lawes of these His Realmes, or by His Prerogatiue Royall which in this case He will not
admit to be disputed, may be inflicted vpon the offendors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:28980:2"/>
And because such forraigne Tobacco, may not be receiued and vttered, vnder the pretence of
the Tobacco of the growth of <hi>Virginia,</hi> the <hi>Summer-Ilands,</hi> and other Colonies and Plantations,
vnder, and within His Maiesties owne Dominions, nor the Planters, Owners, or Aduenturers,
of, and in these Plantations, giue themselues ouer to the planting of Tobacco onely, to make a
present returne of profit, and neglect to applie themselues to solide Commodities fit for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of Colonies, which will vtterly destroy these and all other Plantations; His Maiestie
doth further will and command, that from henceforth no Tobacco of the growth of <hi>Virginia,</hi> the
<hi>Summer-Ilands,</hi> or any other Plantations, or Colonies, of, or within His owne Dominions, bee
imported into these his Realmes or Dominions, or any the Ports, Hauens, Creekes, or places
thereof, without His Maiesties especiall licence in that behalfe, vnder the great Seale of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and that vpon the importation thereof, the same bee deliuered into the hands of such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
for his Maiesties owne immediate vse, as His Maiestie vnder His great Seale of
<hi>England</hi> shal appoint, at, &amp; for such Prices and Rates to be paid for the same, as shall be reasonably
agreed vpon, betweene the Owners or Factors of the same, and the Kings Commissioners on
His Maiesties behalfe, or if they shall not agree thereon, then to be transported againe, and sold
elsewhere, vpon paine of confiscation and forfeiture thereof, and vpon such further paines and
penalties, as by the Law, or His Maiesties Prerogatiue Royall may be inflicted vpon them.</p>
            <p>And further His Maiestie doth straitly charge and command, that no person whatsoeuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to buy any sort of Tobacco, within these Realmes or Dominions, or any Hauen, Port,
Creeke, or place thereof, of any other person, then of His Maiesties Commissioners onely to bee
authorised vnder the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> as aforesaid, and after the same shall bee sealed with
a Seale to that purpose appointed, and that they, vpon the buying thereof, doe expresse the true
time when the same was bought, the quantitie and qualitie thereof, in and by a note in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
indented betweene the Buyer and Seller, testifying the same vpon the paines and penalties
aforesayd,</p>
            <p>And if during these times of Hostility, and Tobacco shall bee imported by any of his Maiesties
owne Shippes, or by the Ships of any of his Subiects, by way of Prize, or Letters of Marque,
his further will and pleasure is, that all such Tobacco shall be deliuered vnto his Maiesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
at, and for reasonable prices, to bee accomptable therefore to his Maiesties vse.</p>
            <p>And his Maiestie doeth hereby straitly charge and command, all Customers, Controllers,
Searchers, Wayters, and all other Officers, Ministers, of, or belonging to His Customes,
And also all Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Sheriffes, Constables, and other Our Officers,
Ministers and louing Subiects, in their seuerall places and degrees, to take knowledge of this
his Royall pleasure and Commandement, and to bee ayding, helping and assisting to His Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Commissioners, and their Deputies, Factors and seruants, in all things touching and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this His Seruice, whereof his Maiestie is resolued to require a due and strict accompt.</p>
