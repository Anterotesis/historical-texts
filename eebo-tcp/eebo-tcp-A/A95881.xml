         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of ſupplication, Remonſtrance, Proteſtations, and ſufferings) for the preſervation of our ſelves and our Religion, from utter ruin
and deſtruction; according to the commendable practiſe of theſe Kingdomes in former times, and the example of Gods people in

               <head>The Covenant.</head>
               <p>1. THat we ſhall ſincerely, really, and conſtantly, through the grace of God, endeavor in our ſeverall Places and callings, the
preſervation of the reformed Religion, in the Church of Scotland, in Doctrin, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government, againſt
our common Enemies, the Reformation of Religion, in the Kingdomes of England and Ireland in Doctrine Worſhip, Diſcipline,

Government, Directorie for Worſhip and Catechizing; That We and our poſterity after us, may as brethren live in faith and love
and the Lord may delight to dwel in the midſt of us.</p>
               <p>2 That we ſhall in like manner without reſpect of perſons, endeavor the Extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, (that is, Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, their Chancellors and Commiſſaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Arch-deacons, and all other

to preſerve the Rights and Priviledges of the Parliament and the Liberties of the Kingdomes; and to preſerve and defend the
Kings Majeſties Perſon and Authority, in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdomes, that the
world may bear witneſs with our conſciences of our Loyalty; and that we have no thoughts or intentions to diminiſh his Majeſties

               <p>4. We ſhall alſo, withall faithfulneſs, endeavour the diſcoverie of all ſuch as ſhall be Incendiaries, Malignants, or evill Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by hindring the Reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his people, or one of the Kingdomes from another, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <p>5. And whereas the happineſſe of a bleſſed Peace between theſe Kingdomes, denyed in former times to our progenitors, is by the
good providence of God granted unto us, and hath been lately concluded and ſetled by both Parliaments; We ſhall each one of us,
according to our place and intereſt, endeavour that they may remain conjoyned in a firme Peace and Union to all poſterity, and
that juſtice may be done upon the wilfull oppoſers thereof, in manner expreſſed in the preſent Articles.</p>
               <p>6. We ſhall alſo according to our places and callings, in this common cauſe of Religion, Liberty, and Peace of the Kingdomes
aſſiſt and defend all thoſe that enter into this League and Covenant, in the maintaining and purſuing thereof, and ſhall not ſuffer
our ſelves directly or indirectly, by whatſoever combination, perſwaſion or terrour, to be divided or withdrawn from this bleſſed Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

in this cauſe which ſo much concerneth the glory of God, the good of the Kingdomes and honour of the King; but ſhall all the
dayes of our lives, zealouſly and conſtantly continue therein againſt all oppoſition; and promote the ſame according to our power
againſt all lets and impediments whatſoever; and what we are not able our ſelves to ſuppreſſe or overcome we ſhall reveal and
make known, that it may be timely prevented or removed. All which we ſhall do as in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>7. And becauſe theſe Kingdomes are guilty of many ſins and provocations againſt God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt; as is too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
by our preſent diſtreſſes and dangers, the fruits thereof, We profeſſe and declare before God and the world, our unfained de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be humbled for our own ſins, and for the ſins of this Kingdome; Eſpecially that we have not as we ought, valued the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
benefit of the Goſpel, that we have not laboured for the purity and power thereof, and that we have not endeauoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Chriſt into our hearts, nor to walk worthy of him in our lives, and each one to go before another in the Example of a reall
Reformation; That the Lord may turn away his wrath and heavie indignation, and eſtabliſh theſe Churches and Kingdomes in
truth and peace. And, this Covenant we make in the preſence of Almighty God the ſearcher of all hearts, with a true intention to
perform the ſame, as we ſhall anſwer at that great day, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed; Moſt humbly beſeeching
the Lord to ſtrengthen us by his holy Spirit for this end, and to bleſſe our deſires and proceedings with ſuch ſucceſſe as may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
and ſafety to his people, and encouragement to other Chriſtian Churches, groaning under or in danger of the yoak of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian

            <bibl>JEREM. 11. v. 10. 11.</bibl>
            <q> The houſe of Iſrael, and
the houſe of Judah have broken my Covenant,
which I made with their fathers. Therefore, thus
ſaith the Lord, behold, I wil bring evil upon them,
which they ſhal not be able to eſcape, and though
they ſhal cry unto me, I wil not hearken unto them.</q>
            <bibl>JEREM. CHAP. 11. v. 10. 11.</bibl>
            <q> Thus ſaith the
Lord God of Iſrael, curſed be the man that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <bibl>JEREM. 34. 18. 19. 20.</bibl>
            <q> I wil give the men that
have tranſgreſſed my Covenant, and which have
not performed the words of the Covenant which
they made before me, into the hands of their enemies,
and into the hands of them that ſeek their life.</q>
            <bibl>EZEK. 16. 59.</bibl>
            <q> Thus ſaith the Lord God, I wil even
deal with thee, as thou haſt done, which hast deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Oath, in breaking the Covenant.</q>
            <bibl>EZEK. 17. 15. 16. 18. 19.</bibl>
            <q> Shal he proſper, ſhal he
eſcape that doth ſuch things? Or, ſhal he break the
Covenant and be delivered? As I live ſaith the
Lord God, ſurely, in the place where the King
dwelleth, that made him King, whoſe Oath he hath
deſpiſed, and whoſe Covenant he hath broken, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with him, in the midſt of Babylon he ſhal dye.
Seeing he deſpiſed the Oath by breaking the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
(where as, lo, he had given his hand) and
hath done all theſe things. Therefore, thus ſaith
the Lord God, as I live, ſurely, mine Oath which
he hath deſpiſed, and my Covenant that he hath
broken, even it wil I recompence upon his own head.</q>
            <bibl>HOSEA. 1. 9.</bibl>
            <q> They have ſpoken words, ſwearing
falſly, in making a Covenant; Thus judgment
ſpringeth up like hemlock, in the furrows of the
field.</q>
            <bibl>AMOS. 1. 9.</bibl>
            <q> Thus ſaith the Lord, for 3. tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Tyrus, and for 4, I wil not turn away the
puniſhment thereof, becauſe they delivered up the
whole Captivity to Edom, and remembred not the
brotherly Covenant.</q>
            <bibl>MALA. 2. 10.</bibl>
            <q> Have we not one Father? Hath not

            <p>1. Joſuah having made a <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> (notwithſtanding they had craftily circumvented and deceived <hi>Joſua</hi> therein) which remained inviolable among the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> till the dayes of King <hi>Saul</hi>
who, in his fooliſh Zeal, had (it ſeems) ſlain ſome of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and endeavoured to have deſtroyed them all from among the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> Hereupon the wrath of the Lord was greatly incenſed againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which brake not
out til King <hi>Davids</hi> dayes, who was ſorely vexed with a fearful famine over the whole Land, for at leaſt 3, years together inceſſantly: which ſo greatly grieved and troubled <hi>David,</hi> that he enquired of the Lord what might be
the cauſe thereof; And the Lord anſwered him, that it was for <hi>Sauls</hi> ſake, and for his <hi>bloudy-houſe,</hi> becauſe he had broken the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and ſlain the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and his wrath would not be appeazed, till holy <hi>David,</hi> in juſt
revenge of this breach of <hi>Covenant,</hi> had delivered up unto the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> (as they, by Gods wil, had demanded) 7 of <hi>Sauls</hi> Sons, or neareſt Kindred to be hanged by them, as they were, and then (and not till then) was God paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and the famine immediatly ceaſed. <hi>Joſua</hi> 9. &amp; 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.</p>

<hi>League</hi> and <hi>Truce,</hi> by interchangeable writings, ſealed and delivered each to other; not long after, <hi>Julian,</hi> a <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> having perſwaded him to renounce and violate this <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Peace;</hi> the King of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
ſecretly prepared mighty forces ſuddainly to invade and ſet upon the <hi>Turks</hi> Territories, and <hi>Amurath</hi> the great <hi>Turk,</hi> at laſt hearing of this unexpected invaſion by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus,</hi> made mighty preparation (preſently) to oppoſe
him; entred into a pitcht field againſt him, in brief, <hi>Amurath,</hi> obſerving a mighty ſlaughter of his men, and himſelf, and his whole Army in great danger to be utterly diſcomfitted, and beholding alſo in the <hi>Hungarian</hi>-diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-baners,
the picture of a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> he preſently pluckt forth the <hi>writing</hi> out of his boſom, wherein the late <hi>League</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> was compriſed, and holding it up in his hand, with his eyes caſt up to heaven, he ſaid theſe
words. <hi>Behold, thou crucified Chriſt, this is the League thy Chriſtians, in thy name, made with me, which they have without cauſe violated. Now, if thou be a God, as they ſay thou art, revenge the wrong now done unto thy
name, and unto me, and ſhew thy power upon thy pernicious people, who in their deeds deny thee their God;</hi> preſently after this, the fight was fiercely followed on both ſides, but it pleaſed the Lord, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> was put to
the worſt, and in the fight, ſlain by one of the <hi>Turks Janizaries,</hi> and his head  cut off, and preſented to <hi>Amurath,</hi> in the midſt of the battel, who commanded it to be ſet on the top of a lance, and carryed up and down in the field,
to the terror of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who preſently fled and left <hi>Amurath,</hi> total victor, with a moſt mighty and lamentable ſlaughter of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> From both which moſt pregnant and eminent examples, we may profitably
make this pertinent uſe and applycation. That if the Lord God hath ſo tender a reſpect to the exact performance of <hi>Leagues</hi> and <hi>Covenants,</hi> made not only 'twixt <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Man, Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but even between <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
and <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Infidels</hi> (ſuch as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> and this <hi>Amurath</hi> were) O how much more tenderly affected, and ſeverely exaſperated, wil he be for the breach of <hi>Covenants,</hi> made betwixt <hi>his own glorious Holyneſs,</hi>
(who is a <hi>Conſuming fire)</hi> and <hi>Wormling-Man</hi> (who is but as <hi>Combuſtible-Stubble</hi> in his preſence) O conſider this, and lay it timely and ſadly to heart, O all ye <hi>Malignants</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> who (now adayes) dare ſo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciouſly
and Maliciouſly ſcorn and contemn, and ſo Hypocritically, to violate and break <hi>This</hi> ſo <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Religious,</hi> ſo <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>honeſt,</hi> yea, I ſay, ſo <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> a <hi>Covenant,</hi> moſt duly and deliberately taken hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
by very many of you. O, <hi>whoever</hi> ye be, and <hi>whereſoever</hi> ye ſit and ſhroud your ſelves, tremble, yea tremble I ſay, and be aſtoniſht and confounded, at your ſo treacherous, and moſt audacious dealing with the <hi>moſt high
God</hi> and <hi>us:</hi> And for the ſame, expect (for certain, Gods Word is my warrant, you ſee, for what I ſay, and theſe 2, examples ratifie it) expect (I ſay) the <hi>curſe of God like a flying Roul,</hi> even ſome ſuddain and ſore <hi>plague</hi> or <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi>
inevitably to fall upon <hi>you or yours</hi> (if not upon <hi>you and yours)</hi> if ye timely and truly repent not; which the Lord give unto you (as ſpace, ſo) grace, to perform and do it. <hi>Amen.</hi>
