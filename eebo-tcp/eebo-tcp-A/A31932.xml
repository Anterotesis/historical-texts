            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce my last, which was by <hi>Talbot,</hi> the Scots Commissioners have sent to desire me to send a Commission to the generall Assembly in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which I am resolved not to do; but to the end of making some use of this occasion, by sending an honest man to <hi>London,</hi> and that I may have the more time for the making a handsome negative, I have demanded a passeport for <hi>Philip Warwick,</hi> by whom to return my answer.

            <p>Even now I am advertised from <hi>London,</hi> that there are three or four Lords, and eight Commons (besides four Scotch Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) appointed to treat, and they have named <hi>Uxbridge</hi> for the place, though not yet the particular persons. I am likewise newly advertised that General <hi>Goring</hi> prospers wel where he is, and since <hi>Munday</hi> last hath taken 80. of the Rebels Horse: and upon his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance they have quitted <hi>Peterfield</hi> and <hi>Coudry.</hi>

            <p> since my last (which was but 3. dayes a go) there are no alterations hapned of moment, preparations rather then actions being yet our chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est businesse, in which we hope that we proceed faster then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, whose levies both of men and money (for certain) goes on very slowly; and I beleeve, they are much weaker then is thought, even here at <hi>Oxford.</hi> For instance, A very honest servant of mine, and no fool, shewed me a proposition from one of the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <hi>London</hi> Rebels, who will not let his name be known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he have hope that his proposition will take effect; it is this, That fince the Treaty is so broken off, that neither the rebels nor I can resume it without at least a seeming totall yeelding to the other. The Treaty should be renewed upon thy motion, with a pre-assurance that the rebels will submit to reason. The answer that I permitted my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ervant to give, was, That thou art the much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> person to be the means of so happy &amp; glorious a work as is the peace of this Kingdom; <hi>but that upon no terms thy name was to be prophaned,</hi> therefore he was to be <hi>satisfied of the rebels willingnesse to yeeld to reason, before he would consent that any such intimation should be made to thee, and particularly concerning Religion and the Militia, that nothing must be insisted upon but according to my former offers.</hi> This I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve will come to nothing, yet I cannot but advertise thee of any thing that comes to my knowledge of this consequence.</p>

               <hi>I must again tell thee, That most assuredly France will bee the best way for transportation of the D. of Lorraines Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, there being divers fit and safe places of landing for them upon the Western coasts, besides the Ports under my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as Shelsey neer Chichester and others, of which I will advertise thee when the time comes.</hi>

            <p> I wrote to thee yesterday by <hi>Sakefield,</hi> the subject of it was onely kindnesse to thee; which, I assure thee shall ever be visible in all my actions: And now I come to <hi>Jermins</hi> account, given me by thy command, which is very cleare, hopefull in most particulars, and absolutely satisfactory as concerning thy care &amp; industry. As for the main impediment in the D. of <hi>Lorrains</hi> busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (which is his passage) why may thou not procure him pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through <hi>France?</hi> (if that of <hi>Holland</hi> be stuck at) it will much secure and facilitate the Sea transportation in respect of landing on the Western Coast, which I beleeve will be found the best, there being not so many places to chuse on, any where else. But this an opinion, not a direction.</p>
            <p>The generall face of my affairs me thinks begins to mend, the dissensions at <hi>London</hi> rather increasing then ceasing, <hi>Montrosse</hi> daily prospering, my Western businesse mending <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And so farewell dear heart.</p>

            <p>the expectation of an expresse from thee (as I find by thine of the 4. <hi>Febr.</hi>) is very good newes to me, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that thou art now well satisfied with my diligence in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. As for our treaty, there is every day lesse hopes then other, that it will produce a peace. But I will absolutely promise thee, that if we have one, it shall be such as shall invite thy return. For I avow, that without thy company I can neither have peace nor comfort within my self. The limited dayes for treating, are now almost expired without the least agreement upon any one Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Wherefore I have sent for enlargement of dayes, that the whole treaty may be laid open to the world. And I assure thee, that thou <hi>needst not doubt the issue of this treaty; for my Commissioners are so well chosen (though I say it) that they will neither be threatned nor</hi>

            <p>now is come to passe what I fore-saw, the fruitlesse end (as to a present peace) of this treaty; but I am still confident, that I shall find very good effects of it: for besides that my Commissioners have offered, to say no more, full measured reason, and the rebels have stucken rigidly to their demands, which I dare say had been too much, though they had taken me prisoner, so that assuredly the breach will light foully upon them. We have likewise at this time discovered, and shall make it evidently appeare to the world, that the <hi>English</hi> Rebels, (whether basely or ignorantly, will be no very great difference) have as much as in them lies, transmitted the command of <hi>Ireland</hi> from the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to the Scots, which (besides the reflection it will have upon these rebels) will clearly shew, that reformation of the Church is not the chief, much lesse the onely end of the Scotch Rebellion; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing presumption, &amp; no pietie: so to trust to a good cause, as not to use <hi>all lawfull means to maintain it, I have thought of one means more to furnish thee with for my assistance, then hitherto th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>WHat I told thee the last weeke concerning a good parting with our Lords and Commons here, was on Munday last handsomly performed, and now if I doe any thing unhandsome or disadvantagious to my selfe or friends, in order to a Treaty, it will be meerly my owne fault, for I confesse when I wrote last, I was in feare to have been pressed to make some meane overtures to renew the Treaty, (knowing that there were great labouring to that purpose:) But now I promise thee, <hi>If it be renewed, (which I believe will not, without some eminent good successe on my side) it shall be to</hi>

            <p>I have received thine of the third of <hi>March,</hi> by which thou puts me in hope of assistance of men and Money, and it is no little expression of thy love to me, that (because of my businesse) Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals are troublesome to thee, <hi>But I see that Assemblies in no Countries are very agreeable to thee,</hi> and it may be done a purpose to make thee weary of their companies, and excuse me to tell thee in earnest, that it is no wonder, that meere Statesmen should desire to be rid of thee, therefore I desire thee to thinke whether it would not advantage thee much to make a personall friendship with the Queen Regent, (without shewing any distrust of her Ministers, though not wholly trusting to them) &amp; to shew her, that when her Regency comes out (and possibly before) she may have need of her friends, so that she shall but serve her selfe by helping of thee; and to say no more, but certainly, if this Rebellion had not begun to oppresse me when it did, a late great Queene had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more glorious then she did. In the last place I desire thee, to give me a weekly account of thy health, for I feare least in that alone thou takest not care enough to expresse thy kindnesse to him who is eternally thine.</p>

            <p>SUnday last I received three Letters from thee; one a Duplicate of the 30. <hi>Decemb.</hi> another of the 6. <hi>Jan.</hi> &amp; the last of the 14. <hi>Jan.</hi> and even now one <hi>Petit</hi> is come with a Duplicate of the last; wherein, as I infinitely joy in the expressions of thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love of me, so I must extreamly wonder, that any who pretend to be a friend to our Cause, (for I believe thou wouldest not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any information from the other side) can invent such lies, that thou hast had ill offices done to me by any; or that they care for my assistance hath been the least suspected, it being so far from truth, that the just contrary is true. For I protest to God I never heard thee spoken of, but with the greatest expressions of estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for thy love to me, and particularly for thy diligent care for my assistance: But I am confident that it is a branch of that root of knavery which I am now digging at, and of this I have more then a bare suspition: And indeed, if I were to finde fault with thee, it should be for not taking so much care of thine own health as of my assistance, at least not giving me so often account of it as I desire; these three last, making no mention of thy selfe. Now as for the Treaty (which begins this day,) I desire thee to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that I shall never make a peace by abandoning my friends, nor such a one as will not stand with my honour and safety; of which I will say no more, because, knowing thy love, I am sure thou must believe me, and make others likewise confident of me.</p>
            <p>I send thee herewith my directions to my Commissioners, but how I came to make them my self without any others <hi>Digby</hi> will tell thee, with all the newes, as well concerning Military as Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listicall matters. At this time I will say no more, but that I shall in all things, (only not answering for words) truly shew my selfe to be eternally thine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugall</hi> Agent hath made me two propositions, first, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the release of his Masters Brother, for which I shall have 50000. <hi>l.</hi> if I can procure his liberty from the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> the other is for a marriage betwixt my Son <hi>Charles</hi> and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters eldest daughter: For the first I have freely undertaken to do what I can, and for the other, I will <hi>give such an Answer, as shall sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I desire thee not to give too much credit to <hi>Sabrans</hi> Relations,

nor much countenauce to the Irish Agents in <hi>Paris,</hi> the particular reasons thou shalt have by <hi>Pooly,</hi> (whom I intend for my next Messenger.)

            <p>upon the great rumours and expectations which are now of Peace, I think it necessary to tell you the true state of it, lest mistaken reports from hence might trouble my affaires there.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Rebels here have agreed to Treat; and most assuredly, one of the first and chiefe Articles they will insist on, will be, to continue the Irish Warre; <hi>which is a point not Popular for me to break on;</hi> of which you are to make a double use: First, to hasten (wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diligence) the Peace there; the timely conclusion of which will take off that inconvenience which otherwayes I may be subject to, by the refusall of that Article, upon any other reason. Secondly, by dextrous conveying to the Irish, the danger there may be of their totall and perpetuall exclusion from those favours I intend them, in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39552:13"/>
case the Rebels here clap up a peace with me, upon reasonable terms, and only exclude them; which possibly were not councelable for me to refuse, if the Irish peace should be the only difference betwixt us, before it were perfected there: These I hope are sufficient grounds for you to perswade the Irish diligently to dispatch a peace upon reasonable termes assuring them that you having once fully engaged to them my word (in the conclusion of a peace) all the earth shall not make me break it.</p>
               <p>But not doubting of a peace, I must again remember you to presse the Irish for their speedy assistance to me here, and their friends in <hi>Scotland:</hi> My intention being to draw from thence into <hi>Wales</hi> (the peace once concluded) as many as I can of my Armed Protestant subjects, and desire that the Irish would send as great a body as they can to land about <hi>Cumberland,</hi> which will put those Northern Counties in a brave condition; wherefore you must take speedy order to provide all the shipping you may, aswell Dunkeirk as Irish Bottomes; and remember that after March it will be most difficult to transport men from <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> the Rebels being masters of the Seas: So expecting a diligent and particular account in answer to this Letter, I rest</p>

            <p>As I confesse it a mis-fortune (but deny it a fault) thy not hearing oftner from me, so excuse me to deny that it can be of so ill consequence as thou mentions, if their affections were so reall, as they make shew of to thee; for the difficulty of sending is known to all, and the numbers of each Letter will shew my diligence, and certainly there goes no great wit to finde out wayes of sending, wherefore if any be neglected more, then our wits are faulty; but to imagine that it can enter into the thought of any flesh living, that any body here should hide from thee what is desired, that every one should know (excuse me to say it) is such a folly, that I shall not beleeve that any can think it though he say it: And for my affection to thee, it will not bee the miscarrying of a Letter or two that will call it in question; but take heed that these discourses be not rather the effect of their wearinesse of thy company, then the true image of their thoughts; and of this is not the proposall of thy journey

to <hi>Ireland,</hi> a pretty instance? For seriously of it selfe, I hold it one of the most extravagant propositions that I have heard, thy gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eare to it, being most assuredly only to expresse thy love to me, and not thy judgement in my affaires: As for the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it selfe, (I meane the peace of <hi>Ireland</hi>) to shew thee the care I have had of it, and the fruits I hope to receive from it: I have sent thee the last dispatches, I have sent concerning it, earnestly desiring thee to keep them to thy selfe, only thou maist in generall let the <hi>Q. Regent</hi> and Ministers there under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that I have offered my Irish Subjects so good satisfaction, that a peace will shortly ensue, which I really beleeve. But for Gods sake, let none know the particulars of my dispatches. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but tell thee, that I am much beholding to the Portugall Agent (and little to the French) it being by his meanes that I have sent thee all my Letters, (besides expresses) since I came hither, though I expected most from <hi>Sabran.</hi>

               <head>First concerning Religion.</head>
               <p>IN this the governement of the Church (as I suppose) will be the chiefe question wherein two things are to be considered, Conscience and Policy. For the first, I must declare unto you that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39552:17"/>
I cannot yeeld to the change of the government by Bishops; not only as I fully concurre with the most generall opinion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in all ages, as being the best, but likewise I hold my selfe particularly bound by the Oath I took at my Coronation, not to alter the government of this Church from what I found it. And as for the Churches patrimony, I cannot suffer any diminution or alienation of it, it being without peradventure sacriledge, and likewise contrary to my Coronation Oath but whatsoever shall be offered, for rectifying of abuses if any hath crept in, or yet for the ease of tender conscences (so that it endamage not the foundation) I am content to heare, and will be ready to give a gracious answer thereunto: For the second, as the Kings duty is to protect the Church, so it is the Churches to assist the King, in the maintenance of his just authority; wherefore my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors have been alwayes carefull (and especially since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) to keep the dependency of the Clergy intirely upon the Crowne; without which it will scarcely sit fast upon the Kings head; therefore you must doe nothing to change or lessen this necessary dependency.</p>

               </head>
               <p>After conscience, this is certainly the fittest subject for a Kings Quarrell; for without it the Kingly power is but a shaddow; and therefore upon no meanes to be quitted, but to be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to the ancient knowne lawes of the Land: (yet because to attaine to this so much wished peace by all good men) it is in a manner necessary that sufficient and reall security be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the performance of what shall be agreed upon. I permit you either by leaving strong Townes or other <hi>Military</hi> force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Rebels possession (untill Articles be performed) to give such assurance for performance of conditions as you shall judge necessary for to conclude a peace: provided alwayes that ye take (at least) as great care by sufficient security, that conditions be performed to me: <hi>And to make sure that the peace once setled, all things shall returne into their ancient Channels.</hi>

He pretends sometimes to have the hearts of the major and better part of his Protestant subjects firme to him in this cause, yet trust none but Papists, and therefore is advised by the Queene, <hi>pap.</hi> 31. by no meanes to disband for this reason, because all the Militia is generally in the Parliaments hands. We see what opinion the King hath of <hi>Wilmot, Percy, Sussex.</hi> We see what opinion he hath of the Lords and Commons at <hi>Oxford</hi> who have discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their trust here, out of confidence in him: the 13. <hi>paper</hi> here tells us plainely what use the King makes of them.</p>
            <p>The King will declare nothing in favour of his Parliament, so long as he can finde a partty to maitaine him in this opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:39552:27"/>
nor performe any thing which he hath declared, so long as he can finde a sufficient party to excuse him from it.</p>
            <p>And indeede it is a sad consideration to thinke what unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py use the King hath ever made of the obedience, and patient loyalty of this Nation; finding alwaies that he might without any opposition or danger at least deny their just liberties, laws, and the very use of Parliaments; or if some urgency, or his own necessities, or advantages had caused him to call a Parliament he might afterwards with as little opposition, deny whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he granted under his owne hand; as the Petition of Right obtained with some difficulty, and broken immediately after without any scruple may sufficiently testifie. The Pacification with <hi>Scotland</hi> was not assented to, until the <hi>English</hi> people shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some aversenesse to that wicked warre; and were loath any longer to fight for their owne slavery, nor was that Pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any longer kept; then till a Party strong enough was found to maintaine the breach of it. But without other instances, this Parliament had beene happie, the King glorious, and his people flourishing, if the King had found none to side with him against all these; and it is strange that so long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had not taught them more wifedome.

and State could wish to see done, you are no fit Instruments for that cause, which you have unhappily chosen, unlesse you returne to the right way, you must goe as farre in the wrong one, as that will leade you. The <hi>Chronicles</hi> tell us that <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was deare to <hi>Richard</hi> the third, whiles he had so much wickednesse as to further the deposing or disinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting of his two Nephewes: but when he was not bad enough to consent to the murder of those Princes, he was rejected by that King, and afterwards beheaded, if you cannot learne how to goe through with wickednesse: learne a better lesson to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to goodnesse; or else perhaps the wrong which you have done your Country in betraying her trust, and by consequence shedding so much innocent bloud, may be at last revenged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, by them, for whom you did it. The King, who despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth you by the name of Mungrells, as not altogether firme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to his owne designe, in another late letter to the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> gives thankes to <hi>Muskeny, Plunket,</hi> and <hi>Browne,</hi> the cheife Actors in that horrid Massacre of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which may teach the world what kind of men he confides truly in, and who they are that must reape the benefit of his Conquest, if God (for the sinnes of our <hi>English</hi> Protestants) should permit it: if <hi>Muskeny</hi> had beene at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the King had had one man more of his owne opinion, in not acknowledging the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> for want of such, he is forced to complaine. And you may plainely see what a dishonourable use is made of your persons there, as men meerely <hi>operis secundi,</hi> a number onely that serve to give countenance and credit to the designe of a dearer Partie, and to perswade your Countrey, not for your owne behoofes, what is said to you, may be said to all, that are leade by you, to all those thousands which have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the King as your Traine; for the same opinions which render you now contemptible to the King: render you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the major part of Protestants, which fides with you, and did at first make the Kings Power so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as it is, if there be any thing of Protestants, of <hi>English</hi> men, of men remayning in you, resume that, whatsoever it be, either acknowledge your selves such, as the King calls you

If we be Rebels at <hi>London,</hi> because we are not so servile as you are, and you are mutineers at <hi>Oxford,</hi> because you are not so servile as the King would have you. Let us know by what definition either you or we are measured, and how we are distinguisht, and let us see that other third remaining party which the King ownes as his loyall faithfull party indeed. It concerns you to look both forward and backward, and having now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the dimention of the Kings minde by his secret Letters, turne about awhile and looke upon the same in his publike Declarations.

The King (according to <hi>Digbies</hi> superstitious observation) in his Letter of Jan. 14. last, takes it as evident, that <hi>Straffords</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood has brought the judgement of this civill war equally upon both sides, both being equally guilty thereof. The Kings meaning is, That he and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ide was as guilty in permitting as the Parliament was in prosecuting. But now for <hi>Canterburies</hi> blood, that being totally put upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments score, he doubts not but the hand of Justice will from henceforth totally lay the weight of this guilt upon the Parliaments side. The truth is, <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> were the chiefe firebrands of this war, the two ill Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors that chiefly incensed the King against the Scots, and endeavoured to subject all these three Kingdoms to a new arbitrary Government, and were justly executed for attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that subvertion of Law which the King has perfected since.

               <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Canterburies</hi> all the rest of the Conspirators, and so the people will make good their ancient freedom still. Hereupon discontents break out, the King withdrawes into Scotland, during his abode there the Rebellion in Ireland, some attempts against Marquesse <hi>Hamilton</hi> and others in Scotland, and some other dangerous machinations in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land put us into strange terrors and apprehensions. The King at his returne, Decemb. 2. 1641. complains of these Jealousies, Frights, and Alarms, with this profession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>I am so farre from repenting of any Act done this Session for the good of my people, that if it were to doe againe I would doe it, and will yet grant what else can be justly desired.</hi> He concludes with a recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the businesse of Ireland, and finding the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the same slow, againe on the 14. of Decemb. he is patheticall in quickning them thereunto. All this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Parliament findes the old faction at Court to grow strong, and daily to attaine to more prevalence with the King, which besides other causes of jealousie makes them lay open the indisposition of the whole State in a plain and sharp Remonstrance, Decemb. 15. with the Remedies thereof proposed. The King as to the businesse of Religion answers, <hi>For preserving of the peace and safety of the Kingdome from the designes of a Popish Party, we have and will concur with all just desires of our people in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary way. For</hi> Ireland <hi>wee thanke you for your care and cheerfull ingagement for the speedy suppression of that Rebellion, the glory of God in the Protestant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, the safety of the Brittish there, our Honour, and this Nations so much depending thereupon, &amp;c. Your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to apply your selves to such courses as may support our Royall estate with honour and plenty at home, and with power and reputation abroad, is that which we have ever promised our selfe, both from your loyalties and affections.</hi> Here are words that sound nothing but grace, and here is a cleare testimony from the Kings owne mouth, concerning the merit of this Nation to this day; But notwithstanding these promises and testimonies, the King discovers daily more and more regret for <hi>Straffords</hi> execution, sticks clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser

to the counsels of the same faction, and instead of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to his Parliament, he commands a charge of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be framed against six Members, the most eminent and active in both Houses. Also upon the fourth of <hi>Jan.</hi> the King comes in person with a great Traine armed into the House, and missing the five Members there, tels the rest that he must have them wheresoever he found them. Here was the fatall commencement of the war, for the next day the House declares, that they cannot sit in safety any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and therefore they adjourne for some daies, and retire into the City. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 31. they petition for a Guard out of the City, under command of the Kings Lord Chamberlaine the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> which is denyed, yet with these expressions: <hi>We are ignorant of the grounds of your apprehensions, but protest before Almighty God, had we any knowledge, or beliefe of the least designe in any of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, either formerly, or at this time against you, we would pursue them to condigne punishment, with the same severity and detestation as we would the greatest attempt upon our Crowne; and we do ingage solemnly the word of a King, that the security of every one of you from violence, is, and shall be ever as much our care, as the preservation of us and our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> These words were sweetly tempered, but wonne no beliefe, nor could over-power contrary actions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Major, Aldermen, and Common-Councell of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> seeing nothing but symptomes of war in the Court, frame a Petition, praying the King that the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> may be put into the hands of persons of trust, that by removall of doubtfull and unknowne persons from about <hi>Whitehall</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> a knowne and approved guard may be appointed for the safety of the Parliament, and that the accused Members may not be restrayned or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded against, otherwise then according to the Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Parliament. The King grants nothing, but answers, <hi>That his reception of such an unusuall request, is a sufficient</hi>

               <hi>instance of the singular estimation he hath of the good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the City, which he believes in gratitude will never be wanting to his just commands and service.</hi> Hitherto the King speaks nothing, but in justification both of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Parliaments, and Peoples loyalty. The tumults about <hi>Whitehall, &amp;c.</hi> amounted to no war, are imputed by the King to the Rabble, and by us to the Kings Party; the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is acquitted except the sixe Members, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of them also is after declined by the King, yet the King departs from the City, as unsafe, seeing plainly it could not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Upon the 20. of <hi>Jan.</hi> the King sends a Message to the Parliament, to state the differences on both sides, promising that when they are digested into a body, fit to be judged of, it shall appeare what he will do. In answer hereunto, the Commons House (the Lords refusing to joine) onely petition for the raising up unto them and the State a sure ground of safety and confidence, that the Tower of <hi>London</hi> and the Militia of the Kingdome may be put into such persons hands as they should recommend. The King replies; <hi>That the Militia by Law is subject to no command but his owne, which he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to himselfe, as a principall and inseparable flower of his Crowne, professes to take care of Peace, and the rights of the Subject, equally with his life, or the lives of his dearest Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: He further also conjures them by all acts of duty and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour received, by hopes of future mutuall happinesse, by their love of Religion, the Peace both of this Kingdome, and</hi> Ireland <hi>not to be transported with feares and jealousies.</hi> The Parliament could not believe themselves secured by these professions or asseverations, &amp; the King would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that the setling the Militia at this time in confiding hands, to prevent civill war, was any other, then the taking the Crowne from his head. <hi>Hin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Propositions, are dispatched to the King; the maine things desired were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in Church Government, that power military and civill might be put into confiding hands; That justice of Parliament might passe upon Delinquents, but the Answer returned is, <hi>That if these things were granted, the King should remaine but the out side, but the picture, but the signe of a King.</hi> This, though it was the Trumpet of war and the sound of defiance in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet was not so owned, for still the King saies, <hi>He intends not to fixe any disloyall designe upon both or either House of Parliament, he is rather most confident of the loyalty, good affections, and integrity of that great bodies good intentions: but the malignity of the des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>une,</hi> 1642. this inference may be truly made, that the King hath no cause to looke upon us now, otherwise then as he did then; and if he have varied since from those Vows and Asseverations which he made then, the blame will

not remaine on this side, but on his; so that the very calling to minde what hath been said by the King, will be now suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for our purpose.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wherefore, as to the taking up of Armes at all against the Parliament, <hi>June</hi> 3. 1642, the King in his Declaration to the Freeholders of <hi>Yorkeshire,</hi> renounces any intention of war, his words are, <hi>To the end this present posture, wherein we meet, should not affright you with the distempers of the times, we wish you to looke into the composition and constitution of our Guard, and you will finde it so far from the face or fear of war, that it serves to secure you as well as us from it, &amp;c.</hi> Also <hi>June</hi> 16. in his Delaration at <hi>Yorke,</hi> he useth these words; <hi>Wee againe, in the presence of Alusighty God our Maker and Redeemer, assure the world, we have no more thought of making war against our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, then against our owne Children.</hi> To the fame purpose he made all his Lords signe a testimoniall with their own hands, in affirmance of his profession. Tis true, afterwards when he tooke the field with his increased Guard, and became the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saylant at <hi>Hull,</hi> (having also possest himselfe of <hi>Newcastle</hi>) he was driven to save himself by distinctions, for he had not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed all war in generall, but all invasive war, and if the siege of <hi>Hull</hi> had some shew of invasion, yet indeed it was but in order to his defence, and this was a subtilty that all the sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>igning Lords and others, it is thought, had not foreseene till now.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the waging war against the Parliament, <hi>June</hi> 16. The King disclaimes all thoughts of war against his Parliament, and in <hi>July,</hi> after the date of the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he abhors the like, <hi>Desiring no longer the protection and blessing of Almighty God upon himselfe and his posterity, then he and they shall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly observe the Lawes in defence of Parliaments.</hi> Also on <hi>Aug.</hi> 12. after <hi>He acknowledges that the King and Parliament are like the twins of</hi> Hyppocrates, <hi>which must laugh and cry, live and dye together.</hi> So this guides us to more distinctions, that the King may defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against a Parliament, yet not fight against it, or he may assaile a Malignant party in Parliament, yet not touch the Parliament it selfe: These distinctions hold good on this side, not on that: but by what distinction will the King put a short period to this perpetuall Parliament without violence? or how can he deny it the name of a Parliament without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillity? Examine the Letters further about this.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:39552:31"/>
            <p n="3">3 As to the waging of War by Papists. The King August 4. when the Earle of Essex his Army was in forming, in his Speech to the Gentry of Yorkshire avers, <hi>That he had taken order that the power of the Sword should not come into the hands of Papists.</hi> And <hi>Aug.</hi> 10. He makes strict Proclamation, <hi>That all Papists presuming to list themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bim as Officers or Souldiers, should be punished, and a way by Oath was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed for discrimination of them.</hi> Also Aug. 29. <hi>The King gives Instructions to his Commissioners for Arrays to disarm all Papists.</hi> So Octob. 27. after the battell at Edge-hill the King thinks it worth his excuse, That he had some few Popish Commanders in his Army, taken in of great necessity, he concludes thus; <hi>We shall never forget our severall Oathes in our severall Declarations, we are too much a Christian to beleeve that we can breake those Promises and avoid the justice of Heaven.</hi> Tis true, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a new distinction came to light, for upon a Petition from the Lancashire Papists, the King did avow, <hi>That Papists were by Law prohibited Armes in time of Peace, not in time of Warre; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did not onely authorize but require them to arme themselves, servants, tenants, and use the same Armes, &amp;c.</hi> This distinction bore date long after the war begun, but that was want of invention only.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to managing the Warre by Irish Papists, <hi>he had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named them</hi> but with a bleeding <hi>heart:</hi> His words once were, <hi>We hope the lamentable condition of Ireland will invite us to a faire intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and unity, that we may with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In December the King answers some Irish Protestants thus: <hi>Since the beginning of that monstrous Rebellion I have had no greater sorrow then for the bleeding condition of that Kingdome.</hi> Nay, since the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at Uxbridge, the King in publike washes his hands of all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance given to the Rebels, and turnes the blame upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, though in private he had beene (as it were) a suiter to them for Peace, and some assistance from them by private

Letters to <hi>Ormond. Quere</hi> how this may be reconcileable, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5 As to the granting of a toleration. The King March 9. 1641, in answer to the Parliaments Declaration, uses these words, <hi>Our faithfull and zealous affection to the true Protestant Profession, and our reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is to concurre with our Parliament in any possible course for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of it and suppression of Popery.</hi> In April 1642. he calls God to witnesse, with this assurance, <hi>That he will never consent (upon whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pretence) to a toleration of the Popish Profession, or abolition of Laws now in force against Recusants.</hi> Also April 25. <hi>He has no other end but to defend the true Protestant Profession, &amp;c. God so deale with us, as we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in these Professions.</hi> So in his Speech in the head of his Army, Sept. 19. So in his Proclamation of pardon to London, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 29. <hi>All the professions we have made in our severall Declarations for suppression of Popery and maintenance of Religion, the Laws, &amp;c. shall be as inviolably observed by Us, as we expect a blessing from Almighty God, and obedience from our Subjects. Quaere</hi> then how this may be confistent with taking away Statutes in England and Ireland made for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Popery, and that by the Armes of Papists.</p>
            <p n="6">6 As to the bringing in of forraign Force, The King March 9. 1641. in his Declaration from Newmarket, saith, <hi>Whatsoever you are advertised from Rome, Venice, Paris, of the Popes Nuncio's soliciting, Spain, France, &amp;c. for forraign Aids, We are confident no sober honest man can beleeve Us so desperate or sencelesse to entertaine such designes as would not onely bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>y this our Kingdome in sudden destruction and ruine, but our Name and Posterity in perpetuall scorne and infamy.</hi> Also March 26. 1642. about solicitation suspected of the King of Denmarke, his words are, <hi>We have neither so ill an opinion of our owne merits, or the affections of our Subjects, as to thinke our selfe in need of forraigne Force.</hi> Also August. 4. the King in his Speech to the Gentry of Yorkshire acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>He is wholly cast upon the affections of his people, having no hope but in God, his just cause, and the love of his Subjects.</hi> What distinction can now satisfie us, that neither Irish, French, Lorrainers, Dutch, Danes, are forreiners? The concealing of this by sealing up the lips of the Queene and <hi>Ormond,</hi> and <hi>Cockram</hi> must supply all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions.</p>
