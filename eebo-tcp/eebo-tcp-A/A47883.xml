            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is it possible for <hi>Mee</hi> to Think of my <hi>Debts</hi> and
not of your <hi>Lordships Bounties,</hi> at the same
time: Under whose Roofe I have <hi>formerly</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48779:3"/>
receiv'd so <hi>many, many Benefits.</hi> In the <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment</hi>
of That Felicity, I reckon'd my self
as <hi>sure,</hi> as in the <hi>Possession</hi> of it: I <hi>did,</hi> (my
Lord) and I must do so <hi>still,</hi> or do a <hi>harder,</hi> and
a <hi>worse</hi> Thing, in Thinking Otherwise. For <hi>I</hi>
am the <hi>same</hi> I <hi>was,</hi> and to suppose your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
good opinion,</hi> either <hi>Begun,</hi> or <hi>Ended</hi>
without <hi>Reason,</hi> were to subject your <hi>Wisdome,</hi>
or <hi>Stability</hi> to a <hi>Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since so it is, (My Lord) that I cannot suspect
your <hi>Kindnesse,</hi> without an injury to your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
nor let your <hi>Obligations</hi> sleep without
some <hi>Testimony</hi> of my <hi>Thankfulnesse:</hi> Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to know, (my Lord) that after more then
<hi>Twenty Years</hi> spent in serving the <hi>Royall
Interest:</hi>
Near <hi>Six</hi> of them, in <hi>Gaoles;</hi> and
almost <hi>Four,</hi> under a <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> in
<hi>Newgate; Fortune</hi> has been so kind, as to
leave me <hi>yet</hi> a <hi>Bottle of Inke,</hi> and a <hi>Heap of
Paper;</hi> out of which <hi>pittiful Remain,</hi> I make
your Lordship a <hi>Present</hi> of a <hi>Book.</hi> This Book
I humbly offer, (not to your <hi>Reading,</hi> or
<hi>Thought,</hi> but) barely to your <hi>Countenance:</hi>
Let it (my Lord) but wear the <hi>Credit</hi> of
<hi>Your Patronage.</hi> Which I the rather wish,
<pb facs="tcp:48779:3"/>
because of a Late <hi>Pamphlet</hi> that I find De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to your Lordship, by a <hi>Mournevall</hi>
of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> wherein my <hi>Name</hi> is not
well us'd: and truly (if I am not Mistaken)
his Majesties <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> much
<hi>worse;</hi> about the <hi>Imprisonment</hi> of Mr. <hi>Crof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must Proceed now to acquaint your Lordship,
that beside the <hi>Honour</hi> of your <hi>Protection,</hi>
I have great need of your <hi>Interest,</hi> and <hi>Favour:</hi>
which yet <hi>I dare not Beg, for fear of Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
your Readinesse to do me all reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Justice without it.</hi> In Truth; it is not
for a man either of my <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Condition,</hi>
to <hi>Thrive</hi> by <hi>Begging;</hi> for he that is both
<hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Honest,</hi> carries a <hi>Double Clogg:</hi>
Especially in <hi>This Age,</hi> (my Lord) when
<hi>(Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> apart) 'tis a greater
<hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Misfortune</hi> to be <hi>Indigent,</hi> then
<hi>Treacherous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are (my Lord) that do not stick to
say, <hi>I'm Both:</hi> and I forgive with all my Soul,
the <hi>Worst</hi> that ever was said of <hi>Mee,</hi> with
<hi>good Intention</hi> to the <hi>King.</hi> It is not long
since I troubled your Lordship with a Paper
<pb facs="tcp:48779:4"/>
upon This Subject; to which (with Leave) I
shall add a word or two.</p>
            <p>Some will needs have it, that I do not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<hi>Deny</hi> the <hi>Six hundred Pound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord; <hi>I do so far</hi> deny <hi>it, that</hi> I wish
That Peny, or Penyes-worth, which (to the
best of my Knowledge) I ever receiv'd from
any Creature of the Rebels Party, or by
any Order from Them, or any of Them,
may rise against Me at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>There is a further Rumour, as if Captain
<hi>Whitlock</hi> should have sent me word that he
would <hi>justifie</hi> it: whereas I never heard a
Syllable from him to That Purpose; nor can
the World shew the least Colour for the Truth
of That Report.</p>
            <p>Let me be Pardon'd (my Lord) if I conoeive
<hi>This Addresse</hi> not altogether <hi>Impertinent;</hi>
for if it did belong to you to <hi>Condemne</hi> me,
while you but <hi>Thought</hi> me <hi>Guilty;</hi> your
Lordship is certainly Oblig'd in <hi>Honour,</hi> to
<hi>Acquit</hi> me when you <hi>Know</hi> me <hi>Innocent.</hi> In
<hi>This Particular,</hi> (my Lord) I think you are
<hi>Bound</hi> to do me <hi>Right;</hi> but in what <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Subject</hi> I have here undertaken leads mee
into several unlucky <hi>Characters,</hi> which if they

as holding no <hi>Proportion</hi> with <hi>Nature,</hi> and

let him keep his own Counsel, and Consider, that a <hi>Coat</hi>
may be <hi>fit</hi> for him that was never <hi>made</hi> for him. <hi>His</hi>
Answer was not amisse, that being Compleyn'd of to the
Late Eminent Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> for having written
a <hi>Libel:</hi> My <hi>Lord</hi> (sayes he): The Case is but This<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Let not an <hi>Ill man</hi> find fault with a <hi>Vitious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;</hi>
For 'tis much worse to <hi>Practice Wickednesse</hi>

            <p>The scope of This First Part which I here expose,
is by Laying open the <hi>Workings</hi> and <hi>Series</hi> of
the <hi>Last Rebellion,</hi> to <hi>disappoint</hi> the <hi>Purposes</hi> of
another. The <hi>Second Part</hi> I reserve for more <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

<hi>Methode,</hi> the <hi>Design,</hi> and the <hi>Effects</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>It is with <hi>Church-men</hi> as with <hi>other Mortals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Losse of <hi>Life</hi> it self, could ever move from the

so that upon the whole, 'tis evident; <hi>some</hi>
Clergy-men are <hi>Quiet,</hi> because they <hi>have</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,

                  <p>The Principal <hi>Ingredients</hi> into <hi>Schisme</hi> are These;
<hi>Ambition, Avarice, Popularity,</hi> and <hi>Envy;</hi> The <hi>Scope</hi>
of it is to destroy <hi>Authority,</hi> and advance a <hi>Faction.</hi>
Now how to accomplish This, is the great work;
for a <hi>Rent</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> signifies nothing without a

Upon the whole, it seems that an Army,
within it <hi>self,</hi> and without any <hi>Separate Interest,</hi>
may be troublesome upon These <hi>Three Accompts:</hi>
Either <hi>Want of Pay;</hi> which causes a <hi>General Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny:</hi>

provokes <hi>Animosities, Factions,</hi> and <hi>Revolts:</hi>
or <hi>Ambition;</hi> which more directly attempts upon
the <hi>Sovereignty.</hi> It may be also <hi>Hazzardous,</hi> by
reason of some <hi>Errour</hi> in the <hi>Constitution</hi> of it.
That is; if it be composed of Persons <hi>Ill-affected</hi> to
the Government,<note place="margin">☜</note> it cannot rationally be expected,
that it should labour to <hi>Preserve,</hi> what it wishes to
<hi>Destroy.</hi>

                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:48779:63"/>
But we are treating of Distempers <hi>acquir'd;</hi>
and rather proceeding from the <hi>ill menage</hi> of an
Army, then from the first <hi>Mis-choyce,</hi> or founded
in the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of it. Concerning a <hi>Standing-Army,</hi>
enough is said in the foregoing Chapter:
a word wee'll add; It is in This Regard, an Affair
of a Peevish Quality; that <hi>either a General has too</hi>
little <hi>Power to do his</hi> Master's <hi>businesse, or</hi> enough <hi>to
do his</hi> own.</p>
                  <p>As it is not safe for a Monarch,<note place="margin">Hazzard not a Rebellion in one Place, for fear of a Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> at any time, to
entrust the Chief Officer of an Army, with so
much Power, for fear of a <hi>Sedition,</hi> as may ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him to move a <hi>Rebellion:</hi> so is it a work of great
<hi>Skill,</hi> and <hi>Difficulty,</hi> so dexterously to <hi>Resume,</hi> or
<hi>Ballance</hi> that <hi>over-grown Power,</hi> as to bring in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Command,</hi> without discovering such a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
as may Provoke him to <hi>abuse</hi> it. Let This
suffice, as to the Disorders of an Army <hi>within it
self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Hazzard is, lest it be <hi>Corrupted</hi> into a
Dependence, upon some other Interest, into which
Defection, it may be partly Driven by the <hi>Neglect,</hi>
or <hi>Unkindnesse</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and partly Drawn by
the <hi>Allurements</hi> of <hi>Profit,</hi> and <hi>Reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having spoken of the Mischief a <hi>Seditious
Army</hi> may <hi>Doe;</hi> very Briefly let us behold what
mischiefes a <hi>Vitious,</hi> and <hi>undisciplin'd</hi> Army may
<hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There never fails to be an Opposition betwixt the
<hi>Civill,</hi> and the <hi>Military</hi> Power; and in like maner
betwixt the <hi>People,</hi> and the <hi>Souldiery.</hi> Whom nothing

by an Army of their own Countrymen,
is an <hi>extorted Patience,</hi> accompany'd with a Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to embrace any opportunity of working their

                  <p>If at the best, the bare <hi>appearance</hi> of a Force be
