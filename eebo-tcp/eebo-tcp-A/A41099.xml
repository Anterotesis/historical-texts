            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Always was of Opinion, Men ought both to Speak and Write concerning the internal Life, with all the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration imaginable, and though the ſame includes nothing but what is clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the immutable rule of Faith and Evangelick Obedience; yet to me it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very manifeſt, that this matter requires a kind of ſecret and wary management: the generality of Readers are not at all prepared for ſuch ſtrong ſort of Readings: Its the way to expoſe the moſt pure and Sublime part of Religion to the deriſion of of prophane Spirits, in whoſe ſight the myſtery of Chriſt Crucified, is no other than a Stumbling-block of Offence, and meer folly: This is to commit the inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable ſecrets of God in the heart, to the hands of the moſt unthankful and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced
<pb facs="tcp:49309:3"/>
Men, who are not capable of any benefit or edification thereby: On the other hand, 'tis to lay ſnares for all thoſe that are uncredulous and diſcretionleſs, in order to fall to illuſion; for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently imagine themſelves to be in all thoſe ſtates that Books repreſent unto them, and from thence become viſionaries and unteachable; whereas, if they ſhould be kept in ignorance of all thoſe ſtates which are above theirs, they could not fall upon thoſe ways of diſintereſted Love and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, but by the ſole attraction of Grace, without their imaginations, heated with reading, having any ſhare therein. Hence it is, that I am perſwaded Men ſhould be as ſilent as poſſible in this matter, for fear of overexciting the Curioſity of the generality of Mankind, who have neither experience nor a ſufficient light of Grace to examine the works of the Saints; for the Carnal Man can neither diſcern nor taſte of the things of God, ſuch as are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ways ſpoken of. But ſeeing this part of Curioſity for ſome time paſt is become in a manner univerſal; I think it will be as neceſſary to ſpeak, as it might have
<pb facs="tcp:49309:3"/>
been wiſhed Men would have held their Tongues.</p>
            <p>My Deſign in this Treatiſe, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the experiences and expreſſions of the Saints, in order to prevent their being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſcorn and deriſion of wicked Men; but at the ſame time I would lay open to myſtical Men, the real meaning of theſe holy Authors, to the end, the true value of their expreſſions may be made known unto them. When I ſpeak of holy Authors, my meaning is, to confine my ſelf to thoſe that are Canonized, or whoſe memories have a ſweet ſmelling ſavour in all the Church, and whoſe Writings have been ſo ſolemnly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of without any Contradiction: I ſpeak of no other than thoſe Saints who have been Canonized or admired by the whole Church, for having themſelves pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, and cauſed their Neighbour to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe a kind of ſpirituality, that is ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down through the body of their Writings. Its undoubtedly unlawful for us to reject ſuch Authors, or to accuſe them of innovating any thing againſt the courſe of Tradition.</p>
            <p>I am about to ſhew how far theſe holy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb facs="tcp:49309:4"/>
have been from injuring the rule of Faith, and favouring illuſion; I ſhall make appear to our myſtical Men that I ſhall detract in nothing from all that which is Authorized by the Maxims and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of thoſe Authors who are our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern: I ſhall engage them into a belief of what I ſay, when I ſhew unto them the exact bounds theſe ſame Saints have ſet us, and beyond which it is not allowable for us to go. The myſtical Men of whom I am ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, are neither thoſe Fanaticks nor Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, who conceal the myſtery of iniquity under the notion of perfection: God forbid, that I ſhould direct the word of truth to thoſe Men who do not carry the myſtery of Faith in a pure Conſcience, they deſerve no other then Indignation and horror: I ſpeak to the plain, open-hearted, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able myſticks; they ought to know that illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on continually follows the moſt perfect ways. Thoſe execrable Men the falſe <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> from the very beginning of Chriſtianity, had a mind to mix themſelves with the true <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who were Contemplative Men, and the moſt perfect among the Chriſtians: the <hi>Begardians,</hi> have in a falſe diſguiſe
<pb facs="tcp:49309:4"/>
imitated the Contemplative of theſe laſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſuch as St. <hi>Bernard, Richard</hi> and <hi>Hugh de</hi> St. <hi>Victor.</hi> Its an Obſervation of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that the expreſſions of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Authors have been often critiſiced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after an equivocal manner. It fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens, <hi>(ſays he,)</hi> in his Book, <hi>de Script. Eccleſ.</hi> that the expreſſions of thoſe who have written of myſtick Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, have been condemned by ſome, and practiſed by others; becauſe they are not taken by every body in the ſame ſence. Cardinal <hi>Bona,</hi> in his <hi>Compendium,</hi> ſays alſo, that thoſe who are taken up with paſ ſive Contemplation are leſs able to expreſ themſelves, but more excellent in matters of practice and experience: In ſhort, there is nothing ſo hard as to give a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of thoſe ſtates which conſiſt in ſuch ſimple and nice Operations, that are ſo far abſtracted from ſence, and to ſet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the right place all the correctives that are neceſſary to prevent illuſion and to explain ſtrictly the true Syſtem of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. This is that which has given Offence to ſome Readers of myſtical Men's Books, and hath drawn divers others of thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb facs="tcp:49309:5"/>
into Illuſion; while <hi>Spain</hi> in the laſt Age was full of ſo many Saints endued with wonderful Grace; the <hi>Illuminates</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in <hi>Andalouzia,</hi> who brought the greateſt Saints to be ſuſpected of unſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Then it was, St. <hi>Thereſa, Balthazar Alvarez,</hi> and the Bleſſed <hi>John de la Croix,</hi> took upon them to juſtifie their Conduct and Innocency. <hi>Rusbrok</hi> whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calls a great Contemplative and <hi>Taulere</hi> that Apoſtolick Man ſo famous throughout <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> have been Vindicated, the one by St. <hi>Dennis le Chartreaux,</hi> and the other by <hi>Bloſius.</hi> Neither has St <hi>Francis de Sales,</hi> been free from being contradicted, the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks having been unable to diſcern how to joyn exact and ſtrict Theology with that light of Grace that is moſt eminent: So it is, that the Chaff oftentimes hides the good Corn, and the pureſt Authors concerning the Internal Life, ſtand in need of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſt ſome expreſſions taken in a wrong ſence ſhould alter the purity of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Theſe Examples ſhould make myſtical Men ſober and wary, if they are humble and teachable, they ſhould leave not only
<pb facs="tcp:49309:5"/>
Doctrinals to the entire deciſion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church, but alſo the choiſe of all thoſe terms that are proper to expreſs them by: St. <hi>Paul</hi> would rather never eat meat than Offend the leaſt of his Brethren, for whom Chriſt died. How can we then be tied to any expreſſion that gives Offence to a weak Soul? Myſtical Men therefore ſhould take away all equivocal terms, when they know the ſame are abuſed, in order to corrupt the ſoundeſt Doctrine. Let thoſe who have ſpoken after an improper and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated manner, and without precaution, explain their meaning, and ſuffer nothing to be wanting for the edification of the Church; let thoſe who have been erroneous as to main Doctrinals not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with condemning the Errors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but let them confeſs they have believed them, and give the Glory to God; let them not be aſhamed that they have erred, as being what is natural to the race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but let them humbly confeſs their Errors, ſince they remain to be no longer theirs, after they have made an humble Confeſſion of them. Its in order to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Truth from Falſhood in ſo nice and
<pb facs="tcp:49309:6"/>
important a matter, that two great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates have Publiſhed Thirty-Four Articles, that in ſubſtance contain all the Doctrine of the internal life; and I have no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in this undertaking, than to give a larger Explanation of the ſame.</p>
            <p>All theſe Internal ways have a tendency to pure or diſintereſted Love. This pure Love is the higheſt degree of Chriſtian perfection: It is the end or boundary of all the ways known unto the Saints. Whoever allows of nothing beyond that, contains himſelf within the bounds of Tradition. Whoever exceeds this bound is already out of the way. If any one ſhould doubt of the Truth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this Love, I make an offer of ſhewing an univerſal and clear Tradition for it, from the times of the Apoſtles to that of St. <hi>Francis de Sales</hi> without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and I will thereupon publiſh, when I am deſired to do it, a Collection of all paſſages out of the Fathers, School-Men, and holy myſticks, who unanimouſly ſpeak of it. It will appear from this Collection, that the Ancient Fathers ſpoke as vigorouſly to the matter as St. <hi>Francis de Sales,</hi> and that they for the diſintereſt of Love, have made the
<pb facs="tcp:49309:6"/>
ſame Suppoſitions concerning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Salvation, that our diſdainful Criticks ſo much laugh at, when they meet with them in the Writings of the Saints of the last Age: Even S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf, whom ſome have taken to be an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of this Doctrine, hath taught it as much as any other. It's true, indeed, the main Thing is to explain this pure Love aright, and to mark out the exact Bounds, beyond which its Diſinterest could never go: The Diſinterest thereof, can never exclude the Will from loving God without Bounds, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard to the Degree, nor the Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Love; This can never exclude a Conformity in us to the good Pleaſure of God, who not only wills our Salvation, but would have us will it with him for his Glory. This Diſintereſted Love, is always tied to the written Law, performs entirely the ſame Acts, and exerciſes the ſame diſtinct Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as Intereſted Love does, with this only Difference, that it doth exerciſe the ſame in a ſimple and peaceable Manner, and ſuch as is diſengaged from every Motive of Self-Intereſt.</p>
            <p>This holy Indifference that is ſo much praiſed by St. <hi>Francis de Sales,</hi> is nothing
<pb facs="tcp:49309:7"/>
elſe but the diſintereſt of this Love, which is always indifferent, and without any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Will for itſelf; but the ſame is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways determined to, and poſitively wills all that God would have us do, according to his written Law, and that by the Attraction of his Grace.</p>
            <p>In order to the attaining to this State, our Love must be purified, and all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Trials, are but the purification of it; even Contemplation itſelf, that is of a moſt paſſive Nature, is nothing elſe but the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and uniform Exerciſe of this pure Love; We cannot inſenſibly paſs from Meditation, wherein we perform methodical and diſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Acts, into Contemplation, whoſe Acts are ſimple and direct, but in proportion to our paſſing from intereſted to diſintereſted Love. This paſſive State, and Transformation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Spiritual Marriages, and eſſential or immediate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, are no other than the entire Purity of this Love; the Habit whereof, without being ever either invariable, or exempted from venial Sins, very few Souls are endued with. I do not ſpeak of all theſe different Degrees, that are ſo little known to the Generality of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

but becauſe they are Conſecrated to us, by being made uſe of by a great many Saints whom the Church hath approved off, and have in theſe Terms explained their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences; neither do I relate them for any other end, than to explain them with the ſtrictest Precaution. Finally, all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ways tend to pure Love, as to their End; an habitual State whereof, is the higheſt Degree attainable in the Pilgrimage of this Life; it's the Foundation, and the top Stone of the whole Building: Nothing can be raſher, than to oppoſe the Purity of this Love, that is ſo worthy of the Perfection of our God, to whom all is due, and of his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, which is a conſuming Fire. But again, there is nothing can be ſo raſh, as to go about to take away from this Love, the reality of its Acts, in the Practice of diſtinct Vertues, by a Chymerical refining of it. Laſtly, It will be no leſs dangerous, to place the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Internal Life, in ſome myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious State, beyond the Bound fixed to it of an habitual State of pure Love.</p>
            <p>It's in order to prevent all theſe Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, that I have taken upon me to treat of the whole Matter in the following Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb facs="tcp:49309:8"/>
that are digeſted according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Degrees that have been remarked unto us, by Myſtical Men, in the Spirittal Life.</p>
            <p>Every Article will conſist of two parts, the first will be the true one, which I ſhall approve of, and which ſhall contain all that is Authorized by the Experiences of the Saints, and purſuant to the ſound Doctrine of pure Love. The ſecond ſhall be the falſe part, where I ſhall exactly explain the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Place where the Danger of Illuſion lies; and as I ſhall give an Account alſo of what is exorbitant in every Article, I ſhall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſie the ſame, and cenſure it according to the ſtrict Rules of Theology.</p>
            <p>And thus the first part of my Articles will be a Collection of exact Definitions of the Saints Expreſſions, in order to reduce them all to an unconteſtable meaning, that can neither be liable to any Equivocation, nor alarm the most timorous Souls. It will be a kind of Dictionary for Definitions, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to know the exact meaning of every Term: Theſe Definitions together, will make up a plain and compleat Syſtem of all the Internal Ways, including a perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, ſeeing the whole thereof will be clearly reduced to the
<pb facs="tcp:49309:8"/>
Exerciſe of pure Love, that has been as vigorouſly taught by all the Fathers, as by the more modern Saints.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, the ſecond part of my Articles will ſhew all the Conſequence of falſe Principles, that tend to create the most dangerous Illuſion, against the Rule of Faith and good Manners, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſhew of Perfection. I ſhall endeavour in each Article, to point at the Place where the Equivocation begins, and to cenſure all that is ill, without in the leaſt diminiſhing the Authority of the Saints Experiences. If our Myſtical Men would give me Ear without prejudice, they would quickly apprehend what my Meaning is, and that I take their Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in a just extent of the true Sence of them: I'll even refer it to their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if I do not explain their Maxims, with much more Exactneſs than moſt of them have hitherto done; becauſe I have made it my principal Buſineſs to give their Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſions clear and exact Ideas, and ſuch as are Authoriſed by Tradition, without weakning the Foundations of the Things themſelves: All good Myſtical Men, who love nothing but Truth, and the Edification of the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:49309:9"/>
ought to be ſatisfied with this Plan: I could have added hereunto a great many formal Paſſages out of the Ancient Fathers, as well as School-Doctors, and Myſtical Saints; but this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me into ſuch Lengths, and innumerable Repetitions as frightned me from it, for the Reader's ſake: this is that which hath cauſed me to ſuppreſs the Collection of thoſe Paſſages, which I had already digeſted and ſet in Order. I do ſuppoſe, without any more ado, this Tradition to be conſtant and deciſive; and I have confined my ſelf to ſet forth here a clear Syſtem, and ſuch as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Theological Definitions: Tho' the Drineſs of this Method looks like a great Inconvenience, yet it is leſs than that of a tireſome Length.</p>
            <p>I have no more to do, than to practiſe this Plan, that I have given an Explanation of: I look up unto God, and not my ſelf, for Strength to do it, who is pleaſed to make uſe of the vilest and unworthiest Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: My Doctrine ought not to be mine, but that of Christ, who ſends forth Paſtors; be it far from me, to ſay any thing of my ſelf; may I not proſper, if while I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb facs="tcp:49309:9"/>
in inſtructing others. I be not my ſelf the most teachable, and most ſubmiſſive Child of the Catholick, Apoſtolick, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin my Work, with making a plain Expoſition of the different Sences that may be given to that we call, <hi>The Love of God;</hi> in order to give a clear and diſtinct <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the State of the Queſtions belonging to this Matter; then will the Reader meet with my Articles, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of what is true, and condemns every thing that is falſe, in each particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Internal Life.</p>

            <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHen I conſider the many Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that have hapned from Time to Time, between not only particular Perſons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but even whole Societies; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and almoſt all Others, about Matters of Faith, and other Religious Tenets, I cannot but admire at the Boldneſs of ſome of thoſe Gentlemen, who make their Unity to be a token of their Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the divided Opinions of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, an evident Mark of the Falſity of their Belief: But ſurely, it is now high time they ſhould give over that fantaſtick Argument, ſince theſe ſort of Diſſentions are more rife among themſelves, than any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity in the World; and they may have Work enough to do, to turn their Pens that way, eſpecially ſince <hi>Quietiſm,</hi> and ſome other Opinions, in Conſequence of it, hath taken ſuch Root amongſt them, that even ſome of thoſe who are reckon'd the Pillars of the Church, ſeem to be as good as open Favourers of it, and would draw, if it were poſſible, his <hi>Holineſs</hi> himſelf, to be of the ſame Sentiments, and ſo to turn all at once Heretick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49309:10"/>
But among all thoſe who have more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſpouſed theſe new Opinions, is the Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> a Perſon of that Learning and Conſideration in his Countrey as to have been intruſted by the <hi>French</hi> King his Maſter, with the Education of the young Princes, the Dauphine's Sons. But how this Eminent Perſon came thus to expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will be ſomewhat worthy of our enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, before we proceed to give an Account of the oppoſition he hath met with, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſequences that have attended the Publiſhing of his Book, which is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Readers View, that he may paſs his Cenſure alſo thereupon.</p>
            <p>There are but a few people that have not heard of <hi>Molinos,</hi> and his Doctrine of <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etiſm,</hi> ſome years ſince broached at <hi>Rome,</hi> and what induſtry was uſed by the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Inquiſitors, to ruine both him and it; But how rigorous ſoever they ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Author, they have not yet been able to ſuppreſs his Opinions, which not only have ſtill a being and conſiderable Fautors amongſt them in <hi>Italy,</hi> but the ſame or ſomething very like it, which we may call <hi>Semi-Quietiſm,</hi> upon the ſame account as ſome Ancient Hereticks were diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the name of <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> hath been able to make its way through the ſnowy <hi>Alps,</hi> and enter into the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and agreed ſo well ſince with the
<pb facs="tcp:49309:11"/>
Soyl of that Countrey, that it will not be quickly rooted out.</p>
            <p>The Rulers of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church began to be ſenſible pretty early, of this ſuppoſed growing Evil; but the occaſion of their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a more publick notice of it, was, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Womans putting out a Pamphlet, called <hi>A Short Method,</hi> &amp;c. and diſperſing ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papers, ſavouring very much of <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etiſm,</hi> whom to reclaim from her error, they took care to appoint three Counſellours to admoniſh and inſtruct her, and to them the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> was added for a fourth: But which way things came to paſs, and what ſucceſs ſoever the firſt three might think they had upon the Woman, its likely ſhe brought over the fourth to the Opinion, (or ſomewhat that was near it, if he were not ſo before) She was accuſed of being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of; But this did not appear at preſent. However, ſome of the Clergy thought it high time to beſtir themſelves in the matter; and particularly the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Meaux</hi> and <hi>Chartres,</hi> did believe the foundation of their Church to have been ſo far ſtruck at by ſuch proceedings that they framed thirty four Articles, on the 16th and 26th of <hi>April,</hi> 1695. wherein they ſet forth what every Chriſtian ought to believe and act, and what to reject, as erroneous and noxious to the Souls of Men; Hereupon, the Arch-Biſhop
<pb facs="tcp:49309:11"/>
of <hi>Cambray,</hi> led by what fate I know not, took upon him to compile this Work, Entituled, <hi>The Maxims of the Saints Explained,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to give a more full Explication of the ſaid thirty four Articles, but did it in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as allarmed the whole body of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy, but more particularly, the Authors of the ſaid Articles, who with divers others failed not to make Complaints thereof to the King, and at the ſame time to importune him to commit the ſaid Work to Examination. The Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Rheims</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> with the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> an implacable Enemy to <hi>Cambray,</hi> were the perſons appointed for it, the effect whereof was the putting out of their Declaration, upon the ſame Subject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they fully ſet forth their ſentiments in relation to it. And as theſe Prelates diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed their Zeal in this manner, againſt this <hi>Semi-Quietiſm;</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Noyon,</hi> about the ſame time, in his <hi>Paſtoral Letter,</hi> written in the Form of a <hi>Preſervative, to keep the Clergy, and Faithful of his Dioceſs, in the holy Exerciſe of a ſolid and real Piety, againſt the pernicions Maxims of</hi> Quietiſm, ſets himſelf againſt <hi>Quietiſm,</hi> in all the Branches of it: But tho' he would have the <hi>Quietiſm</hi> he darts his Thunder at, to be not that of <hi>Molinos,</hi> but this new ſort of <hi>Semi-Quietiſm;</hi> yet when he comes to a kind of an Explanation of it, he confounds the new <hi>Quietiſm</hi> with the old, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:49309:12"/>
that in reſpect to the Opinions, which he looks upon to be moſt monſtrous, he imputes what <hi>Molinos</hi> taught, to thoſe againſt whom he writes; of which take this one taſt, <hi>What an Abomination</hi> is it (ſays the Biſhop) <hi>to ſet up Vices in the place of Vertues, and to pretend, that ſhameful Falls are the Steps by which to aſcend to the Glory of a perfect Union with God.</hi> Now this is <hi>Molinos</hi> himſelf, that has occaſioned this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, who ſays in direct Terms, That we ought not to afflict, or diſturb our ſelves, when we fall into any Defect; but to riſe up and go on, and ſet our ſelves to Exerciſes of Piety, as if we had never fallen: <hi>Would you not take him to be a Fool,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Prize of a Race, and hapning to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the midst of his Carier, ſhould lie upon the Ground, to no other end, than to bewail his Fall? You would rather ſay to him, Riſe, Friend, and without loſs of time, ſet thy ſelf a running again; for he that gets up quickly, and purſues his Race, is like one that never fell:</hi> So that it's manifeſt from hence, in ſhort, that the <hi>French</hi> Prelates do not well underſtand what they write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; but that there is ſomething in it tending to invalidate Penances, and put Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular Confeſſions out of Faſhion, which has brought ſo much <hi>Griſt</hi> to the <hi>Romiſh Mill,</hi> is what they ſeem to be very apprehenſive of.</p>
            <p>But the Clergy, notwithſtanding all their 'fore-mention'd Endeavours for the Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this new Doctrine, finding it to ſpread
<pb facs="tcp:49309:12"/>
itſelf more and more, among all Ranks and Orders of Men, as well Eccleſiaſticks as La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks, they thought it high time to transfer the Accuſation to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all the aggravation of the Arch-Biſhop's of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>'s Crime, and Hereſie, imaginable; and becauſe they would not fail to make <hi>ſure work</hi> of it, they engag'd the <hi>French King</hi> ſo far on their ſide alſo, as to get him to write to the Pope, to induce him in Confirmation of the <hi>Cenſures</hi> of the <hi>Clergy of France,</hi> to condemn the Arch-Biſhop's Book; who, on his own part alſo, being not ignorant of theſe Proceedings againſt him, and not to be wanting to his own Defence, thought it no leſs proper to write to his <hi>Holineſs</hi> upon the ſame Subject: But tho' the Biſhop has uſed as much Caution as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in that he wrote to the <hi>Pope,</hi> yet you will find in another of his Letters to a Friend, that he is the ſame Man ſtill.</p>
            <p>But how violent ſoever the Arch-Biſhops accuſers appear'd againſt him, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope kept a ſoft pace, till ſuch time as having received the Arch-Biſhops ſaid Letter, he was pleaſed to appoint ſeven Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to Examine his Book, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Sacred Pallace, His Holineſs his Confeſſor, and a <hi>Jaccbin;</hi> Father <hi>Marſouiller,</hi> a <hi>French-Man</hi> of the ſame Order, the <hi>Proctor-General</hi> of St. <hi>Auguſtine-Friars,</hi> Father <hi>Gabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> of the <hi>Mendicant</hi> Order; Father <hi>Miri,</hi> a
<pb facs="tcp:49309:13"/>
               <hi>Benedictine;</hi> Father <hi>Grenelli,</hi> a <hi>Franciſcan;</hi> and Father <hi>Alfaro, Jeſuit.</hi> Theſe were to make their Report to the Congregation of the holy Office, in order to their farther proceedings thereupon: But whither it were that theſe Gentlemen could not underſtand the Biſhops <hi>Gallimaufry</hi> of notional ſpeculations, or what ſhall I call it, or what ever elſe was in the wind, they did nothing in it, and the matter at laſt came before <hi>old Infallibility himſelf,</hi> and his Sacred College of <hi>Cardinals:</hi> But after all this, and the continual Sollicitations of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and ſome great Prelates, there are ſome months now elapſed and nothing done in it; and by any thing that hitherto has appear'd to the contrary, they are ſo far from coming to a final deciſion either in favour or againſt the ſaid Book, as when they firſt began. To enter upon an inquiry into the Doctrine and notions contained in this Treatiſe, will not be proper for me in this place, that being entirely left to the judgment of every one that has an inclination to peruſe it: It remains for me therefore to ſay; that as it as ſtirred up the Curioſity of all ſorts of perſons abroad to make an inſpection into theſe tenets, ſo it has done mine, to engage me in a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inquiry into the riſe, and progreſs, as well as the diſlike of, and oppoſition made againſt them.</p>

            <head>AN EXPLANATION Of the Diverſe Loves Which may be had for GOD.</head>
            <p n="1">1. WE may love God not for the ſake of himſelf, but for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good things depending on his Almighty power, which we hope to obtain from him. Such Love as this had the Carnal Jews, who obſerved the Law in hopes only of being recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd with the dew of Heaven and the fertility of the Earth. This love is neither Chaſt nor Filial, but meerly Servile; or rather, to ſpeak properly, who loveth ſo, does not love God but his own dear Self, and ſeeks entirely for himſelf, not God, but what comes from him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may have Faith and not one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Charity with it. We know God to be our only happineſs, that is to ſay, the only Object, the ſight whereof can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us happy. Now ſhould we in this ſlate love God as the only inſtrument to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49309:14"/>
made uſe of for to work our happineſs, and becauſe we are not able to find our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in any other object: ſhould we look upon God as a means of felicity, and refer it purely to our ſelves as to its ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end, this would be rather a ſelf-love than a love of God; at leaſt, it would be contrary to order, as reſpecting God as an object or inſtrument of our felicity, both to our ſelves and our own happineſs. And though by this love we ſhould ſeek for no other reward but God alone, yet would it prove wholly mercenary and of meer concupiſcency. <hi>That Soul</hi> (as ſaith S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> in his Book of the love of God, Lib. 2. c. 17.) <hi>which ſhould love God only out of love to her ſelf, by eſtabliſhing the end of that love ſhe bears to God in her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, alas! would be guilty of an extream Sacriledge. . . . . . . . That Soul which loveth God only for her own ſake, loveth her ſelf as ſhe ought to love God, and loveth God as ſhe ought to love her ſelf: Which is as much as if one ſhould ſay, the love I bear to my ſelf is the end for which I love God; ſo that the love to God be depending, ſubordinate, and inferiour to ſelf-love . . . . which is an unparallell'd impiety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We may love God with a love of hope, which love is not intirely ſelfiſh, for it is mixt with a beginning of love to God for himſelf, only our own intereſt is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49309:14"/>
the chief and predominant motive. S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> (love of God, Lib. 2. c. 17.) Speaks thus of this love. <hi>I don't ſay howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that it returns ſo fully upon us as to make us to love God only for our ſakes. . . . . There is a great deal of difference between ſaying; I love God for the good things I expect from him: and this expreſſion, I love God only for the good things I expect from him.</hi> This love of God is ſo call'd becauſe the motive of ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is yet predominant in it: 'Tis a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Converſion to God; but not yet the true righteouſneſs of this hopeful love. S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> (love of God, Lib. 2. c. 17.) Spoke thus, <hi>Sovereign love is only in Charity; but in hope love is imperfect, as not tending into the infinite goodneſs as it is ſuch to us . . . . Though in truth none by that love alone can either obſerve the Commandments of God, or have eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a love of Charity which is yet allayed with ſome mixture of ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, but is the true juſtifying love; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the diſintereſſed motive is over-ruling in it: to which S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> Speaks in the laſt cited place. <hi>Sovereign love is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Charity.</hi> This love ſeeks after God for himſelf, and prefers him before any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing whatſoever without exception.</p>
            <p>By reaſon only of that preference <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> capable to juſtifie us: And it prefe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49309:15"/>
leſs God and his Glory, both to us and our intereſts than to all other Creatures beſides. The reaſon why is this: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are no leſs vile Creatures and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to compare our ſelves with God than the reſt of created beings. God who did not make us for the other Creatures, hath not likewiſe made us for our ſelves, but for himſelf alone.</p>
            <p>He is no leſs Jealous of us than of the other external objects which we may love. To Speak properly, the only thing he is Jealous of in us is our ſelves; for he clearly ſees that it is our ſelves, whom we are tempted to love in the enjoyments of all external objects. He is not liable to miſtakes in his Jealouſie, and the love of our ſelves is the centre of all our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Whatſoever does not proceed from the principle of Charity, (as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo often ſaith,) is of cupidity. And it is the deſtruction of that very love, the root of all vices, which is preciſely the aim of God's Jealouſie. While we have yet but a love of hope whereby ſelf-love does pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponde are againſt the Glory of God, the Soul is not ſatisfied yet. But when diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed love or of Charity begins to turn the ſcale and to prevail againſt ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, then a Soul that loves God is truly beloved of him. Nevertheleſs, this true
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49309:15"/>
Charity is not yet entirely pure that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture: but the love of Charity prevailing over the intereſſed motive of hope, that ſtate is termed a ſtate of Charity. The Soul then doth love God for the ſake of him and for her ſelf, but ſo as to love chiefly the Glory of God, not ſeeking her own happineſs, but as a means by her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and ſubordinated to the ultimate end, namely, the Glory of her Maker. Nor is it neceſſary that this prefering of God and of his Glory to us and our intereſts, be always explicite in the righteous Soul. We are aſſured by faith that the Glory of God and our felicity are inſeparable one from another, 'tis enough if this ſo juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary preference be real, but implicite in the occurrences of life. There is no need of its becoming explicite but in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſions of trial from God in order to purifie us from our droſs. But then he would give us both light and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage proportionate to the trial, to carry us through it, and to make us ſenſible in our hearts of that preference. Now to dive for it ſcrupulouſly at another time, in the bottom of our hearts would rather prove prejudicial and dangerous.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We may love God with a love of pure Charity, and without any mixture of the motive of ſelf-intereſt, Then it is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49309:16"/>
that we love God in the midſt of troubles and adverſities, ſo that we ſhould not love him more even when he fills our Souls with comforts. Neither fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor deſire of rewards have any ſhare in this love; God is no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved either in regard of the merit or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or for the happineſs which is found in loving him. We would love him as much, though by an impoſſible ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſhould know nothing of his being beloved, or would render eternally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy thoſe who had loved him. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, we do love him as the ſupream and infallible happineſs of thoſe who are faithful to him; we love him as our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal good, as our promiſed reward, as our all; but no more with that preciſe motive of our own happineſs and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Thus much did S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales,</hi> with the moſt exactneſs expreſs (love of God, Lib. 2. c. 17.) in theſe Words: <hi>'Tis a very different thing to ſay, I love God for my ſelf; and ſaying, I love God for the ſake of my ſelf. . . . . for the one is a holy affection of the Bride . . . and the other a downright im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,</hi> &amp;c. He Speaks again thus in another place: <hi>The purity of love conſiſts in not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing for ones ſelf, in looking on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the good pleaſure of God, for which one would be ready to prefer eternal torments to

glory.</hi> The Soul diſintereſſed in pure cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity expects, deſireth, hopeth in God as her good, her recompence, as that which is promiſed her and is entirely for her ſelf. She will have him for her ſelf, but not for the love of her ſelf. She will have him for her ſelf that ſhe may conform with the good pleaſure of God who will have it ſo for her ſelf. But ſhe will not have him for the love of her ſelf, becauſe ſhe is no more acted by her own intereſt.</p>
            <p>This is pure and perfect love, which works the ſame acts as mixt love in all the ſame virtues; with this one difference only, that it driveth out fear with all vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious troubles, and is even free of all the ſolicitude of intereſſed love.</p>
            <p>Now, I declare that to avoid all ſort of equivocation, in a matter where it is ſo dangerous to make any, and ſo difficult not to miſtake; I ſhall always exactly obſerve the ſame names which I will aſſign to theſe five kinds of love for a better diſtinction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The love of the carnal Jews, for the gifts of God diſtinguiſhed from him and not for himſelf, may be called meerly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile love. But becauſe we ſhall have no need to ſpeak of it, I ſhall ſay nothing of it in this work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That love wherewith God is beloved as the means and only inſtrument of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49309:17"/>
which is referr'd abſolutely to ones ſelf as to the ultimate end, may be termed meer concupiſcential love.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That love in which the motive of our own happineſs prevails yet over that of God's Glory, is called love of hope or hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful love.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That love in which charity is yet mixt with a motive of ſelf-intereſt, related and ſubordinate to the principal motive, and to the ultimate end which is the pure glory of God, ſhould be called love of charity mixt. But becauſe we ſhall have occaſion to oppoſe very often this love to that which is called pure or wholly intereſſed, I ſhall be oblig'd to give to this mixt love the name of intereſſed love; as being indeed yet allayed with a remnant of ſelfiſh inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, though it be a love of preference of God to ones ſelf.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The love to God alone, conſidered in it ſelf, and without any the leaſt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an intereſſed motive either of fear, or of hope, is the pure love or perfect cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

               <p>MEER concupiſcential or wholly mercenary love, whereby no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be deſired but God; God, I ſay, for the only intereſt of ones own happineſs, and becauſe we ſhould think to find in him the ſole inſtrument of our felicity, would be a love unworthy of God. For one would then love him as a Miſer doth love his Money, or as a voluptuous Man his pleaſure: So that one would referr only God to ones ſelf as a means to its end. This overturning of order would be according to S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> (love of God, Lib. 2. c. 17.) <hi>a Sacrilegious love, and an unparallell'd impiety.</hi> But this meer concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcential or wholly mercenary love ought never to be confounded with that love, which by Divines is called of preference, which is a love of God mixt with ourſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and in which the love of our ſelves is found always ſubordinate to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal end, which is the glory of God. Love meerly mercenary is rather a love of ones ſelf than of God. It may indeed prepare
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49309:18"/>
one for righteouſneſs in this, that it coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſes our paſſions, and renders us pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in diſcerning where our true good does lie: But it is againſt the eſſential or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a creature, and cannot be a real beginning of true internal Juſtice. On the contrary, Preferential Love though ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, may juſtifie a Soul, if ſo be that our own intereſt be referr'd to it, and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the Predominant love of God, and provided his glory be the principal end thereof, ſo that we do not prefer with leſs ſincerity God to our ſelves, as to all other creatures. This preference ought not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to be always explicite, provided it be real: for God who knows the clay where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are formed, and pitieth his own Children, does not require at their hand a diſtinct and unfolded preference, but in thoſe caſes wherein he giveth them by his grace the courage to go through thoſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in which this preference muſt needs be explicite.</p>
               <p>Speaking thus we recede in nothing from the Doctrine of the holy Council of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ALL intereſſed love or mixt with any ſelf-intereſt concerning our eternal happineſs, though referr'd and ſubordinate to the principal motive of the glory of God, is a love unworthy of him, whereof the Soul ought to be purified as of a true ſpot or ſin. It is not even lawful to make uſe of meer concupiſcential love or meerly mercenary to prepare ſinful Souls to their converſion, ſuſpending thereby their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ill habits, in order to put them in a condition to hearken peaceably to the words of faith.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak after that rate is to contradict the formal deciſion of the holy Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> declaring that mixt love wherein the glory of God is the predominant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is no ſin.

               <p>THere are three different degrees, or three habitual ſtates of Juſt Men upon the Earth. The firſt have a Preferential Love for God, ſince they are Juſt, but this love though principal and predominant, is yet mixt with fear for their ſelf-intereſt. The ſecond are much more in a Love of prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: but this love, though chief and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling is yet mixt with Hope for their intereſt, as it is their own. Therefore S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> ſaith, (love of God, Lib. 9.) <hi>That holy Reſignation hath yet ſelfiſh deſires, but ſubordinate.</hi> Theſe two loves are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the fourth which I have called (V. <hi>pag.</hi> 10.) an intereſſed love in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions.</p>
               <p>The third incomparably more perfect than the two other ſorts of Juſt Men, have a fully diſintereſſed love, which hath been termed pure, thereby to intimate, that it is without mixture of any other motive than that of loving only in himſelf and for himſelf, the ſovereign beauty of God. This all the Ancients have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by ſaying that there are three ſtates: The firſt of Juſt Men, whom fear acted yet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49309:19"/>
by a remnant of a ſlaviſh mind. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is of thoſe who hope yet for their own intereſt by a mixture of a mercenary ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The third is of thoſe who deſerve to be called Sons, becauſe they love the Father without any ſelf-ended motive, either of hope or of fear. This the Writers of the laſt Ages have preciſely expreſs'd the very ſame under other equivalent names. They have divided them into three ſtates. The firſt whereof is Purgative life, in which we do combat vices with a love mixt with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive intereſſed with fear of eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The ſecond is illuminative life, wherein we do acquire fervency of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues by a love yet mixt with a motive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed for coeleſtial happineſs. Finally, the third is contemplative or unitive life, in which, we do remain united with God by the peaceable exerciſe of pure love; in which laſt ſtate one never loſeth filial fear, nor the hope of the Children of God, though he hath parted with all intereſſed motives of hope and fear.</p>
               <p>Fear is brought to perfection by purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf; it becomes a delicacy of love, and a filial reverence in peace. And it is then that chaſt fear which remains for ever and ever. Likewiſe hope far from being loſt, is perfected by the purity of love, and then it is a real deſire, and a ſincere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49309:20"/>
of the fulfilling of the promiſes, not only in general and in an abſolute manner, but alſo of the accompliſhment of the promiſes in us and for us according to the good pleaſure and will of God: nay, by the only motive of his good pleaſure, without any intermixture of our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. This pure love is not yet ſatisfied with deſiring no other recompence but God himſelf. A ſlave entirely mercenary, who ſhould have a diſtinct faith of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truths, might be willing to have no other reward but God alone, becauſe he would know him clearly as an infinite good, and as being himſelf his true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, or the only inſtrument of his felicity. This mercenary Man in the life to come would have nothing but God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but he would have God as Beatitude objective, or the object of his Beatitude, to refer it to his formal Beatitude, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to himſelf, whom he would make hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and conſtitute himſelf as his ultimate end. On the contrary, whoſoever loveth with a pure love, without any mixture of ſelf-intereſt, is acted no more by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his intereſt. He wiſhes Beatitude to himſelf, only becauſe he knows that God will have it ſo, and will have every one of us to deſire it for his own glory. If by an impoſſible ſuppoſition, by reaſon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49309:20"/>
of the promiſes which are meerly free, God would annihilate the Souls of Juſt Men at the moment of their ſeparation from the body, or deprive them of the fruition of himſelf, and keep them eternally under the temptations and miſeries of this life, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſuppoſes it; or even make them to ſuffer far from him, all the pains of Hell during all eternity, as it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> after S. <hi>Clement,</hi> the Souls of this third ſtate of pure love, would not love or ſerve him with leſs fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Once more 'tis true, that this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is impoſſible, upon the account of the promiſes, becauſe God hath given himſelf to us as a rewarder: We cannot any more ſeparate our happineſs from God, beloved with final perſeverance: but thoſe things which cannot be ſeparated in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the object, may happen really to be ſo in reſpect of the motives. God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of being the felicity of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul; but ſhe may love him with ſo much impartiality, that the enjoyment of a beatifying God increaſeth not in the leaſt the love ſhe hath ſor him without minding her ſelf, and that ſhe would love as much though he were never to be the cauſe of her happineſs. Now to ſay that this abſtraction of motives is but a vain ſubtilty, is to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant both of God's jealouſie, and of that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49309:21"/>
of the Saints againſt themſelves: It is to give the name of ſubtilty to the nicety and perfection of Pure Love, which the tradition of all Ages, hath put in this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of the motives.</p>
               <p>This way of Speaking is preciſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the whole general tradition of Chriſtianity, from the moſt Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> to all the moſt famous Scholaſtick Doctors, from S. <hi>Thomas</hi> to thoſe of our Age; laſtly, to all thoſe Myſtical Men who have been Canoniz'd or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the whole Church in ſpight of all the contradictions they have ſuffered. Nothing in the Church is more evident than this tradition, and nothing would be more raſh than to oppoſe it, or to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhift it off. This ſuppoſition of the impoſſible caſe here mentioned, far from being an indiſcreet and dangerous ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Myſticks, is on the contrary formally in S. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in <hi>Caſſian,</hi> in S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> in S. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen,</hi> in S. <hi>Anſelm,</hi> and in S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who have been followed by a great number of Saints.</p>

               <p>THere is a love ſo pure that it rejects that recompence which is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo that a Man will not have it any more in himſelf and for himſelf, though we are taught by faith that God will have it in us and for us, and commands us to will it as he doth for his own glory.</p>
               <p>This love doth carry its impartiality ſo far even as to conſent to hate God eternally, or to ceaſe from loving of him; or elſe it tends to the deſtruction of filial fear, which is nothing elſe but the niceneſs and delicacy of a Jealous love; or it aims to the exſtinguiſhing in us all hope, foraſmuch as the pureſt hope is a peaceable deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in us and for us the effect of the promiſes in conformity to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, and for his pure glory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture of ſelf-intereſt; or elſe it tends to the hating of our ſelves, with a real hatred, ſo that we ceaſe from loving in our ſelves, for God's ſake, his worth, and his image, as we love it out of charity in our Neighbour.</p>
               <p>The ſpeaking at this rate is to give with a horrid Blaſphemy, the name of pure love to a brutiſh and impious deſpair, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49309:22"/>
to the hatred of the work of our Creator. It is by a monſtrous extravagance to affirm That the principle of conformity with God makes us contrary to himſelf. It is a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about by a chimerical love to deſtroy love it ſelf. It is to put Chriſtianity out of the hearts of Men.</p>

               <p>SOuls muſt be left in the exerciſe of love, that (4. Love, See <hi>pag.</hi> 8.) which is yet mixt with the motive of intereſt as long as the power of grace ſhall leave them in it. One ought alſo to reverence theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſcattered through all the Books of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, in all the moſt precious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Tradition; and in all the Prayers of the Church. We ought to make uſe of theſe motives to repreſs paſſions, to conſolidate virtues, and to diſintangle our Souls from all things of this preſent life.</p>
               <p>However this love though leſs perfect than that which is fully diſintereſs'd hath nurſed up in all ages a great number of Saints, and greateſt part of holy Souls do never attain in this life the perfect impartiality of love; you diſturb and caſt them into temptation if you take from them the motives of ſelf-intereſt,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49309:22"/>
which being ſubordinate to love, ſerve to hold them up, and to animate them in dangerous occaſions. It would be to no purpoſe, and indiſcretion to propoſe them a more elevated love, which is out of their reach, as having neither internal light nor the power of grace for it. Nay, thoſe who begin to have ſome knowledge and foretaſte of it, are yet very far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reality of it. Finally, thoſe who have attained its imperfect reality, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far yet from having the uniform exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it turned into an habitual ſtate.</p>
               <p>What is eſſential in the direction is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low only grace ſtep by ſtep, with extream patience, precaution, and niceneſs. We ought to confine our ſelves to God's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and never ſpeak of pure love but when God by internal unction begins to open the heart to that word, ſo hard to Souls, yet ſelfiſh, and ſo apt to ſcandalize them or to caſt them into trouble. Nay more than that, we ought never to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from a Soul the ſupport of intereſſed motives, when they begin with the power of grace to inſtruct her in pure love. 'Twill be enough if upon certain occaſions we ſhew her how amiable God is in himſelf, but never to diſſwade her from taking hold on the ſupport of mixt love.</p>

               <p>INtereſſed love (See <hi>pag.</hi> 8.) is mean, groſs, unworthy of God, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Souls ought to ſcorn and deſpiſe. Haſt muſt be made to put them out of conceit with it, that they may aſpire from the beginning to an intirely Diſintereſſed Love.</p>
               <p>The motives of the fear of Death, of God's Judgments, and of Hell belonging only to ſlaves, ought immediately to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.

               <p>To Speak at this rate, is to be ignorant of the ways of God and of the operations of his grace. They will have the ſpirit to

               <p>HOpe in the habitual ſtate of pureſt love, far from being loſt, is perfected and keeps its diſtinction from charity. 1. The habit thereof infuſes into the Soul, and is conformable there to the produci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acts of that virtue. 2. The exerciſe of that virtue remains always diſtinguiſh'd from that of charity: the reaſon of which is this. It is not the diverſity of ends that cauſeth the diverſity or ſpecification of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. All virtues ought to have but one end, though they be one from the other diſtinguiſhed by a true ſpecification. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> (de moribus Eccl. l. 1.) aſſureth, <hi>that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49309:24"/>
charity it ſelf is the active principle of all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and takes diverſe denominations ſuitable to the objects it is applied to.</hi> S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith, <hi>that charity is the form of all virtues,</hi> becauſe it exerciſeth and refers them all to its end, which is the glory of God. S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales,</hi> who hath excluded ſo formally, and with ſo many repetitions all intereſſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, from all the virtues of perfect Souls, hath followed preciſely the ſteps both of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> whom he cites. They have all followed the univerſal tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which conſtitutes a third degree of Juſt Men, who do exclude all intereſſed motives from the purity of their love. 'Tis then certain that one ought not any more to ſeek in that ſtate for hope exerciſed by an intereſſed motive: otherwiſe this would be a pulling down with one hand what hath been raiſed with the other; a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ones ſport with ſo holy a tradition; an affirming and denying at the ſame time one and the ſame thing; and a ſeeking for the motive of ſelf-intereſt in an intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſintereſſed love. We ought then to remember well that it is not the diverſity of the ends or of the motives which makes the diſtinction or ſpecification of virtues. What cauſeth this diſtinction is the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of formal objects. To the end that hope may remain truly diſtinguiſhed from cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49309:24"/>
'tis not neceſſary they ſhould have different ends: on the contrary, for to be good, they ought to refer to one and the ſame end. 'Tis enough if only the formal object of hope be not the formal object of charity. Now ſo it is, that in the habitual ſtate of the moſt diſintereſſed love, the two formal objects of theſe two virtues are very different; therefore theſe two vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues do conſerve in that ſtate a diſtinction and true ſpecification in the ſtricteſt Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical ſenſe. The formal object of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the goodneſs or beauty of God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſimply and abſolutely in it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Idea relative to us. The formal object of hope is the goodneſs of God as it is good for us and of a difficult acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Now it evidently appears, that theſe two objects taken in the moſt abſtracted ſenſe and Formal Conception are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Therefore the difference of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects conſerve the ſpecifick diſtinction of theſe two virtues. 'Tis certain that God as he is perfect in himſelf, and without any reſpect to me; and God as he is my happineſs which I endeavour to acquire, are two formal objects very different. There is no confuſion on the part of the object which ſpecifies theſe virtues; but only on the part of the end, and that confuſion ought to be there: and it alters in nothing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49309:25"/>
the ſpecification of virtues. The only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty remaining now is to explain how a fully diſintereſſed Soul can will God as it is her good. Is not this, will they ſay, a falling from the perfection of ones diſintereſſment, a going back in the way of God, a coming again to the motive of ſelf-intereſt, contrary to all that tradition of the Saints of all ages, who do exclude from the third ſtate of Juſt Men all inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed motives? It is an eaſie matter to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that pure love never hindreth us to will, and cauſeth us even to will poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all that God is willing that we ſhould will. God will have me to will God, as he is my happineſs and reward. I will him formally under this Notion: but I will him not by that preciſe motive that he is my good. The object and the motive are different; the object is my intereſt; but the motive is not intereſſed, ſince it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards nothing but the good pleaſure of God. I will that formal object, and in this redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, as ſpeak the School: but I will it by pure conformity to the will of God, who makes me to will it. The formal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is that of the common hope of all Juſt Men, and it is the formal object by which virtues are ſpecified. The end is the ſame with that of charity; but we have ſeen that the unity of end never confoundeth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49309:25"/>
the virtues. I may without doubt deſire my ſupream good, as it is my reward, and not that of another, and deſire it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to God who will have me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. Then I deſire that which is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and which I know is the greateſt of all my intereſts, without being determined to it by any intereſted motive. In this ſtate, hope remains diſtinguiſhed from cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and does not alter or diminiſh the purity or impartiality of her ſtate. This is by S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> explained, in theſe words, according to Theological ſtrictneſs: (Love of God, Lib. 2. c. 17.) <hi>It is a very different thing to ſay, I love God for my ſelf; and to ſay, I love God for the ſake of my ſelf—the one is a holy affection of the Bride—the other is an impiety that hath not the like,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak ſo, is to conſerve the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Theological virtues in the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Eſtates of the inward Life, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to depart in nothing from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the holy Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> 'Tis to explain at the ſame time the tradition of the Fathers, of the Doctors of the School, and of Myſtick Saints, who have ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a third degree of Juſt Men, who are in an habitual ſtate of pure love without any motive of intereſt.</p>

               <p>IN this third degree of perfection, a Soul wills not any longer her Salvation as her Salvation, nor God as her ſupream good, nor reward as reward, though God will have her to have this will.

               <p>To Speak at that rate, is to place our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in a formal reſiſtance of the will of God, who wills our Salvation, and will have us to will the ſame as our own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.

               <p>THere be two different ſtates of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Souls. The firſt is that of holy Reſignation. The reſigned Soul will, or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49309:26"/>
at leaſt would have ſeveral things for her ſelf, by the motive of her own intereſt. S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> ſaith, (Love of God, Lib. 9.) <hi>That ſhe hath yet ſelfiſh deſires, but that they are ſubjected.</hi> She ſubmits and ſubordinates her intereſſed deſires to the will of God, which ſhe prefers before her intereſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this Reſignation is good and meritorious. The ſecond ſtate is that of holy indifference. An indifferent Soul wills not any longer any thing for her ſelf-intereſt. She hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted deſires to ſubmit, becauſe ſhe hath no more interreſted deſire. 'Tis true, that there remains in her ſtill ſome incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and unvoluntary repugnances which ſhe ſubmitteth; but ſhe hath no longer any voluntary and deliberate deſires for her own intereſt, except in thoſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions wherein ſhe does not faithfully co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate to the fulneſs of her grace. This indifferent Soul, when ſhe fulfilleth her grace wills not any thing more but as God makes her to will it by his attractive power.</p>
               <p>She loves it is true, ſeveral things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides God, but ſhe loves them only for the ſole love of God, and with the love of God himſelf; for it is God that ſhe loves, in all whatſoever he cauſeth her to love. Holy indifference is nothing but the impartiality or diſintereſt of love, as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49309:27"/>
holy Reſignation is nothing but intereſſed love, which ſubmitteth ſelf-intereſt to the glory of God. Indifference reacheth as far and never farther than the perfect diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of love. As that indifference is love it ſelf, it is a very real and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive principle. It is a poſitive and formal will, which cauſeth us to will or deſire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all the will of God known to us. It is not a dull unſenſibleneſs, an internal unaction or non-willing, a general ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a perpetual equilibrium of the Soul. On the contrary, it is a poſitive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant determination to will and not to will any thing, as Cardinal <hi>Bona</hi> does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it. One wills nothing for himſelf, but every thing for God: We deſire nothing in order to be perfect or happy, for our own intereſt, but we will all perfection and bleſſedneſs as far as it pleaſeth God to make us, deſire theſe things by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his grace, according to the written Law, which is always our invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable rule. In this ſtate we deſire no longer Salvation as our own Salvation, as an eternal deliverance, as a reward of our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or as the greateſt of our intereſts: But we will it with a full will, as the glory and good pleaſure of God, as a thing which he wills, and will have us to will for his ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49309:27"/>
'Twould be a manifeſt extravagancy to refuſe out of a pure love, to deſire that good which God will do to us, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to deſire. The moſt diſintere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted love ought to will what God wills for us, as that which he wills for others. The abſolute determination to will nothing would be no longer a diſintereſt, but the extinction of love which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and true will: it would be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger holy indifference; for indifference is the ſtate of a Soul, equally ready to will or will not, to will for God all that he wills, and never to will for ones ſelf, what God does not declare that he wills: Whereas, that nonſenſical determination not to will any thing, is an impious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy to all the known will of God, and to all the impreſſions of his grace. This equivocation in ſaying, that one does not deſire his Salvation, is eaſie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd. We do deſire it fully as the will of God. To reject it in this ſenſe would be a horrid Blaſphemy, and we ought always thereupon to Speak with a great deal of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution. It is true, only as we do not will it as it is our recompence, our good and our intereſt. In this ſenſe, S. <hi>Francis</hi> oſ <hi>Sales</hi> hath ſaid, (Second Converſation) That <hi>if there was a little more of God's good pleaſure in Hell, the Saints would exchange
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49309:28"/>
Paradiſe for it.</hi> And in other places too, (Conv. p. 182.) <hi>The deſire of Eternal Life is good, but he makes us to deſire nothing elſe but God's will.</hi> (Conv. 368.) <hi>Could we ſerve God without Merit, we ſhould deſire to do it.</hi> He ſaith elſewhere, (Love of God, Lib. 9. c. 11.) <hi>Indifference is above Reſignation, for it loves nothing but for the will of God: So that nothing moves an indifferent heart in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God's will.—An indifferent heart is as a Wax-Ball in the hands of his God, in order to receive in like manner all the impreſſions of his Eternal good pleaſure. 'Tis a heart without choice, equally diſpos'd to every thing, without any other object of his will but the will of his God; who does not ſet his love upon the things which God wills, but in the will of God who wideth them.</hi> In another place he ſaith, Speaking of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and of S. <hi>Martin, (Ibid.) They ſee Paradiſe open for them; they ſee a thouſand miſeries and labours upon the Earth; the one and the other is indifferent to their choice, and nothing but the will of God can give the counterpoiſe to their hearts.</hi> He ſaith afterwards, <hi>(Ibid.) Should he know that his Damnation were a little more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, than his Salvation, he would leave his Salvation and run to his Damnation.</hi> He Speaks alſo thus, in another place; (3 Diſcourſe,) <hi>It is not only requiſite that we ſhould relie upon Divine Providence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49309:28"/>
temporal things, but much more for what belongs to our Spiritual life and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> He ſaith elſewhere, <hi>Whither it be in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour or exteriour things you ought to will nothing but what God ſhall will for you.</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He ſaith in another place. <hi>I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no deſires, but if I was to be Born again, I would have none at all. If God ſhould come to me, I ſhould go to him alſo: if he would not come to me, I ſhould hold ſtill and not go to him.</hi> The other Saints of the laſt Ages who are authoriz'd by the whole Church, are full of ſuch and the like expreſſions, which are all reduced to this ſaying, <hi>that one hath no longer any ſelf and intereſted deſire, neither about merit, perfection, nor eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus to Speak, is to leave no equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſo nice a matter, where none ought to be ſuffered; 'tis to prevent all the abuſe which can be made of the moſt precious and moſt holy thing which is upon the Earth, I mean pure love; 'tis to Speak as all the Fathers, all the chiefeſt Doctors of the Schools and all myſtical Saints do.</p>

               <p>HOly indifference is an abſolute ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the will, an entire non-will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an excluſion even of all diſintereſted deſire. It goes beyond the perfect diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of love. It does not deſire for us thoſe eternal goods, which by the written Law we are taught God will give us, and which he wills we ſhould wiſh to receive in us and for us, by the motive of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. All even the moſt diſintereſted deſire is imperfect. Perfection does conſiſt in not willing any thing more whatſoever, in not deſiring any more, not only God's gifts but alſo God himſelf, and in leaving him to do in us what he pleaſes, by not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing on our ſide any real or poſitive will.</p>
               <p>To Speak at this rate, is to confound all ideas of humane reaſon; It is to put a chimerical perfection in an abſolute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of Chriſtianity, and even of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.

               <p>HOly indifference, which is nothing elſe but the diſintereſt of love, is ſo far from excluding diſintereſted deſires, that it is the real and poſitive principle of all thoſe diſintereſted deſires which the written Law commands us, and alſo of all thoſe grace does inſpire us with: After this manner did the Pſalmiſt expreſs himſelf to God; <hi>All my deſires are ſet before thine eyes.</hi> The indifferent Soul not only deſires fully her Salvation, as it is the good pleaſure of God; but more than that, perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the amendment of her faults, the increaſe of love by the means of grace, and generally without exception all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and even temporal good, that is within the order of providence, a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of means both for ours and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Salvation.

               <p>To Speak thus, is to Speak conformable to the true principles of holy indifference,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49309:30"/>
and to the ſentiment of Saints, all which expreſſions, if well examin'd, both by what precede and what followeth, are reduced without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> difficulty to this explication that is pure and ſound according to the faith.</p>

               <p>HOly indifference, admits of no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct deſire, nor of any formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, for any good either ſpiritual or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, what relation ſoever it hath either to ours or our Neighbour's Salvation.

               <p>THere is never a ſtate of indifference, or of any other perfection known in the Church, that gives to Souls a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or extraordinary inſpiration. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of interiour ways does conſiſt only in one way of pure love, whereby God is beloved without any intereſt, and of pure faith, where one walks only in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and without other light but that of faith it ſelf, which is common to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. This obſcurity of pure faith ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of extraordinary light. 'Tis not but God, who is the maſter of his gifts, may give Raptures, Viſions, Revelations, and internal communications. But they do not belong to that way of pure Faith, and we are taught by the Saints, that then we ought not to ſtop willfully in thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary lights, but to paſs them over, as ſaith the Bleſſed <hi>John</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and dwell in the moſt naked and dark Faith. Much more ought we to take heed not to ſuppoſe in the ways we have ſpoken of, any miraculous or extraordinary inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which indifferent Souls do guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by. They have for their rule no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49309:31"/>
but the precepts and counſels of the written Law, and the actual grace which is ever conformable to the Law. As to the precepts, they ought always to preſuppoſe without wavering or reaſoning, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſakes any unleſs forſaken firſt; and conſequently, that grace always preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting does inſpire them continually to the accompliſhment of the precept when it ought to be accompliſh'd. So it is their work to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with all the power and ſtrength of their will, that they may not come ſhort of grace by a tranſgreſſion of the precept. As for thoſe caſes in which counſels are not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into precepts, they ought without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence to themſelves to produce acts either of love in general, or of certain diſtinct virtues in particular, according as the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal attraction of grace inclines them to ſome rather than to others, as occaſion requires. What is very certain, is that grace prevents them in reſpect to every deliberate action; that this grace which is the internal breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God, does inſpire them thus upon every occaſion; that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration is nothing but that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Juſt Souls, and which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exempts them in the leaſt from the whole extent of the written Law; that this inſpiration is only ſtronger and more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial in Souls elevated to pure love, than
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49309:31"/>
in thoſe who are acted only by intereſted love; becauſe God communicates himſelf more to the perfect than to the imperfect. So when ſome myſtical Saints have admitted into holy indifference inſpired deſires, and rejected the others; we muſt take heed not to think that they would exclude the deſires and the other acts commanded by the written Law, and admit none but thoſe that are extraordinarily inſpired. This would be a Blaſphemy againſt the Law, and raiſe above it a Phantaſtical inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The deſires and other inſpired acts mentioned by thoſe Myſticks, are either thoſe commanded by the Law, or thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Counſels, and which are formed in an indifferent and diſintereſted Soul, by the inſpiration of ever preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace, without the mixture of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted eagerneſs to prevent grace. So that all is reduced to the letter of the Law, and to the preventing grace of pure love, to which the Soul does co-operate without preventing it.</p>
               <p>To Speak thus, is to explain the true ſenſe of good myſtical perſons; 'tis to take away all equivocations which may ſeduce the one and offend the other; 'tis to precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Souls againſt whatſoever is ſuſpected to be illuſive; it is to keep up <hi>the form of Sound Words,</hi> as <hi>S.

               <p>SOuls dwelling in an holy indifference have no regard for any, though a diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted deſire, which the written Law obliges them to form.

Their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifference eminently containing all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires diſpenſeth with them from forming ever any. Their inſpiration is their only rule.</p>
               <p>To Speak at this rate, is to elude all Counſels under pretence of fulfilling them in a moſt eminent manner; it is to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh in the Church a ſect of impious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks; 'tis to forget that Chriſt Jeſus came upon the Earth, not to diſpenſe with the Law or to leſſen the authority of it, but on the contrary, to fullfill and perfect it: ſo that Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away before the Words of our Saviour, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the confirmation of the Law ſhall paſs.

               <p>HOly indifference which is never any other but the diſintereſt of love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh in the moſt extream tryals what the holy Miſticks have called <hi>abandoning</hi> or giving one ſelf up; that is to ſay, that the diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted ſoul gives her ſelf up totally and without any the leaſt reſerve to God in all her own intereſt; but ſhe never renounceth either love nor any of thoſe things wherein the Glory and good pleaſure of her beloved are concern'd. This <hi>abandoning</hi> is nothing elſe, but that abnegation or renounciation of ones ſelf, which Jeſus Chriſt requires of us in the Goſpel; after we have forſaken all outward things. This abnegation of our ſelves is only pointed againſt our ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and ought never to hinder that diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted love, which we owe in our ſelves as to our Neighbour, for God's ſake. The
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49309:33"/>
extream tryals wherein this <hi>abandoning</hi> is to be exercis'd, are the temptations whereby our Jealous God will purify love in hiding from it all hope for its intereſt even eternal. Theſe Tryals are repreſented by a very great number of Saints, as a terrible Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which may exempt from the Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the other world, thoſe Souls who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it with entire Fidelity. <hi>Only mad and wicked Men</hi> ſaith Cardinal Bona, <hi>will deny their belief of thoſe ſublime and ſecret things, and deſpiſe them as Falſe, though not clear, when they are atteſted by Men of a moſt venerable Virtue, who ſpeak by their own experience of God's Operations in their hearts.</hi> Theſe tryals are but for a while, and the more true ſouls are in them to Grace by leaving themſelves to be purify'd from all ſelf-intereſt by Jealous love, ſo much the ſhorter are theſe tryals. 'Tis ordinarily the ſecret reſiſtance of the Souls to grace under ſpecious pretences; 'tis their intereſted and eager endeavour for retaining theſe ſenſible ſupports where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from God is willing to deprive them, which render their tryals both ſo long and ſo painful: for God never makes his Creature ſuffer, to make him ſuffer without fruit. It is with a deſign only to purifie the Soul, and to overcome her reſiſtances. Thoſe Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whereby love is purify'd from all ſelf-intereſt, are in nothing like to other
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49309:33"/>
common Temptations. Experienced Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors can diſcern them by certain tokens, but nothing is more dangerous, than to take the common Temptations of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for trials, tending to the entire purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of love in the moſt eminent Souls. This is the ſource of all illuſion: This cauſeth deceived Souls to fall into hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dreadful Vices. Theſe bitter tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are not to be ſuppos'd to be but in a very ſmall number of pure and mortified Souls, in whom Fleſh hath been a long while al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready entirely brought under the Spirit, and who have ſolidly practiſed all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Virtues. They ought to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, ſo as never willfully to ſtrain at any of thoſe hard and abject things which may be commanded them. They ought not to fall in love with any comfort or freedom; they ſhould be taken off from all things whatſoever, and alſo from the way that teacheth them this freedom; they ſhould be ready for all the practiſes that are laid upon them; they are to ſtick neither to their kind of Prayer, nor to their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, nor to their Readings, nor to thoſe perſons they have conſulted formerly with truſt and reliance. One ought to have had the Experiment that their Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are of a different nature from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Temptations in this, that the true
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49309:34"/>

to her Calling, and preſent Degree of Perfection, nor the real and internal Acts of her Free-will, for that accompliſhment: She looſeth neither preventing Grace, nor explicite Faith, nor Hope, as it is a diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Deſire of the Promiſes; nor the Love of God, nor the infinite Hatred of Sin, not ſo much as venial, nor that inward and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous certainty, that is neceſſary for the Rectitude of the Conſcience: She loſeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ſenſible Reliſh of Good, but the comfortable and affecting Fervency, but the eager and intereſted Acts of Vertues, but the After-certainty, that comes by an intereſted reflection, bearing to itſelf a comfortable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Fidelity: Theſe direct Acts, and ſuch as eſcape the Reflections of the Soul, but which are yet very real, and do conſerve in her all the Vertues without ſpot, are, as I have already ſaid, that Operation called by S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales,</hi> the Edge of the Spirit, or the Top of the Soul: This State of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Gloomineſs, which is only for a while, is not even in its own Duration, without peaceable Intervals, in which ſome Glimpſes of very ſenſible Graces, appear like Lightning in a dark ſtormy Night, which leave no ſign of themſelves behind.</p>

               <p>IN theſe extream Tryals, a Soul without having been before unfaithful to Grace, loſeth the true and full Power of perſevering in her State: She falls into a real Impotency, to fulfil the Precepts in thoſe Caſes, where Precepts are urging.

               <p>THE Promiſes of Eternal Life, are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free: Grace is never due to us; or elſe it would not be Grace. God never oweth to us, in a ſtrick Sence, either Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to the Death, nor Eternal Life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of the Body: He is not ſo much as indebted to our Soul, to give her Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence after this Life; he might let her drop into her Nothing again, as it were, by her own Weight: Otherwiſe he ſhould not be free in reſpect to the Duration of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and it would become a neceſſary Being. But altho' God never owes any thing to us, in a ſtrict Sence, he hath been pleaſed to give us Rights grounded on his Promiſes, meerly free: By his Promiſes he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himſelf, as a Supream Bleſſedneſs, to a Soul faithful to him, and perſevere to be ſo.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49309:36"/>
It is then true in this ſenſe, that any ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition tending to the believing ones being excluded from Eternal life by Loving God, is impoſſible, becauſe God is faithful in his promiſes: He wills not the Death of the Sinner, but rather that he may live and be Converted. Thereby it is certain that all the Sacrifices which the moſt Diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Souls make uſually concerning their Eternal Bleſſedneſs are conditional. They ſay: my God, if by an impoſſibility thou wouldſt condemn me to the Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell without loſing thy Love, I ſhould not Love thee the leſs for it. But this Sacrifice cannot be abſolute in an ordinary ſtate. In no other caſe but of the laſt trials, this Sacrifice becometh in a manner abſolute. Then a Soul may be invincibly perſwaded with a reflex per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and which is not the intimate bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Conſcience, that ſhe is juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated by God. In this ſtate did S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> find himſelf in the Church of of S. <hi>Stephen des Grez.</hi> A Soul in this trouble finds herſelf contrary to God, in reſpect to her former infidelities, and by her preſent obduration. She takes her bad inclinations for a deliberate will, and ſees not the real acts of her Love and of her Virtues, which by reaſon of their ſimplicity do eſcape her reflections. She becomes in her own eyes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49309:37"/>
covered with the lepro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſie of Sin, though it is only in appearance and not real. She can not bear with her ſelf. She is offended with thoſe who are willing to quiet her and take away from her that kind of perſwaſion. It matters nothing to tell her of the preciſe Doctrine of Faith, in regard to the will of God of ſaving all Men, and the belief we ought to have, that he is willing to ſave every one of us in particular. This Soul does not doubt of the good will of God, but believeth her own bad, becauſe ſhe ſees nothing in her ſelf by reflection but the apparent evil which is external and ſenſible, and that the good which is always real and intimate, is by God's jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie continually taken from before her eyes Nothing in this involuntary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible trouble can recover her, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal to her in the bottom of her ſelf what God is pleaſed to conceal to her. She ſees God's Anger ſwoll'n and hanging over her head as the billows of the Sea, ready to drown her; then it is that the Soul is divided from her ſelf, ſhe expires with Chriſt upon the Croſs: ſaying, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> In that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary impreſſion of deſpair, ſhe makes an abſolute Sacrifice of her concern for Eternity, becauſe the impoſſible caſe in the trouble and darkneſs ſhe is in, ſeems to her
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49309:37"/>
poſſible and actually real. Once more it would profit nothing to argue with her, for ſhe is wholly incapable of reaſoning, all the buſineſs lies in a conviction which is not intimate, but ſeeming and invincible. A Soul in this condition, looſeth all hope of things for her own intereſt, but ſhe never looſeth in the ſuperiour part of her ſelf, that's to ſay, in her direct and intimate acts, that perfect hope which is the diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted deſire of the promiſes. She loves God more purely than ever, and is ſo far from conſenting poſitively to hate him, that ſhe does not ſo much as indirectly conſent to ceaſe for one inſtant from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, nor to diminiſh in the leaſt her Love, nor to put ever to the increaſe of that Love any voluntary bounds, nor to commit any fault, though never ſo venial. A Director may therefore leave this Soul to make a ſimple condeſcention to the loſs of her own intereſt, and to the juſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation ſhe thinks to be under from God, which ſerveth ordinarily but to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et her, and to becalm the Temptation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only for that effect; I mean for the purification of Love: But he ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver either to adviſe or to permit her poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to believe by a free and willful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that ſhe is reprobated and ought no longer to deſire the promiſes by a diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49309:38"/>
motive: He ought yet much leſs to conſent ſhe ſhould hate God, or ceaſe from loving him, or tranſgreſs his Law even by the moſt venial faults.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak thus, is to ſpeak according to the Experience of Saints, with all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution neceſſary for the Conſervation of the Doctrine of Faith, and never to lay open Souls to any Illuſion.</p>

The eſſential Difference
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49309:39"/>
between the new Law, and the old, is, that the latter did not lead Man to any thing that was perfect; that it ſhewed what was good, but gave not a Power wherewithal to do it, and Evil, without affording Means to avoid it; whereas the new is the Law of Grace, which gives both the Will and the Deed, and which commands only, becauſe it gives the true Power to fulfil. As the Obſervers of the old Law were aſſured, that they ſhould never ſee the diminution of their Temporal Goods: <hi>Inquirentes autem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num non minuentur omni bono.</hi> Souls that are true to their Grace, ſhall likewiſe never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any dimunition in their Grace, which is always preventing, and the real Good of the Chriſtian Law: Thus each Soul, that ſhe may be fully true to God, can do nothing ſolid and meritorious, but to follow Grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need of preventing it. To be willing to prevent it, is to be willing to give to one's ſelf, what it does not give yet; 'tis to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſomething of himſelf, and his own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, or Induſtry; 'tis a ſubtile, and unperceptible Remainder of a <hi>Semi-Pelagian</hi> Zeal, at the very time when we long yet for more Grace. One ought, 'tis true, to prepare himſelf, for to receive and invite Grace to himſelf; but this ought not to be done, without the Co-operation of Grace it ſelf. A faithful Co-operation with Grace,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49309:39"/>
in the preſent Moment, is a moſt effectual Preparation for receiving, and attracting of Grace the next Moment. If the thing be narrowly pried into, 'tis then evident, that all is reduc'd to a faithful Co operation of a full Will, and of all the Forces of the Soul, with the Grace of every Moment's preſenting. If all that could be added to this Co-operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were rightly taken in its full extent, it would be nothing but a raſh and over-haſty Zeal, an eager and unquiet En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, of a Self-intereſted Soul; an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Motion that would diſcompoſe, weaken, and retard the Operation of Grace, inſtead of making it both more eaſie and perfect: 'Tis even, as if one who is led by another, whoſe Impulſes he ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſhould inceſſantly prevent his Motions, and at every Minute turn himſelf back, to meaſure that Space he had already run: This unquiet, and ill concerted Motion, with the Man that principally moves, would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cumber, and retard the Courſe of them both: 'Tis even ſo with a juſt Man in the Hand of God, who moveth him without diſcontinuation with his Grace. All ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and unquiet Excitation fore-running Grace, for fear of not acting enough; all eager excitation, except in caſe of Command, for to give to one's ſelf, by an exceſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Precaution, thoſe Diſpoſitions, which

Grace does not inſpire with in thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe it inſpires with others leſs comfortable, and perceptible; all haſty and unquiet exciting, for to give to one ſelf, by obſervable excitation, a more perceptible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and whereof one may be able to bear to himſelf immediately a more intereſted Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are defective Motions, for Souls called to a peaceable Diſintereſt of perfect Love. This unquiet, and fore-running Acting, is what good Myſticks have called Activity, which hath nothing in common with the Action, and real, but peaceable Acts, that are eſſential to co-operate with Grace. When they ſay, that one ought no more to excite himſelf, nor ſtrive, they mean only to remove that unquiet and haſty Excitation, whereby one would go before Grace, or recal the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Impreſſions of it, after they are paſt, or co-operate with it, in a more ſenſible and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted manner than is required of us. In this Sence, Excitation or Activity, ought effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to be cut off: But if by Excitation ſhould be meant, a Co-operation of the full Will, and of all the Powers of the Soul, to the Grace of each Moment; it ought to be concluded, that it is by way of Faith, that one ought to excite himſelf every Moment, to fill up all his Grace. This Co-operation is no leſs ſincere for being diſintereſted; and for being peaceable, it is no leſs efficacious,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49309:41"/>
and the Product of the entire Will: For being without precipitation, it is no leſs painful, in relation to Concupiſence, which it overcomes. It is not an Activity, but an Action, which conſiſts in very real and meritorious Acts. Thus it is, that Souls called to pure Love, reſiſt the Temptations of the greateſt Trials: They fight, even to the Blood, againſt Sin; but it is a peaceable Combat, becauſe the Spirit of the Lord ſavors of Peace: they reſiſt in the Preſence of God, who is their Strength. They reſiſt in a State of Faith and Love, which is a State of Prayer. Thoſe who have yet need of the intereſted Motives of Fear and Hope, ought to take hold of them, even with a natural eagerneſs, rather than to expoſe themſelves to be overcome. Thoſe who find by a repeated Experience, and known to good Directors, that their Strength lies in an amorous Silence, and their Peace in the greateſt Bitterneſs, may continue thus to overcome Temptation; and they muſt not be diſturb'd, for they are pained already enough another way: But ſhould theſe Souls by a ſecret Infidelity, come ſecretly to fall from their State, they ſhould be oblig'd to have their recourſe to the moſt intereſted Motives, rather than expoſe themſelves to violate the Law, in the exceſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>

               <p>SOuls attracted to pure Love may be as diſintereſted in reſpect to themſelves as to their Neighbours, becauſe they never ſee or deſire more in themſelves than in the moſt unknown neighbour, but the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, his good pleaſure, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his promiſes. In this ſenſe, theſe Souls are as it were ſtrangers to themſelves; and they Love themſelves no farther, but as they do the reſt of other Creatures within the Order of pure Charity. After this wiſe, would Innocent <hi>Adam</hi> have Loved himſelf only for God's ſake. Self abnegation, and the hating of our Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in the Goſpel, are not an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute hatred of our Souls, which are God's I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: For the Work of God is good, and we ought to Love it for his ſake: But we do ſpoil that work by Sin, and we ought to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49309:43"/>
hate our ſelves in our corruption. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of pure Love conſiſteth then in not loving our ſelves any further, but for God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. The vigilancy of the moſt diſintereſted Souls ought never to be regulated according to their diſintereſt: God who calls them to be as freed from themſelves as from their Neighbour, will have them at the ſame time more watchful over themſelves whom they are intruſted with, and for whom they are reſponſible, than over their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour whom God hath committed to their charge. They ought even to watch over what they do every day to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whom Providence hath intruſted to their direction and conduct. A good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor watcheth over the Soul of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour without any intereſt. He Loves in him nothing but God: He hath him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of ſight: He comforteth, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, and ſupports him. Thus ought we to bear up our ſelves without flattery, and correct our ſelves without diſcouragement. We ought to converſe charitably with our ſelves as with another, and not to forget our ſelves but by cutting off the tickliſhneſs and niceneſs of ſelf-love; not to forget ones ſelf at all, but in pulling down all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and intereſted reflections when we are intirely in the grace of pure love. But it is never lawful to forget ones ſelf
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49309:43"/>
ſo as to ceaſe watching over our ſelves, after the ſame manner we would watch over our Neighbour if we were Paſtors. We ought even to add this further, that one is not ſo ſtrictly charged with the care of his Neighbour as with himſelf, becauſe it is not in our power to regulate the internal wills of others as 'tis of our own. Whence it follows, that one ought always to watch, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more over himſelf than the beſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor can over his flock. We ought never to forget our ſelves by aboliſhing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections that are even moſt intereſted, when we are yet in the way of intereſted Love. Laſtly, we ought not to forget our ſelves ſo as to reject all ſorts of reflections as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect things: For reflections have nothing imperfect in themſelves, and don't become ſo often hurtful to ſo many Souls, but becauſe Souls ſick of ſelf-love turn very ſeldom an eye upon themſelves, but they do grow impatient and are ſoftened at that ſight. Moreover, God inſpires often by his grace the moſt improved Souls with reflections very profitable either in reſpect to his deſigns in them, or upon his former mercies which he makes them to celebrate, or their diſpoſitions whereof they are to give an account to their Director. But fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, diſintereſted love watcheth acts, and reſiſts Temptation more yet than intereſted
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49309:44"/>
Love doth. The only difference is, that the watchfulneſs of pure Love is ſimple and peaceable, whereas that of intereſted Love, which is leſs perfect, keeps ſtill ſome remains of eagerneſs and trouble, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but perfect Love driveth out fear with its attendance.</p>
               <p>To Speak thus, is to Speak in a very correct manner, which ought to be ſuſpected by no body, and is conformable to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Saints.</p>

               <p>A Soul fully diſintereſted in her ſelf, does not love her ſelf even for God's ſake. She hateth her ſelf with an abſolute hatred, as ſuppoſing the work of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator not to be good, and ſhe carries thus far her abnegation and renounciation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the hatred to her ſelf, even ſo far as to will deliberately her loſs, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reprobation. She rejects grace and mercy; wills nothing but juſtice and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. She becometh ſo great a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to her ſelf, that ſhe ceaſeth to take any further concern either for the good that is to be done, or the evil to be eſchewed. All her deſire is to forget her ſelf in every thing, and looſe continually the ſight of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49309:44"/>
her ſelf. She is not ſatisfied to forget her ſelf in reſpect to her own intereſt: She is willing moreover to forget her ſelf, in relation to the amendment of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and to the fulfilling of the Law of God, for the intereſt of his pure glory. She reckons no longer upon her being entruſted with her ſelf, nor upon watching even with a ſimple, peaceable, and diſintereſted vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy over her own will. She rejecteth all reflection as imperfect, becauſe nothing but meerly direct and not reflex ſights are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God.</p>
               <p>To Speak at this rate, is to oppoſe the experiences of Saints, whoſe moſt internal Life hath been fill'd with very profitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections made by the impreſſion of grace; ſince they have afterward come to know the graces paſt, and the miſeries from which God hath delivered them, that at length they have given an account of a very great number of things that had happened in them. This is to turn the abnegation of ones ſelf into an impious hatred of our Soul, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes her to be bad by nature, according to the principle of the <hi>Manicheans,</hi> or which overturns the order, in hating what is good, and what God loves as being his image. This is to annihilate all watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all fidelity to grace, all attention to make God reign in us, all good uſage of

               <p>THere is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſimple and direct acts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex acts. Whenſoever we act with a right Conſcience, there is in us an inward cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that we go right; or elſe we ſhould act in a doubt, whither we do well or ill, and ſo ſhould not practiſe a downright dealing. But this inward certainty conſiſts often in acts ſo ſimple, ſo direct, ſo rapid, ſo momentanous, ſo free from all reflection, that the Soul who knows well that ſhe makes them in that moment that ſhe makes them, does not find afterwards any diſtinct, and durable ſign of them. Hence it comes that when ſhe will return by reflection to what ſhe hath done, ſhe doth not think ſhe hath done what ſhe ought, ſhe diſturbs her ſelf by ſcruples, and is even offended at the indulgence of her ſuperiours, when they go about to quiet her in reſpect to what is paſt: So God giveth her at the inſtant of the action, by direct acts, all the neceſſary certainty for the rectitude of her Conſcience; and he takes away from her in his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49309:45"/>
the facility of finding again by way of reflection, and an after-blow that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and rectitude: ſo that ſhe cannot enjoy it to her comfort, nor juſtifie her ſelf in her own eyes. As for reflex acts, they leave behind them a laſting and ſteady Foot-ſtep, which is found again when we pleaſe, and this is the reaſon why Souls yet intereſted for themſelves be willing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly to form acts that are ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed and reflected, to make themſelves ſure of their operation, and bear witneſs of it to themſelves: Whereas, diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls are of themſelves indifferent to perform acts diſtinct or indiſtinct, direct or reflex: They make reflex ones whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver either any Precept may require it, or the power of grace carries them to it; but they don't look for reflex acts with prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to others by a trouble ariſing from a concern for their own ſecurity. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the extremity of Tryals, God leaves nothing to them but direct acts, of which afterwards they cannot perceive any Foot-ſtep; and this cauſeth the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Souls, while any motive of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſt remaineth yet in them. Theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and intimate acts without reflection imprinting any ſenſible Foot-ſtep, are that which S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> hath called the Top of the Soul or Edge of the Spirit. In
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49309:46"/>
theſe acts it was that S. <hi>Anthony</hi> did repoſe the moſt perfect Prayer, when he ſaid, <hi>Prayer is not yet perfect, when the ſolitary knows that be makes a Prayer,</hi> (Caſſian. conf. 9.)</p>
               <p>To Speak thus, is to Speak conformable to the Experience of Saints, without excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſtrictneſs of Catholick Doctrine. It is alſo to Speak of the operations of the Soul, in conformity to the ideas of all good Philoſophers.</p>

               <p>IN the laſt Tryals for the purification of Love, a ſeparation is made of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior part of the Soul from the inferiour; in that the ſenſes and imagination have no part of the peace and of the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Grace, which God makes often enough both to the underſtanding and to the will, in a ſimple and direct manner, which eſcapeth all reflection. After this manner, Chriſt Jeſus our perfect pattern, hath been happy upon the Croſs, ſo that in the ſuperior part of his Soul he enjoyed Coeleſtial Glory, while in the inferiour, he was actually a Man of Grief, with a ſenſible impreſſion upon him of his being forſaken by his Father. The inferiour part did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to the ſuperiour her involuntary trouble, nor her painful ſwoundings. The ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our communicated to the inferiour neither her peace nor her bleſſedneſs. This ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is made by the difference of the real, but ſimple and direct acts of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and of the will, who leaving
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49309:47"/>
behind them no ſenſible ſign, and of the reflex Acts, which leaving a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mark behind them, are communicated to the imagination and to the ſenſes, which are called the inferiour part, for to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from that direct and intimate operation of the underſtanding and of the will, called the ſuperiour part. The acts of the inferiour part in this ſeparation, conſiſt of an entirely blind and unvolun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary trouble, becauſe all that is intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and voluntary belongs to the ſuperiour part. But although this ſeparation taken in this ſenſe cannot be abſolutely denied, the Directors nevertheleſs ought to take great care never to ſuffer in the inferiour part, any of thoſe Diſorders, which are in a natural courſe to be always deemed voluntary, and for which the ſuperiour part ought conſequently to be accountable. This precaution ought always to be found in the way of pure Faith, which is the only one we can Speak of, and in which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to the order of nature is admitted. 'Tis needleſs, for this Reaſon, to Speak here of diabolical poſſeſſions, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, or other extraordinary things: One cannot abſolutely reject them, ſince both the Scripture and the Church have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged them: But in particular caſes, the greateſt caution ought to be uſed for to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49309:47"/>
being deceived. Moreover, this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is common to all internal ways, hath no particular difficulty to be cleared in it by the way of pure Faith and of pure Love. On the contrary, it may be aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that this way of pure Love and of pure Faith, is that wherein fewer of theſe extraordinary things are to be ſeen: Nothing diminiſheth them ſo much, as not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and carrying always the Souls to a Conduct that is ſimple in the diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Love, and in the obſcurity of Faith.</p>

               <p>THE perſons who are in thoſe rigorous Tryals ought never to neglect that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſobriety, ſo often ſpoken of by the Apoſtles, and which conſiſts in a ſober uſe of all the things that are round about us. This Sobriety reacheth to all the operations of ſenſe, of the imagination, and even of the Spirit: It makes our Wiſdom Sober and Temperate: It reduceth all to a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple uſe of neceſſary things. This Sobriety implies a continual privation of all the enjoyments that are only for ſatisfaction and pleaſure. This Mortification, or rather this Death, tends to cut off not only all the voluntary motions of nature, corrupted and revolted through the voluptuouſneſs of the Fleſh, and the pride of the Spirit; but alſo all the moſt innocent Conſolations, which intereſted Love does ſeek with ſo much eagerneſs. This Mortification is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed with peace and ſimplicity, without diſcompoſure of mind and ſourneſs againſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49309:48"/>
ones ſelf, without method ſuitable to ones occaſions and needs, but in a real manner, and without intermiſſion. 'Tis true, that ſome perſons oppreſſed by exceſſive Tryals, are ordinarily oblig'd by their Obedience to an Experienced Director, to forbear or leſſen certain Corporal Auſterities they have been much addicted to. This Temperature is neceſſary for the Relief of their Body, ſinking under the Rigor of internal Pains, which is the moſt terrible of all Penances. It happens alſo, often, that theſe Souls have been too much in love with theſe Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the Repugnancy they felt at firſt to obey, in leaving them off in this State of Oppreſſion, ſhews, that they ſtuck a little too faſt to them: But it is their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Imperfection, and not that of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities, that deſerves the blame: Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties anſwerable to their Inſtitution, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and often neceſſary: Chriſt hath given us the Pattern of them, which all Saints have followed: They bring our revolted Fleſh under; they tend to the Amendment of committed Faults, and do preſerve from Temptations: 'Tis true indeed, that they don't ſerve to deſtroy the Bottom of Self-love, or Cupidity, but by ſo much as they are animated by the Spirit of Recollection, Love, and Prayer: For want of which they would quench the groſſer Paſſions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49309:49"/>
to their Inſtitution, make a Man full of himſelf; this would be nothing elſe, but a Juſtifying of the Fleſh. It is moreover to be obſerved, that the Perſons that are in this State, being deprived of all ſenſible Graces, and from the fervent Exerciſe of all diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vertues, have no longer any reliſh, nor ſenſible fervency, nor noted attraction, for all the Auſterities they had practiſed before, with ſo much Ardor. Then it is, that their Penance is reduc'd to bear, in a very bitter Peace, the Anger of God, which they look for every Moment, and their manifeſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. There is no Auſterity, or Torment, which they would not ſuffer with Joy, and Eaſe, in the room of this inward Pain; all their inmoſt Attractiveneſs is to bear their Agony, in which they ſay upon the Croſs, with Chriſt, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſpeak thus, is to acknowledge the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual neceſſity of Mortification: It is to Authoriſe Corporal Auſterities, which by their Inſtitution are very wholeſome: 'Tis to be willing, that the moſt perfect Souls ſhould do Penance, proportionable to the Strength, Graces, and Tryals of their State.</p>

               <p>THere are two Kinds of Proprieties: The firſt is a ſin for all Chriſtians: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is not ſo much as a Venial Sin; but only an Imperfection, in compariſon with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49309:50"/>
fomething that is more perfect; nay, it is not even an Imperfection, but for thoſe Souls that are actually attracted by Grace, to the perfect Diſintereſt of Love. The firſt Property is Pride: It is a Love of Self-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, as 'tis one's own, and without any ſubordination to our eſſential End, which is the Glory of God: This Property was the Sin of the firſt Angel, who reſted in himſelf, as ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> inſtead of refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf to God, and by that ſimple Appropriation of himſelf, he did not remain in the Truth: This Property is in us a Sin, leſſer, or greater, according as it is leſs, or more voluntary. The ſecond Property, which we ought never to confound with the firſt, is a Love of our own Excellency, as it is our own, but with ſubordination to our eſſential End, the Glory of God. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to havenone but the moſt excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; we will have them chiefly for the Glory of God, but we will have them alſo for our Merit, and for the Reward that does attend them. Moreover, we deſire them for the very Comfort of becoming perfect: It is a Reſignation, which, as S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hath yet Self-deſires, but they are ſubjected.</hi> Thoſe Vertues that are intereſted for our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and Happineſs, are good, becauſe they refer themſelves to God, as our principal End: But they are inferiour, in Perfection,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49309:50"/>
to the Vertues exercis'd by holy Indifference, and for the Glory of God alone in us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Motive of Self-Intereſt, either for our Merit, or for our Perfection, or for our Eternal Reward. This Motive of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Intereſt, which remains always in the Vertues, while the Soul remains poſſeſſed with intereſted Love, is that which Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writers have called Propriety. It is that which the bleſſed <hi>John of the Croſs</hi> calls Avarice, and Spiritual Pride. The Soul, whom they call the <hi>Proprietary One,</hi> refers her Vertues to God, by holy Reſignation, and in this is leſs perfect, than the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted Soul, which refers her to God, by holy Indifference. This Property which is not a Sin, is nevertheleſs, by Myſtical Men, called an Impurity; not as if it were a Spot in the Soul, but to expreſs that it is a mixture of divers Motives, hindring Love from being pure, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture. They often ſay, that they find this impurity, or mixture of intereſted Motives, in their Prayer, and moſt holy Exerciſes: But we ought to take heed, leaſt we think that they mean then to ſpeak of any vicious impurity.</p>
               <p>When it is clearly underſtood, what My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Men mean by Property, 'tis no hard matter to underſtand what is meant by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appropriation, 'tis the Operation of Grace,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49309:51"/>
purifying Love, and making it diſintereſted in the Practice of all Vertues. 'Tis by means of Trials, this Diſappropriation is made; it loſeth therein, as myſtical Perſons do ſay, all Vertues: But this loſs is but ſeemingly ſo, and for a limited time. The Foundations of Vertues are ſo far from being really loſt, that they are rather purified by pure Love; the Soul is there ſtript from all ſenſible Graces, from all Reliſhes, from all Eaſineſs, and from all Fervency, which might both comfort and hearten her; ſhe loſeth thoſe Methodical Acts, and ſuch as are excited with Eagerneſs, for to render to herſelf an intereſted Teſtimony, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Perfection; but ſhe loſeth neither the direct Acts of Love, nor the Exerciſe of diſtinct Vertues, in caſe of a Command, nor the near hatred of Evil, nor the momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Certainty of Evil, neceſſary for the rectitude of Conſcience, nor the diſintereſted Deſire of the Effect of the Promiſes in her: the appearance alone of her Demerit, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to take from her all diſcernable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and to leave no other Shift for Self-Intereſt: Why then ſhould any real Evil be added to it, as if God could not make his Creature perfect, but by a real Sin? On the contrary, the Soul, if ſo be ſhe is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in thoſe Trials called Loſs and Diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation, ſuffereth no real diminution of her
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49309:51"/>
Perfection, but groweth ſtill more and more in the inward Life; in fine, aSoul who pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies herſelf in the Experience of her daily Faults, by hating her Imperfection, becauſe contrary to God, loves nevertheleſs the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection coming to her by it; becauſe this Abjection is ſo far from being a Sin, that it is, on the contrary, that Humiliation which is the Penance and Remedy of Sin itſelf: She hates ſincerely all her Faults, by how much ſhe loves God in the utmoſt Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but ſhe makes uſe of her Faults to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble herſelf peaceably, and thereby <hi>her Faults become the Windows of the Soul, through which God's Light doth enter;</hi> according to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Balthazar Alvarez. (In his Life,</hi> C. 13.)</p>
               <p>To ſpeak thus, is to unfold the true Sence of the beſt myſtical Men; it is to follow a plain Syſtem, which is reduced only to the Diſintereſt of Love, which is Authoriſed by the Tradition of all Ages.</p>

               <p>THE Myſtical Property, which is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Love, is a real Impurity; it is a Contamination of the Soul: The Vertues of this State are not meritorious; one muſt really loſe the very Depths of his Vertues; one muſt ceaſe to produce even the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and direct Acts of them; one muſt really loſe the Hatred of Sin, the Love of God, the diſtinct Vertues of his State, in the Caſe of a Command; one ought to loſe really the momentaneous Certainty that is neceſſary for the Rectitude of Conſcience; nay, alſo the diſintereſted Deſire of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Promiſes in us. We ought to love our Abjection in ſuch a manner, that we may love truly our very Sin, becauſe it renders us Abjects, and contrary to God.

               <p>THere is but a ſmall Number of Souls, who are in theſe laſt Trials, wherein they make an end of purifying themſelves from all Self-intereſt. All other Souls, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out undergoing theſe Trials, do yet arrive at ſeveral Degrees of Holineſs, that is very real, and pleaſing to God: Otherwiſe one would reduce intereſted Love to a Judaical Worſhip, or ſuch as is unſufficient to eternal Life, againſt the Deciſion of the holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent.</hi> The Director ought not to be eaſily induced to ſuppoſe, that thoſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations in which he finds the Soul to be, are extraordinary Temptations. One cannot be too miſtruſtful, of an heated Imagination, and that exaggerates all that ſhe feels, or thinks to feel. One ought to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49309:53"/>
diſtruſt a ſubtile, and almoſt unperceptible Pride, which tends always to flatter one ſelf, with being a Soul extraordinarily led. Laſtly, we ought to diſtruſt illuſion, which creeps in and makes one that after having begun by the Spirit with a Sincere Ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to end in the Fleſh: His chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern therefore ſhould be, to ſuppoſe at the very firſt, that the Temptations of a Soul are nothing elſe but common Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Remedy whereof is both internal and external Mortification, with all the acts of fear, and the practiſing of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Love. One ought even to ſtand faſt in admitting nothing beyond this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an entire conviction, that theſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are abſolutely unprofitable, and that the ſole exerciſe both ſimple and peaceable of pure Love does better quell the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Upon this occaſion it is that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and the danger of wandrings are in the extream. When an unexperienced or too credulous Director ſuppoſeth a common Temptation, to be an extraordinary one, for the purifying of Love, he is the ruine of a Soul, he fills her with her ſelf, and caſteth her into an incurable and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able indolency of Vice. To leave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rereſted Motives when we have need of them, it is to take from a Child the Milk of his Nurſe, and to deprive him cruelly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49309:53"/>
of his Life, by weaning him out of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Souls who are very imperfect yet and full of themſelves, do often fancy upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet readings, and ſuch as are diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their circumſtances, that they are in the moſt rigorous Tryals of pure Love, while they are yet only in ſuch Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are very natural, which they draw on themſelves by a lazy wandering and ſenſual Life. The Tryals we Speak of here, are only the Portion of Souls already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, both in outward and inward Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, who have learn'd nothing by premature Readings, but by the ſole Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Gods Conduct towards them, who breath nothing but Candor and Docili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who are always ready to think that they are deceived; and ought to enter upon the common way again: Theſe Souls do not recover their peace in the midſt of their Temptations, by any of the ordinary helps, at leaſt while they are held with the Grace of pure Love. Nothing but a faithful co-operation with the Grace of this pure Love can becalm their Temptations, and thereby their Tryals are diſtinguiſhed from the common ones: The Souls that are not in this ſtate, ſhall infallibly fall into horrid exceſſes, if you go about to blame them contrary to their neceſſities in the ſimple acts of pure Love, and thoſe who
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49309:54"/>
were under the Attractive Power of pure Love, ſhall never be pacified by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practices of intereſted Love. Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſiſted God and had Peace? But to make a true Judgment of Souls that are ſo nice, and under ſuch important circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Spirits ought to be tried to know whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they come from God or no.</p>
               <p>To Speak thus, is to Speak with all the neceſſary precaution in a matter where our care cannot be too great, and it is at the ſame time to admit all the Maxims of the Saints.</p>

               <p>THe Simple, Peaceable, and uniform ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of pure love is the only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that one ought to employ againſt the Temptations incident to every condition.

               <p>THe Will of God is always our only rule, and Love is wholly reduced to a Will, willing of nothing elſe but what God himſelf Wills, and makes the Soul to Will. But there are ſeveral ſorts of Wills in God, <hi>viz.</hi> his poſitive and written Will, which commands what is good, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits what is evil. This is the only inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable rule of our Wills, and of all our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Actions. There is the Will of God which is manifeſted to us by the inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or attraction of that Grace which is in all Juſt Men. This Will of God muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ſuppos'd to be entirely conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the written Will, and it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to believe, that it can exact of us any other thing but the faithful accompliſhing of the Precepts and Counſels comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Law. The Third Will of God, is, a Will of ſimple permiſſion, and is that which ſuffers Sin without approving of it. The ſame Will which permitteth it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it: It does not poſitively permit it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:49309:55"/>
but only by giving way to the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and not hindring it: This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive Will is never our Rule. It would be an impiety to will our Sin, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that God willeth it permiſſively. 1. It is falſe that God willeth it. 'Tis true, only that he hath not a poſitive Will to hinder it. 2. At the ſame time that he hath not a poſitive Will to hinder it, he hath an actual and poſitive Will to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and to puniſh it, as being eſſentially contrary to his immutable holineſs to which he oweth all. 3. One ought never to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God's allowance of Sin, but that after it is unfortunately committed, and when it cannot be help'd, that what is done ſhould be not done: Then we ought to conform our ſelves at one and the ſame time to the two Wills of God: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the one, we are to condemn and puniſh that which he condemns and would puniſh, and according to the other, we ought to will the confuſion and abjection of our ſelves, which is not a Sin, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Penance and remedy of Sin it ſelf; becauſe this wholſome confuſion, and this abjection which carries in it ſelf all the bitterneſs of a potion, is a real good which God hath been poſitively willing to draw from Sin, though he never poſitively wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Sin it ſelf. This is to love the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49309:55"/>
that is drawn from Poyſon, without loving Poyſon.</p>

               <p>WE ought to conform our ſelves to all the Wills of God, and to his permiſſions as to all his other Wills: We ought therefore to permit Sin in our ſelves, when we know God is about to permit it. We ought to love our Sin though contrary to God, by reaſon of its abjection, which purifies our love, and takes from us all pretence and deſert of a reward.

               <p>VOcal, without Mental Prayer, that's to ſay, without the attention of the Mind, and the Affection of the Heart, is a Superſtitious Worſhip, which honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God with the Lips while the Heart is far from him. Vocal Prayer, is not good and meritorious, but in as much as it is directed and animated by that of the Heart: It is much better to recite but a few Words, with great recollection and Love, than long Prayers, with little or no recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, when they are not Commanded. To Pray both without attention and Love, is to Pray as the Heathens did, who thought to be heard for the Multitude of their Words. One Prays no further than one deſires, and one doth not deſire but by how much one loveth at leaſt with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Love. Nevertheleſs, Vocal Prayer ought to be reſpected and conſulted, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to awake the Thoughts and the Affections which it expreſſes, as having been taught by the Son of God to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and practiſed by the whole Church in all Ages. To make light of this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Praiſes, this fruit of the Lips that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49309:56"/>
does confeſs the Name of the Lord, would be an impiety. Vocal Prayer may be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome for a while, to thoſe Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Souls who are yet in the imperfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of their Contemplation, becauſe their Contemplation is more ſenſible and affecting than pure and quiet. It may be alſo burthenſome to Souls who are in the laſt Tryals, becauſe every thing in that ſtate diſturbs them: But one ought never to give them for a rule, to forſake without the permiſſion of the Church, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a true impotency known to be ſo by their Superiours, any Vocal Prayer which is obligatory. Vocal Prayer taken with ſimplicity, and without ſcruple, when it is according to the Command, may well be troubleſome to a Soul, in relation to thoſe things we have already noted: But it is never contrary to the higheſt Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Experience even ſhews that the moſt Eminent Souls in the midſt of their moſt ſublime Communications, have familiar Communications with God, and that they read or recite with a loud Voice, and in a kind of Tranſport, ſome inflamed Words of the Apoſtles and Prophets.</p>

Nothing cauſeth ſo much illuſion in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Life, as the indiſcreet chooſing of Books.

               <p>WE ought to diſtinguiſh between Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Contemplation: Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſiſts in diſcurſive acts that can be eaſily diſtinguiſhed, the one from the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are diſtinguiſhed by a kind of a noted motion; becauſe they are varied by the diverſity of Objects they are applied to; becauſe they draw a conviction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth of the conviction of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth already known; becauſe they draw an affection from ſeveral Motives
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49309:59"/>
methodically aſſembled: Laſtly, becauſe they are done and reiterated with a refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that leaves behind it diſtinct Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps in the Brain. This Compoſition of diſcurſive and reflex acts, is proper for the exerciſe of intereſted Love, by reaſon that this imperfect Love which does not drive out fear, hath need of two things: One is to recall often all the intereſted Motives of fear and hope: The other, to make ones ſelf ſure of its operation, by acts well marked and well reflected: So diſcurſive Meditation is an exerciſe agreeable to this Love, that is mixt with intereſt. Fearful and intereſted Love could never be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with forming ſimple acts in Prayer, without any variety of intereſted Motives: It could never be ſatisfied with doing acts whereof it ſhould never render any wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it ſelf. On the contrary, Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation is according to all the moſt Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Divines, and the moſt Experienced Contemplative Saints, the exerciſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love: It conſiſts in acts ſo ſimple, ſo direct, ſo peaceable, ſo uniform, that they have no characters whereby a Soul may diſtinguiſh them. It is the perfect Prayer whereof S. <hi>Anthony</hi> ſpoke, and which is not perceived by the ſolitary himſelf who makes it. Contemplation, is equally authoriz'd by the Ancient Fathers, the School Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49309:59"/>
and by holy myſtical Men: It is termed a ſimple and amorous Sight, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from Meditation, which is full of methodical and diſcurſive Acts. When the Habit of Faith is ſtrong, when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by pure Love, the Soul who does love God no more, but for himſelf, hath no further need to ſeek for, nor to gather intereſted Motives upon each Vertue, for her own Intereſt: Rational Diſcourſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of helping her, is but Trouble and Labour to her; ſhe is all for Love, and finds the Motive of all Vertues in it, there being no more for her to do, but one neceſſary thing: 'Tis in this pure Contemplation that one may ſay with S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales: Love must needs be very powerful, ſince it ſtands by itſelf, without the Support of any Pleaſure, or of any Pretenſion.</hi> (Love of God, <hi>L.</hi> 9. <hi>C.</hi> 21.)</p>
               <p>Affecting and diſcurſive Meditation, tho' leſs perfect, than pure and direct Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, is nevertheleſs an Exerciſe very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, and very neceſſary to the greateſt part of good Souls: It is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Foundation of the Interior Life, and the Exerciſe of Love for all juſt Men, who are not arrived yet, at what we call perfect Diſintereſt.</p>

               <p>DIſcurſive Meditation is not convenient for thoſe Souls whom God draws actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally into Contemplation, by the three Tokens above related, and who would not return to the diſcurſive Acts, but out of a ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Temper, and with a deſire to ſeek their own Intereſt, againſt the actual attraction of their Grace.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak thus, is to ſpeak as the bleſſed <hi>John of the Croſs,</hi> (in the lively Flame of Love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.) who only in theſe ſtrict Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances calls Meditation, <hi>a low Means,</hi> and <hi>dirty Means:</hi> 'Tis to ſpeak, as all myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Saints have done, that have been Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis'd, or Approved by the whole Church, after the moſt rigorous Examination.</p>

               <p>THere is a State of Contemplation ſo high, and ſo perfect, that it becomes habitual, inſomuch, that at any time when a Soul puts herſelf to actual Prayer, her Prayer is contemplative, and not diſcurſive: Then ſhe hath no need to return to Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor to her Methodical Acts. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, if it ſhould happen againſt both the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49309:62"/>
ordinary Courſe of Grace, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experience of Saints, that this habitual Contemplation ſhould abſolutely ceaſe, one ought always to ſupply the deficiency of it, by the Acts of diſcurſive Meditation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Chriſtian Soul ought never to remain really in Emptineſs and Idleneſs. One ought even to ſuppoſe, that a Soul that ſhould fall from ſo high a Contemplation, could not do ſo, but by ſome ſecret Infidelity: For the Gifts of God, on his part, are never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of; he forſakes none but thoſe by whom he is forſaken, and never diminiſhes his Graces, but to thoſe who diminiſh their Co-operation: 'Tis our only Buſineſs, to perſwade that Soul, that it is not God who fails her, but that it muſt needs be ſhe herſelf that hath fail'd God. A Soul of this Rank might alſo be put again into Meditation by the Order of a Director, who was minded to try her; but then ſhe ought by the Rule both of holy Indifferencè, and of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to be as contented to mediate, as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners do, as to contemplate with the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak ſo, is to follow the Spirit of the Church, and to prevent all Dangers of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. 'Tis to ſpeak as the greateſt Saints, whoſe Books have been, I may ſay ſo, as well Canoniſed as their Perſons.</p>

               <p>THere is in this Life an habitual State, but not wholly invariable, in which the moſt perfect Souls do all their free Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Preſence God, and for his ſake, according to the Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let all your Works be done in Charity.</hi> And again, <hi>Whether you eat or drink, or do any thing elſe, let it be done for the Glory of God.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring all our free Actions, to our only End, is that perpetual Prayer recommended by Chriſt, when he will have our Prayer

to be without ceaſing; and by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Pray without intermiſſion:</hi> But this Prayer ought never to be confounded with pure and direct Contemplation; or taken, as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpeaks, in the moſt perfect Acts. That Prayer which conſiſts in a referring to God all our Actions, may be perpetual in one Sence; that's to ſay, it may laſt as long as our free Acts. In this Caſe it is never interrupted, but by Sleep, and the other Deficiencies of Nature, which make all free and meritorious Acts to ceaſe. But pure and direct Contemplation hath not even this kind of Perpetuity; becauſe it is often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Acts of diſtinct Vertues ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to all Chriſtians, and which are not Acts of pure and direct Contemplation.</p>

               <p>PUre and direct Contemplation, is in ſome Souls abſolutely perpetual; Sleep itſelf does not interrupt it; it conſiſteth in a ſimple and ſingular Act, which is perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, which hath no need of ever being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated, and ſubſiſts always by itſelf, unleſs recalled by a contrary Act.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak at this rate, is to deny the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage of this Life, the natural Swoundings of the Soul, and the State of Sleep, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Acts are no longer, either free or meritorious: 'Tis at the ſame time to give way to a contemplative Soul, to diſpenſe with thoſe neceſſary Vertues of her State, which are not Acts of pure and direct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation: It is to be ignorant, that every Act, both of the Underſtanding, and of the Will, is eſſentially tranſitory; this is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Men in loving God, during ten Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make ten ſucceſſive Acts of Love, one of which is not the other; one whereof ſhould never follow the other; one of which is ſo paſt, that nothing remains of it, when the other that was not, begins to be.

The ſame Exerciſe of Love, which is called Contemplation, or Quietneſs, where it remains in its general Scope, and is not applied to any particular Function, becometh each diſtinct vertue, according as it is applied to particular Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: For it is the Object, as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpeaks, which ſpecifieth all Vertues: But pure and peaceable Love, remains always the ſame, as to the Motive in all theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Specifications.</p>

               <p>PUre and direct Contemplation is nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, becauſe it is never voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about any ſenſible Image, any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and namable Idea, as S. <hi>Dioniſius</hi> ſpeaks; that's to ſay, about any particular and limited Idea, relating to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but that it paſſeth over all that is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and diſtinct; that's to ſay, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, and limited, to ſtop only in the Idea that is purely intellectual, and abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Being which is without limits
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49309:65"/>
and reſtriction. This Idea, tho' very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, from all that can be imagined and comprehended, is, however, very poſitive and real. The ſimplicity of this purely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Idea, and which hath not paſſed through the Senſes, and by the Imagination, does not hinder, but Contemplation may have for diſtinct Objects, all the Attributes of God; for the Eſſence, without the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, would be no longer the Eſſence it ſelf, and the Idea of an infinitely perfect Being, eſſentially comprehends in its ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, the infinite Perfections of that Being. This ſimplicity, does not hinder the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Soul to Contemplate even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the Three Divine Perſons, becauſe an Idea let it be never ſo ſimple, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, repreſent divers Objects really diſtinguiſhed one from the others. Finally, this ſimplicity does not exclude the diſtinct ſight of the Humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, and of all his Myſteries, becauſe pure Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation admits of other Ideas with that of the Divinity: It admits of all the Objects which pure Faith can ſet before us: It excludes nothing in Divine things but ſenſible Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Diſcurſive Operations. Though the Acts tending directly and immediately to God alone, be more perfect, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the part of the Object, and in a Philoſophical ſtrictneſs; they are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49309:66"/>
as perfect on the part of the pinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that's to ſay, as pure, and as meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when they have for Objects the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects offered by God himſelf, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with one is converſant, only by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his Grace. A Soul in this ſtate, conſidereth no longer the Myſteries of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by a Methodical and ſenſible working of the imagination, to imprint ſigns of it upon the Brains, and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably ſoftened by them: She is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Converſant about it, by a Diſcurſive Operation, and ſucceſſive Reaſoning, to draw concluſions from each Myſtery: But ſhe ſees with a ſimple and Amorous ſight, all the diverſe Objects as certified and made preſent by pure Faith. Thus the Soul can exerciſe in the higheſt Contemplation Acts of the moſt explicite Faith. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Bleſſed in Heaven being purely intellectual, hath for diſtinct Objects all theſe Myſteries of the Humanity of our Saviour, whoſe Graces and Victories they do ſing. So much the more reaſon there is that the moſt imperfect Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Pilgrimage of this Life can never be altered by the diſtinct ſight of all theſe Objects.</p>

               <p>PUre Contemplation excludeth all image, that's to ſay, all that Idea which is even meerly intellectual. A Contemplative Soul, admits of no real and poſitive Idea of God, that diſtinguiſheth him from all other beings. She ought to ſee neither the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes which do diſtinguiſh him from all Creatures, nor the Three Divine Perſons, for fear of altering the ſimplicity of her ſight. She ought yet leſs to imploy her ſelf about the Humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, ſince that is not the Divine Nature; nor about his Myſteries, becauſe they would multiply too much Contemplation. The Souls that are in this ſtate, have no further need to think on Jeſus Chriſt, who is but the way to come to God his Father, becauſe they are already arrived at the end.</p>
               <p>To Speak at this rate, is to be ignorant of all that good, Myſtical Men themſelves have been pleaſed to ſay, of the pureſt Contemplation: It is to annihilate Faith, without which, Contemplation it ſelf is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated: 'Tis to make a chimerical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, which hath no real Object, and cannot diſtinguiſh God from nothing: It is to deſtroy Chriſtianity, inſtead of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it: It is to make a kind of Deiſm,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49309:67"/>
which next moment terminates into a kind of Atheiſm, whereby all real Idea of God as diſtinguiſhed from his Creatures is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. Finally, it is to ſet up two impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinions: The firſt is, to ſuppoſe, that there is upon the Earth ſome Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Perſon, who is no longer a ſojourner, and who hath no further need of the way, becauſe he is arrived at the end. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is to be ignorant that Chriſt who is the way, is no leſs the Truth and the Life; that he is as much the finiſher as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our Salvation. Finally, that the Angels themſelves in their moſt ſublime Contemplation have deſired to ſee his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and that the Bleſſed Sing inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Song of the Lamb before him.</p>

               <p>COntemplative Souls are deprived of the diſtinct ſenſible and reflected ſight of Jeſus Chriſt, at two different times; but they are never deprived for ever in this Life of the ſimple and diſtinct ſight of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: Firſt, in the prime fervour of their Contemplation, this exerciſe is yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfect, not repreſenting God but in a very confuſed manner. The Soul being as it were ſwelled up with the ſenſible Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49309:67"/>
of her recollection, cannot yet be converſant about diſtinct ſights. Theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſights would cauſe in her a kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction in her weakneſs, and caſt her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the reaſoning of Meditation, out of which, ſhe is ſcarcely departed. This impotency of ſeeing diſtinctly Jeſus Chriſt, is not the perfection, but rather the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this exerciſe, for it is then more ſenſible than pure. Secondly, a Soul looſeth the ſight of Chriſt in the laſt Tryals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God at that time takes away from the Soul the poſſeſſion and reflected know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all that is good in her, to purifie her from all Self-intereſt. In this ſtate of unvoluntary darkneſs and trouble, the Soul looſes no more the ſight of Chriſt than of God. But all theſe loſſes are but in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and tranſient; after which, Chriſt is no leſs reſtored to the Soul than God himſelf. Beſides theſe two caſes, the moſt elevated Soul may in the actual Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation be poſſeſt of Chriſt, made preſent to her by Faith; and in the intervals where pure Contemplation ceaſeth, ſhe is yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of Jeſus Chriſt. It will be found by Experience, that theſe Souls which are moſt Eminent in Contemplation, are thoſe that are moſt poſſeſſed of him: They Speak with him every Hour, as the Bride with her Bridegroom: They often ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49309:68"/>
but him in themſelves: They bear ſucceſſively deep impreſſions of all his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and of all the ſtates of this Mortal Life. True it is, that he becomes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo intimate in their Heart, that they uſe themſelves to look on him leſs as a foreign and external Object, than as the internal principle of their Life.</p>
               <p>To Speak thus, is to repreſs the moſt Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Errors: 'Tis clearly to explain the experiences and expreſſions of Saints, which Souls given over to illuſion might abuſe.</p>

               <p>COntemplative Souls have no more any need to ſee diſtinctly the Humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they are arrived at the end. The Fleſh of Chriſt is no more an Object worthy of them, and they know him no more in the Fleſh, even as made preſent by pure Faith: They are no more poſſeſſed of him out of actual Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than in pure Contemplation it ſelf. God whom they in ſupream ſimplicity do poſſeſs is enough for them.

               <p>To ſpeak at this rate, is to take away the corner Stone: It is to ſnatch from the

               <p>IT may be ſaid that poſitive Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is infuſed, becauſe it prevents the Souls with a ſweetneſs and Peace greater yet than do the other graces which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the common ſort of Juſt Men. It is a grace more freely given than all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers given for Merit, becauſe it worketh in Souls the moſt pure and perfect Love. But paſſive Contemplation is neither purely infuſed, ſince it is free and meritorious, nor meerly free, ſince the Soul co-operates with Grace in it: It is not miraculous, ſince according to the Teſtimony of all the Saints it conſiſts only in an Amorous knowledge, and that Grace without a Miracle is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the moſt lively Faith, and the moſt purified Love. Laſtly, this Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation cannot be Miraculous, ſince it is ſuppoſed to conſiſt in a ſtate of pure and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49309:69"/>
dark Faith, in which the faithful is not led by any other light but that of ſimple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and of the Authority of the Church common to all Juſt Men. 'Tis true, that ſeveral Myſtical Writers have ſuppoſed this Contemplation to be Miraculous, becauſe in it is Contemplated a Truth, that hath not been received in by the ſenſes and through the imagination. This true alſo, that theſe Writers have acknowledged a bottom of the Soul which did work in this Contemplation, without any diſtinct Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the faculties. But theſe two things had only their Origin from Scholaſtick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, whereof theſe Myſtical Men were preconceited. All this great Myſtery va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth away, aſſoon as one ſuppoſes with S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that we have without Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, intellectual Ideas which have not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the ſenſes, and when it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the other ſide, that the bottom of the Soul is not really diſtinguiſhed from her powers. Then all paſſive Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is reduced to ſome thing very ſimple and which hath nothing miraculous: 'Tis a chain-work of Acts of Faith and of Love, ſo ſimple, ſo direct, ſo peaceable, and ſo uniform, that they don't ſeem to do more than one only Act, or even that they don't ſeem to do any Act at all, but a repoſe of pure Union. This is the reaſon why S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:49309:69"/>
of <hi>Sales</hi> won't have it called Union, for fear of expreſſing a motion or action towards uniting, but a ſimple and pure uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Hence it comes, that ſome as S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> of <hi>Aſſiſium</hi> in his great Song, have ſaid, that they were able no longer to perform any acts; and that others as <hi>Gregory Lopez,</hi> have ſaid that they did a continual Act du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their whole life. Both the one and the other by expreſſions ſeemingly oppoſite mean the ſame thing. They do no more any eager acts and marked by an unquiet motion. They produce Acts ſo peaceable and ſo uniform, that theſe Acts though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſucceſſive and even interrupted, do ſeem to them one only Act without interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a continual reſt. Hence it is, that this Contemplation hath been call'd ſilent or quiet Prayer. Hence it is Finally, that it hath been called paſſive: God forbid! it ſhould ever be called ſo, to exclude from it the real, poſitive, and meritorious Action of the Free-Will, or the real and ſucceſſive Acts which ought to be reiterated every moment. It is called Paſſive only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Activity or intereſted eagerneſs of Souls, when they will yet agitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in order to feel and ſee their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhould be leſs mark'd were it both more ſimple and more united. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Contemplation is nothing elſe but pure
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49309:70"/>
Contemplation: The Active is that which is mixt with forward and diſcurſive Acts. So when Contemplation hath yet a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of intereſted forwardneſs, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Activity, it is yet Active<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When it hath further remains of this Activity, it is entirely Paſſive, that's to ſay, Peaceable and unintereſted in its Acts. In fine, the more the Soul is Paſſive towards God, the more Active is ſhe in that which ſhe ought to do: That is to ſay, that the more ſhe is ſupple and pliant to the Divine impulſe, the more efficatious is her motion, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſelf agitation: For it is always equally true, that the more the Soul receiveth from God the more ought ſhe to reſtore to him of what ſhe hath from him. This ebbing and flowing makes up all the order of Grace and all the fidelity of the Creature.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak ſo, is to prevent all illuſion; 'tis to explain the bottom of Paſſive Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, which cannot be denied without a notorious raſhneſs, and cannot be carried further without extremity of danger: 'Tis to diſintricate whatever the Saints have ſaid in terms, which by the ſubtilty of ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have been ſomewhat darkned.</p>

               <p>PAſſive Contemplation is purely Paſſive, ſo that the Free-Will co-operates no more therein, with Grace by any real and tranſient Act. It is purely infuſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely a free gift, and without Merit on the part of the Soul. It is miraculous, and draws while it laſts a Soul from the ſtate of pure and dark Faith. It is a poſſeſſion and a ſupernatural rapture which prevents the Soul. It is an extraordinary inſpiration that puts the Soul out of the common rules. It is an abſolute binding or evacuation of the powers, ſo that both the underſtanding and the will are then in an abſolute impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to any thing, which without doubt is a miraculous and extatick ſuſpenſion.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak at this rate, is to overturn the Syſtem of pure Faith, which is that of all good myſtical Men, and eſpecially of the Bleſſed <hi>John of the Croſs:</hi> 'Tis to confound Paſſive Contemplation, which is free and meritorious, with gifts meerly free and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and which as we are adviſed by the Saints, ought never voluntarily to poſſeſs us. It is to contradict all Authors, who place this Contemplation in a free, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, and meritorious look; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the real but ſimple Acts of theſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49309:71"/>
two Powers: 'Tis to contradict S. <hi>Thereſa</hi> herſelf, who aſſures us, that the Seventh manſion hath none of the raptures, which do ſuſpend againſt the order of nature, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the underſtanding and of the will. 'Tis to oppoſe all the Eminent Spiritual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who have ſaid that theſe ſuſpenſions of natural operations are ſo far from being a perfect ſtate, that on the contrary, they are a ſign that nature is not yet enough purified, and that ſuch effects as theſe do ceaſe, by how much the more the Soul is purified and grown more familiar with God, in the ſtate of pure Faith. It is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the trouble which a pure Soul ſhould be at in making unquiet and reflected Acts for her ſelf-intereſt, againſt the actual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of Grace, with an abſolute impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of performing Acts even by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral endeavour. A miſtake in this matter may be in ſome an inexauſtible ſource of illuſion, and in others an ill grounded oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of offence.</p>

               <p>THE Paſſive ſtate, whereof myſtical Saints have ſo often ſpoken, is Paſſive only ſo far as Contemplation is Paſſive, that's to ſay, that it excludeth not peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49309:71"/>
and diſintereſted Acts, but only the Activity, or the Acts that are unquiet and froward for our ſelf-intereſt. A Paſſive ſtate is that wherein a Soul loving no more with a mixt love, makes all her Acts with a full and efficacious, but peaceable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted will. Sometimes ſhe makes ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and indiſtinct Acts, which are call'd quietude and Contemplation, and ſome other times ſhe makes diſtinct Acts of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues agreeable to her ſtate. But ſhe makes the one and the other no way equally Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, that's to ſay, peaceable and unintere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. This ſtate is habitual, but not wholly invariable. For beſides that the Soul may fall abſolutely from it, moreover, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth venial faults in it. This Paſſive ſtate ſuppoſes no extraordinary inſpiration: It includes nothing but a peace and infinite pliantneſs of the Soul to all the impreſſions of Grace. A dry and very light feather, (as <hi>Caſſian</hi> ſaith;) is carried away without reſiſtance, by the leaſt breath of Wind, and this breathing carrieth it all ſorts of ways with celerity; whereas, if it was wet and heavy, it would be by its weight leſs apt to be moved and carried about. The Soul in intereſted love which is the leſs perfect, hath yet a remnant of intereſted fear which makes her leſs light, leſs pliant and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when the breath of the interiour Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49309:72"/>
carries her: A troubled Water can't be clear, nor receive the Image of the neareſt Objects; but that which is untroubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as a real Looking-Glaſs; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives without alteration, all the Images of diverſe Objects, and yet retains none. A pure and peaceable Soul, is the ſame; God imprints in her his Image, and that of all the Objects he is minded to imprint in her. All is imprinted, and all blotted out: This Soul hath not any proper Form, but hath equally all thoſe which Grace gives to her; nothing remains in her, but all vaniſheth away, as in Water, as ſoon as God will make new Impreſſions: Nothing but pure Love gives this Peace and perfect Docility. This paſſive State is not a continual actual Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Contemplation, which laſts only for ſome limited time, makes only part of this habitual State. Unintereſted Love, ought not to be leſs unintereſted, nor conſequently leſs peaceable, in the Acts that are Diſtincts from Vertues, than in the indiſtinct Acts of pure Contemplation.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak ſo, is to take away all Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and to admit a State which is nothing elſe but the Exerciſe of pure Love, ſo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by all Tradition.</p>

               <p>To ſpeak at this rate, is to confound the paſſive State, with paſſive Contemplation: It is to ſuppoſe a State of miraculous and perpetual Extaſies, excluding all ways of Faith, all Freedom, all Merit, and Demerit; nay, incompatible with the Pilgrimage of this Life: It is to be ignorant of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of the Saints, and to pervert all their Ideas.</p>

               <p>THere is in the paſſive State, a Simplicity and Childhood noted by the Saints; but the Children of God, who are ſimple in Things that are good, are always prudent againſt any thing that is evil: They are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, ingenuous, peaceable, and without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: They don't reject Wiſdom, but only the Propriety of Wiſdom: They diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate their Wiſdom from themſelves, as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49309:73"/>
they do all their other Vertues: They make a faithful Uſe every moment, of all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light of Reaſon, and of all the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Light of actual Grace, to guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves according to the written Law, and a true Decorum. A Soul in this State, is wiſe, neither by a forward ſeeking after Wiſdom, nor by an intereſted Reflection upon herſelf, in order to aſſure herſelf that ſhe is wiſe, and to enjoy her Wiſdom as her own: But without minding to be wiſe in herſelf, ſhe is ſo in God, by admitting wilfully none of the froward and irregular Paſſions, either of Humour, or of Self-love; and by making uſe, without Property, as well of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as of the ſupernatural Light of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Moment. This preſent Moment hath a kind of a Moral Extenſion, wherein ought to be included all thoſe things which have a natural and near relation to the thing, which is actually in hand. Thus ſufficient to the Day, is the Evil thereof, and the Soul leaves to Morrow, to take Care of itſelf, becauſe that to Morrow, which is not yet hers, ſhall bring with it, if it comes, its Grace and Light, which is the daily Bread. Such Souls as theſe do deſerve and draw on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a ſpecial Care of Providence, under whoſe Care they live, without a far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and unquiet Forecaſt, as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Boſome of their Mother. They
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49309:73"/>
do not poſſeſs themſelves as thoſe who are wiſe in themſelves, againſt the Prohibition of the Apoſtle: But they let themſelves to be poſſeſſed, inſtructed, and moved, upon every occaſion, by the actual Grace of God. Theſe Souls do not think themſelves extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily inſpired; they think on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that they may deceive themſelves by Miſtakes, which to avoid, they judge almoſt of nothing; they willingly receive Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and have neither Sence nor Will: Theſe are the Children whom Chriſt will have let to come near him: They have with the Simplicity of the Dove, all the Prudence of the Serpent; but a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prudence, which they do no more own, than I do appropriate the Beams of the Sun to my ſelf, when I walk in its Light: Theſe are the Poor in Spirit, whom Chriſt Jeſus hath declared bleſſed, and who are as much taken off from their Perfections, as all Chriſtians ought to be from their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Poſſeſſions.

               <p>THere is in the paſſive State, a Re-union of all the Vertues in Love, which never excludeth the diſtinct Exerciſe of each Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: 'Tis Charity, as ſaith S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> after S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which is the Form and Principle of all Vertues: That which diſtinguiſheth or ſpecifieth them, is the particular Object which Love does embrace. The Love which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains from impure Pleaſures is Chaſtity, and this very ſame Love, when it bears Evils,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49309:75"/>
takes the Name of Patience: This Love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going out of its Simplicity, becometh, by Turns, all different Vertues; but it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of none as being a Vertue; that's to ſay, either Fortitude, Greatneſs, Beauty, Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, or Perfection. <hi>A diſintereſted Soul,</hi> as S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales,</hi> (12. <hi>Diſcourſe of Simplicity)</hi> hath obſerved it, <hi>loves no longer the Vertues, either becauſe they are handſome and pure, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are worthy to be beloved, or as beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and perfecting thoſe that do practiſe them; or becauſe they are meritorious, and prepare Men for an Eternal Reward; but only becauſe they are the Will of God: A diſintereſted Soul,</hi> as this great Saint ſaid of Mother <hi>Chantal</hi> (Life of Mad. of <hi>Chantal,</hi> p. 246.) <hi>does not waſh away her Faults, for to be pure; and does not adorn herſelf with Vertues, for to be beautiful; but for to pleaſe her Spouſe, to whom if Uglineſs had been as acceptable, ſhe would have loved it as much as Beauty.</hi> Then it is, that we do practiſe all diſtinct Vertues, without thinking that they are Vertues; then we think on nothing every Moment, but to do the Will of God, and jealous Love cauſeth, at the ſame time, that we deſire no more to be vertuous, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we are never more vertuous, than when we are no more pleaſed to be ſo. It may be ſaid in this Sence, that paſſive and unintereſted Love, will no more, even Love itſelf, as being her Perfection and Happineſs, but
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49309:76"/>
only as it is that which God does require of us. Therefore S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> ſaith, that <hi>we return into our ſelves, loving that Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the well Beloved.</hi> (Love of God, l. 9. c. 9.) This Saint in another place ſaith, that <hi>we ought not ſo much as to deſire the Love of God, as it is our good.</hi> Laſtly, to give to this Truth all the ſtrictneſs that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, this Saint ſaith, <hi>that we ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſeek in God nothing but the Love of his Beauty, and not the pleaſure which is felt in the Beauty of his Love.</hi> This diſtinction will appear ſubtile to thoſe whom unction hath not yet taught; but it is confirmed by the Tradition of all Saints from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſtianity, and it ought not to be deſpiſed without making light of the Saints, who have placed the perfection of a Soul in this ſo nice a jealouſie of Love.</p>

               <p>THE ſtate of transformation whereof ſo many both Ancient and modern Saints have ſo often ſpoken, is nothing but the moſt Paſſive ſtate, that's to ſay, the moſt free of all Activity or intereſted unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Soul being peaceable and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pliant to all the ſubtileſt impulſes of Grace, is like a Globe upon a ground-plot, that hath no more any proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Situation, but goes equally all ſorts of ways, and the moſt inſenſible impulſes is enough for to move it. In this ſtate a Soul hath but one only Love, and knows nothing elſe but to Love. Love is her Life, it is as it were her being and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, for it is the ſole principle of all her Affections. As this Soul gives to her ſelf not any froward motion, does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49309:77"/>
unſeaſonably in the hand of God her own diſpoſer; ſo ſhe feels no more but one motion, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in her, even ſo as a Man carried by another feels no other impulſe but this, if ſo be that he does not diſcompoſe it by a contrary agitation: Then the Soul ſaith with S. <hi>Paul; I live, but it is not I, but Chriſt Jeſus, who lives in me. Christ does ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf in his Mortal Fleſh,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle will have him to manifeſt himſelf in us all. Then the image of God darkned and almoſt blotted out in us by Sin, is imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again and yields a new ſimilitude which is called transformation. Then when this Soul ſpeaks of herſelf by a ſimple Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhe ſaith with S. <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Genoa: I find no more of my ſelf; there is no other ſelf in me but God.</hi> If on the contrary, ſhe ſeeks herſelf by reflection, ſhe hateth herſelf as being ſomething without God; that's to ſay, ſhe condemns the <hi>my ſelf,</hi> as it is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the pure impreſſion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace, as this ſame Sainteſs did with horror. This ſtate is neither fixed nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable. 'Tis true only, that one ought not to believe that the Soul does fall from it, without any infidelity, becauſe the gifts of God are without Repentance, and Souls faithful to their Grace ſhall ſuffer no dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of them. But in ſhort, the leaſt

When a Soul is truly, and actually in pure Love, there is no fear but in the actual Confeſſion of her Sin, ſhe is in the actual Condemnation of what ſhe hath committed againſt the Well-beloved, and conſequently in the moſt formal, moſt pure, and moſt efficacious Contrition, tho' ſhe produces not always ſenſible Acts of it, in an expreſs'd and reflected Form. If ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial

Faults are blotted out in an inſtant, by the ſimple reciting of the Lord's Prayer, as S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> aſſureth us in general of juſt Men, tho' imperfect: So much the more are they blotted out likewiſe, in the transformed Souls by the Exerciſe of the moſt pure Love: 'Tis true, that one is not oblig'd to make equally always frequent Confeſſions, when the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Director hath Reaſon to fear, leaſt they ſhould caſt one into Deſpair, or be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a meer Habit, or ſhould become an unlading of the Heart, and an eaſe for Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, more afflicted for not ſeeing himſelf entirely perfect, than faithful, in being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do Violence to himſelf for his Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or becauſe theſe frequent Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diſturb too much ſome Souls, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them too much about their State, in ſome tranſient Pains; or becauſe they don't ſee in themſelves any voluntary Fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſince their laſt Confeſſion, which may appear to the Confeſſor a ſufficient Matter of Sacramental Abſolution, after they have caſt themſelves at his Feet, for to lay their Submiſſion in the Power and Judgment of the Church.</p>

which proceed more from a natural Infirmity, than from the Will, and which are according to the thought of Pope S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> the contrapoiſe of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, as the pricks of the fleſh were in the Apoſtle the meſſenger of Satan to hinder him from growing Proud of the greatneſs of his revelations.

This Tradition, would include ſecret Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, beyond the truths of univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; or theſe Opinions at leaſt would be contrary to thoſe of the common Faith, and would exempt Souls from exerciſing all thoſe Acts of an explicite Faith and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Vertue, which are no leſs eſſential to the ways of pure Love, than to that which is intereſted.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak thus, is to annihilate Tradition, inſtead of multiplying it. It is the way to make a ſect of ſecret Hypocrites in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Church, without her being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to diſcover them, or to free her ſelf from them. Hereby the impious ſecret of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and <hi>Manicheans</hi> will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and all the Traditions of our Faith and Morals undermined.</p>

               <p>ALL the Internal ways that are moſt eminent, are ſo far from being above an habitual ſtate of pure love, that they are but the way to arrive at that bound of all perfection; all inferiour degrees do not come up to this true eſtate. The laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree which Myſtick Writers call by the name of Transformation, or Eſſential Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any Medium, is no more than a ſimple reality of this love without a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar intereſt. This when true, is the moſt ſafe ſtate, becauſe it is the moſt voluntary and meritorious of all the ſtates of Chriſtian Juſtice; and becauſe 'tis that which referrs all to God, and leaves nothing to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But on the contrary, when 'tis falſe and imaginary, it is the heighth of illuſion. The Traveller after many Fatigues, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Sufferings, arriving at length up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of a Mountain, from thence diſcerns at a diſtance his Native City, and the end of his Journey, and all his toils, he is preſently overjoy'd at it, believes himſelf to be already at the very gates of that City, and that there is nothing now remaining but a little way, and that very good for him; but as he moves forwards, the lengths
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49309:87"/>
and difficulties which he had not foreſeen at firſt ſight, do proportionably increaſe, he muſt be obliged to deſcend by Precipices into deep Vallies, where he loſes the ſight of that City, which he thought he could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt touch. He muſt be forc'd oftentimes to creep up over ſharp Rocks, and 'tis not without great trouble and dangers that he arrives at laſt at that City, which he thought at firſt to have been ſo near him, and ſo eaſie to come at. It's the very ſame thing with that Love which is entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted; the firſt caſt of the Eye diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it in a wonderful perſpective; one thinks he has hold of it, he ſuppoſes with himſelf that he is already confirmed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or at leaſt that there is between him and it but a ſhort and even ſpace; but the more he advances towards it, the more tedious and painful he finds the way. There is nothing ſo dangerous for a Man as to flatter himſelf with this pretty Idea or Conceit, and to believe that he lives in the practice of the ſame, when it is not really ſo. He that makes this Love to be ſpeculative, would fret himſelf to a Skeleton, if God ſhould put him to prove how this Love doth puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and realize it ſelf in the Soul. In ſhort, he muſt have a care of believing that he hath the ſame in reality, when he only has a view of it, and is charmed with it. That
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49309:87"/>
Soul which dares preſume by a deciſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection that he is arrived to it, ſhews by his preſumption how remote he is from it; the ſmall number of thoſe that have reached it, do not know whether they are really ſo; and as often as they do reflect upon themſelves in relation to it, they are ready to believe it is not ſo with them, when their Superiours declare the ſame unto them: They ſpeak of themſelves as of another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in a diſ-intereſted manner, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflection, and act with ſimplicity, by a pure obedience, according to true neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, without ever voluntarily judging or reaſoning concerning their ſtate. In ſhort, tho' it be true to ſay, that no man can ſet exact bounds to the operations of God in the Soul, and that there is none but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God that can ſound the depths of this ſame Spirit; yet it is alſo true to ſay, that no internal perfection can allow a Chriſtian to diſpence with thoſe real acts that are eſſential to the accompliſhment of the whole Law; and that all perfection reduces it ſelf to this habitual ſtate of ſole and pure love, which effects in theſe Souls, with a diſ-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Peace, all that which a mixt love does in others, with ſome remains of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted eagerneſs. In a word, there is nothing but a peculiar intereſt that cannot, and which ought not at all to be found in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49309:88"/>
the exerciſe of diſ-intereſted Love; but all the reſt is there ſtill in a more abundant manner than ordinarily in juſt Perſons.</p>
               <p>For us to ſpeak with this precaution, is to confine our ſelves within the bounds ſet us by our Fathers; this is a Religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Tradition, and hereby is a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given, without any mixture of innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the Experiences of the Saints, and the Language they have uſed in ſpeaking ſometimes of themſelves, with ſimplicity and pure Obedience.</p>

               <p>HOly indifference is nothing elſe but diſintereſted Love; Tryals are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Purification of it; the abandoning of the ſame is but its exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in Tryals. The diſappropriating of Vertue, is nothing, beſides the laying aſide of all Complaiſance, all Conſolation, and all Self-Intereſt in the exerciſe of Vertue by pure Love. The retrenching of all activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, implies no more than the retrenching of all inquietude and intereſted eagerneſs for pure Love. Contemplation is but the plain Exerciſe of this Love reduced to one ſimple Motive. Paſſive Contemplation is but pure Contemplation without activity or eagerneſs. A Paſſive ſtate, whether it be in a time bounded with pure and decent Contemplation, or in thoſe Intervals where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Man does not at all Contemplate, doth exclude neither the real Action, nor the ſucceſſive Acts of the Will, nor the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick diſtinction of Vertue, as they relate to their proper Subjects, but only ſimple acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, or intereſted inquietude; it's a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

Exerciſe of Prayer and Vertue by pure Love.

               <salute>Moſt Holy Father,</salute>
            </opener>
            <q>
               <p>I have reſolved, with utmoſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as with all manner of ſubmiſſion and reſpect to your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ſend the Book that I wrote ſome time ſince concerning the Maxims of the Saints, in relation to an internal Life. It's a duty which I am obliged to pay, not only to the Supream Authority, with which you preſide over all the Churches, but alſo to thoſe Favours you have been pleaſed to heap upon me. But to the end that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49309:90"/>
may be omitted in a matter of ſuch importance, and concerning which, Mens Minds are ſo toſſed about and agitated, and for removing any Equivocations that might ariſe from the diverſity of Languages, I have undertaken to make a Latin Verſion of my whole Work, to which I apply my ſelf wholly, and will very quickly ſend this Tranſlation to be laid down at your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs his Feet.</p>
               <p>I would to God, moſt Holy Father, I could, my ſelf in perſon, bring you my Book, with a zealous and ſubmiſſive heart, and then receive your Apoſtolical Benediction; but the Affairs of the Dioceſs of <hi>Cambray,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the misfortune of the War, and the inſtruction of the young Princes, which the King has done me the honour to intruſt me with, will not allow me room to hope for this Conſolation. And now, moſt Holy Father, I come to give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have induced me to write con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the internal Life and Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have obſerved, That ſome Perſons abuſing the Maxims of the Saints, that have been ſo often approved of by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly See, thought by little and little to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate pernicious Errors thereby, and that others who knew nothing of ſpiritual things, turned the ſame into a Ridicule. The abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Doctrine of the Quietiſts, under
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49309:90"/>
the appearance of Perfection, glided ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into divers parts of <hi>France,</hi> and even into our <hi>Low Countries.</hi> Several Writings, whereof ſome were too Uncorrect, as others might be juſtly ſuſpected of Errors, ſtirred up the indifferent Curiofity of the Faithful againſt them. Some Ages ago, diverſe myſtical Writers arraigning the Myſtery of the Faith in a pure Conſcience, had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the ſame, yet not knowing the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror concealed under it; this they did out of an exceſs of warm Piety, want of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution in the choice of Terms, made uſe of by them, and a pardonable ignorance of the Principles of Theology. This is that which has inflamed that ardent Zeal of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers illuſtrious Biſhops, and this gave them an occaſion to Compoſe Thirty Four Articles, which they were pleaſed to draw up and lodge with me. This alſo has brought them to Cenſure certain little Books, ſome Paſſages of which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſenſe that doth naturally ariſe from them, have deſerved to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But, moſt Holy Father, Men have not removed far from one Extream, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling into another; ſome perſons have taken occaſion againſt our intention, to Ridicule, as an extravagant Chimera, the pure love of a Contemplative Life. For my own part, I thought, by taking dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49309:91"/>
heed to an exact medium, it was the way to ſeparate Truth from Error, and that which is Ancient and Stanch, from what is new and dangerous; this is that which I have endeavoured to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my weak Abilities; but to know whether I have ſucceeded therein or no, is left, moſt Holy Father, to your Judgment, and 'tis my buſineſs reſpectfully to give ear to St. <hi>Peter</hi> as living and ſpeaking in you, whoſe Faith ſhall never fail.</p>
               <p>I have chiefly applyed my ſelf to make this Work conciſe, and therein have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Advice of very knowing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who have deſired that a ready and an eaſy remedy ſhould be found out, not only againſt the Illuſion which is Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but alſo againſt the ſcoffing of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Perſons. Great regard then was to be had for thoſe Souls that are full of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, who being more ſimple in that which is good, than precaution'd againſt Evil, could not diſcern that horrible Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that was hid under the Flowers; regard alſo muſt have been had to the Contempt of Criticks, who would not ſeparate the Aſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or ſtudious Traditions and precious Maxims of the Saints from the vile Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Hypocrites. Wherefore it has been thought neceſſary to make a kind of a Dictionary of Myſtical Theology, in order
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49309:91"/>
to prevent good Souls from paſſing beyond thoſe Bounds ſet unto us by our Fathers.</p>
               <p>I have therefore, in as ſhort a Style as poſſibly I could, comprized the Deſiniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Terms which the Practice of the Saints have Authorized. I have alſo imploy'd the weight and authority of a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to endeavour to cruſh down a Hereſy ſo full of Impudence; it appeared to me, moſt Holy Father, as ſome ſort of undecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that a Biſhop ſhould expoſe thoſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Errours to the Publick, without te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying, at the ſame time, the indignation and horror which the Zeal of God's Cauſe had inſpir'd him with againſt it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I pray God that I may not have loſt the ſight of my own weakneſſes, and ſpoken any thing preſumptuouſly.</p>
               <p>The ſupream Authority of the Holy See hath abundantly ſupplyed all my Defects; the Soveraign Pontiffs, upon a ſcrupulous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of all the Writings of the Saints, which have been Canoniz'd, have, upon all occaſions, approv'd of the true Maxims of the Aſcetick or ſtudious Life, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative Love. Wherefore having kept cloſe to that immutable Rule, I hope I have without any danger of going out of the way, fitted up the Articles, which I have aſſerted as true ones. As to thoſe falſe ones which I have Condemned, I have
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49309:92"/>
been led thereunto, as it were, by the Hand; for I have, in every thing, taken the Solemn Decrees, by which the Holy See hath Condemned the Sixty Eight Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Molino</hi>'s, for my Model therein. And ſo having ſuch an Oracle for my Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, I have endeavoured to lift up my Voice to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place I have Condemned the permanent Act, which has never any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be reitterated, as being a Poiſoned Spring of Idleneſs and inward Lethargy.</p>
               <p>In the next place I have Eſtabliſhed the indiſpenſible neceſſity of a diſtinct Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of every Virtue.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I have reſiſted a perpetual and uninterrupted Contemplation, which would exclude Venial Sins; the diſtinction of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and unvoluntary diſtractions, as being incompatible with the Condition of a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I have rejected paſſive Prayer, which would exclude the real Cooperation of Free-will for the formation of Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I have allowed of no other Reſt, neither in Prayer, nor in other Exerciſe of the Internal Life, ſave that peace of the Holy Ghoſt, whereby the moſt pure Souls frame their Actions in ſo uniform a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they appear to Perſons without
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49309:92"/>
Knowledge, not as diſtinct Acts, but a ſimple and permanent Unity with God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, For fear that the Doctrine of pure Love, ſo much Authorized by ſo many Fathers of the Church, and other Saints, might ſerve as an Azilum or Refuge to the Quietiſts, I have ſet my ſelf chiefly to ſhew, that in what degree of Perfection ſoever it may be, and how great the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Love wherewith one is filled, may arrive to, yet he muſt always retain in his Heart, the Hope wherewith we are ſaved, in purſuance to what the Apoſtle ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith, Hope and Charity: <hi>Now theſe three things, Faith, Hope, and Charity remain, but Charity is the greateſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt therefore always hope for, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and pray for our Salvation, ſince 'tis God's will it ſhould be ſo, and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that we ſhould will it for his glory; thus Hope preſerves it ſelf in its proper Exerciſe, not only by the means of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Habit, but alſo by its own proper Acts, which being commanded and enobled by Charity, as the Schools phraſe it, they are moſt abſolutely carried to the ſublime end of the ſame Charity, which is nothing elſe but the pure glory of God.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, This ſtate of pure Charity is not to be found but in a very few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Souls; and that 'tis there only in an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49309:93"/>
manner. When I ſay habitual, God forbid that an unamiſſible ſtate, or ſuch as is exempted from any variation ſhould be meant. If this eſtate be ſtill ſubject to daily Sins, with how much more reaſon is the ſame compatible with Acts performed from time to time, which ceaſe not to be good and meritorious, tho' they may be a little leſs pure and diſintereſted. It's enough for this State, that the Acts of Vertue are performed therein very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with that perfection that Charity diffuſes there, and with which the ſame are animated.</p>
               <p>All theſe things are agreeable to our thirty four Articles. I ſhall joyn to the Book which I have publiſhed, moſt Holy Father, a Collection in Manuſcript, of the Sentiments of the Fathers and Saints of the laſt Age, concerning the <hi>Pure Love,</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatives; to the end that that which is but plainly ſet out in the Firſt Book, may be proved in the Second, by the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Opinions of the Saints of all Ages. I entirely ſubmit, Moſt Holy Father, both the one and the other Pieces, to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Holy Roman Catholick Church, who is the Mother Church of all, and has taught all the reſt. I devote all that is mine, and my ſelf, to your Holineſs, as a Son ought to do, that is full of Zeal and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49309:93"/>
Reſpect towards you. But if my Book in <hi>French</hi> hath been already brought unto your Holineſs, I moſt humbly intreat you, moſt Holy Father, to decide nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, 'till ſuch time as you have ſeen my <hi>Latin</hi> Verſion, that will be diſpatched away with all ſpeed. There is nothing now remaining for me, ſave to wiſh a long Pontificate to the chief of Paſtors who Rules the Kingdom of Chriſt with ſo diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Heart, and who ſays, with ſo much applauſe from all the Roman Catholick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to his Illuſtrious Family, <hi>I know you not.</hi> In doing thus daily, I think I ſeek the Glory and Conſolation of the Church, the Re-eſtabliſhment of its Diſcipline, the propagation of the Faith, the Extirpation of Schiſms and Hereſies; and laſtly, an abundant Harveſt in the Field of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Father of the Family.

               <p>BE not concerned for me, the buſineſs of my Book is gone to <hi>Rome;</hi> if I am under a miſtake, the Authority of the Holy See will undeceive me; and this is that I wait for with a gentle and lowly Mind; if I have illy expreſt my ſelf, they will reform my expreſſions: If the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appears to require a more large explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I will readily do by way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. If my Book contains nothing in it, but what is pure Doctrine, I ſhall have the conſolation to know exactly what a Man ought to believe, and what to reject. I ſhall not in this Caſe fail to make all thoſe Additions, which, without weakning the truth, will be conducive to enlighten and edifie ſuch Readers as are moſt ſubject to take the allarm. But, Sir, in ſhort, if the Pope condemns my Book, I ſhall be
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49309:94"/>
the firſt, God willing, that will condemn it, and put out a Mandate to forbid the reading of it in the Dioceſs of <hi>Cambray.</hi> I ſhall only intreat the Pope to do me the favour, exactly to note thoſe paſſages he condemns, and the ſenſe whereon he grounds his Condemnation; to the end that I may ſubſcribe thereunto without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, and that I may never run the riſque of defending, excuſing, or tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſenſe its condemned in. Being thus diſpoſed, thro' the bleſſing of God, I am at reſt, and have nothing to do but to wait the diſpoſition of my Superiour, in whom I acknowledge the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt to be lodged; diſintereſted Love muſt not be defended but with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere diſintereſt. We have not to do herein with a point of Honour, nor with the Opinion of the World, nor yet with that profound humiliation, wherein Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may fear to meet with ill ſucceſs. I think I act with integrity, I am as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of being preſumptuous, and poſſeſſed with a baſe ſhame, as to be feeble, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and fearful in the defence of truth. If the Pope condemns me, I ſhall be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by undeceived, and the vanquiſhed ſhall reap all the real fruits of the Victory. <hi>Victoria ſcedet victis,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> But if, on the other ſide, the Pope does
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49309:95"/>
not condemn my Doctrine, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour both by my ſilence and reſpect, to pacifie thoſe of my Fraternity, whoſe Zeal has animated them againſt me, by laying a ſort of Doctrine to my charge, which I abhor, and always did, as much as they do. Perhaps they will do me juſtice, when they ſee my ſincerity. There are but two things that my Doctrine was intended to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; the firſt whereof is, that Charity is a love to God ſor his own ſake, diſtinct from that motive of bleſſedneſs that we find in him. Secondly, that Charity in the life of the moſt perfect Souls, is that which precedes all other Vertues, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimates them, and commands the acts ſo as to make them bear to its end; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Juſt thus qualified, do then ordinarily exerciſe hope, and all other Vertues with all the diſintereſt of Charity it ſelf; becauſe this ſame ſtate of the Soul is not without its exception; being no other than an habitual one, and not immutable. God knows I have never intended to teach any thing elſe that exceeded theſe limitations. And hence it is that I have ſaid, in my ſpeaking concerning pure Love, which is Charity, ſo far as it animates and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all other diſtinct Vertues. <hi>Whoever allows of nothing beyond that, is within the confines of Tradition, whoever paſſeth thoſe

bounds, is already out of the way.</hi> I do not think there is any danger that the Holy See ſhould condemn a Doctrine ſo well grounded upon the Authority of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of the Schools, and of ſo many great Saints that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd. As for the manner of Expreſſions contained in my Book, if they ſhould be any ways prejudicial to truth, for want of being correct, I conſign them to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Superiour: and I ſhould be very ſorry to trouble the repoſe of the Church, were there no more in it than the intereſt of my Perſon, and of my Book. Theſe are my thoughts of the matter, Sir, I go for <hi>Cambray,</hi> having Sacrificed unto God with my whole heart all that I could Sacrifice to him thereupon; permit me to exhort you to be of the ſame mind; I have introduced nothing that related to Humane Affairs and Temporals into the Doctrine which I was convinced of the truth of; neither have I forbore to let the Pope know any of thoſe Reaſons that could ſupport this Doctrine. This is enough, let God do the reſt; if it be his Cauſe that I have vindicated, let us not be concerned at the intentions of Men, or their proceedings; it is God alone that is to be looked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to in all this; let us be the Children of Peace, and Peace will reſt upon us; it will be bitter,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49309:96"/>
but the ſame will be ſo much the more pure. Let us not ſpoil good intentions by an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, by any Heat, by any Humane Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, by any Natural Impreſſion for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of our ſelves. Let us plainly give an account of our Faith; let us ſuffer our ſelves to be Corrected if there be need of it, and let us endure Correction, when we do not even deſerve the ſame. As for you, Sir, you ought to have no other por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein, than Silence, Submiſſion, and Prayer. Pray for me that am under ſuch preſſing difficulty, pray for the Church that undergoes theſe Scandals; pray for thoſe who riſe up againſt me; to the end that they may be endued with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace, in order to undeceive me, if I'am in the wrong, or to do me juſtice if I am otherwiſe. Laſtly, pray for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Prayer it ſelf, which is in danger, and ſtands in need of being juſtified. Perfection is become very ſuſpicious, they are not for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving it ſo far from lazy Chriſtians, and ſuch as are full of ſelf. <hi>Diſintereſted Love</hi> would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be the Spring of Illuſions and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Wickedneſs; they have accuſtomed Chriſtians under pretence of ſafety and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution to ſeek after God no other way than by the motive of their bleſſedneſs, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to themſelves. Thoſe Souls that have made moſt proficiency, are forbid to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49309:96"/>
ſerve God by the pure motive, whereby hitherto it hath been wiſhed that Sinners themſelves would return from their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, I mean the goodneſs of the infinitely amiable God. I know that pure Love and abandoning ones ſelf is abuſed; I know that Hypocrites overthrow the Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch good names; but pure Love is no leſs a perfection of Chriſtianity, and 'tis the worſt of all Remedies to go about to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh thoſe things that are perfect, to prevent being abuſed therewith. God knows how to make better proviſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in than Men. Let us be humble, let us hold our peace, inſtead of reaſoning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Prayer, let us be engaged in it; in ſo doing, we ſhall defend our ſelves, our ſtrength will conſiſt in our ſilence.

            <p>AS we have been long ſince called to bear Witneſs, it's time at laſt we ſhould make anſwer. The moſt Illuſtrious and moſt Reverend Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> as well in the very beginning as Preface of his Book, called <hi>An Explication of the Maxims of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. hath made mention of two of our number, whoſe Doctrine and Deciſions contained in the Thirty Four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, he hath only taken upon him more
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49309:98"/>
fully to explicate; and which the third of us by a publick Act hath agreed to, and Subſcribed.</p>
            <p>The ſame moſt Illuſtrious and moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Arch-biſhop, hath in the Letter he wrote to our Holy Father the Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XII. grounded what he ſays upon the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and Cenſures of the Biſhops againſt ſome Books that have been written; And we were the only three who have thought it our Duty to Cenſure thoſe Books, or rather according to the Author's words, <hi>certain places</hi> in the ſaid Book.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, they are not <hi>ſome places</hi> as the ſame Author ſays, that we have taken upon us to cenſure, but the greateſt part of them; nay and we would have the whole Books condemned, and the Spirit that runs quite thro' them.</p>
            <p>But as the ſame Epiſtle takes notice, <hi>our Zeal is not raiſed</hi> againſt certain Myſtick Perſons in former Ages, who laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pardonable ignorance of Theological Dogma's, but our Cenſures and Articles are level'd at the <hi>Quietiſts</hi> of our own time, who are well known amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Neither have we recourſe <hi>to the obvious and natural ſenſe of things,</hi> as if there were ſome more occult meaning couched under them, which perhaps might at the ſame time be tolerated; but we have thought it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49309:99"/>
neceſſary to expoſe the Poiſon lying hid in thoſe Books.</p>
            <p>We know nothing of any bodies taking occaſion from our Articles and Cenſures, to <hi>deride pure Love and Contemplation, as the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of a troubled Brain;</hi> as the ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intimates.</p>
            <p>It's alſo ſaid in the ſame Letter, That the principal Points which have been treated on in the Book, having been anew Explained, are found to be conformable to the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
            <p>This Concluſion, and the intention we find there is, to have what is contained in the ſaid Book, to be thought agreeable to our Sentiments, we are neceſſitated to explain our ſelves upon this Head, tho' it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble of mind, that we are brought to this Extremity, having before uſed all ſorts of means to gain the Judgment of our Brother herein; 'tis pure neceſſity that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains us hereunto, to the end we may prevent the Belief of our approving this Work; and above all, out of the Fear we are in, leſt our Holy Father the <hi>Pope,</hi> whom we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly honour, and to whom, as to our Head, we are inviolably united, ſhould be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that we favour a Doctrine which the Church condemns.</p>
            <p>We ſhall begin, by ſhewing the Reaſons that occaſion'd the Articles, which the Book
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49309:100"/>
Entituled, <hi>An Expoſition of the Maxims of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. makes mention of. There was a certain Woman living amongſt us, who having put out a Pamphlet called, <hi>a Short Method,</hi> &amp;c. and ſome others alſo, and ſpread up and down certain Manuſcripts of the Quietiſts, ſeemed to us to be a leader of that Sect; ſhe deſired ſhe might be allowed three Counſellors, with whoſe Advice ſhe might acquieſce, the moſt illuſtrious Author of this book was added for a Fourth; the deſign was to conſine her, and thoſe of her Party, within ſome bounds; to remove all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges they had, and to ſhew them from the undoubted Articles of our Faith, the Lord's Prayer, the Doctrine of the Holy Scripture, Holy Tradition, and Saints, that their Tenets were condemned to all intents and purpoſes, either from their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by Councils, and the Apoſtolick See; this was the end of the Articles that contained our deciſions and Cenſures; our buſineſs now, is to ſee whether the ſaid Book did explain and open the ſame, or overthrow them.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, Theological or Divine Hope is taken away in that Book, as well out of the ſtate of Grace, as within it among the perfect.</p>
            <p>And when it is ſaid, that without the ſtate of Grace, before Juſtification, one may love
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49309:101"/>
God with the love of Hope, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that ſelf-love, that is, the love of our own Intereſt and Happineſs, be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Motive of the ſaid love of Hope, and prevalent above the other motive of love to God's Glory; it from thence follows, that Hope which depends upon a created good, and ſelf intereſt, is no Divine or Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Virtue, but a Vice; and thence it is, that that Axiom of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is applyed, tho' in a wrong ſenſe: That which proceeds not from a principle of Charity, proceeds from Concupiſcence, and from that love which is the root of all Vices, and which the Jealous God is ſo much ſet againſt.</p>
            <p>After Juſtification in a perfect ſtate of pure and diſ-intereſted love, he admits of Hope that reſides in the Mind, but doth not move it; becauſe that the love which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Hope, is pure, without any mixture of intereſt, in reſpect to fear or hope, and being, as it were, perfect Charity, it excludes Hope as well as Fear, ſo that the Soul is not at all excited from any motive, or upon the account of ſelf-intereſt, and ſo thoſe incentatives or motives of ſelf-advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſo often inculcated in the Scripture Tradition, and the Prayers of the Church, are utterly excluded from perfect Minds.</p>
            <p>As for the motives of Self-intereſt, the ſame is explained in all the paſſages of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49309:102"/>
Book, in ſuch a manner, that the Soul is to retain no mercenary deſire, and not to love God neither for his deſert, perfection, nor the good that is to be found in loving him, nor yet for everlaſting Rewards, and it would be inſinuated, that it is the common ſentiments of all the Saints, both Ancient and Modern.</p>
            <p>From whence this general Concluſion is made, That this intereſted Motive is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally excluded from all the Virtues of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect minds; an Opinion which is alſo attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to St. <hi>Francis de Sales,</hi> without uſing the place where it is to be met with; tho' in contrariety to this, there are divers paſſages in his Writings that are quite oppoſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>To the ſame end tends alſo what is further ſaid, that we <hi>will</hi> or love God, as he is our good, happineſs and reward; that we love him formally under this preciſion or reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but not becauſe of this reſtriction, and that the formal Object of our hope is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to wit, God our Good, but that we have no mercenary motive thereunto; but this is perfect contrariety, to make that a motive which is no motive, to cut off that hope, which being deſtitute of power to move the Soul, has no more in it than the bare name of hope.</p>
            <p>By theſe Propoſitions, and others alſo,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49309:103"/>
whereby in retaining the name of hope, the thing it ſelf is precluded; the ſenſe of our Firſt and Thirtieth Article, concerning the retaining of the Exerciſe of hope in every condition, is eluded.</p>
            <p>It will ſignify nothing for a Man to ſay, that there are other propoſitions oppoſite hereunto, to be found in ſome places of the ſaid Book. For to be plain in the matter, the ſaid Book contains things that evidently contradict one another; for Example, <hi>God wills that I ſhould love him as he is my Good, Happineſs, and Reward;</hi> very well, but the contrary is repeated again and again, in theſe words. <hi>It's certain, we do not (will the love of God (or our Salvation) as he is the reward of our merits, our ſalvation, our eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, our good, our intereſt, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them.</hi> So manifeſt a Contradiction of Propoſitions and Terms, is ſufficient to prove there is Error in that caſe, and cannot ſerve for an Excuſe for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Moreover the ſtyle of this Book is ſo perplext, and the manner of reaſoning uſed in it ſo ſubtile, that they are quite loſt, there being many places therein where the ſenſe cannot be found out without great trouble and vexation of mind; and this muſt be the Character of an ill-contriv'd Syſtem, and of an Author that ſeeks not ſo much a good temperament of things, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges and ſubtilties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:49309:104"/>
As for what concerns the deſire of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation, the ſaid Author thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf. The deſire of Eternal Salvation is good, but nothing ought to be deſired ſaving the Will of God; a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which he attributes to St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de Sales,</hi> tho' it be not to be met with in any of his Writings.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Book it is alſo ſaid, that there are two different ſtates of the Juſt, one of reſignation; wherein mercenary or ſelf-deſires are ſubjected to the Will of God; another of Holy indifference; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Soul has no mercenary deſire at all, except it be upon ſuch occaſions as when it is wanting to its own grace, and is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſpondent thereunto; to which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the forementioned Heads are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that Salvation is not to be deſired, as it is our good, our reward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe Propoſitions, as well as thoſe that exclude the deſires of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, conceived from motives of Hope, as alſo thoſe others that regard the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Salvation, are rejected in the foreſaid Articles, purſuant to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Holy Scriptures, not only as falſe, but alſo as erroneous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:49309:105"/>
Thoſe ſame Articles particularly condemn that which is affirmed in the ſaid Book, <hi>that holy indifference admits of general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, for the accompliſhment of all the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den will of God;</hi> and though the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of ones own and others reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were contained in this Will, yet his deſires are to be ſo far extended, as to wiſh the accompliſhment of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Neither is there, as the ſaid Book would inſinuate, any room left for Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing all manner of Equivocation is taken away in the ſaid Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the indifference of Salvation, by a clear definition of indifference, which may appertain to the events of this Life, and ſenſible Comforts, but never to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the means that are conducive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. The Author, in order to make the Articles to be equivocal, grounds himſelf upon this Poſition, <hi>that Salvation is to be deſired and wiſhed for as a thing that God would have;</hi> which is right enough, and taken from the very end of Salvation.</p>
            <p>But in his Book he expreſſes himſelf in an excluſive manner, ſaying, that the Soul wills not happineſs for it ſelf, but becauſe it knows God wills it; whereby the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and ſpecific motives of hope are cut off, and a way opened to the pernicious Opinion of indifference; as if ſalvation was
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49309:106"/>
in it ſelf a thing indifferent, and as if the good that was commanded was not in it ſelf deſirable, but only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its being commanded and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the difference that lies between deſirable things, becauſe of the will of God, and thoſe things that are not deſirable, but by reaſon of the will of God, is ſet forth by the Author himſelf, from the very beginning of his Treatiſe, in a paſſage he cites out of St. <hi>Francis de Sales. There is a great deal of difference between theſe words, I love God for the good I expect from him;</hi> and thoſe, <hi>I do not love God but upon account of that good.</hi> which ſhews what diverſity there is often between things that ſeem to be expreſt in very near the ſame words.</p>
            <p>This indifference to Salvation, which is aſſerted throughout the whole Book, gives way to theſe conſequences; that a Soul, in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tryals may be invincibly perſwaded that it is reprobated by God; whereby the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Salvation, which is ordinarily conditional, becomes abſolute; an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible caſe appearing, not only as poſſible, but even as real or actual: And then a director of ones Conſcience may ſuffer a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49309:107"/>
Soul to take up with a bare acquieſce with its own juſt Condemnation, and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Moreover in ſuch a ſtate, it will be to no purpoſe, nay intolerable to ſpeak to him of the Rule of Faith, in relation to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God that is extenſive to all Men, or to offer him Reaſons for his ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>All theſe things are clearly rejected by the Thirty Four Articles, when an abſolute conſent is not allowed of in any probations, or tryals: God forbid it ſhould be ſo; this is a falſe pre-ſuppoſition, and impoſſible, that other Article being premiſed, wherein all deſpair is excluded; and much leſs ſhould the Director of ones Conſcience be allowed to ſuffer Souls ſimply to acquieſce with their own Condemnation, and juſt reprobation. But on the contrary, he is required not to ſuffer any ſuch thing to be. He is ſo far from being adviſed not to preach the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God clearly and diſtinctly, as the ſaid Book aſſerts, that he ought to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in conformity to St. <hi>Francis de Sales,</hi> to aſſure thoſe afflicted Souls, that they ſhall never be forſaken of God, and that his goodneſs is not only general towards all Men, but that the effects of the Divine Mercy is more eſpecially extended unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:49309:108"/>
Again, you have in the Articles all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues both Divine and Moral, ſet forth and diſtinguiſhed, with their Motives; but in the ſaid Books endeavours are uſed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſtinction there made, obſcure, by theſe words. <hi>Pure Love doth of it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Internal Life, it's the only Principle and ſole Motive thereof, all other Motives are taken away, ſave only Charity.</hi> But the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereby Charity is even made to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, ſeems alſo to be taken away, when it is ſaid that this Love becomes by turns to be every diſtinct Virtue, but it ſeeks after no Virtue, as it is a Virtue; and ſo neither is Faith ſought for as Faith, nor Hope as Hope, nor even Charity it ſelf, which is the life and form of Virtue, as a Virtue.</p>
            <p>And ſo allowing theſe Propoſitions to be true, all Virtues are debaſed and thrown out of doors, pure Love will have no other effect than to hinder us to be ſtudious of Virtue; and no one ſhall cultivate the ſame better, than he that neglects it; which makes way for this extravagant, and to this day unheard of propoſition, that Myſtick Saints exclude the practice and acts of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from this ſtate, which are Paradoxes that divert the Mind from the ſtudy of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and impoſe ſtrangely upon Spiritual Perſons, and render the very name of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue it ſelf ſuſpicious and odious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:49309:109"/>
Now we come to another Propoſition that is very agreeable to what precedes; that transformed Souls may and ought according to the preſent Diſcipline, to confeſs their Venial Sins, to ask pardon for their faults, and to pray for the Remiſſion of their Sins, not for their own purification and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but as 'tis a thing agreeable to the will of God, which clearly overthrows the right and intrinſical motive of Repentance, and the ſame is contrary to our Fifteenth Article. Beſides we cannot allow that the Confeſſion of Venial Sins is to be referred only to the diſcipline of the preſent times.</p>
            <p>As for Concupiſcence being perfectly routed out of ſome Souls, though they are but very few, where the ſenſible effects thereof are ſuſpended, or elſe where the Fleſh has been a long time ſubjected to the Spirit; what the ſaid Book ſays in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto, is manifeſtly contradicted by our Seventh and Eighth Articles taken out of the Councils, whence the Author is brought to ſuch a paſs, as to extenuate the uſefulneſs and neceſſity of Mortification, notwithſtanding the practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Saints to the contrary; and this tends to favour the Doctrine diſallowed of in the Eighteenth Article of our Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:49309:110"/>
As for what concerns Contemplation, we find in the ſaid Book, that when 'tis pure and direct, it's not taken up willingly with any ſenſible imagination, with any diſtinct and nameable Idea; that is, with any limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and particular Idea of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that the ſame is confined to an Idea that is purely intellectual, and abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from an Infinite Being. And thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation cannot have the attributes of God, nor the Divine Perſons in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor conſequently the Humane Nature of Chriſt for an Object of its own choice; but only by the repreſentation which God makes of the ſame unto him, and by the inſtinct and impreſſion of peculiar Grace, becauſe the Mind does not voluntarily adhere to theſe Objects; as if neither the goodneſs of the thing it ſelf, nor the exhortations of the Holy Scripture, nor the choice of ones own Will, in conjunction with common Grace, were not ſufficient to make a Man ſeek after them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Principles tend to this concluſion, that Contemplative Souls are in both Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deprived of the diſtinct view of Chriſt, and of his preſence by Faith; that is, both in the very beginning of their Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in their Tryals; and theſe Conditions may laſt a long time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:49309:111"/>
Neither is the Party afraid to reject the diſtinct view of Chriſt to the very inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of Contemplation; as if to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate Chriſt, was to deſcend from the height and purity of Contemplation, as the <hi>Begu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardians</hi> were wont to ſay. By which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and Subtilties, falſe Contemplators are furniſh'd with excuſes, who take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, and are not freely carried into a contemplation of him, and who remove the Divine Attributes and Sacred Perſons in the Trinity far from it, and ſeparate diſtinct Acts of Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, thereby eluding the 1, 2, 3, 4. and 24 Articles.</p>
            <p>We read in the ſaid Treatiſe, that 'tis never lawful to prevent the work of grace, and that a Man is to expect nothing from himſelf by the way of his own induſtry and endeavours.</p>
            <p>By which Propoſition, and all the reſt that is contained in the Eleventh Article of the Book, it appears upon exact examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that that act of the free will, which is properly called excitation, is deſtroyed; thoſe words of the Prophet David, <hi>I will prevent his face,</hi> and that other, <hi>my Prayer ſhall prevent thee,</hi> are thrown out of doors, as is alſo that Maxim of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole diſpenſation of Divine Grace relies. <hi>He cannot be helpt on, unleſs he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49309:112"/>
to do ſomething of his own accord:</hi> that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous diſtinction of Spiritual Men is at the ſame time deſtroyed, who by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent have diſtinguiſhed between thoſe acts that are the product of ones own induſtry and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and thoſe acts that are infuſed moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are wrought by God's act or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, without any mixture of a mans effort therewith. Theſe and the like Propoſitions, overthrow, or at leaſt obſcure the 11. 25. and 26 Articles.</p>
            <p>We do in the ſame Articles reject that continued Act which the <hi>Quietiſts</hi> have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the ſtate of perfection, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſurd in it ſelf, and foreign to the Scriptures and Fathers; and the Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the ſame alſo both in his Treatiſe and in his Letter. Nevertheleſs he falls into the ſame abſurdity, by allowing of ſuch ſtill peaceable Acts, that they have nothing whereby the Soul may be able to make a true diſtinction of them, they being ſuch as are diſturbed with no manner of jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſo uniform and ſo even, that they ſeem as much to be no acts at all, as one continued Act during the whole courſe of ones Life.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we have more particularly taken care in our Articles, leſt Chriſtian Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, holineſs or purity, or the internal Life ſhould be placed in paſſive Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49309:113"/>
other quiet and extraordinary ones of that kind, wherein all contemplative and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal perſons are with us; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the ſaid Book doth aſſert, that the ſame Prayer and Contemplation do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in pure love, which doth not only juſtify and purify of it ſelf, but conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, accompliſh and make perfect, and is conſequently the laſt degree of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian perfection.</p>
            <p>Wherein the Author doth extreamly err, and not only differs from ſpiritual men, but even from himſelf. He differs from ſpiritual Perſons or Myſticks, who in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance to the Authority of St. <hi>Thereſia,</hi> the Expoſitions of <hi>John de Jeſus,</hi> and the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of <hi>James Alvarez de Paz,</hi> who was a follower of them, and that of St. <hi>Francis de Sales</hi> and ſeveral others, have taught, that either a perſon may arrive at a ſtate of perfection without quiet prayer, or that this Prayer is in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch bleſſings, as ſeem very much to appertain to thoſe graces that are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free; that it is neither of a perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, and juſtifies no man, yea, and that the ſame may conſiſt with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin. He differs from himſelf, in that he aſſerts every where, That Chriſtian perfection conſiſts in this ſort of Prayer, which is nothing elſe but a love that is
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49309:114"/>
very pure, and teaches, at the ſame time, the greateſt part of holy Souls, and thoſe who by a peculiar Title are called Saints, could never attain to this ſort of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor conſequently to perfection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had not the inward light, nor the advantages of attractive Grace.</p>
            <p>From hence he conludes that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of pure love, wherein all Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick perfection doth conſiſt, and to which all Tradition beareth a Teſtimony, is yet a myſtery, which is concealed not only from Chriſtians in general, but even from the greateſt part of Saints, and that 'tis the buſineſs of a director of Mens Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to leave the ſame unto God, and to wait for his opening the Heart by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Unction; as if the word of the Goſpel would be of no uſe to thoſe who ought to be endued with pure love, as if Unction ſhould exclude and ſhut out the good word of Salvation.</p>
            <p>From whence it follows, that that command of Chriſt, <hi>Be ye perfect,</hi> doth not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Saints, nor that neither, <hi>thou ſhalt love,</hi> &amp;c. which derogate from the perfection of Chriſtian calling.</p>
            <p>There is alſo as much contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe Propoſitions, That the gift of pure Love and Contemplation depends upon grace or divine inſpiration, which is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49309:115"/>
common to all that are juſtifyed, and that yet there are many Saints to whom the ſame is not communicated, and which would be but a trouble and offence to them, were the ſame propoſed to them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things therefore, and thoſe other before mention'd, which run through the whole Book, are contrary to our Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and the Thirty Four Articles ſo often mentioned; neither are thoſe that follow leſs oppoſite to the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or any more conſonant to Truth.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, altho' the ſaid Book doth in the beginning, and in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places onwards, make an enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of falſe ſpirituallizers, (If I may ſo call them) whereof he makes the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> of old, the <hi>Beguardians</hi> in the middle age, and the late <hi>Illuminates</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> to be of the number; yet he makes no manner of mention of <hi>Molinos</hi> and his followers, nor more particularly of that Woman up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe account the Articles were fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; whereas in the mean time it muſt be ſaid, that they ſhould have been chiefly ſpoken of, ſeeing the whole Church is filled with the noiſe their Writings have made, and the Cenſures paſt upon them by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:49309:116"/>
To which theſe Poſitions muſt in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be added, that the love of pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, how impious and ſacrilegious ſoever it be, doth yet prepare Sinners for to be juſtifyed and converted, tho' this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration proceeds from no other motions than ſuch as are excited by the Spirit, or at leaſt, the impulſe thereof.</p>
            <p>That juſtifying love, whereby a perſon ſeeks not its own happineſs, but as a means that doth refer unto, and ſubordinates it ſelf to the laſt end, which is God's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is in this Book called mercenary, which is contrary to the judgment of the Schools, and that Axiom of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> ſo well known among Divines, <hi>That we are to deliver our ſelves according to a known Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That an impoſſible caſe, to wit, that a juſt Soul who loves God even to the end, ſhould yet be condemned to eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is rendred poſſible; and that St <hi>Francis de Sales</hi> ſeems to have found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be in the ſame ſtate, tho neither he himſelf, nor any of thoſe that have writ his Life, ſay any thing of it, and that no juſt Soul can be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:49309:117"/>
That direct Acts, and ſuch as eſcape the reflections of the Soul, are the very ſame operation of the Soul, which, by St. <hi>Francis de Sales,</hi> are called the top of the Soul; tho' he ſays nothing of it in all his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            <p>That in theſe Acts there is a ſtrange and unheard of diviſion of the Soul in it ſelf to be found; ſince perfect Hope ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the upper part, as the lower is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd to deſpair; and which is worſe, the former is in direct Acts, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reflex ones, which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the moſt deliberate and efficacious, eſpecially if allowed by the director of the Conſcience, inſomuch, that Hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expelled by reflex Acts, ſubſiſts in thoſe that are direct.</p>
            <p>That in this diviſion of the Soul labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under an unvoluntary impreſſion of deſpair, and making an abſolute Sacrifice of its own intereſt for that of Eternity; it doth die on the Croſs with Chriſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>my God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me,</hi> as if deſpairing Souls could expire with Chriſt, and yet bewail their ſtate, in being forſaken by him.</p>
            <p>That in theſe laſt Tryals or Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he makes a ſeparation between the Soul and it ſelf, according to the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, who is our pattern, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49309:118"/>
the inferior part had no Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſuperior, neither in its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary troubles, nor faintings; that in this ſeparation, the motions of our inferior part are blind, and full of unvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Trouble. As if there had been ſuch perturbations in Chriſt, as there are in us; which is an abominable Opinion, and which the fam'd <hi>Sophronius</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as ſuch, with the approbation of the ſixth Council.</p>
            <p>As for the Tradition of all ages, which is continually alledged in the ſaid Book; we may learn what that was from St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de Sales</hi> alone, whom the Author ſo much inſiſts upon, and tho he be the only Authority almoſt, cited by him in his Works, yet he quotes him ſeveral times to ill purpoſe, and that in relation to very important points, whereon the whole foundation of his Book depends, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſhewed in ſome meaſure, in what has been ſaid before, we ſhall now, for brevity ſake, paſs over, and defer the ſame, with divers other things, to another opportunity, as we ſhall alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the examination of Vocal Prayer, the nature of Contemplation, human Acts, and Tryals; the three Marks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Vocation is known from Meditation to Contemplation. And laſtly, ſeveral Texts
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49309:119"/>
of Scripture, which inſtead of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, according to the natural mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, have been made to bear a new and unheard of Interpretation.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we cannot but wonder, ſeeing this Book treats of the love of ſuch as are perfect, that yet it takes no manner of notice of a love of gratitude towards God and Chriſt our Saviour, as if theſe things were no ways proper to ſtir up, and inflame true Charity; or that the ſame derogated from pure love, or that ſuch as are perfect, ought to neglect them.</p>
            <p>Neither are we leſs amazed, that in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that defines hope to be in it ſelf good, and agreeable to the ſtate of Saints; that this which is contained in the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, is omitted, <hi>viz.</hi> That the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt perfect, ſuch as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> were, were ſtirred up by this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as is eſpecially ſet forth in the ſame Council, which ſays, <hi>That eternal life is to be propoſed as a Reward to all thoſe that continued in the performance of good Works to the end, and put their hope in God;</hi> and ſo by conſequence to all the Saints, and ſuch as are moſt perfect; by which motive they are not at all made mercenary, but Children, that by the way
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49309:120"/>
of Charity, are aiming at their Father's Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Hereunto it muſt be added, that the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions diſperſed up and down in this work, tend (tho' againſt the Author's intention) to promote that Notion, that Vice, by the help of direct Acts, may ſubſiſt with the Virtue that is oppoſite to it; ſo as that while the Soul, thro' an inconſiderate Zeal for the Juſtice of God, doth acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce with the whole ſecret will of God; it doth imprudently conſent to its own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and abſolute Reprobation, and ſo we ſhall be brought, contrary to the Apoſtles prohibition, to be taken with <hi>ſubtilties and vain bablings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, the groans of the Church, which is but as a ſojourner here below, and longs to return to her own Countrey, are ſtifled; St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Saints, who in their Martyrdom, have been helpt up with the hopes they had of Happineſs, and counted the ſame to be gain, are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by turned off as mercenary Souls; but <hi>we having the form of ſound words,</hi> and being deſirous to follow the footſteps of the Saints, do not meaſure impoſſible and abſurd things with Chriſtian Piety and Perfection; neither do we believe that ſome extraordinary and unuſual Affections, which a few Saints have been a little ſubject to and that by the by,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49309:121"/>
ought therefore to be preſently turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rules, and eſteemed as a particular ſtate of Life; we do not call thoſe Wills or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, which are converſant about impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities, true Wills and real Conſents, but veleities, as the Schools alſo term them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things therefore we have received from our Anceſtors; theſe are our Thoughts, and our Will is that all the World may know them.

            </head>
            <p n="1">1. EVery Chriſtian in every Condition, tho' not every moment, is obliged to live in an Exerciſe of Faith, Hope and Charity, and to produce diſtinct Acts of them, as they are three ſeveral Virtues.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every Chriſtian is obliged to have an explicite Faith, in Almighty God, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Heaven and Earth, the rewarder of all that ſeek him; and in his other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes that are alike revealed; and to put this Faith into actual Exerciſe, tho' not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Every Chriſtian in like manner, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to have an explicit Faith in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and to act this Faith in every condition, tho' not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:49309:122"/>
4. Every Chriſtian is alſo oblig'd to have an explicite Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, God and Man, as Mediator, without whom he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not draw nigh to God, and to act this Faith in every condition, tho' not every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Every Chriſtian in every Condition, tho' not every moment, is obliged to will, deſire, and explicitly to ſeek his own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation, as a thing which God willeth, and which he would have us will for his Glory.</p>
            <p n="6">6. God will have every Chriſtian in every Condition, tho not every moment, expreſly to ask of him the forgiveneſs of his Sins, grace to abſtain from them, perſeverance in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, the increaſe of Virtue, and every other thing that is neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A Chriſtian in every Condition is to ſtrive againſt Concupiſcence, tho' not at all times alike, which doth engage him in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Condition, tho' not every moment, to pray for ſtrength againſt Temptations.</p>
            <p n="8">8. All theſe Propoſitions are according to the Catholick Faith, being expreſly contained in the Apoſtle's-Creed, and the Lord's-Prayer, which is a common and daily Prayer to be uſed by all the Children of God; or elſe expreſly defin'd by the Church; as is that of asking forgiveneſs of Sins, and the gift of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49309:123"/>
perſeverance, and that of ſtriving againſt Covetouſneſs, in the Councils of <hi>Carthage, Orange,</hi> and <hi>Trent;</hi> as thoſe Propoſitions that are contrary thereunto, are formally Heretical.</p>
            <p n="9">9. A Chriſtian is not allowed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in the matter of his Salvation, nor in thoſe that tend thereunto; holy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indifference regards the events of this Life (Sin only reſerved) and the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Comforts, or Spiritual droughts.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The fore-mentioned Acts do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the higheſt Chriſtian perfection, and ceaſe not to be perfect, becauſe they are perceivable, provided Thanks be given to God for them, and that the ſame be done to his Glory.</p>
            <p n="11">11. A Chriſtian is not allowed to expect, that God ſhould inſpire theſe acts into him by any particular way and inſpiration, there is nothing required for the exciting of them in us, but Faith which makes the Will of God known, as ſignified and ſet forth in his Commandments and the Examples of the Saints, by ſuppoſing always the ſupplies of his exciting and preventing Grace. The three laſt Propoſitions, are the manifeſt conſequences of the preceding ones; and ſuch as are contrary thereunto, are raſh and erroneous.</p>
            <p n="12">12. By the obligatory Acts aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49309:123"/>
we are not to underſtand ſuch Acts as are methodical and orderly, much leſs thoſe Acts that are reduced to Forms and definite words; or troubleſome and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs acts; but acts formed with ſincerity in the heart, with all holy ſweetneſs, and tranquility inwrought by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p n="13">13. In that Life and Prayer that is moſt perfect, all theſe acts are united in Charity alone, ſeeing all virtues are animated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and the Exerciſe of them commanded by it, according to that of St. <hi>Paul, Charity ſuffers all, believes all, hopes all, bears all.</hi> So much cannot be ſaid of other Chriſtian acts, whoſe diſtinct exerciſes are exerciſed and regulated hereby, tho' they may not always be ſenſibly and diſtinctly diſcerned.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The deſire that is to be ſeen in the Saints, as in St. <hi>Paul</hi> and others, of their eternal Salvation, and perfect redemption, is not only a deſire or indeliberate appetite, as the ſame St <hi>Paul</hi> calls it; but a good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we are to form, and freely to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in our ſelves, by the aſſiſtances of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, as being perfectly conformable to the will of God. This Propoſition is clearly revealed, and the contrary Doctrine Heretical.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Its, in like manner, a Will conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Will of God, and abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in every Condition, tho' not every
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49309:124"/>
moment not to will ſin, and not only to condemn Sin, but alſo to be ſorry for the Commiſſion of it, and to deſire the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thereof in us by forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Reflection upon ones ſelf, upon his Acts, and the Gifts he has received, which has been practiced throughout by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, in order to give thanks unto God for his Benefits, and other the like ends, are propoſed as an Example to all Believers, and even to the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and that Doctrine which takes theſe away, is erroneous, and nigh to be Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
            <p n="17">17. There are no evil and dangerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, but thoſe wherein a man takes a review of his actions, and the Gifts he hath received, in order to feed ſelf-love, to ſeek out a common ſupport, or to take up too much with himſelf.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Mortifications are agreeable to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in every ſtate, and are often neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to make the ſame ſeparate from the duty of Believers, under a pretence of perfection, is openly to condemn St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and to preſuppoſe an Erroneous and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="29">29. Continual Prayer conſiſts not in one perpetual act, which is ſuppoſed to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, and which alſo ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be repeated; but in a diſpoſition,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49309:124"/>
and habitual and perpetual preparation to do nothing that is diſpleaſing unto God, and to do every thing that is pleaſing to him. The contrary Propoſition, that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in any condition whatſoever, yea, in a ſtate which is perfect, all pluralities and ſucceſſion of acts, is erroneous, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Tradition of all the Saints.</p>
            <p n="20">20. There are no Apoſtolick Traditions but thoſe that are acknowledged for ſuch by the whole Church, and the Authority whereof is decided by the Councils of <hi>Trent;</hi> the contrary propoſition is Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and pretendedly ſecret Apoſtolical Traditions, would be a Snare to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and a way to introduce all manner of evil Doctrines.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Dilatory and quiet Prayer, or ſuch as is attended with the ſimple preſence of God, and all other extraordinary Prayers not excluding paſſive ones, approved of by St. <hi>Francis de Sales,</hi> and other ſpiritual ones received by the whole Church, are not to be rejected, nor ſuſpected without great raſhneſs, and they do not hinder a man from being always diſpoſed to produce all the forementioned acts in convenient time; but to reduce them to implicit or apparent acts in favour of the moſt perfect, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that the love of God ties them all up to a certain method, is to elude the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49309:125"/>
obligation, and to deſtroy that diſtinction which is revealed by God.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Without theſe extraordinary Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, one may become a very great Saint, and attain to Chriſtian Perfection.</p>
            <p n="23">23. To reduce the inward ſtate and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of the Soul, to theſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prayers, is a manifeſt Error.</p>
            <p n="24">24. It's alike dangerous to exclude the ſtate of Contemplation, the Attributes, the three Divine Perſons in the Trinity, and the Myſteries of the Incarnation of the Son of God, and more eſpecially, that of the Croſs and of the Reſurrection; and all thoſe things that are ſeen no otherwiſe than by Faith, are the Object of a Chriſtians Contemplation.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Its not allowable for a Chriſtian, under pretence of paſſive, or other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Prayer, to expect that God, in the Conduct, as well of the Spiritual as temporal Life, ſhould determin him to every action, by way of particular inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the contrary leads men to Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, careleſneſs, and the tempting of God.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Laying aſide the circumſtance and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Prophetical or extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration; the true ſubmiſſion which every Chriſtian Soul, tho' perfect, owes to God, conſiſts in ſerving him with the natural and ſupernatural Light, as he received the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49309:125"/>
ſame, and according to the Rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian prudence, in preſuppoſing always that God directs all things in the Courſe of his Providence, and that he is the Author of every good Counſel.</p>
            <p n="27">27. We ought not to tye up the gift of Prophecy, and much leſs the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtate, to a certain ſtate of perfection and Prayer, and to do ſo, is to bring in an Illuſion, raſhneſs and Error.</p>
            <p n="28">28. The extraordinary ways and marks which thoſe that have been approved Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualiſts, have given concerning themſelves, are very rare, and ſubject to the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhops, Eccleſiaſtical Superiors and Doctors, who are to judge of the ſame, not ſo much according to Experiences, as according to the immutable Rules of the Scriptures and of Tradition; and to teach and practice the contrary, is to ſhake off the Yoke of Obedience that is due to the Church.</p>
            <p n="29">29. If there is, or if there has been, in any part of the World, a ſmall number of choſen ones, whom God by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and particular way of prevention, beſt known to himſelf, ſtirs up every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch a manner, to all thoſe actions that are eſſential to Chriſtianity, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good works, whereof there was no neceſſity of giving them any preſcriptions

to excite them thereunto, we will leave them to the judgment of the Almighty, and without avowing the like ſtates, we do only make this practical Obſervation, that there is nothing ſo dangerous, nor ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Illuſion, as to guide Souls in ſuch a manner, as if they had already attained thereto, and that however, it is not in theſe ſort of preventions that Chriſtian perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="30">30. In all the above named Articles, as to what regards Concupiſcence, imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and principally ſin, our meaning is not, for the honour of our Lord, to take in the Holy Virgin his Mother.</p>
            <p n="31">31. As for thoſe Souls whom God is pleaſed to exerciſe with Tryals, <hi>Job,</hi> who is a pattern for ſuch, teaches them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit themſelves by lucid intervals, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to produce the moſt excellent acts of Faith, Hope and Love. The Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts teach them to find theſe in the top or higheſt part of the Soul. They are not therefore to be allowed to acquieſce in their apparent damnation, but their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, with St. <hi>Francis de Sales,</hi> are to aſſure them that God will never forſake them.</p>

               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:49309:126"/>
32. It's well in every condition, and eſpecially in this ſame, to adore the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Juſtice of God, never to wiſh the exerciſe of the ſame upon our ſelves, in all its rigour, ſeeing that even one of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this rigour, is to deprive us of Love. Chriſtian Abandoning is to caſt all our Cares upon God, to hope in his goodneſs for our ſalvation; and as St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> after St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> teaches us, to attribute all to him, <hi>ut totum detur Deo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="33">33. Troubled and truly humbled Souls may alſo be inſpired with a ſubmiſſion and agreement to the Will of God, tho' e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a very falſe ſuppoſition, inſtead of the eternal good which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the Juſt, he would detain them by virtue of his own good pleaſure, in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments; and this without being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, at the ſame time, of his Grace and Love; which is an act of perfect reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſelf-abandoning, and of a pure love practiſed by the Saints, and which may be uſeful with that particular grace of God to Souls truly perfect, without derogating from the Obligation of the other fore-mentioned Acts, which are eſſential to Chriſtianity.</p>

Over and above which, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Perfect, and ſuch as are No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, or beginners, ought to be condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted reſpectively, by different ways, and that the former have a more full and deeper inſight into Chriſtian Truths than the other.</p>

            <p>THE Book written by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> having for ſome Months paſt, made much noiſe in the Church within my Kingdom, I cauſed the ſame to be Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by my Biſhops, a great number of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and learned Religionaries of ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They have all, as well Biſhops as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, unanimouſly reported, that it was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill and dangerous Book, and that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation publiſhed by the ſaid Archbiſhop, was unwarrantable. He declared in his Preface, that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49309:128"/>
his intention only, was to Explicate the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his Brethren, who, after they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by all gentle ways to reclaim him, they found themſelves obliged in Conſcience, to put out their Declaration concerning his Book, and to conſign the ſame into the Hands of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Damas,</hi> your Holineſs's <hi>Nuncio</hi> at my Court, to the end that your Holineſs might put an end to an Affair, that may have pernicious Conſequences, if it be not nipt in the very Bud.
