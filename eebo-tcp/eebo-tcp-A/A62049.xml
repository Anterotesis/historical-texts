            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Have ſaid.</hi> How God ſpeaketh, is a point almoſt unſpeakable. God ſpeaketh or ſaith as well as man, but not after the ſame manner; he doth not form a voyce by ſuch organs or inſtruments of ſpeech. But when God ſpeaketh, He doth either create a voyce in the air, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. or declare and make known his mind, ſometimes ſecretly and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſpirits of the Prophets; ſo that phraſe <hi>The word of the Lord came unto me,</hi> ſo frequently uſed in Scripture, is to be underſtood; ſometimes publickly and mediately by the Prophets to the people.</p>
            <p>So then, <hi>I have ſaid,</hi> that is, I have in my Word manifeſted this to be my will; That ye ſhould be Gods amongſt men, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.28. I that ſpeak, and none may (or who dareth) diſannul it: I who ſaid <hi>Let there be light, and there was light;</hi> I who <hi>appointed the Sun to rule the day, the Moon and the Stars to rule the night; I have ſaid,</hi> Be ye Gods, and ye ſhall be Gods. I have appointed you in power and dignity to excel others, and to rule over them on earth, as the greater Luminaries do the leſſer in the Heavens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ye are Gods.</hi> That is, in my place and ſtead amongſt men. To receive honour from them both of reverence and obedience; To diſtribute juſtice

amongſt them both zealouſly and impartially. To be terrours to evil doers, and encouragements to them that do well; To govern from love to my Name, according to the rule of my Law, for my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praiſe, as likewiſe the good and profit of the people.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>God</hi> is taken diverſly in Scripture,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Properly,</hi> and ſo it is given only to him who is Eſſentially and by Nature God.

            <p>
               <hi>That the God of Heaven hath appointed Magiſtrates to be Gods on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is God by Nature, and he hath given them to be Gods by Name. The Deity was by Incarnation cloathed with the Humane Nature; and Humanity is here by Gods deſignation cloathed with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine name, <hi>I will praiſe thee before the Gods,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64745:8"/>
               <hi>David; Pſal.</hi> 83.1. that is, The tune of my heart ſhall be high in ſinging thy praiſe, even before them that are by thy command higheſt in place.</p>
            <p>The Sun in the higher world ſhineth moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, yet he communicateth ſome of his light to the Moon, whereby ſhe ſurpaſſeth (and is as Queen among) the glittering Stars: So God the true Sun is infinitely above all; he ſhineth eminently with his own native light and luſtre; yet he beſtoweth of his beauty and brightneſs on ſome men, whereby they excel and are above others in this lower world.</p>
            <p>For the Explication of this truth, I ſhall only ſhew in what reſpects Magiſtrates are called Gods, and then proceed to Application.</p>
            <p>Magiſtrates are in a two-fold reſpect called Gods.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of their honourable dignity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reſpect of their anſwerable Duty.</p>
            <p>It ſpeaketh that their priviledge is high, and that their practices ſhould be holy.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Ceterum hic nomen ſicuti paulo poſt, &amp; aliis locis pro judicibus ſumitur, quibus ſpecialem gloriae notam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculpſit Deus, <hi>Calv. in Pſal. 82.1.</hi>
               </note>1. In reſpect of their Dignity, God ſpeaketh the nature of Magiſtracy to be honourable by the names which he giveth to the Magiſtrate. Government is not a mean employment, but a great preferment. Magiſtracy is here by God himſelf inveſted with Majeſty.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable that God aſcribeth to Magiſtrates the moſt honourable names among men. Great men, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.38. Nobles, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30. Princes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.11.

The Ancients of the people, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3.12. not only becauſe aged perſons were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily elected; for <hi>with the ancient is wiſdom, and in length of dayes underſtanding,</hi>

perſons. Men are commanded to bow down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hoary head, and reverence the Ancient, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.32.</p>
            <p>Nay, God giveth Magiſtrates not only thoſe names which are in moſt eſteem amongſt men; but the names of Angels.</p>
            <p>Angels are the perfection, as it were, of the Creation, the top-ſtone of this glorious building. When the Spirit of God would ſpeak a thing, or perſon to be excellent, it doth reſemble them to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. <hi>My Lord is wiſe as an Angel of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.20. And <hi>Acts</hi> 6.15. <hi>They beheld his face as if it had been the face of an Angel.</hi> Farther the great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of holy ones in heaven is ſet forth by their likeneſs to Angels; <hi>They ſhall be as Angels, Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30. Now what glorious perſons then are Magiſtrates, that have the names of Angels given them; Angels are called <hi>Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.21. So are Magiſtrates, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 8. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. <hi>Be ſubject to Principalities and Powers;</hi> But the Text ſpeaketh more of their dignity. Magiſtrates have not only the higheſt names of the moſt honourable viſible creatures, Men; and of the moſt honourable inviſible creatures, Angels; but of the Creatour, of God himſelf, the Fountain and Standard of all Dignity and Honour; <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods.</hi> When <hi>Jacob</hi> would manifeſt to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> children the extraordinary reſpect he had for their father, he doth it thus; <hi>My Name be named on them, and the Names of my Father</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Iſaac, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16. It is a great honour to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſervant of God. <hi>Paul</hi> gloried in this, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.1. So did <hi>David,</hi> more in being a ſubject to God, then a King over men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. Title. It is a greater honour and favour to be called Gods ſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Is it a mean thing,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, to be the Kings Son in law?</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.23. Magiſtrates are children of the moſt High, they are
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64745:9"/>
ſons to the King of Kings. But the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of all is to be called Gods; for God to ſay My name be named on them, This is the higheſt name that can be given; Here is a <hi>ne plus ultra.</hi> This is the higheſt Name which is above all names, and as the Diamond to the Ring, addeth both vertue and value to whatſoever it is affixed.</p>
            <p>As becauſe Gold is the moſt precious excellent metal, therefore we lay gold over other things; we guild peuter braſs, yea ſilver it ſelf. So becauſe God is the moſt excellent name, it is laid to other things, that thereby their worth may be ſet forth: As <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> Job 1.6. <hi>The City of God,</hi> Pſal. 46.4. <hi>The River of God,</hi> Pſal. 65.9. <hi>The Kingdom of God</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">It is ordinary in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> to adde the name of God to a thing to heighten the excellency of it. A man of God is as much as an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary man, an excellent man. It is ſaid of the Church compared to a Vine, <hi>She ſent forth her branches as goodly Cedars, Pſal.</hi> 80.10. ſo we read it; But in Hebr. <hi>As the Cedars of God,</hi> that is, tall, and excellent Cedars; and ſo in many other places, becauſe all the creature excellencies are derived from him, and are but a drop, a beam, a print of that Glory and Majeſty which is in him.</note>.</p>

               </note>Now in their dignity Magiſtrates reſemble God in theſe two or three particulars, and therefore are fitly called Gods.</p>

               <note place="margin">This is a godlike preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. <hi>God is cloathed with Majeſty and honour, Pſal.</hi> 104.1.

There is naturally in man an aw and reſpect towards thoſe that are Magiſtrates: They are the Fathers of their Countrey, and their ſubjects like children owe them both obedience and reverence. Divine worſhip is to be given only to God in heaven, but civil worſhip may be given to Gods on earth. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelf being a King, <hi>His glory is great in thy ſalvation, Honour, and Majeſty haſt thou put upon him,</hi> Pſal. 21.5.</p>

God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath the greateſt honour as the Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Law-giver, but Magiſtrates receive it upon his account, as they are his Repreſentatives and Vicegerents. <hi>When I went out to the gate,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, their dignity appeareth (and in this they reſemble God alſo) in giving Laws to others. Magiſtrates have power to enact laws for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of vertue, and diſcouraging of vice,<note place="margin">This is a Godlike privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Iſa</hi> 33.21. to make laws for men, to preſcribe what creatures ſhall do; and what they ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear. <hi>Zanch. de Magiſtrat.</hi>

            <p>There is indeed one Supreme and abſolute Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, <hi>James</hi> 4.12. whoſe will and word muſt be the rule of others laws. Beſides in ſpirituals, none can give laws to bind the conſcience but God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.21. In that ſenſe, <hi>The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver;</hi> but in external policy the Laws of men are to be obſerved. And they have power to make ſuch laws as are ſutable unto, and convenient for the wealth and ſafety of their Dominions.</p>
            <p>The end of Magiſtracy ſheweth their legiſlative authority; for neither will piety be promoted,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64745:10"/>
nor the publike good procured, or peace preſerved without it. And queſtionleſs God would never have injoyned Subjects to obey, if Magiſtrates had not power to command.</p>

               </note>Laws are the walls and Bulwarks of a Nation, which in a great part may ſecure it againſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from abroad, and inſurrections at home. The ſtanding Militia which protecteth the lives of the people. The hedge which keeps men in from oppreſſing their neighbours.

They are the nerves and ſinews of the Body Politick, or as Phyſick to the natural body, to prevent diſeaſes and purge out ill humours.</p>
            <p>Man is by nature an untamed Heifer, loathing the yoke of ſubjection, prone to rage and rebel; ſo that he needeth all means imaginable to rule and reſtrain him. The wiſe Governour of all things hath therefore thought fit not only to give Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians a natural law and moral law from himſelf, but alſo poſitive laws from men, that this threefold cord which is not eaſily broken may bind him faſt. And this ſurely ſpeaketh Magiſtrates to be like God; for even the Heathen themſelves would aſcribe their laws to ſome one of their Gods. <hi>Zoroaſtres</hi> who gave laws to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> aſcribed them to <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazen. Triſmegiſtus</hi> among the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> aſcribed his Laws to <hi>Mercurius; Lycurgus,</hi> who gave laws to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> would make <hi>Apollo</hi> the Author of them. <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Draco</hi> among the <hi>Aehenians,</hi> ſaid that <hi>Minerva</hi> was their Law-giver. So almoſt in every Nation they who had the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power, aſcribed the invention of their laws to their falſe gods. But the Word of God which is a perfect rule for all men, doth impower Magiſtrates to make laws (not according to their luſts, but) agreeable to his revealed will.</p>

A Law unexecuted is like a ſword without an edge for no uſe or ſervice.

            <p>God will not upon any pretence whatſoever have his own perſon accepted, <hi>Job</hi> 13.8. much leſs the perſons of men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In not ſparing or fearing any for their greatneſs.

The great God of heaven feareth none, ſpareth none for their glory or greatneſs. <hi>He putteth the mighty out of their Seats,</hi> Luke 1.52. <hi>He bindeth Kings in chains, and Princes in Fetters of Iron,</hi> Pſal. 149.8. <hi>The day of the Lord ſhall be upon all the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of</hi> Lebanon <hi>that are high and lifted up, and upon all the Oaks of</hi> Baſhan, <hi>and upon all the high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and upon every high Tower, and upon every fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Wall,</hi> Iſa. 2.12, 13, 14.

Great men oftentimes are like Lions, or ravenous Beaſts, that prey on others without fear or pitty.

He is a baſe hireling that hides his head when the Wolf cometh in the night, though he endeavour to preſerve his ſheep from injury by the flies in the day. For one Wolf will do more miſchief in a night then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand flies in a year. As the day of judgement will make no difference between great and ſmall, rich and poor, noble and ignoble; for then the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief Captains and the mighty men will hide themſelves in the dens, and in the rocks of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and will ſay to the Mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the wrath of the Lamb <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15, 16. ſo ſhould not the day of executing juſtice in this world<note n="*" place="margin">Of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour it is ſaid that he neither feared nor hated any man, but that he heard the cauſes of his ſubjects without prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care impiety, examined them without ſiniſter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity, and judged them without unjuſt partiality.</note>.</p>
            <p>The impartiality of God, and alſo of the Gods, conſiſteth in not taking gifts. God is no taker of gifts, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Riches prevail not in the day of wrath,</hi> Prov. 11.4. <hi>Neither ſilver nor gold can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from his indignation,</hi> Zeph. 1.18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:64745:13"/>Thus ſhould Magiſtrates reſemble his Majeſty, not perverting juſtice either for having, or for hope of a reward. A bribe received or expected clogs or obſcures the courſe of Juſtice. A golden pen muſt not write the diſcharge: when the hand of a Judge is greaſed with gold, it cannot hold the ſword of juſtice, but will let it ſlip, at leaſt ſtrike ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry partially.</p>

               <hi>Thou ſhalt not wreſt judgement, thou ſhalt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect perſons, neither take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wiſe, and pervert the words of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi>

               </note> Now this is the Word of God which cometh to the Magiſtrate, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 10.35. authorizing him and appointing him to that Ordinance. The Magiſtrate is therefore called <hi>the Miniſter of God, Rom.</hi> 13.4. As Juſtices are called the Kings Juſtices, becauſe they act by Commiſſion from him: ſo Magiſtrates are called the Lords Miniſters, becauſe they rule by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority derived from the Lord. Coin is carryed to the Mint, and there ſtamped with the Superſcription and Image of the chief Magiſtrate, and then called his Coin, becauſe currant by his authority.</p>
            <p>Governours are not of the Devil, as Satanical ſpirits have affirmed, nor of men, as others have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted; but of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.</p>
            <p>As in the waters there be ſome greater, ſome ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler fiſh; and in the earth there be Mountains and Hills as well as Plains and Valleys; and in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens there are Stars differing from each other in glory; ſo amongſt men there are ſome greater then others in power, higher in place, and excelling them in authority and glory.</p>
            <p>As the natural body is diſtinguiſhed by God himſelf into comely and uncomely parts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.23, 24. ſo is the Political body into members Noble and Ignoble:</p>

Mights, Archangels, and Angels: As alſo they aſſert the reaſon of theſe ſeveral names. But the more modeſt and learned Expoſitors who joyn not in the aforeſaid preſumptuous diviſion, do yet generally conclude an order, diſtinction, and preheminence amongſt Angels, from <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.13. Nay, there is a government amongſt the very Devils; there is not only a Prince of Angels, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. but <hi>Beelzebub</hi> a Prince amongſt Devils, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24.

There is a kind of government in Hell, though ſome would turn all out of the earth.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> indeed calleth Magiſtracy an ordinance of man, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. though <hi>Paul</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us it is of God; <hi>The Powers that be are ordained of God, Rom.</hi> 13.1. And the Magiſtrate <hi>is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God,</hi> verſ. 4.</p>
            <p>Magiſtracy is an ordinance of man in a fourfold reſpect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Subjective.</hi> As man is the ſubject thereof, by them it is executed. Our Princes as well as our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are men of like paſſions with us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Objective.</hi> As man is the object thereof, about them it is exerciſed. It is for the puniſhment of bad men, and encouragement of good men, for the deciding differences between man and man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Finaliter.</hi> As man is the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. He is the Miniſter of God for mans good.</p>
            <p>But theſe things will not prove Magiſtracy to be a meer humane Ordinance; for in theſe three reſpects the Miniſtry as well as the Magiſtracy may be ſaid to be an humane Ordinance; Man being both the ſubject, object, and end thereof; yet what ſober man ever denyed the miniſtry to be an Ordinance of God?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:64745:14"/>4. It is Ordinance of man in regard of the kind of it: Each Nation having a liberty to chooſe what form of Government they apprehend moſt commodious for them. Magiſtracy is Ordained by God, though this particular Magiſtrate, or this form of Government be appointed by man. The Genus of Magiſtracy is from God; yet the Species, whether Monarchy, Democracy, or Ariſtocracy may be at the choice of men.</p>
            <p>Further, though the Magiſtrate ſhould be of the Devil, a wicked ungodly perſon; yet the Magiſtracy is of God.</p>
            <p>There is a difference between the Office or Power it ſelf, and the manner of exerciſing it, and the means of attaining it. The firſt is alwayes of God, but not alwayes the ſecond and third. The power of <hi>Nero</hi> was of God, (as the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh! ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.) though he exerciſed it in a Devilliſh manner, oppreſſing and killing the good, encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acquitting ſuch as were evil. The power of our <hi>Richard</hi> the third was of God, though he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it by ungodly and devilliſh means, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his own Soveraign and Nephew.</p>
            <p>There are four particulars which will clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the truth of this aſſertion, namely, That Magiſtracy is of Divine Authority.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Their Commiſſion is from God.<note place="margin">

commiſſionated him to rule over men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.37, 38. <hi>Thou O King art a King of Kings; for the God of Heaven hath given thee a Kingdom, power, and ſtrength, and glory. And whereſoever the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men dwell, the beaſts of the field, and the fowls of heaven hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee Ruler over them all, thou art this head of Gold.</hi> Theſe higher Powers are ſo clearly from the higheſt Power, that their Throne is called Gods Throne, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.23. <hi>Then</hi> Solomon <hi>ſate on the Throne of the Lord as King inſtead of</hi> David; their Scepter is called Gods Scepter, and their judgement Gods judgement; <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Ye ſhall not reſpect perſons; for the judgement is Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, we find that ſeveral perſons received their Regal Inveſtiture from God himſelf; as <hi>Saul, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Jehu, Cyrus,</hi> which laſt was by God named and ordained to the government of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy above ſixty years before he was born, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.28. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their command to govern is from God; the ſeveral Precepts from God to men in high places, doth fully ſpeak their power to be of God. Why ſhould God command them to rule according to his laws, who have no authority to rule at all? <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.2, 3. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord O King of</hi> Judah, <hi>execute judgement and righteouſneſs, and deliver the ſpoiled out of the hand of the oppreſſed, &amp;c.</hi> If the matter or ſubſtance of their rule were unlawful, ſurely God would not own it ſo far as to preſcribe rules for the manner of executing it. Now God through the whole Scriptures ſcattereth many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for directions to Princes how they ſhould govern, and what they ſhould practice, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their protection is from God. As a King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth his inferiour officers in the execution of their offices; ſo the King of Kings defendeth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in the diſcharge of their truſts; <hi>God ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <p>It is worthy our obſervation how exceedingly God manifeſteth his power and zeal for the help of Magiſtrates againſt all oppoſition. <hi>Korah</hi> and his company conſpire againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy and Miniſtery, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. and would have brought in Anarchy.

Thoſe that would level the Miniſtery, making Preachers <hi>Jeroboam</hi>-like, of the loweſt of the people, and filling the Pulpit as <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, with creatures clean and unclean, will at laſt level the Magiſtracy too, and make the Throne as low and as common as the Pulpit.)

The multitude is a Beaſt with many heads ſaith another: cut off one, nay many, yet there will millions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill. Now that one ſhould keep millions in awe, how could it be, if there were not a divine
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64745:16"/>
conſtitution in an humane perſon. The Devil is ſuch an enemy to mans peace and welfare; and every mans nature ſo oppoſite to rule and reſtraint, that if there were not ſomewhat more then humane in Magiſtracy, one man would be a Beaſt, nay a Devil to another, and be no whit kept under by the higher Powers. But we ſee clearly God hath put ſuch a Majeſty on Princes, that their people are afraid of their fury; reverence their perſons, and ſubmit to their authority. He that readeth the wonderful ſtrength of the Horſe, how his neck is cloathed with thunder; how the glory of his noſthrils is terrible; how he paweth in the Valley, and goeth out to meet the armed men; how he mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted, nor turneth back from the ſword, <hi>Job</hi> 39.19. <hi>to</hi> 26.

So truly he that behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many millions of men ſubject to the word, to the command of one, when they have ſtrength enough to overthrow thouſands, muſt needs acknowledge that it is the Lords doing, and it ought to be marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in their eyes.</p>

Such men by denying rule and authority, ſeem to be beaſts, and to put off all humanity. For
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64745:17"/>
places without ſome in power would be rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes then Cities, and the Inhabitants rather herds of Beaſts then Societies of men.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of men guilty of this ſin.</p>
            <p>Firſt, thoſe that in their Principles deny Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be from God. There have in ſeveral ages been ſome, that becauſe they themſelves were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and inferiours, would therefore deny all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and Superiority. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> whom <hi>Auguſtine</hi> undertaketh, were of that opinion. And ſo were the Anabaptiſts and Libertines in <hi>Germany,</hi> who (armed the rude multitude againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and) were oppoſed by <hi>Luther.</hi> And truly in our dayes there are ſome who againſt the light both of Nature and Scripture, affirm Government to be a work of darkneſs. Though it be written in the fleſhly tables of their hearts, and in the tables of ſtone by the finger of God; That Fathers and Mothers civil as well as natural muſt be honoured, yet they are ſo wicked and blind, that they will not ſee or read it. In the Apoſtles dayes there were ungodly men that turned the grace of God into la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciviouſneſs, deſpiſers of Dominions, <hi>Jude verſ.</hi> 8. ſuch as aimed at Anarchy (according to <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi> Comment) and the over-throw of all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; being proud they ſcorned rule; and being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious, they were impatient of reſtraint.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Order is needful to them that are in a ſtate of innocency. Angels who continue in their eſtate of integrity differ in point of Superiority; <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 4. <hi>Michael</hi> ſpeaketh the name of his perſon, and <hi>Archangel</hi> the nature of his office. There are Thrones, Dominions, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, Powers, different degrees among thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical ſpirits. Surely if ſuch order be conducible to the happineſs of perfect Angels, it is the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable for the happineſs of imperfect man. And if there be ſuch order in heaven, it is no part of our
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64745:17"/>
bondage to have ſome order on earth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Grecians</hi> do upon good ground uſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to ſignifie Superiority, or Government: which in its proper and native acception, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>principium,</hi> to ſet forth the antiquity of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which had a being aſſoon as the world had a beginning <note n="*" place="margin">Politick Government was probably then inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, when man was firſt created under the Old Covenant of works; for it is a natural bleſſing, and grounded upon the fifth Command of the Moral Law, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced upon mans firſt Creation before <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and the rather may we thus judge, becauſe it is a law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was binding in mans eſtate of innocency; beſides, Chriſt himſelf who knew no ſin, yet minded this duty of ſubjection, <hi>Luke</hi> 2 51. 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.23.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Order and Superiority are needful to them that are in a ſtate of Apoſtacy; the more wild man is, the more need he hath of a yoak; the more heady our Horſes are, the more we curb them: Unruly perſons for their own good as well as for others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire reſtraint.</p>
            <p>The hearts of wicked men are like the Sea which cannot reſt, but is ever caſting up mire and dirt;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thinketh that all civil ſubjection of one man to another came in by ſin, though not all natural ſubjection of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to parents. <hi>De civit. Dei, lib.</hi> 19.</note> Now what a deluge would the boiſterous waves of their unſanctified wills and affections cauſe, if there were no banks of Magiſtracy to bound them and keep them in. If ſome men were not Gods to others, moſt men would be Devils to others.</p>
            <p>Sin muſt be diſcouraged; evil doers muſt be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; humane Society muſt be preſerved; the good muſt be protected; our liberties and properties muſt be defended; juſtice muſt be executed; the poor muſt be relieved; wholeſome laws muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and how can either of theſe be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Magiſtrates: Many fear not ſin, nor the God of Heaven, and if it were not for ſuffering from the Gods on earth, their luſts ſhould be their law, and they would deprive the innocent of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, eſtates, and lives, and turn the places where they live into <hi>Acheldema's</hi> fields of blood; nay make the earth worſe in ſome reſpects then hell;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64745:18"/>
for in hell there is no oppreſſion, as no injuſtice; no guilty perſon freed, and no guiltleſs perſon puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but had theſe men their wills, it ſhould be ſo upon earth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, Order or Magiſtracy is not only neceſſary to thoſe that are in a ſtate of nature, but to thoſe alſo that are in a ſtate of grace, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2. When they begin to be ſervants to God, they do not ceaſe to be ſubjects to the Gods. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity doth not conſume but confirm Magiſtracy: As a man I obey and honour the Magiſtrate for fear; as a Chriſtian, for conſcience ſake: ſo that Religion addeth a ſtronger tie and obligation. The Scepter in Chriſts hand doth not ſtrike the Crown of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates head: No, it maketh it ſit the faſter, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where their perſon is crowned with grace, and the power improved for the glory of Chriſt. One Ordinance of God doth not weaken but ſtrengthen another.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inquire a little, and very briefly, into the reaſons which ſome urge againſt Magiſtracy and Order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Say ſome, <hi>We are the Lords Freemen, and and therefore ſhould not be ſervants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23. <hi>Ye are bought with a price, be not the ſervants of men.</hi>

               <label>Anſwer.</label>
            </p>
            <p>That place indeed forbiddeth ſinful ſubjection to men, but not civil ſubjection to men. I may ſerve a Prince, but I may not ſin at his precept and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; If men command what God forbiddeth, I muſt diſobey men to obey God. Or that Text may import, that I muſt give no man liberty to give my conſcience laws; No, my abſolute dependance for ſoul-direction muſt be only on Chriſt and his Word.</p>
            <p>Thoſe whom Chriſt makes free are free indeed, but it is from bondage to their own and others
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64745:18"/>

            <p>God is the good mans Keeper; but how? not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately (in an ordinary way) but mediately. As truſt in God doth not conſiſt with truſt in means, neither without uſe of means where God doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them: for then Chriſt might have taken the Devils Counſel, and have thrown himſelf down from the Pinacle of the Temple when God had afforded him ſtairs for his ſafe going down.

            <p>God can in regard of his abſolute power protect his people without the ſhields of the earth, againſt all the oppoſition from men: as he can defend imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from all the fiery darts of the Devil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſhield of faith, or the ſword of the ſpirit.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64745:25"/>
thoughts to enforce the duty of honouring Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider the neceſſity of Magiſtracy; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Magiſtracy one man would be but bread for another; and the world which is like the Sea for ſtorms and tempeſts, would alſo reſemble it in this, that the Inhabitants of it would be as the fiſhes of the Sea, the great would devour the ſmall. <hi>Men are like the fiſhes of the Sea</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>that have no ruler over them, Hab.</hi> 1.14. No man could call any thing his own, were it not for theſe Gods. Did not they defend us by their power, every one would rob and wrong us at his pleaſure. Our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, eſtates and lives would quickly be a prey to the covetouſneſs and cruelty of vicious perſons. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and property are quite baniſh't where au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is not eſtabliſhed. Who can expreſs the malice, and murders, the rapine and robberies, the miſchiefs and miſeries that raign where the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate doth not raign. <hi>In thoſe days there was no King in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>every man did that which was right</hi> (not in Gods, but) <hi>in his own eyes, Judg.</hi> 17.6. <hi>Judg.</hi> 19.1. And what evill is not good in his eye who hath the Devil for his guide and leader, and corrupt nature for his law and rules? When the gate of Magiſtracy is ſhut, the floodgates for all manner of enormities are open. When theſe that bear up the pillars of the houſe are removed, how ſoon will the building be ruined? When God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſtruction of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Common-wealth, he took away their <hi>Sanedrim.</hi> And in the glaſs of our times it is too too viſible what a ſad deformed face things have, when Magiſtrates are overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> will witneſs to this truth, where upon the grand Signiors death, till his Succeſſor be on his Throne, all things are in a confuſion, and the Janizaries have the rule and Dominion. Some write that the <hi>Perſian</hi> law commandeth, that upon
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64745:25"/>
the deceaſe of their Kings, there ſhould be a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion of the Laws for certain (five) dayes that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects might know the neceſſity of Government, and learn to value it more by being bereſt of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it for a time. Nay when God is exceedingly provoked by ſin, how ſharply doth he make men ſuffer by taking away their ſtay and their ſtaff! The mighty man, the Judge, the Prophet and the Prudent, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. The taking away the civil ſtay and ſtaff, the Prince; and the ſpiritual ſtay and ſtaff, the Prophet, will quickly cauſe the fall, yea the utter downfall of the people. Men often murmur at the Magiſtrate and tell us (many times falſly) He is a Tyrant, if he were gone all would be well; but when he is out of the way, do they not find many Tyrants for one? Every man would be an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, were there no man to be a reſtrainer.</p>
            <p>What would a Nation without goverment be but a deſert of ſavage beaſts? what would Towns be but dens of Thieves, and what would families be but ſtages of unclean birds? yea what would moſt men be, but like dogs trying all right and title by their teeth and ſtrength?</p>
            <p>Men naturally are more afraid of the noiſe of the Musket then of the Bullet; I mean of the frowns of the Rulers, then of the fire of Hell: and therefore were they once free from them, they would do that which would ſoon undo both themſelves and others.</p>
            <p>Now the neceſſity of Magiſtrates calleth for reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and obedience to their authority. The more needfull things are, the more gratefull they ſhould be. Things that are ſuperfluous may be ſlighted, things that are only convenient may be the leſs valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but things that are abſolutely neceſſary muſt be highly eſteemed. I tell thee, the Miniſtry is not more neceſſary to the well-being of the Church, then the Magiſtracy to the well-being of the State. You may as ſoon ſee a Tree thrive without a root, as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64745:26"/>
a Common-wealth flouriſh without a Ruler. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are in Scripture called the <hi>heads of the people, Exod.</hi> 18.25. becauſe they are as neceſſary to the body Politick, to direct and govern it, as the head is to the body natural; therefore as the members yield reſpect and are ſubject unto the head (if the head do but ake, all the humours of the arm (as ſome obſerve) run to the head, and therefore the arms are thin and ſlender, becauſe they want their proper nurture; yea if the head be in danger how do the other parts hazzard themſelves for its ſhelter? many an hand and arm hath been wounded, that the head might be ſaved) thus ſhould ſubjects ſhew their reſpect to, and tenderneſs of their ſuperiours, for if a member or ſome of the inferiour parts be cut off, the body may live; but if the head be taken off, if Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours be ſet aſide, <hi>Actum eſt de republica,</hi> that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that Common-wealth cannot ſtand long.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider the ſeverity of God againſt the contemners of Magiſtrates. There are ſeveral in the word of God that ſtand up like the Maſt of a Ship caſt away by Sands, to warn us that we ſteer not their courſe, leaſt we be ſunk alſo. Thoſe who oppoſed the preſervers of our civil lives, have not ſeldom been puniſhed with violent deaths: <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, <hi>Abimelech, Athaliah, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah, Abſolom, Zimri, Joab, Sheba,</hi> with ſeveral others will confirm this truth. And humane as well as divine writings ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe.</p>

               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:64745:26"/>
and many others have been marked with divine vengeance for contemning this divine Ordinance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Son,</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change. For their calamity ſhall ariſe ſuddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both? Prov.</hi> 21.22. <hi>i.e.</hi> of them that fear not God, and of them that fear not the King. And <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.8, 9. <hi>He that diggeth a pit, ſhall fall into it; and whoſo breaketh an hedge, a Serpent ſhall bite him. Whoſo removeth ſtones, ſhall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood, ſhall be endangered thereby.</hi> Theſe four proverbial expreſſions ſpeak the danger of them that go about to ſupplant their Rulers. Whileſt they are digging pits to catch others, the earth falleth on them, and murdereth themſelves. When they are breaking up the old hedge of Government, Serpents and Adders which uſe to harbour in old walls and hedges will ſting them. God will make men know that it is a dangerous thing to confound rule and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to break down the partition wall which he hath ſet up between Magiſtrates and people. When theſe ſharp inſtruments which they run againſt, wound them deep, they will believe that it is bad medling with edged tools, and that there is a truth in thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>They that reſiſt procure to themſelves damnation, Rom.</hi> 13.2. that is, both corporal puniſhment and eternal torment, ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou wouldſt not therefore ſuffer with others, take heed of ſinning with other. <hi>Depart I pray you from the Tents of theſe wicked perſons,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Congregation upon the conſpiracy of <hi>Corah, Dathan, &amp;c.</hi> againſt their rulers) <hi>and touch nothing of theirs, leaſt ye be conſumed in all their ſins, Numb.</hi> 16.26. They that join in common rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, muſt expect to be joyned common deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Be not impatient of rule, as thou deſireſt to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64745:27"/>
avoid that ruine, which Gods mouth doth threaten, and his hand will execute on ſuch rebellious ones. Let thoſe many examples (which are in Scripture and other Authors mentioned) of them that are hung on Gibbets as monuments of Gods fury, fright thee from their acts leaſt thou partake of their ends. Believe it, no King can poſſibly be ſo tender of his own honour, as God is of his own Officers. Do not therefore ſhoot off thy guns of oppoſition againſt the Gods, leaſt they recoil and kill thy ſelf. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling of natural parents was baniſhment by <hi>Plato's</hi> Law, death by Gods Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.17. Thoſe then that revile civil parents, ſhall not alwayes go unpuniſhed.</p>

               </note>Thirdly, Conſider, thy felicity and welfare doth under God depend much on the Gods. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle enforceth this uſe by this very Argument. For he is the Miniſter of God for thy good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. If he labour to do thee good why ſhouldſt thou imagine evil againſt him?

They deliver the poor that cryeth, and the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and him that hath none to help. They are eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, Fathers to the poor,<note place="margin">Non ſibi ſed multorum uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititati ſe eſſe natum.</note> and helpers to the needy, <hi>Job</hi> 29.11, 15. They are born not for themſelves, but for the good of many; as <hi>Bucers</hi> Phyſitian told him. And they govern not ſeeking their own wealth,<note place="margin">Non mihi ſed populo, <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that which he was often heard to ſay,</hi> Ita ſe rempublicam geſturum, ut ſciret rem populi eſſe, non ſuam.</note> but the Common-wealth, as <hi>Aelius Adrianus</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> would ſay. They are as Trees whoſe leaves are fair, whoſe fruit much, and in them is meat for all; in their ſhadow the beaſts of the field dwell, and in them the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.12.21.</p>
            <p>They are the keepers of our liberties, the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of our lives, the ſafety of our perſons, the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our poſſeſſions, the terrors of ſinners, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Saints, the Nerves and Sinews, yea the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirits of the body Politick, without whom all things would run to ruine, and quickly fall to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. How much then do they for us, and how much then ſhould we be ſubject to them! Surely as little as many value them, they will find much cauſe to celebrate the funerals of theſe civil Fathers with many tears. Our comforts as well as our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences call upon us to be subject. To wiſh them harm that watch to be our helps, is horrid ingratitude. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, he that killeth his Father committeth many ſins in one, becauſe he ſinneth againſt many obligations. His Father begat him, nouriſhed him, brought him up. Magiſtrates are the Fathers of their Countrey; he that reſiſteth them, or doth violence to them, committeth ſeveral ſins in one, becauſe he ſinneth againſt ſo many engagements to ſubjection. We owe all the comforts we enjoy for this world, nay ſomewhat of them that relate to a better world under God to the Magiſtrate. We could not ſleep quietly in our beds one night; we could not eat one meal peaceably in the day without them, we could
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64745:28"/>
not call either children, or eſtates, or lives our own without them: we could not enjoy ſuch liberties for our ſouls, ſuch frequent communion of Saints with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. How great then is our obligation, and how great ſhould our ſubjection be to them! Theſe many cords of kindneſs ſhould bind us to them. He was poſſeſſed with a Devil whom no cords would hold, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.3. and ſurely they are little better that againſt the Law of God and this protecting love of the Gods will not learn to be loyall.</p>
            <p>Trees receive moiſture from the earth, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while pay it back in thoſe leaves that fall to the earth again: the Rivers receive their waters from the Ocean, and they acknowledge it in emptying themſelves into it: Sheep that are fed by us acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it in ſerving us with their fleſh and fleeces. And ſhall man be more brutiſh then the beaſt? I ſhall end this exhortation with the words of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt a little varied; <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves; for they watch for your bodies</hi> (as Miniſters for your ſoul) <hi>as they that muſt give an account,</hi> Heb. 13.17.</p>
            <p>My ſecond Exhortation will be to the Gods. If the God of heaven have appointed you to be Gods on earth, then it may exhort you to walk as Gods, and to work as Gods amongſt men.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Walk as Gods among men; your calling is high, and therefore your carriage ſhould be holy. Every calling hath a peculiar comlineſs belonging to it. A Courtier hath another manner of behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our then a Countrey man, a Scholler then a Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, a Prince then a Peaſant. The greater your priviledges are, the more gratious your practices ſhould be. Remember whoſe livery your wear, whoſe image you hear, whoſe perſon you repreſent, whoſe place you ſtand in, and walk worthy of that calling whereunto you are called, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1. Some would have us give no names to children, but ſuch as ſhould
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64745:28"/>
mind them of their duty. The ſpirit of God hath given you a divine name which ſhould mind you of the divine nature. Since your compellations are according to God, ſurely your converſations ſhould be according to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral Titles given to you, call for ſanctity and ſtrictneſs from you.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of God calleth you Kings, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.9. and Princes, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8.33. Now is it ſeemly or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to ſee Kings or Princes padling in the mire, or playing in the dirt with every beggars brat? Doth not every one expect that their Linen ſhould be in print, their cloaths clean without the leaſt ſpot of dirt? And is it comely or conſonant to ſee Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates (honoured with a commiſſion from heaven) wallowing in the mire of ſin and pollution with every heir of hell? Do not all expect that as your places are god-like and honourable, ſo your practice ſhould be godly and anſwerable, that your linen ſhould be white, your garments undefiled, and your perſons higher then others not only in place but pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
            <p>When King <hi>Porus</hi> was taken priſoner, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Conquerour how he would be uſed? he anſwered, Like a King: and being three times asked the ſame queſtion, he as often returned the ſame anſwer. And if you ask me how you ſhould demean your ſelves, I would anſwer Like Kings, Every one reſembling the behaviour of a King. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31, 3, 4. It is not for Kings, O <hi>Lemuel,</hi> it is not for Kings to drink wine, nor Princes ſtrong drink, leaſt they drink and forget the Law.

            <p>O Sirs, Think of it; ye that are the ſons of God by deputation, ſhould reſemble this Son of God by generation.

Davids</hi> daughters were known to be his children by their garments, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.18. Do you make it known to others that you are the children of God, by not defiling your garments; by keeping your ſelves unſpotted from the world; by looking to your cloathes that they be not defiled, though ye walk in dirty ſtreets; be as the children of God, without rebuke in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation.</p>
            <p>Conſider, the Devil is ever watching for your halting, and like ſome unkind ſervant, he blabs preſently to the Fathet what a dirty pickle his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are in. Suppoſe he ſeeth the dirt of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of uncleanneſs, of ſqueezing tenants, of prophaning the Sabboth, of ſcoffing at godlineſs, of irreligion and atheiſm in your houſes, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately carryes your cloaths to God, as the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs did <hi>Joſeths</hi> coat <hi>(For he accuſeth men before God day and night, Revel.</hi> 12.10.)

of their father the Devil. Can you imagine that God ſhould own you? No certainly, (as the Pope diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned the Biſhop, when the Emperour had ſent the Buffe-coat in which he was taken priſoner, and delivered him up to juſtice) he will not diſhonour himſelf by owning you. Nay, how can you expect but that Jeſus Chriſt, who ſitteth by, and heareth the indictment againſt you (who uſeth to appear as an Advocate for others, when the Accuſer of the Brethren pleadeth againſt them) ſhould even ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the Bill againſt you, and ſay to God, as <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 32.5. <hi>They have corrupted themſelves, their ſpot is not the ſpot of Gods children, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and crooked perſons!</hi> Father, theſe are ſins not of weakneſs but wickedneſs; they are not infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but enormities; they are not the ſpots of thy children. Thoſe that caſt thee out of their hearts, and let the fleſh have the Supremacy there; that caſt thee out of their houſes, and let the world have the Superiority there; Thoſe that make no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thy day and their duties; whoſe whole care is to be honoured and enriched; whoſe heat and fervour is for credit and profit, and put thee off with a few fragments of time, and a few ſcraps of their eſtate, which they can ſpare from the world and fleſh; thoſe ſin like wretches, like rebels, not like Saints, like ſons; <hi>Their ſpots are not the ſpots of thy children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſpots which may be, and ſpots which cannot be the ſpots of Gods children. All ſins are unſutable to, but ſome ſins are inconſiſtent with ſonſhip; yea the preheminence of Adoption doth abſolutely deny the predominancy of any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Antigonus</hi> was to go to a place that might probably prove a temptation to ſin, he asked counſel of <hi>Menedemus</hi> what he ſhould do; He bade him only remember he was a Kings ſon: So ſay I

            <p>It might have been a cutting word to the heart of <hi>Brutus,</hi> (whoſe hand was then ſtabbing <hi>Caeſar)</hi> What thou my ſon <hi>Brutus!</hi> I could not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected better from a ſlave; but little looked for this from a ſon. How think you, can the Lord take it, that you who are his children, ſhould wound the Body of his Son with oaths and curſes, his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred laws by wickedneſs and wilful diſobedience! I beſeech you, be exceeding holy that ye may ſhew your ſelves to be <hi>children of the moſt High.</hi> In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil; <hi>He that doth not righteouſneſs, is not of God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.10. <hi>If ye therefore call on the Father, who without reſpect of perſons will judge every man according to his works, paſs the time of your ſojurning here in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. <hi>foraſmuch as ye know ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver or gold, from your vain-converſations received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh, verſ.</hi> 18, 19. It is written of <hi>Boleſlaus,</hi> one of the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> that he ſtill carryed about with him the picture of his Father, and when he was to do any great work, he would look on the picture, and pray that he might do nothing unworthy of ſuch a Fathers name: So when you ſet about any buſineſs, deſire and labour that you may do nothing (while on earth) unworthy your Father who is in heaven.</p>
            <p>Nay further, the Holy Ghoſt calleth you Gods. How godly then ſhould you be! how unſutable are the works of the Devil to them that have the name

of God! God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all; and ſhould not the Gods ſhine brightly with the light of holineſs, and abhor all deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?

But the God of Heaven is far from ſuch things; He is the holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> holy in all his wayes, and righteous in all his works; His Nature is the pattern of holineſs; his Law is the rule of holineſs: Holineſs is his Eſſence, his glory, himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.13. <hi>A God of truth without ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, juſt and right is he, Deut.</hi> 32.4.

            <p>Sir, obſerve it, is it comely for a God to ſwear; for a God to wrong his neighbours; for a God to prophane Gods day; for a God to deſpiſe godlineſs, and godly men; for a God to keep company with

            <p>I have ſometime read of <hi>Luther,</hi> that he uſed to repel the darts of temptations with this ſhield, I am a Chriſtian, I cannot do it: O would you but think when your hearts, or lives are ſwerving from God, I am called a God, and cannot, may not do the work of the Devil.

            <p>Think therefore how comfortale it will be for thee by thy holy life to direct others the way to heaven; and how lamentable will it one day be to thee, ſhouldſt thou lead others in the road to Hell?

            <p>I ſhall branch this Uſe into three Particulars.</p>

               <item>1. Executive Juſtice impartially.</item>
               <item>2. Excell in ſhewing Mercy.</item>

            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:64745:33"/>Firſt, Execute juſtice impartially. God is a God of Juſtice &amp; judgement, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. The moſt juſt, <hi>Job</hi> 34.17. Others may do juſtly, he cannot but do juſtly: Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice which is an accident in others (and therefore may be ſeparated from them) is his very Eſſence, his Being. Be ye therefore like God. <hi>Let Juſtice run down like water, and Righteouſneſs like a mighty ſtream.</hi> Wear the ſame garments which he doth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.17. <hi>He putteth on Righteouſneſs for a Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, and the Helmet of Salvation upon his head.</hi> Such garments did holy <hi>Job</hi> wear, <hi>I put on Righteouſneſs, and it cloathed me, my Judgement was as a Robe and a Diadem, Job</hi> 29.14. Kings and Princes wear Crowns and Diadems, Judges and other Officers wear Robes and other Ornaments. Now ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> others place much of their glory and ſtate in their Robes, in their Purple veſtments which ſtrike a reverence in the Subject toward his Superior, adding in the eſtimation of men Majeſty to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſolemnity to the action of the wearer: but I place my honour in Juſtice and Judgement; I think my ſelf better cloathed with theſe real vertues, then others with their empty marks &amp; enſigns of dignity.</p>
            <p>I ſay, Execute Juſtice impartially, that is,<note place="margin">It was a ſtrange yet true ſaying, There was more juſtice in hell then in <hi>France;</hi> there the guilty are puniſhed, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great, they do not eſcape; but in <hi>France</hi> it is otherwiſe; may it not be ſaid ſo of <hi>England?</hi>

And the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings preſented the Oath to their Judges, not to ſwerve from their conſciences, though they received a command from themſelves to the contrary. Neither fear of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (It is a mercy to have Judges, ſaith <hi>Cicero, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do audeant quae ſentiunt)</hi> nor favour of nearneſs ſhould make Magiſtrates deviate from the Rule.

When <hi>Caricles</hi> the ſon in law of <hi>Phocion</hi> was accuſed for taking bribes, he deſired his Father to defend his cauſe; but he anſwered him, I took thee for my ſon in law in all honeſt matters only. A Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould be an heart without affection; an eye without luſt; a mind without paſſion; or otherwiſe his hand will do unrighteous actions. He that goeth to the Seat of Judicature, muſt leave his affections (as <hi>Abram</hi> his ſervants when he went to the Mount) behind him. A Juſtice muſt like the earth, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and nouriſh the low Violet as well as the tall Cedar. The <hi>Graecians</hi> placed Juſtice betwixt <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Libra,</hi> thereby ſignifying, that there ought to be both magnanimity in executing, and indifferency in determining. But the impartiality of a Ruler is notably ſet out by the Throne of the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>

            <p>It would be an ornament unto, and tend to the ſettlement of Magiſtracy <hi>(for the Throne is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by righteouſneſs, Prov.</hi> 16.12) if thoſe two Verſes which ſome ſay are written in letters of gold over the Tribunal in <hi>Zant,</hi> were practiſed by every Court of Juſtice.</p>

            <p>In the executing of Juſtice there are two things mainly to be minded.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you be terrors to evil doers; this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed as one of your chief duties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3. If
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64745:34"/>
men be fearleſs in ſinning, ſurely you ſhould not be fearful in ſentencing them for their ſins. God hateth iniquity; He is of purer eyes then to behold it, the evill of ſin never got a good look from God,<note place="margin">Dan. Hiſt.</note> and why ſhould it from the Gods? <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor was held a bad Prince, not by doing but enduring evil. God was angry with <hi>Eli,</hi> and telleth him that he would judge his houſe for ever for the iniquity which he knew, becauſe his Sons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Eli</hi> was a Magiſtrate, and ſhould have put forth his authority and puniſhed thoſe ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children, but becauſe he did not, God puniſht both him and them. O it is dangerous to do the work of the Lord negligently. Sir, Do not you (or might you not upon inquiry) know of them that prophane Gods day, blaſpheme his name, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Ale-houſes and the like? do you reſtrain them? Do you fright ſuch offenders with your frowns, and ſhew your love to their ſouls by executing Juſtice on them for their ſins? If you do not, look to your ſelf; for God hath Iron hands for Juſtices that have leaden heels, and will one day ſtrike them home, for forſwearing themſelves to ſpare others. He will be a terror to thee, and make thee a terror to thy ſelf who wilt not at his command be a terror to evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Thou ſinneſt in others,<note place="margin">Our old word <hi>Koning</hi> and by contraction King, comes of <hi>Con,</hi> ſaith <hi>Becanus,</hi> and comprehendeth 3. things, <hi>Poſſum, Scio, Audeo.</hi>
               </note> whilſt thou ſuffereſt them to ſin, and thou ſhalt one day ſuffer with them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. Thou art afraid to offend thy Neighbours, I tell thee, God will make thee know twere better of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending all the world, then one God. I beſeech you, make it appear that you are Magiſtrates by being men of courage; be as bold in executing as others are in tranſgreſſing the law. Shall iniquity be brazen-faced, and authority hide it ſelf? If the offendor be in robes, be not afraid of him, but make him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of you. I have read that the <hi>Athenian</hi> Judges ſat in <hi>Mars-ſtreet,</hi> to ſhew that Rulers ſhould be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64745:35"/>
men of valour; Cowards are more fit to be ſlaves then rulers. A Magiſtrate ſhould be like <hi>Moſes,</hi> in his own cauſe as meek as a Lamb, in Gods cauſe as ſtiff as an Oak, as bold as a Lion. All dare diſparage him who dareth diſcourage none. How punctually doth Scripture tell you, that this ought to be your practice! Magiſtrates, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> are ſent for the puniſhment of evil doers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If thou doeſt evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the ſword in vain. For he is the Miniſter of God, an avenger to execute wrath on them that do evil, Rom.</hi> 13.4. The ſword which is carried before him, as an Enſign of his power, is not for ſhew or for faſhion, but for the wounding diſorderly perſons. <hi>A wiſe King</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.26. <hi>ſcattereth the wicked and bringeth the wheel over them,</hi> a kind of puniſhment then in uſe, and now in many places. Eſpecially be ſevere to them that prophane the Sabbath, that Queen of dayes, that golden ſeaſon of grace. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would not ſpare the chief men that prophaned this chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of dayes, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.17. This is one of the chief precepts which the Lord of Sabbath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.12. <hi>Englands</hi> diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods reſt, hath raiſed God to diſturb <hi>Englands</hi> reſt.</p>
            <p>He that ſpareth the bad, hurteth the good. The Chirurgion muſt cut off incurable members, and the Phyſitian of the State muſt purge out the peccant humours of the body Politick, leaſt they infect and injure the whole. The execution of Juſtice is like a clap of thunder which ſtriketh few, but frighteth many.<note place="margin">Poena ad unum, timor ad omnes.</note> 
               <hi>Smite a ſcorner, and the ſimple will beware, Prov.</hi> 19.25. Thus by not puniſhing the evil, both the good and bad are (though unjuſtly) puniſhed; yet the greateſt injury is to the Ruler, by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors impunity; for beſides the guilt which he contracts on his ſoul, and thereby Gods eternal wrath, he is oftentimes puniſhed in his body, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64745:35"/>
made an example of Gods Juſtice to others. When the French King was perſwaded by the Duke of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to baniſh that generation of Vipers, the Jeſuites,<note place="margin">

God is therefore called their ſhield, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. Now a ſhield is between the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the weapon.

            <p>Secondly, As you ſhould work like Gods amongſt men in executing Juſtice impartially, ſo likewiſe in ſhewing mercy: <hi>God is the Father of mercies,</hi> 1 Cor 1.3 <hi>Rich in Mercy,</hi> Epheſ. 2.4. <hi>He hath multitudes of tender mercies,</hi> Pſal. 51.1. <hi>He is abundant in

I beſeech you to be doing for the furthering Piety, &amp; the Lord will be with you.</p>
            <p>Now that Magiſtrates may be enabled and incited to walk, and to work, as Gods among men; I ſhall deliver a few directions, and two or three motives, and then conclude.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If you would walk and work, as Gods, then get divine principles. According to your principles, ſuch will your practices be; water riſeth no higher then its Fountain: If therefore you would walk as God, and work for God, you muſt both walk and work from God. If ever the hand of the dial point, and go right without, the wheels and poiſes muſt be right within. It is noted of true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Saints, that acted for God in the Regal Office, That their hearts were perfect with the Lord, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.3. This ſpiritual life in their ſouls made them warm and zealous for their Saviour. <hi>Caleb</hi> that followed the Lord fully, had another ſpirit, a different principle from the ten carnal Princes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. Mens actions will then be ſacred, when their affections are ſanctified. He
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64745:40"/>
that followeth God he knoweth not why, will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake God he knoweth not how. A Magiſtrate that is zealous for God only becauſe the times favour ſuch, may ſoon be brought to be as zealous againſt God. He that is not knit to his ſervice with the heart-ſtrings of love, ſpun out of a renewed nature, will eaſily be parted from his ſervice. Such ſlaviſh ſpirits will ſerve God no longer then they can ſerve themſelves of God. When <hi>Jehu</hi>'s intereſt &amp; Gods are conjoyned, as in rooting out the idolatry of <hi>Baal,</hi> how fiery is <hi>Jehu?</hi> how furiouſly doth he drive? He ſlayeth all the falſe Prophets, he breaketh down the Images of <hi>Baal,</hi> and the houſe <hi>Baal,</hi> and maketh it a draught-houſe, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.25, 26, 27. But when Gods Intereſt and <hi>Jehus</hi> are divided, as in the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> there <hi>Jehu</hi> muſt be excuſed, he will uphold them (as ſome do by that Monſter of Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) out of State policy, expecting that they ſhould uphold him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.27, 28. But what was the reaſon of this? Surely the want of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principle; the fire of <hi>Jehu</hi>'s zeal was (not lighted at the Altar, for then it would have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued burning, but) kitchen fire kindled at a common hearth, and therefore would burn no longer then it had ſuch groſs matter as his own credit or profit to feed it, when this fuel was taken away, his fire went out, look in verſ. 31. <hi>Jehu walked not in the law of the Lord with all his heart;</hi> his heart was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it was not caſt into the fire of the Word, and new-moulded by the Spirit of God. The want of this foundation over-turned all that beautiful build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which <hi>Jehu</hi> had ſet up.</p>
            <p>It is a queſtion in Politicks, Whether a wicked man may be a good Magiſtrate? It is I ſuppoſe poſſible for a wicked man when he is in authority to do ſome good; but I conceive he will hardly do the good he ought; or like <hi>Caleb,</hi> ſtand for God when the times are againſt God, when the people talked of ſtoning
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64745:41"/>
him; but like the king of <hi>Navarre,</hi> he will launch no further into the Ocean then he can be ſure to get back ſafe. Such a man is like an Horſe with a thorn in his foot, which may go fairly on in good wayes, but if he come to hard wayes, he will halt, and diſcover himſelf. He that hath not gone through the pangs of the new birth, and heartily taken God in Chriſt for his All, and thereby ſecured his eternal eſtate, will ſcarce hazard his name or eſtate, much leſs his limbs or life for God, as he muſt do that will be faithful unto the death: For with what heart can he look that danger in the face, which for ought he knoweth may kill both body and ſoul?</p>
            <p>Or if he be very bold and venturous for God, yet being an evil man, he can never do good (by all his activeneſs as a Ruler) to his own ſoul. God may give him parts, and gifts, and courage, (as a Noble man giveth dainty fare to his Nurſe) not out of love to him, but for his childrens ſake. He may like a ſhip, be inſtrumental to land others at ſome happy Port whereon it never entereth it ſelf; He may be very helpful to others temporal, nay and eternal ſalvation, and yet miſs himſelf: <hi>Jehu</hi> by acting for God, got a leaſe of an earthly Kingdom for three or four lives, but he loſt the heavenly one for ever. The moſt that I know, that a civil yet unſanctified Magiſtrate gets by his forwardneſs and heat for God, is only a cooler hell; though your names are divine, yet if ye be not partakers of the divine nature, ye are loſt for ever. Now what advantage will it be to you, like <hi>Noahs</hi> Carpenters, to build an Ark for the ſaving of others, and to periſh your ſelves!</p>
            <p>Believe it Sirs, If ye would have good fruits in your lives, there muſt be this root of holineſs in your hearts; <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth forth good things.</hi> What water is in the Well, ſuch will be in the bucket; and what ware
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64745:41"/>
is in the ſhop, ſuch will be on the ſtall; therefore when God promiſeth that men ſhall walk in his wayes, and keep his judgements, and do them; he promiſeth alſo to put his Spirit, or a new ſpirit into them, which ſhould enable them thereunto. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.26, 27. The fleſh will ſerve to enable a man to walk after the fleſh; but the Spirit of God alone can enable man to walk after the ſpirit. Natural light is not ſufficient to mortifie natural luſts: It may cover for ſome time, but can never kill ſin. Some men may be like the Lyons in <hi>Daniels</hi> den, chained up, or reſtrained, and yet have their ravenous diſpoſitions, their old carnal hearts ſtill. Civility though commendable, yet without inward ſanctity, is not ſufficient to prove one intereſted in a Saviour, or in a ſtate of ſalvation. There is as much difference between a Moral man and a real Chriſtian, as between a liveleſs picture and a living perſon. A Lion and a Lamb, a Raven and a Dove, darkneſs and light, death and life do not differ more then a ſinner and a Saint, then a man only civilized and a ſanctified Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>O Sirs, think of it ſeriously,<note place="margin">The ſmoak of a great mans ſacrifice ſmels never the ſweeter before God, becauſe he is perfumed with Musk, or cloathed in Silk.</note> the terms upon which ſalvation may be had, are the ſame to you and the meaneſt beggar, <hi>John</hi> 3.3. If heaven be not in you by the indwelling of Gods Spirit renewing you in the Spirit of your mind, it is impoſſible that ever you ſhould be in heaven. The tide of your natures, and the wind of your affections muſt be turned the clean contrary way to what they are by your birth, if ever you ſail to the Haven of Heaven. Labour therefore as for life, for this principle of ſpiritual life, without which you cannot eſcape the ſecond death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If ye would walk and work as Gods among men, then your rule muſt be divine as well as your principle. Every calling hath ſome rule to go by, in conformity to which, their excellency
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64745:42"/>
conſiſteth. The Lawyer hath his <hi>Littleton</hi> and <hi>Coke;</hi> the Phyſitian hath his <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> the Philoſopher hath his <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> the Chriſtian hath the Word of God, a ſure and a perfect rule to walk by, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. And this Word of God is in a ſpecial manner commanded and committed to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate as his Directory, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>This Book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth,</hi> (ſaith God to the chief Governour of <hi>Iſrael) but thou ſhalt meditate therein day and night, that thou maiſt obſerve to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou ſhalt make thy way proſperous, and then thou ſhalt have good ſucceſs.</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19. <hi>The King that ſitteth upon the Throne, ſhall write him a copy of the Law: And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord, and to keep all the words of this Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Maxim of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> that the Law it ſelf ought to be the rule by which all Judges muſt be regulated, all controverſies tryed, and all caſes decided. It is good to keep cloſe to the laws of men (that are warrantable by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) but it is beſt to keep cloſe to the Word of God; There are the beſt precepts for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the beſt patterns of juſt men; nay, and of the Infinitely righteous God. You have the example of God himſelf, how juſt, how holy he is in all his doings, how he walketh, how he worketh. <hi>Caeſars</hi> ambition was to imitate <hi>Alexander; Themiſtocles</hi> endeavoured to reſemble <hi>Miltiades.</hi> Do you labour to be like God, to hate ſin, to love holineſs, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the prophane, to countenance the pious, to be active and zealous both by your patterns and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for the glory, of God.</p>
            <p>In all your difficulties make the Word of God your Counſellor; in all your doubts let Scripture reſolve you: You may look too much to the light
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64745:42"/>
within you, which is imperfect and (1 <hi>Tit.)</hi> defiled (as Quakers make a Chriſt of it) but you can never look too much to this light without you, which is perfect and pure, without the leaſt blemiſh or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, that if Printing had been found out in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet was the King bound to write out two copies of the Law with his own hand; one to keep in the Treaſury, and the other to carry about with him as his <hi>Vade Mecum.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond, wrote the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out with his own hand.</note> 
               <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> (as ſome ſay) read over the Bible fourteen times with <hi>Lyra's</hi> Notes upon it. And that renowned Maiden Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when ſhe paſſed in triumphal ſtate through the City of <hi>London,</hi> after her Coronation,<note place="margin">Speed Chronic.</note> when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was preſented to her at the little Conduit in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> ſhe received it with both her hands, and kiſſing it, laid it to her breaſts, ſaying, that it had ever been her cheifeſt delight, and ſhould be the rule whereby ſhe would frame her Government. This was the delight, the joy, the counſellor of that Magiſtrate that was after Gods own heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.70.111, 24. And this made him wiſer then his Teachers, then his Elders, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>to</hi> 100. And indeed this Book of Books only can make a wiſe and good Chriſtian, Captain, Counſellor, and Ruler. Let therefore the ballance of the Sanctuary weigh all, the Oracles of God decide all, the rule of the Word ſquare all, and then nothing will be amiſs. Let the Bible be to you as the pillar of fire by night, and the cloud by day to the Iſraelites, directing you through the Wilderneſs of this world, till ye come to the true <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a memorable ſaying of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, when he was crowned,<note place="margin">Baldae. de Script. Brit. cent. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> and had three Swords put into his hands, (ſignifying his power over three Nations, <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland) Deeſt adhuc unus gladius, viz. Sacrorum Bibliorum volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64745:43"/>
Ille liber gladius ſpiritus eſt, &amp; gladiis his omnibus longe anteferendus;</hi> There is one Sword wanting, namely the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, which excelleth them all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let your end be divine as well as your rule, if ye would walk and work as Gods among men.<note place="margin">Actiones ſpecificantur ab objecto, fine, &amp; circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis. <hi>Euſtath.</hi>
               </note> The Moraliſts tell us that actions are much ſpecified from their ends. If your actions are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially good, yet if finally evil, they are denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated wicked. If they are according to Gods Word for the matter, yet if ye make not Gods glory your end, they are evil. Therefore if ye would have the arrows of your actions to flie right, let your eyes take right aim at this mark. Do all for God.<note place="margin">Omnibus operationibus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, coeleſtis intentio ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jungi debet.</note> 
               <hi>Quicquid agas, propter Deum agas,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther.</hi> As ye are men, ye were created to ſerve him; as Magiſtrates, doubly bound to honour your great Maſter. Gods free grace is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of your power, and therefore Gods glory muſt be the end. It is reported of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Scythian,</hi> that having overcome <hi>Bajazet</hi> the great Turk, he asked him, Whether he had ever given God thanks for making him ſo great an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour? The great Turk confeſſed ingenuouſly that he never thought of it; to whom <hi>Tamerlane</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, That it was no wonder ſo ungrateful a wretch was made a ſpectacle of miſery; For you ſaith he, being blind of one eye, and I lame of one leg, was there any worth in us, why God ſhould ſet us over two great Empires of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars?</hi> So truly may you think, It was meer mercy which advanced you more then others, and therefore it is your duty to advance God more then others. If ye love your ſouls, take heed of ſelf. O how many millions by ſeeking themſelves have loſt themſelves! by ſeeking their own glory, pleaſure, and profit for a time, have brought themſelves to ſhame, pain, and loſs to all eternity! O Beware
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:64745:43"/>
of this root of bitterneſs, Self. Do not like <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> pretend to be zealous for the Goddeſs, when in truth it was for his gain. Or like water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, row one way towards God and Chriſt, and Heaven, and look another way, towards the world, and the fleſh; but give up thy ſelf wholly to him; Lay out thy talents altogether for him; eſteem it thy felicity and priviledge that thou haſt more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages then others, whereby thou mayſt exceed others in ſerviceableneſs to thy Maker, Preſerver, and Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Let that Peerleſs Prince be thy pattern, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>I ſeek not my own glory, John</hi> 8.50. And when he came to die; <hi>Father,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth. I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do, John</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>This was the Fathers end in your creation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> The Sons end in your Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.71. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. The Spirits end in your Sanctification, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>John</hi> 17.10. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let this be your end; Pray, and read, and hear, and watch over your own ſouls; walk inoffenſively before God; work induſtriouſly for God, and do all that God may be glorified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</p>
            <p>We call not thoſe Kings happy, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi>

God can eaſily throw thoſe Crowns from mens heads, which are not laid at his feet. And he will aſſuredly lay them low that do not ſet him high; for thoſe that honour him, he will honour; but thoſe that deſpiſe him, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Motives, to ſtir you up both to walk and work as Gods among men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, God beholdeth you this day; He taketh notice, and obſerveth how ye walk, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64745:44"/>
how ye work. <hi>All the wayes of man (Prov.</hi> 5.21.) <hi>are before the Lord, and he pondereth all his paths.</hi> Be your works what they will be, God ſeeth them, and he weigheth them in the balance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and that beam will diſcover it, if they be never ſo little too light.</p>
            <p>He beholdeth not only your practices, but your principles; he knoweth what is the wind which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Mill to go; he knoweth by what rule, and for what end, and from what principle ye act; all things are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, naked and open in the eyes of him with whom we have to do; <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. The words are very Emphatical, and ſignifie thus much, That as the Lineaments and outſide of the Body is very viſible when it is naked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed; and as the bowels and inſide are diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the body is diſſected and anatomized; So are both your outwards and inwards, your actions and affections manifeſt, naked and open to God.</p>
            <p>Nay, he beholdeth what ye do in the dark; you may work ſo cunningly as to hide your deſigns and works from men, but not from God; there is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor ſhadow of death where the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity can hide themſelves, <hi>Job</hi> 34.22. This Sun knoweth no night, no darkneſs; where ever he is (and he is infinite and omnipreſent) it is light, and day; therefore the eyes of Chriſt, <hi>Rev</hi> 1.14. are ſaid to be as a flame of fire, implying his omniſcience, and that he is able to diſperſe all darkneſs. For Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and experience teach us, that thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which have fiery eyes can ſee in the dark; and the reaſon is clear, becauſe they do not ſee as we do <hi>(Recipendo ſpecies ab objecto, ſed extra-mittendo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)</hi> by receiving ſpecies from the Object, but by ſending out ſpecies or rays, which do both inlighten the <hi>medium,</hi> the ayr, and apprehend the Object. Thus Chriſt ſeeth in the dark ye ſee: yea the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hideth not from him, but the night ſhineth as
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64745:44"/>
the day; to him the darkneſs and the light are both alike, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.12.</p>
            <p>Ponder then this omnipreſence and omniſcience of God, and walk before him, and be upright, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. The Moraliſt would have his Scholars to live always as in the eye of <hi>Cato:</hi> O do you live ever as in the eye of God. Beware what thou doſt; for God ſeeth thee: God ſtandeth in the Congregation, he judgeth among the Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.1. He judgeth among you, he is preſent with you; not always in regard of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; for your deeds may be evil; but always in regard of obſervation.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Iehoſaphats</hi> Argument to incite his Judges to care and caution, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6, 7. <hi>Take heed what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judgement.</hi> He is with you in the judgement; With you to commend and praiſe you if ye do well; to condemn and puniſh you if you do ill; to obſerve and take notice whether ye do well or ill. As if <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> had ſaid, I cannot ride circuit with you, nor be preſent with you in all your Councils, but the Lord a greater then I, can and doth; he is with you in the Judgement: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed, and do it; for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſons, nor taking of Gifts,</hi> ver. 7.</p>

And this they hoped would work in their Magiſtrates circumſpection and fear of doing any thing unworthy the Angels eye-obſervation: I muſt tell you a greater then Angels is here, even the God of Angels; therefore be wary and watchfull, take heed what ye do.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> it is reported,<note place="margin">Diodor. Sicul. <hi>lib. 1.</hi>

            <p>This made <hi>David,</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo upright and holy in his Converſation: <hi>I have kept thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; for all my wayes are before thee,</hi> Pſal. 119.68. Obſerve his holy carriage, I have kept thy precepts; and its heavenly cauſe, for all my ways are before thee; or as in another place, <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me,</hi> Pſal. 16.8. As if he had ſpoken, I have not done what ſeemed good in my own eyes, I have not walked according to my own will, but my race hath been according to the Rule which thou haſt preſcribed me: I have kept thy precepts; for I conſidered thou waſt an ear-witneſs to my words; therefore I did ſet a <hi>watch before my lips, that I might not offend with my tongue:</hi> that thou waſt an eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to my works; therefore I endeavoured that my feet might not decline thy paths: That thou waſt an heart-witneſs to my thoughts; therefore I durſt not let vain thoughts lodge within me; <hi>I have kept thy precepts, for all my ways are before, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Surely, if <hi>Alexanders</hi> empty Chair, which his Captains when they met in Council, ſate before them, did cauſe them to be kept in ſuch good order: what behaviour ſhould the preſence of God cauſe among the Gods!</p>
            <p>The Jews covered Chriſts face, and then they buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted him: Men hide God from their eyes, and think to hide themſelves from Gods eyes, and then make bold to provoke him.</p>
            <p>Believe it Reader, God ſeeth thee what ever thou doſt; he is preſent with thee wherever thou art; when thou art in thy Cloſet, in thy Family, among thy Neighbours, when thou art puniſhing Drunkards, or Swearers in the Pariſh where thou liveſt; when
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64745:45"/>
thou art ſitting on the bench at the Seſſions or Aſſize, he obſerveth in what manner thou acteſt, whether coldly and careleſly, as one indifferent about the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of ſin, though ſin deal not ſo mildly with men when it turneth them into intolerable and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flames; or whether diligently and fervently as one fired with love to his Majeſty, and zeal for his glory, and hatred of iniquity. He obſerveth from what principle thou acteſt, whether from nature or grace; and for what end thou acteſt, whether thy own or his glory; whether it be to pleaſe ſuch a man, or the bleſſed God; whether to get thy ſelf a name, or to make his name great.</p>

               <hi>Job</hi> hath a notable expreſſion, I wiſh it were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on every Magiſtrates heart; <hi>He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous, but with Kings are they on the throne,</hi> Job 36.7. He is <hi>totus oculus,</hi> all eye, he ſeeth you through and through; his eyes are with Kings on the throne, to obſerve what the King doth there, to ſee whether Juſtice and Judgement are the habitation of his throne; whether the Scepter of his Kingdom be a righteous Scepter; whether he be cloathed with grace as with a garment, and arrayed with purity as well as purple; to ſee whether the zeal of Gods houſe do eat him up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.9. and he prefer the Spiritual before the Temporal good of his people; to ſee whether he will ſuffer them to be lawleſs in Religion, and allow out of helliſh policy, that which is deſtructive to Piety, even a curſed To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration.</p>
            <p>Gods eye, Sirs, may well make you look well to your walking, to your hands and hearts: Are uncleanneſs, injuſtice, oppreſſion, lukewarmneſs, atheiſm, bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit objects for Gods eye? It was ordered in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that when any went forth of the Camp to eaſe Nature, they ſhould dig an hole with a Paddle, and cover it; and the reaſon is given; <hi>For the Lord thy God walketh in the midſt of thy Camp;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64745:46"/>
therefore ſhall it be holy, that he ſee no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee,</hi> Deut. 23.13, 14. This Law noteth how the preſence of God ſhould keep us from polluting our ſelves; Sin is the ſouls execrement; Gods walking among us ſhould work in us an hatred of ſuch defilements.</p>
            <p>Gods eye may make you work as gods among men. <hi>Ceſars</hi> Souldiers were prodigal of their blood, when he beheld them: How bold ſhould ye be in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the ſturdieſt, ſtatelieſt Offenders? How forward in the countenancing the pooreſt, pious Chriſtian, conſidering that God beholdeth you!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> rejoyced much that he had done noble exploits, his Parents being alive to take notice of them. What noble acts ſoever are done for the promoting Godlineſs, for the ſtopping the mouth of wickedneſs by the children of the moſt High, are all known to the everliving Father, who recordeth them faithfully, and will reward them bountifully; be therefore exact in your walkings, and zealous in your working, <hi>ſince your labour ſhall not be in vain for the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider the day of your diſſolutions is haſtening. While ye are creeping only in Gods way, or doing negligently Gods Work, death is poſting with ſpeed towards you. Conſider the verſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Text; though he hath ſaid, <hi>Ye ars Gods, and called you children of the moſt High, yet ye muſt die like men:</hi> Your honours, and your worſhips, your Majeſties, and your Highneſſe, muſt ſhortly lie in the duſt, and be as low as the meaneſt. Diſeaſes ſpare none for their fine Cloaths, high Places, or great Eſtates. And the Cannon of death doth as ſoon hit the great Commanders as the Common Souldier, it maketh no difference. <hi>Charles</hi> the great, <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, were all little in Deaths hands: Men in places of greateſt power, are not perſons privileged from the Arreſt of this ſurly Sergeant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:64745:46"/>Ye that are Divine in name, have human mortal natures; and as ye are Shields of the earth, ſo ye are earthen Shields. What is ſaid of the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s Sword, is true of Death; it maketh no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Robes and Rags, between Prince and Peaſant: It is the way of all the Earth, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 25.14. The great Road in which all Travell, and the end of all the living, <hi>Job</hi> 30.23. The great Inn to which all travell. There is <hi>no man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, that hath power of his Spirit, to retain it, neither hath he power in the day of death; there is no diſcharge in that war,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.8.</p>
            <p>It is ſtoried of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quint. Curt.</note> that having heard of Paradiſe, he was very eager of ſeeking it out, and for that end came into the Eaſt part of the Earth; where an old man meeting ſome of his Souldiers, bad them tell <hi>Alexander</hi> that he ſought Paradiſe in vain; For the way to Paradiſe was the way of Humility which he did not take: but ſaith he, Take this ſtone and carry it to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and tell him that from this ſtone he ſhall know what he is. Now the ſtone was a precious ſtone, and of ſuch a quality, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thing was weighed with it, that was ſtill the heavier; only if it were covered with duſt, then it was as light as ſtraw; thereby ſignifying that though <hi>Alexander,</hi> and men in Authority out-weigh others in life, yet when they are covered with duſt, when death cometh, they are as light as others; all their greatneſs cometh to nothing. O how little Earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth Great Men when they die, who will not be contented with much while they live!</p>
            <p>If then ye muſt die ſhortly, doth it not behove you to live ſtrictly? If your time be little, ſhould not your work be great for God and your ſouls? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt think of it or no, death is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee; the Sun doth not move faſter in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, then thou art moving to the earth. The glaſs of thy Life for ought thou knoweſt is nigh its laſt
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:64745:47"/>
ſand. Sure I am thou art now nearer thine unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eſtate, then ever thou wert: and doth it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern thee to walk exactly among men, and to work induſtriouſly for God! O how much wilt thou wiſh at an hour of death, that thou hadſt walked humbly with God, and wrought hard for the Lord all the time of thy life!</p>
            <p>Tis obſerved among the Papiſts, that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, who think their Cowle and other Religious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits ill becoming them in their health, yet are very ambitious to die and be buried in them. And I have taken notice in ſeveral Churches, where are the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of great perſons, that their Effigies muſt be erected kneeling, with a Bible in their hands, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands up to heaven, and looking very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly with their eyes up to the ſame place; when I have heard of ſome of them, how Prophane and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical they were in their Lives; that they uſed the name of God often in ſwearing, but ſeldom in praying, and prized a Romance or a Play Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and read them oftner then the Bible. Truly thus it is, Piety that is trampled under feet by you now in your health and life (believe it) will be a pearl of great price with you in your ſickneſs and death; then you will think the holieſt man the happieſt man; the Preciſeſt Chriſtian in the moſt bleſſed condition; then you would willingly change ſtates with them which are now Objects of your ſcorn; then you will wiſh that you had denied your ſelves, crucified the fleſh, glorified God, and walked after the Spirit; that you had ſpent that time in Praying and Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which you have ſpent in Carding or Dicing, or vain Recreations; that you had improved that wealth and ſtrength in the Service of your Saviour, for the honour of God, and welfare of your ſoul, which have been laid about the World and your luſts. O Sirs, when this time cometh, you will have other thoughts of ſin and holineſs, then now ye
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64745:47"/>
have; Sin will not be ſo pleaſant and lovely, nor holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo mean and unworthy as now it is in your eyes.</p>
            <p>Probably you can hear of death by the reports of others, and be little troubled;<note place="margin">As birds build in ſteeples, and are never troubled at the noiſe of Bells, being uſed to it; nor ye at the ſight of graves or coffins.</note> ye can <hi>ſtand it out ſtiffly againſt ſuch falſe fire, with We muſt all die,</hi> and Nothing ſo ſure; God knoweth who ſhall go next, and the like: all this while, the heart not with ſeriouſneſs conſidering of it, ſo as to be preparing for it: The ſoul as much neglected, God as little regarded, and the affections as much inſlaved to fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts as before. But when Death <note n="*" place="margin">That King of terrors and terror of Kings.</note> climbs up to your own windows, and entereth into your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and comely with its pale ſave to your bed ſide, and boldly arreſteth you with a warrant from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, aſſuring you by its ſymptoms on your body, that you muſt in good earneſt into the other world, and there have all your walkings and workings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted and examined by the infinitely pure and righteous God, and your ſouls (according to your deeds) ſentenced impartially, and ſent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to Heaven or Hell, then ſurely your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of a new Nature, and ſtrict Converſation, will change, and you will wiſh with all your ſouls for a little of others oyl; for your Lamps will go out. The ſtouteſt unregenerate heart alive will droop at laſt, when God cometh to take away his ſoul; then his creſt falls, and his plumes flag.</p>
            <p>Now poſſibly thy Cup overfloweth, thou haſt a large portion of the good things of this world, and they have ſo much of thy heart, that thou art little troubled about the things of the other world; the Table of thy life now is richly ſpread with honours, pleaſures, relations, poſſeſſions, and theſe have the largeſt ſhare in thy heart; in theſe thou ſolaceſt thy ſelf, deſiring no other Heaven. But what wilt thou do when Death ſhall come with a Voider, and take all away, even all thy treaſure on earth? then thou wilt wiſh thou couldſt find a treaſure in Heaven, that thou mighteſt die the death of the Righteous, and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64745:48"/>
have thy latter end like his: But oh Friend, thou ſhouldſt then have lived their lives, and have had thy converſation like theirs: as the Crab in the Fable told the Serpent (who when ſhe had received her deaths wound for her crooked conditions, ſtretched out her ſelf ſtraight) <hi>At oportuit ſic Vixiſſe;</hi> that ſhe ſhould have been ſtraight in her life time. The way to make thy death comfortable, is to make thy life ſerviceable to God, and thy ſoul. He that would enjoy true reſt when he dyeth, muſt labour faithfully and diligently whilſt he liveth. It will be like a dagger at the heart in an hour of death to reflect upon the talents miſimployed, and opportunities miſimproved, which free grace afforded you for the honouring of God, and furthering of your own ſalvations. Sins of omiſſion will wound deeper at a dying hour then moſt are aware of. God hath committed a great truſt to you, and the day of your lives is the only time of diſcharging it; beſides, ye know not how few hours ye may have to your day, whether it ſhall be a Winter or a Summer day; the ſhadows of the evening may ſuddenly ſtretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon you, and then it will be no longer day; therefore <hi>work the work of him that ſent you into the world, while it is day, for the night cometh wherein no man can work, John</hi> 9.4. Is it not ſad, that our common obſervation ſhould he ſo much verified in the practices of great men, That Bells ſtrike thick while they are riſing, but ſtand ſtill and give no ſound at all when they are at full pitch! That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhould like the Sun, the higher in the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, move the ſlower!</p>
            <p>The more noble creatures are, the more active they are, Men more active then Beaſts, Angels then men. One I remember obſerveth, that God would not accept the firſt-born of an Aſs, becauſe it was a a dull ſlothful creature. The Spirit of God (which is in all that are ſanctified) is compared to fire, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. therefore they that would not grieve
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64745:48"/>
it, muſt not be ſlothful in buſineſs, but fiery, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent (ſeething hot, as the word ſignifieth) in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. Hence it was that the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> got letters teſtimonial from Heaven, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I know thy works and thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, how thou canſt not bear them that are evil.</hi> And indeed the more good a Juſtice hath in himſelf, the leſs he will bear with evil in others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath a true ſaying, <hi>Qui non zelat, non amat,</hi> He that is not zealous for God, hath no true love to God. For though love be a paſſion, yet it delighteth to ſhew it ſelf in acting for the party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Calvin</hi> grew ſickly, ſome friends diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him from hard ſtudying, but he gave them this anſwer, <hi>Vultiſne Chriſtum me invenire otioſum,</hi> would you have Chriſt when he comes (to me by death) to find me idle? So do ye think, that when ſinners <hi>Jehu</hi>-like drive furiouſly, ye ſhould not like <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> go heavily, leaſt death find you idle? Obſerve what became of the idle ſervant, that hid his talent in a napkin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.30. He was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an eternal long night, who would not work in his ſhort day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider the day of Judgement, God will then ſearch and ſentence you, diſcover and reward you according to your works. Ye that examine and try others, ſhall then be examined and tryed your ſelves, and ye that acquit or condemn others, ſhall then be acquitted or condemned your ſelves.</p>
            <p>How ſhould this thought move you to walk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, ſince your hearts ſhall be anatomized, and your lives manifeſted before God, Angels and men! Could ye but as <hi>Jerom,</hi> hear the ſound of the laſt trump always in your ears, Ariſe ye dead, and come to judgement, ſurely ye would he holy Judges and Juſtices indeed. <hi>Peter</hi> maketh this argument a ſtrong enforcement to holineſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64745:49"/>
               <hi>The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heat; the earth alſo and the works therein ſhall be burnt up; ſeeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs?</hi> Obſerve, the certainty of it, <hi>The day of the Lord will come;</hi> If it were doubtful, it would not be ſo dreadful; but it will come ſurely, though it come ſlowly, therefore men had need to be holy. <hi>Tertullian</hi> obſerved of all thoſe that profeſt Chriſtianity in his time, none lived ſo looſely as thoſe that did not believe the certainty of the day of judgement; But obſerve 2. the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, <hi>The day of the Lord will come as a theif in the night;</hi> when men at midnight are ſecurely ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they dream not of, nor prepare for a theif. It is ſometimes called a day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.13. <hi>propter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velationem ſecretorum;</hi> things that are now dark and ſecret, ſhall be then as clear and apparent as at noon day; the fire of that day will make things legible which are written with the juyce of Lemons. In that Spring time both wholſome roots and poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will be diſcovered, which all the winter of this life were hid. The books of Gods Omniſcience and mans Conſcience, ſaith one, ſhall be then opened, and ſecret ſins ſhall be then as legible as if it were written with the brighteſt ſtar, or the moſt glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sun-beams upon a wall of Chryſtal, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi> And it is ſaid to be at night, <hi>propter improviſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe of moſt mens unpreparedneſs for it.

noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent hear, and the earth and the works thereof ſhall be burnt up.</hi> Well may it be called <hi>the great and terrible day of the Lord,</hi> when the Judge will be a conſuming fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. and ſhall come in flaming fire, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6, 7. try them by a fiery law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.2. before a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of fire, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.27. plead with them in flames of fire, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.15. and condemn ungodly ones to eternal fire.

            <p>Ah how exactly ſhouldſt thou live, that muſt be tryed for thine endleſs eſtate by ſo ſtrict a law!</p>
            <p>How diligently ſhouldſt thou keep thy heart, knowing that God will judge the ſecrets of thy heart! <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. How carefully ſhouldſt thou keep the door of thy lips, conſidering that of every (not only ſwearing or curſing, but) idle word which thou ſhalt ſpeak, thou ſhalt give an account at the day of Chriſt! <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.35.

So think, ſo ſpeak, ſo act, as one that muſt be judged for all at the great day of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This may likewiſe incite you to work as Gods amongſt men, becauſe at that day Chriſt will come, and his reward will be with him to give to every one according to his works, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.12. Your actions now are ſeed; if ye would reap liberally on that great harveſt day, ye muſt ſow liberally in this ſeed-time.

See whether that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical tenent, That Magiſtrates muſt only be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-table men, that they have nothing do in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, will hold water at that day.
