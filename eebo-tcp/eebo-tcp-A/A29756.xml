            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AMong the multitude of
Books which are printed
and published, in this
scribling Age, some serious, some
seditious; some discovering or
savouring of Art, others of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
possibly every one endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring
to bring their Male: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest of the crowd, I,
like the widow, throw in my mite.
If it be (or seem to be) little, it.
is like the Giver, and therefore I
presume will of some be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as little as it is; and as little
<pb facs="tcp:97766:4"/>
worth as it is, it is like enough
to be challenged: but I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
to prevent prejudice, by
the following Discourse.</p>
            <p>Having for some time been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
to find out a way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Work-men might on their
Rules (their constant Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
have a way easily and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to finde the hour of the Day,
and Suns Altitude and Azimuth,
and the like; and have at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times for several men, at their
request, used one and the other
contrivance, to finde the Hour:
as that of the Cillender, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant,
or the like, as the Altitude
by a Tangent on the inside of a
Square, or Joynt-Rule, and the
line of Sines on the flat side; but
still one inconvenience or other
of trouble in adding of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:97766:4"/>
or difficulty of taking of
Aititudes, or trouble to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
did accrue to the work; or
else the Radius was small, and so
much the more short of exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
at last there came to my
sight a Quadrant made by Mr.
<hi>Thomson,</hi> and as I was informed,
was first drawn or contrived to
that form, by Mr <hi>Samuel Foster,</hi>
that ingenious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtist, and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Student, and Reader of the
Mathematicks in <hi>Gresham</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
And considering of the
ease and speed in the using there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I set my self to the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thereof to a more portable
form, at last took some pains in
delineating one, and another in
several forms, and enquired after
the uses thereof, and in effect
have done, as Mr. <hi>Gunter</hi> with
<pb facs="tcp:97766:5"/>
               <hi>Stofflers Astrolabe,</hi> and <hi>Nepeirs
Logarithms,</hi> and as Mr. <hi>Ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
with <hi>Gunters Rule,</hi> to a sliding
and circular form; and as my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Thomas Brown</hi> into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
form; or as Mr. <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>
in his <hi>Rule of Froportion,</hi> and
as of late Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> with Mr.
<hi>Gunters Sector on a Quadrant,</hi> so
may this not unfitly be called,
<hi>The Quadrant on a Sector.</hi> And
in fine, the Invention will be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
for the learned Authors
sake, and never a whit the worse
for the new Contrivers sake: For
first, hereby it is made large in
little room, and as well on wood
as on brass, which is an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
property to broad
Quadrants, though of never so
good matter, as experienced
Workmen know right well; and
<pb facs="tcp:97766:5"/>
by a Tangent of 30 degrees laid
together, is gotten all kinde of
Angles or Altitudes under 90
degrees, and to be afforded for a
low price, in comparison of other
Instruments, which will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the same operations any
better.</p>
            <p>Having made some Joynt-Rules
in the manner following,
and exposing them to sale, I have
been many times solicited to
write somewhat of the use, and
now at last after near a years su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence,
have committed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Discourse to publique
view, partly to save the labor of
tedious transcribings, and also to
make so useful, cheap, and exact
an Instrument, (if it be truly
made) to be more known or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97766:6"/>
In which business, I desire to
disclaim all vain-glorious os<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and therefore have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
and plainly asserted the
manner how, and why it comes
to be published to the world by
me. It is a mechanical thing, and
mechanically applied, and of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
men will be humanical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accepted, I doubt not. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
begun to write, I could not
break off so short and abruptly,
as at first I did intend to do;
therefore have added this short
Discourse of ordinary Dyalling,
the exact Method of which I
finde in no other Author that
ever I met with, (and indeed I
have not time to read many) yet
I dare presume, that for speed,
ease, convenience, and exactness,
inferior to none, especially the
<pb facs="tcp:97766:6"/>
way of making far declining
Dyals; As for other declining
reclining Dyals, I referre you to
other Authors, or to a Discourse
thereof by it self: if I finde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
and ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the same, a Copy whereof
I have had a long time by me,
written by a very ingenious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist)
the demonstration of which
Dyals is most excellently and
easily shewed by the Figure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
<hi>page</hi> 77.</p>
            <p>As for the other part for taking
of Altitudes and Angles, it may
also be very conveniently done,
if the Rule be fitted to a three-leg
staff, with a small Ball-soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
to set it level, or upright, as
other Surveighing-instruments
be, as will be amply found, if a
tryal be made thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97766:7"/>
That of Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er <hi>White</hi>'s Rule
is a thing that hath given very
good content to several Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the Counties of <hi>Essex,
Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and indeed
is a very neat and accurate way
of operation, well becoming a
Gentleman; for while a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
shall take measure, his Rule
keeps the count of length, or
breadth; and having the length
first given, the girt or square<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is no sooner agreed on, but
you have the content without
Pen or Compasses.</p>
            <p>As for the other lines, as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal-board,
and Timber-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
Inches, and Foot, in the
way of Reduction, Girt-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
Circles, Diameter, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
Squares inscribed
and equal: The Use of them
<pb facs="tcp:97766:7"/>
will be very grateful to many a
learner. Lastly, this brief touch of
the Serpentine-line I made bold
to assert, to see if I could draw
out a performance of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that hath been so long
unperformed by the promisers
thereof.</p>
            <p>These Collections, courteous
Reader, I have printed at my
friends and my own proper
charges, and if they prove to
be (as I do hope they will)
of publique benefit, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
my expectation, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at all times to serve you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as I may, in these or other

               <head type="sub">The Description of the Lines on the Rule, as it is made onely for one Latitude, and for the finding the hour of the day onely.</head>
               <p>FIrst open the (Joynt of the)
Rule, then upon the head-leg,
being next to your right hand,
you have a line beginning at
the hole, which is the Center of the
quadrantal lines, and divided from
thence downward toward the head, into
as many degrees as the Suns greatest
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97766:14"/>
altitude in that latitude will be, which
with us at <hi>London</hi> is to 62 degrees;
which line I call the <hi>Scale of Altitudes,</hi>
divided to whole, halfs, and sometime
quarters of degrees.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, On the other leg, and
next to the inside is the line of hours,
usually divided into hours, quarters,
and every fifth minute, beginning at the
head with 4, and so proceeding to 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 at the end, and
then back again with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
for the morning and afternoon hours.</p>
               <p>3. Next to this is a Kalendar of
Moneths and Days in two lines; the
uppermost contains that half year the
days lengthen in, and the lowermost
the shortning days, as by the names of
the moneths may appear; the name of
every moneth standing in the moneth,
and at the beginning of the moneth: and
all but the two moneths that have the
longest, and the shortest days, <hi>viz. Iune</hi>
and <hi>December,</hi> are divided into single
days, the tenth day having a figure 10,
or a point or prick on the head of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97766:14"/>
stroke, and the fifth onely a longer
stroke without a prick, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of every moneth a long stroke, and
every single day all alike of one short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
according to the usual manner of
distinguishing on lines.</p>
               <p>4. And lastly you have a line of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
for so they be most properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and they are the same with the
equal limb on quadrants, and serve for
the same use, <hi>viz.</hi> for taking of Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
or Horizontal Angles, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
usually to whole, and half de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of the quadrant, and figured with
30, 40, 50, 60|0, 70|10, 80|20, and
90, just on the head, cutting the center
or point, where the Scale of Altitudes
and the Line of Hours meet; which
point, for distinction sake, I call <hi>The
rectifying point.</hi> And the reckoning on
this line, as to taking of Altitudes, is
thus: At the number 60|0 is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
then towards the head count
10, 20, 30, where the 90 is; then begin
at the end again, &amp; count as the figures
shew you to 90 at the head, as before.</p>

               <p>1. FIrst in stead of the scale of Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
to 62 degrees, there is one
put to 90 degrees in that place, and
that of 62 is put by in some other place
where it may serve as well</p>
               <p>2. The line of hours hath a double mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,

for Azimuths, &amp; then every 5<hi>th</hi> minute
is more properly made 4, or else every
2 minutes, and in a large rule to every
quarter of a degree of Azimuth, or to
every single minute of time.</p>
               <p>3. The degrees ought to be reckoned
after 3 maner of wayes: first as before
is exprest; secondly from 60 toward the
end, with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, &amp;c.
to be so accounted in finding the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
for a particular latitude; and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97766:18"/>
and thirdly from the head or 90, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the end, with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
60, 70, 80, &amp;c. for the general finding
of Hour and Azimuth in any latitude,
and many other problems of the Sphere
besides; to which may be added, where
room will alow, a line of hours, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at 6 at the head, and 12 at the
end, but reckoning 15 degrees for an
hour, and 4 minutes for every degree,
it may do as well without it.</p>
               <p>4. To the Kalender of moneths and
days, is added a line of the Suns true
place in the Zodiack, or where room
fails, the Characters of the twelve Signs
put on that day of the moneth the Sun
enters into it, and counting every day
for a degree, may indifferently serve
for the use it is chiefly intended for.</p>
               <p>5. Under that is a line of the Suns
right Ascension, to hours and quarters
at least, or rather every fifth minute,
numbred thus: 12 and 24 right under
♈ and ♎, or the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> and
so forward to the tenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> or ♋,
where stands 6, then backwards to 12
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97766:19"/>
where you began, then backwards still
to the eleventh of <hi>December,</hi> with 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, to ♑, then from
thence forward to 24 where you first
began: but when you are streightned
for room, as on most ordinary Rules you
will be, then it may very well suffice to
have a point or stroke, shewing when
the Sun shall gradually get an hour of
right Ascension, and from that for every
day count four minutes of time, till it
hath increased to an hour more, and
this computation will serve very well;
and in stead of saying 13, 14, 15 hours
of right Ascension, say 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. which

be under 90 degrees) is the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Plain. But if it happen to
stand at any Angle above 90, then the
quantity thereof above 90, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the wall.</p>
                  <p>To finde the quantity of the Angle
the Sector stands at may be done two
ways: first by protraction, by laying
down the Rule so set on a board, and
draw two lines by the legs of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
and finde the Angle by a line of
Chords. Secondly, more speedily and
artificially, thus: By the lines of
Sines being drawn to 2. 4, or 6 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
asunder. The Sector so set, take
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97766:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the parallel sine of 30 and 30, and
measure it on the lateral sines from
the center, and it shall reach to the
sine of half the Angle the line of
sines stands at, being more by 2, 4, or
6 degrees then the sector stands at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is drawn one, two, or three
degrees from the inside.</p>
                  <p>Or else take the latteral sine of 30
from the center, and keeping one foot
fixed in 30, turn the other till it cross
the line of sines on that line next the
inside, and counting from 90, it shall
touch at the Angle the line of sines
standsat, being two degrees more then
the Sector stands at; the lines being
drawn so, will be (as I conceive) most
convenien.</p>

putting my box and needle on my

the needle may play well with the

open or close the Rule, till the needle
play right over the north and south
line in the bottom of the box; then
having got the Angle, (take off the
box, or if you put it on the other side
that labor may be saved.) I take the
parallel sine of 30, and measuring it
from the center it reaches, suppose to
the sine of 20, then is the line of sines
at an Angle of 40 degrees, but the
Sector at two degrees less, <hi>viz.</hi> 38 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,

way, minde thus: First it is south, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the sun being in the south, shines
on the wall. Secondly consider, the
sun being in the east, it shines also on
the wal, therefore it is east plain: thus
have you got the denomination which
way, and also the quantity how much
that ways.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:97766:43"/>
Or if you take the latteral sine of
30 from the center, and turn the
point of the Compasses from 30 to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
90, on the other leg you shall
finde it to reach to the sine of 50 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
whose complement, counting

the true declination sought for.
Thus by the needle you may get the
declination of any wall, which in
cloudy weather may stand you in good
stead, or to examine an observation
by the Sun, as to the mis-counting or
mistaking therein; but for exactness
the Sun is alwayes the best, because

                  <p>First open the Rule to an Angle of

hour of the day, and put a pin in the

                  <p>Then apply the head leg to the
wall, if the sun be coming on the
Plain, and hold the Rule horizontal
or level, then hold up the long thread
till the shadow falls right over the
pin, or the center hole, at the same
instant the shadow shall shew on the
degrees, how much the sun wants of
coming to be just against the Plain,
which I call the Meridian or Pole of
the Plain, which number you must
write down thus, as suppose it fell on
40, write down 40-00 want: then
as soon as may be take the Suns true
altitude, and write that down also,
with which you must finde the Suns
Azimuth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then substract the greater
out of the less, and the remainder is
the declination required. But for a
general rule, take this: if the Sun do
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97766:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
want of coming to the Meridian of
the place, and also want of coming
to the Meridian of the Plain, then
you must alway substract the greater
number out of the less<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether it be
forenoon or after-noon, so likewise
when the Sun is past the Meridian,
and past the Plain also. But if the
signes be unlike, that is to say, one
past the Plain, or Meridian, and the
other want either of the Plain, or
Meridian, then you must add them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and the sum is the declination
from the South. Which rule for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>The further illustration by two or
three Examples.</p>
                  <p>Suppose on the first of <hi>May,</hi> in the
forenoon, I come and apply the Rule,
being opened to his Angle of 60 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to the wall, (<hi>viz.</hi> the head leg,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97766:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or the leg where the center is) and
holding up my thickest thread and
plummet, so as the shadow of it cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the center, and at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
also on 60 degrees, then I say
the sun wants 60 deg. of coming to the
Meridian of the Plain; at the same
instant, or as soon as possible I can, I
take the suns altitude, as before is
shewed, and set that down, which
suppose it to be 20 degrees, then by
the rules before, get the Suns azimuth
for that day, and altitude; which in
our example will be found to be 94
degrees from the (south or) Meridian,
then in regard the signs are both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
<hi>i. e.</hi> want, if you substract one
out of the other, there remains 34
the declination required; but for the
right denomination which way, either
north or south, toward either east or
west, observe this plain rule: First,
if the Sun come to the Meridian or
Pole of the Plain, before it come to
the Meridian or Pole of the place,
then it is always an East-plain; but if
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97766:45"/>
the contrary, it is a West-plain, that
is to say, if the Sun come to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
or Pole of the place, before it
comes to the Meridian or Pole of the
Plain, then it is a West-plain. Also
if the sum or remainder, after addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or substraction, be under 90, it is
a South-plain; but if it be above 90,
it is a North-plain. Also note, that
when the sum or remainder is above
90, then the complement to 180, is
always the declination from the north
toward either east or west; So that
according to these rules in our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
it is 34 degrees South-east.</p>
                  <p>Again in the morning, <hi>Iune</hi> 13. I
apply my rule to the wall, and I finde
the Sun is past the Pole or Meridian
of the Plain 10 degrees, and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
at the same time 15 degrees,
the Azimuth at that altitude, and day
in this latitude, will be found to be
109 degrees want of south or pole of
the place; therefore unlike signs, and
to be added, and they make up 119
degrees, whose complement to 180
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97766:46"/>
is 61; for 61 and 119 added, make up
180, therefore this Plain declineth
61 degrees from the north toward the
east.</p>
                  <p>Again the same day in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
I finde the Azimuth past the
south or meridian of the place 30 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and at the same time the Sun
wants in coming to the meridian or
pole of the Plain 10 degrees, here
by addition I finde the declination to
be 40 degrees south-west.</p>
                  <p>Note what I have said in these three
examples, is general at all times; but
if it be a fair day, and time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
serve, to come either just
at 12 a clock, when the Sun is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
or pole of the place; or just
when the Sun is in the meridian or
pole of the Plain, then your work is
onely thus:</p>
                  <p>First if you come to observe at 12,
then applying your rule to the wall,
and holding up the thread and plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
how much so ever the Sun wants
or is past the pole of the Plain, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97766:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is the declination, if it be past it is
east-wards; if it wants, it is south-west-wards;
if neither, a just South Plain,
and then the poles, or Meridians of
place and Plain, are the same.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, if you come when
the Sun is just in the pole of the
Plain, then whatsoever you finde the
Suns Azimuth to be, that is the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
if it wants of south, it declineth
East-wards; if it be past, it declineth
West-wards.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have copiously, (and yet
very briefly) shewed you the most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
way of getting the declination
of any wall, howsoever situated.</p>
                  <p>Note if the Sun be above 15 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
wanting of the Meridian of the
Plain, your rule will prove defective
in taking the Plains Meridian when
the center leg is next the wall, then
you must turn the other leg to the wall,
and then you finde a supply for all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
to 45 degrees past the Plain. But
for the supply of the rest which is 45
degrees, do thus: open the rule till the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97766:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great line of tangents &amp; the outside of
the leg make a right angle, for which on
the head you may make a mark for the
ready setting, then making the inside of
the leg at the end of 45, as a center,
the tangents on the other leg supply
very largely the defect of the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.
Or if you set on the box and
needle on the rule, and open or shut
the rule till the shadow of the thread
shew just 12, then the Angle the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
stands at, is the complement of
what the sum wants, or is past the
meridian or pole of the Plain.</p>

this declination, it is 78:09, Now
every hour containing 15 degrees,

find that the substile will fall on neer
a quarter of an hour past five at night,
therefore if you take 75, the measure
of five hours out of 78. 9, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
03. 09. for the first quarter

hours one quarter, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
00. 36. for the first quarter on

continual adding of 03. 45, to 03. 09,
and to 00. 36, I make up the table as
heer you see or else you may against
12, set down 78. 09, and then take
out 3. 45, as often as you can, till
you come to the substile, and then

what the remainder wants of. 3. 45,

and the two places I appoint for them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97766:53"/>
shall be at E, and C, in the upper
contingent line. Then look in the
table for the numbers of 8, and I
finde it to be 41, 51, which sought
in a table of natural tangents will be
found to be 0 8 9 5 6 7. And the
number in the table for 1 is 63. 09,
whose natural number is found to be
1 9 7 5 3 7. Or if you want those
tables, the line of Lines and Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
or a Scale made equal to the
Radius of the tangents, will supply
the same though you cannot see so
many figures, yet to four figures will
serve our turn very well, or else the
artificial tangent on the edge shall
shew the natural number in the line of
numbers, reading it as a Scale of
equal parts, and having due respect to
the increase of the Radius; for if it be
under 45, the number right against it,
is the natural tangent; if above 45
measure from 45 to it, that extent
aplyed from 1 in the numbers, giveth
the natural number required. Add
these two numbers 0 8 9 6 and 19,

75, and they make 2 8 7 1: which
sought in the tables will be found to
be the Logarithm of the natural tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of 70. 48. or if you take it off
from your Scale, and measure it on
the line of tangents you shall finde it
reach to 70. 48, as before, then take

1. As first, The price of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
at five score to the hundred,
either tale or weight, being given, to
finde the price of one in number, or
one pound in weight.</p>
                  <p>As suppose at two pence half-peny
a pound, (or one) I demand to what
cometh the hundred weight, (or five-score,)
counting so many pound to
the hundred weight?</p>
                  <p>If you look for two inches and a
half, representing two pence two far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
right against it on the foot
measure, you have 21 very near; for
if you conceive the space between
20 and 21, to be parted into 12 parts,
this will be found to contain ten of
them, for the odde ten pence. But
for the more certain computation of
the odde pence, look how many far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
there is in the price of one
pound, twice so many shillings, and
once so many pence is the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which if it be above 12, the 12
or 12s, being substracted, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is the precise number of pence,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97766:64"/>
above the shillings there expressed;
and on the contrary, at any price the
C hundred, or 5 score, to finde the
price of one, or 1l. As suppose at
40s. the C. or 5 score, look for 40 in
the foot measure, and right against it
in the inches, you have 4 inches, 3
quarters, and 1/4 of a quarter, which in
this way of account is 4 pence 3 far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
and about a quarter of one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Thus by the lines, as they are
divided, it proceeds to 12 pence a
pound; but if you conceive the inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
to be doubled, and the foot mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
also, you shall have it to 24 d. or
48 d. the pound, or one in tale, of any
commodity. As at 18 d. a piece, or
pound, the price comes to 7l. 10s.
the C. for then every ten strokes is
20s in the foot measure, and every
inch is 2 pence, and every eighth one
farthing.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, for the buying of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at 50 foot to a Load, at any price
the load, how much a foot.</p>
                  <p>Here in resolving this, the inches
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97766:65"/>
are to be doubled, and the foot mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
taken as it is: As at 40 shillings
the Load, 40 in the foot measure
stands right against 4 inches 3 quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and better, which being doubled,
is 9d. 2 far. 1/2 far. near, for the price
of one foot; and on the contrary, at
5d. a foot, is 41s. 8 d. a load, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. For the great Hundred of 112l.
to the Hundred, let the space of 12
inches be divided into 112 parts, then
the like rule holds for that also.</p>
                  <p>For the inches being divided into
quarters, every quarter is a farthing,
and every eighth half a farthing, and
every division of the 112 is a shilling,
and every alteration of a farthing in
the price of a pound, makes a groat in
the Hundred, as thus: At 3 pence a
pound is 28s. the C. At 3d. 1 q. a
pound, 30s. and 4d. the C. At 3d. 1/2
the pound, 32s. 8 d. the C. At 3 d.
3 farthings, 35s. the C. Thus you
see that every fraction at a farthing
advance, is 4 pence in the Hundred;
but for any other account, as 3 pence
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97766:65"/>
farthing half farthing, then count the
fraction, as 1, 12th part of a shilling,
and nearer you cannot come by a bare
occular inspection; but the price of
the Hundred being given, the price
of the pound you have as near by this
occular inspection, as any usual Coin
is reducable, <hi>viz.</hi> to the 32 part of a
peny, or nigher if you please.</p>
                  <p>Again note here also, you may dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or quadruple the price: as to
24d. or 48d. the pound, or any price
between. As for example: At 13d.
a pound, is 6l. 1s. 4d. the C. At
32d. or 2s. 8d. the pound, is 14l.
19s. the C. and the like by dupling
and quadrupling the inches, and the
112 parts, that layeth by it.</p>
                  <p>4. These lines of equal parts serve
as Scales, for the protracting of any

will be found to be about 4 foot 5
inches.</p>
                  <p>But if you give the usual allowance,
that is made by dupling the string 4

must set 4 foot on the right side, to

you shall finde but three foot 6

               <head>A brief description, and a short-touch
of the use of the Serpentine-line, or
Numbers, Sines, Tangents, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
sine contrived in five (or rather
15) turn.</head>
               <p>1. FIrst next the center is two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
divided one into 60, the
other into 100 parts, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of minutes to 100 parts, and
the contrary.</p>
               <p>2. You have in seven turnes two
in pricks, and five in divisions, the first
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97766:88"/>
Radius of the sines (or Tangents being
neer the matter, alike to the first
three degrees,) ending at five degrees
and 44 minutes.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, you have in 5 turns the
lines of numbers, sines, Tangents, in
three margents in divisions, and the
line of versed sines in pricks, under
the line of Tangents, according to
Mr. <hi>Gunters</hi> cross staff: the sines and
Tangents beginning at 5 degrees,
and 44 minutes where the other
ended, and proceeding to 90 in the
sines, and 45 in the Tangents. And
the line of numbers beginning at 10,
and proceeding to 100, being one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Radius, and graduated into as
many divisions as the largeness of the
instrument will admit, being from 10
to 50 into 50 parts, and from 50 to
100 into 20 parts in one unit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
but the Tangents are divided
into single minutes from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the end, both in the first,
second, and third Radiusses, and the
sines into minutes; also from 30
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97766:88"/>
minutes to 40 degrees, and from 40
to 60, into every two minutes, and
from 60 to 80 in every 5th minute,
and from 80 to 85 every 1oth, and
the rest as many as can be well disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>The versed sines are set after the
manner of Mr. <hi>Gunters</hi> Cross-staff,
and divided into every 10th minutes
beginning at 0, and proceeding to
156 going backwards under the line
of Tangents.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, beyond the Tangent
of 45 in one single line, for one turn
is the secants to 51 degrees, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the sines reitterated
beyond 90.</p>
               <p>5. Fifthly, you have the line of Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
beyond 45, in 5 turnes to 85
degrees, whereby all trouble of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
working is avoided.</p>
               <p>6. Sixthly, you have in one circle
the 180 degrees of a Semicircle, and
also a line of natural sines, for finding
of differences in sines, for finding hour
and Azimuth.</p>
               <p>

7. Seventhly, next the verge or
outermost edge is a line of equal
parts to get the Logarithm of any
number, or the Logarithm sine and
Tangent of any ark or angle to four
figures besides the carracteristick.</p>
               <p>8. Eightly and lastly, in the space

five turnes, and one half of the
circle are three prickt lines fitted for
reduction. The uppermost being for
shillings, pence, and farthings. The
next for pounds, and ounces, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of small <hi>Averdupoies</hi> weight.
The last for pounds, shillings, and
pence, and to be used thus: If you
would reduce 16 s. 3 d. 2 q. to a
decimal fraction, lay the hair or edge
of one of the legs of the index on 16.
3 1/2 in the line of l. s. d. and the hair

                  <head>The uses of the lines follow.</head>
                  <p>As to the use of these lines, I shall
in this place say but little, and that
for two reasons. First, because this
instrument is so contrived, that the
use is sooner learned then any other,
I speak as to the manner, and way of
using it, because by means of first, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and third radiusses, in sines and
Tangents, the work is always right
on, one way or other, according to
the Canon whatsoever it be, in any
book that treats of the Logarithms, as
<hi>Gunter, Wells, Oughtred, Norwood,</hi> or
others, as in <hi>Oughtred</hi> from page 62
to 107.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, and more especially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the more accurate, and large
handling thèreof is more then promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
if not already performed by more
abler pens, and a large manuscript
thereof by my <hi>Sires</hi> meanes, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
many years ago, though to this
day not extant in print; so for his
sake I claiming my intrest therein,
make bold to present you with these
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97766:90"/>
few lines, in order to the use of them:
And first no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e.</p>
                  <p>1. Which soever of the two legs is
set to the first term in the question,
that I call the first leg always, and
the other being set to the second term,
I call the second leg.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, if one be the first or
second term, then for the better set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the index exactly, you may set it
to 100, for the error is like to be the
least neerest the circumference.</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, be sure you keep a true
account of the number of turnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the first and second term.</p>
                  <p>4. Fourthly, observe which way
you move, from the first to the second
term. To keep the like from the third
to the fourth, exept in the back rule
of three, and in such cases as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
requires the contrary.</p>
                  <p>5. Fifthly in multiplication, one is
always the first term, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plycator
or multiplycand the second,
and the product always the fourth.
Also note that in multiplycation the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97766:90"/>
product of two numbers multiplyed,
shall be in as many places as both the
multiplycator, and multiplycand,
except the least of them, be less then
the two first figures of the product;
moreover, for your more certain as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singing
of the two last figures of four
or six, which is as many as you can see
on this instrument, multiply the two
last in your minde, and the product
shall be the figure, as in page 28 of
the <hi>Carpenters Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. In division, the multiplicator is
always the first term, and one the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
the dividend the third, and the
quotient the fourth; also the quotient
shall have as many figures as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend
hath more then the divisor,
except the first figures of the divisor
be greater then the dividends, then it
shall have one less. Also note, the
fraction after division, is a decimal
fraction, and to be reduced as before.</p>
                  <p>7. Note carefully whether the
fourth proportional ought to be a
greater or a less, and resolve accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97766:91"/>
and note if one cometh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the third and fourth term, then
must the fourth be raised a Radius or
a figure more, and be careful to set
the hairs exactly over the part repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the number or minutes of any
degree.</p>
                  <p>8. Always in direct proportion,
and Astronomical calculation, set the
first leg to the first term, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
leg to the second term, and note
how many circles is between, then set
the first leg to the third term, and
right under the second leg, the same
way, and so many turnes between the
third and fourth, is always the fourth
term required.</p>

whose third part 0,7920 counted
from 10, falls on 12 the root, but in
17280, then you must conceive five
whole turnes, or 1000 to be added,
to give the number that is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by three, which number on the
outermost circle in this place, is 12,+3750.
by conceiving 10000 to be
added, whose third part counted from
10, <hi>viz.</hi> two turnes or 4.125, shall
fall in the numbers to be near 26.
But if the prick falls of the last but 2,
as in 172800 then 100 at the end
of the line, must be the unit, and
you must count thus: count all the
turnes from 172830 to the end of
the line, and you shall finde them to
amount to 7,6250, whose third part
2, 5413 counted backward from
100, will fall on 55,70 the cubique
root required.</p>

                  <p>To work questions of interest or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
you must use the help of equal
parts, as in the extraction of roots, as
in this question, if 100 l. yield 106 in
one year, what shall 253 yield in 7
year? Set the first leg to 10 at the
beginning, in this case representing a
100, and the other to 106, and you
shall finde the legs to open to 253
of the small divisions, on the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithms,
multiply 253 by 7, it comes
to 1771, now if you lay the hair upon
253, and from the place where the
index cuts the Logarithms count on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
1771, it shall stay on 380 l.
8 s. or rather thus: set one leg to the
beginning of the Logarithms, and the
other to 1771 either forward or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and then set the same first leg
to the sum 253, and the second shall
fall on 380. 8 s. according to estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

this being premised here, is enough
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97766:103"/>

                  <p>First if it be a Leap-year, then look
for it in the row of Leap-year, and in

the week day the first of <hi>March,</hi> so
also doth the Epact.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi> In the year 1660, right
over 60 which stands for 1660, there
is G for the Dominical or Sunday let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
beginning at <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and T for
thursday the day of the week the first
of <hi>March</hi> is on, and 28 underneath
for the epact that year, but in the year
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97766:104"/>
1661. being the next after 1660 the
Leap-year, count onwards toward
your right hand, and when you come
to the last column, begin again at the
right hand, and so count forwards till
you come to the next Leap-year, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this account for 61, T is the
dominical letter, and Friday is the
first of <hi>March.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to finde the Epact, count how
many years it is since the last Leap-year,
which can be but three, for every
4th is a Leap-year, and adde so many
times 11 to the epact in the Leap-year
last past, and the sum, if under 30, is
the Epact; if above 30, then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
30 or 60, being substracted
is the Epact for that year. Example for
1661.28 the epact for 1660, and
11 being added makes 39 from which
take 30, and there remaineth 9, for
the Epact for the year 1661 the thing
required.</p>
                  <p>Note that in orderly counting the
years, when you come to the Leap-year,
you must neglect or slip one, the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97766:104"/>
reason is, because every Leap-year
hath two dominical letters, and there
also doth the week day change in the
first of <hi>March,</hi> so that for the day of
the month, in finding that the trouble
of remembring the Leap-year is
avoided.</p>

the first of <hi>March</hi> is on the respective

the daies right under the month are
the same day of the week the first of
<hi>March</hi> was on, then in regard the
days go round, that is change orderly
