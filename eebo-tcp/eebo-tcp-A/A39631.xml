            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from moſt of the chiefe Gentry neere

Armes and Munition in His Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
at Hull, for the ſafety (not onely of his
Majeſties Perſon and children, but likewiſe
of all theſe Northern parts: The manifold
rumours of great Dangers inducing them to
make their ſaid ſupplication) thought it moſt fit to goe Himſelfe
in Perſon to His towne of Hull, to view his Armes and Muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there, that thereupon He might give directions, what part
thereof might be neceſſary to remaine there, for the ſecurity and
ſatisfaction of his Northerne Subjects, and what part thereof
might bee ſpared for Ireland, the arming of his Majeſties Scots
Subjects that are to go thither, or to repleniſh his chiefeſt Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
of the Tower of London; Where being come, upon the 23
of this inſtant Aprill, much contrary to his expectation, he found
all the Gates ſhut upon him, and the Bridges drawn up, by the
expreſſe command of Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> (who for the preſent
commands a Garriſon there) and from the walls flatly denyed
His Majeſty entrance into His ſaid Town, the reaſon of the ſayd
denyall being as ſtrange to his Majeſty, as the thing it ſelfe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he could not admit his Majeſty without breach of truſt
to His Parliament; Which did the more incenſe his Majeſties an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
againſt him, for that hee moſt ſeditiouſly and trayterouſly
would have put his diſobedience upon his Majeſties Parliament;
Which His Majeſty being willing to cleare, demanded of him if
he had the impudence to aver, that the Parliament had directed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64518:3"/>
him to deny his Majeſty entrance and that if he had any ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that he ſhould ſhew it in writing, for otherwiſe His Majeſty
could not beleeve it; which he could no way produce, but mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
made that falſe interpretation according to his own Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
confeſſing that he had no ſuch poſitive Order, which His
Majeſty was ever confident of: But his Majeſty not willing to
take ſo much pains in vain, offered to come into that His Towne
onely with 20. horſe, finding that the maine of his pretence lay,
That His Majeſties traine was able to command the Garriſon:
Notwithſtanding, His Majeſty was ſo deſirous to go thither in a
private way, that He gave warning thereof but overnight, which
he refuſing, but by way of condition (which His Majeſty thought
much below him) held it moſt neceſſary to declare him Traytour
(unleſſe upon better thoughts, he ſhould yeeld obedience) which
he doubly deſerved, aſwell for refuſing entrance to his naturall
Soveraigne, as by laying the reaſon thereof groundleſly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly
upon his Parliament.</p>
            <p>One circumſtance His Majeſty cannot forget, that his Sonne
the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and his Nephew the Prince Elector, having
gone thither the day before, Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> delayed the letting
of them out to His Majeſty till after ſome conſultation.</p>
            <p>Hereupon His Majeſty hath thought it expedient to demand
Iuſtice of His Parliament againſt the ſaid Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> to
be exemplarily inflicted on him according to the Laws, and the
rather becauſe His Majeſty would give them a fit occaſion to free
themſelves of this imputation, by him ſo injuriouſly caſt upon
them, to the end His Majeſty may have the eaſier way for the
chaſtiſing of ſo high a diſobedience.</p>
