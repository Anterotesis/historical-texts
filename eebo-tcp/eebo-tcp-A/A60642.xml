         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Meſſage from the Spirit of Truth
unto all the World.</head>
            <p>O Ye People, who have many Shepherds ſet over you,
and many Teachers heaped up amongſt you, and
yet lie ſcattered up and down as ſheep without a
ſhepherd, and are driven from mountain to hill,
where you neither get bread nor water; Have you not heard
ſome of them many years, and followed them many dayes, and
yet your ſouls want ſatisfaction? What is become of all your
money that you ſpent upon them, and to what purpoſe is all your
labour in following them? are not your burdens yet upon you?
and do not your ſins remain within you? and are you not in
the Land where famine pinches you? and doth your faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
you that there is no relief for you? Is darkneſs ſo thick
that nothing can remove it? are the chains thereof ſo ſtrong
that they cannot be broken? is ſin ſo natural that you cannot
forſake it? are vain cuſtoms ſo prevalent that you cannot deny
them? are your eyes ſo ſhut that they cannot be opened? are
your ears ſo ſtopped that they cannot be made to hear? are your
hearts ſo hardened that they cannot be broken? are you ſo far
alienated from God that you cannot be converted? are you ſo
much defiled that you cannot be cleanſed and healed? Is this
the faith wherein ye ſtand? then woful will it be in the end
thereof; for the end of this faith will not be ſalvation to your
ſouls, but wo and eternal miſery: for with God all things are
poſſible, and there is no want of power in Chriſt to ſubject all
the powers of darkneſs; but there is want of true love in you to
his Light and Power within you; and therefore it is that your
ſins remain, and your burdens lie heavy upon you, that your
eyes are not opened, nor your ears unſtopped, nor your hearts
converted and healed; this is the ground of your miſery and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45034:3"/>
cauſe of your grief and trouble, becauſe you hearken not to the
Word of Life, nor yeeld your ſelves to obey its counſel: How
often hath God tendered his Love unto you, and how often hath
his Compaſſion broken towards you? but how have you kicked
againſt his Reproof, and have not hearkened when he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?
and yet you ſay you want power to overcome corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to get victory over ſin; and becauſe it is ſo with you,
therefore you are perſwaded that there is no help for it in this
life, but ſo it muſt be whilſt you live upon the Earth; Is not this
your faith? and are you like to get victory over ſin, and to be
eaſed of your burdens, whilſt you give way unto darkneſs that
leads you into ſin? and yet you ſay you ſtrive as much as you
can to keep out of it, and feeling ſomething in you that ſtrives
againſt it, yet notwithſtanding you feel it prevail over you,
therfore you are perſwaded that it can never be otherwiſe whilſt
you are in the body, and ſo you ſay the fleſh is weak and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to failings and haltings, and whilſt you are in the body ſin
will be creeping in, though you endeavour what you can againſt
it; and ſo it is; and therefore you muſt come to the Spirit of
God in your ſelves, that beareth witneſs againſt the fleſh, and
teſtifieth that the deeds thereof are evil: for the fleſh is weak,
and in the fleſh there dwells no good thing; and whilſt you live
in the fleſh you cannot reſiſt the fleſhly motions, but will be
captivated by them, and burdened with them; but the Spirit of
God in ſtrong, and able to ſubdue the luſts of the fleſh, and to
mortifie all your corruptions, and to breake down the body of
ſin and death, under which you lye groveling and bowed down
in ſorrow, pain and wo; for whilſt the fleſh liveth, and you live
in it, and walk after it, you are under the Spirits condemnation;
for every motion of the fleſh is contrary to the Spirit, and by the
luſtings of the fleſh the Spirit is quenched and greived; and here
you cannot be free from the Spirits reproof, nor the Judgment
of it; for the Spirit condemns the luſts of the fleſh, and riſeth
in Judgment againſt every motion of it; for being contrary one
to the other, there can be no agreement between them; and
therefore you may know that when you are reproved, you are
joyned to the fleſh, and obeying the motions of it; and there
the Spirit ſtrives with you, and checks and reproves you, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45034:3"/>
you might not ſo ſwiftly run in the fleſhly liberty which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
your miſery; and herein the love of God is commended
to you, in that he ſtrives with you by his Spirit, to ſtop your way
in which you run after the motions of the fleſh, and by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
he calls unto you in every reproof: and is there not that in
you that lets you ſee that you ſhould not ſin againſt God, and
grieve him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If you ſay, Yea, but we know not how it can be
otherwiſe; we ſtrive and endeavour as much as we can, but we
are ſubject to failings, and though we do ſee that we ſhould not
commit ſuch things as ſometimes we do, yet we want power
to reſiſt and overcome them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now conſider, Why is it that you want power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
and overcome, Is it not becauſe you joyn not to the Spirit
which makes the Evil manifeſt; for when the Spirit lets you ſee
that the motions of the fleſh tempt you to evil, then you are not
to yeeld your ſelves to the motions of the fleſh, but to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit, and ſo not to ſerve the fleſh but the Spirit;
<hi>for unto which you yeeld your ſelves ſervants to obey, you are a ſervant
to it;</hi> and by yeelding to the motions of the fleſh, you are a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to it; and there is your failings and your ſin committed;
for in the fleſh dwells no good thing, it is the proneſs to evil;
and whilſt fleſh lives, and you live in it, your thoughts, words
and deeds are <hi>evil continually;</hi> and though you may feel ſome
ſtrivings againſt the Evil, and many times come under ſuch
Judgment that you ſay, <hi>I will never do ſuch things again,</hi> yet not
joyning with the Spirit to overcome the evil, you want power to
pay your vows unto God: And is it not a ſad thing that when
you have ſinned, and that Judgment overtakes you, and in the
ſence of Judgment you promiſe never to do the like again, and
yet do not pay your vows unto God, but are found committing
the ſame things again, and that with as much greedineſs as
ever? do you not here break your Vow, and ſin againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that makes you ſenſible that you ſhould do ſo no more, and
ſo add ſin to ſin; firſt, by committing evil; ſecondly, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
and not performing?</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing your own ſtriving and endeavouring and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
doth all fall ſhort of performing, and that you want power
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45034:4"/>
in your ſelves to overcome the evil that is preſent, and ſo lie
groaning under it, and burthened with it; and whilſt the fleſh
liveth, and corruption ſtandeth, it cannot be otherwiſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you muſt come to the Spirit, which is holy, which is harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
undefiled, and ſeparate from ſin, in which is no ſin; and
you muſt not quench it and grieve it by diſobedience, but unto
every Repoof yeeld your ſelves, and ponder ſeriouſly what it
meaneth. Art thou reproved by the Spirit? then ſtand ſtill
and ponder it in thy heart, What doth this mean? am I doing
that which is juſt and right, or am I amiſs? and by ſtanding
ſtill and pondering ſeriouſly what is meant by the Reproof, thou
wilt hear the expreſs voice of the Spirit tell thee that thou art
in the evil, and thou muſt turn from it, and forſake it, and deny
thy ſelf, and take up Croſs: This is the Spirit's voice in
thee, and the Spirit is Truth. Now when thou findeſt theſe
things ſo, hearken diligently to the Spirit, there is thy Teacher;
and being willing to hear and obey the Spirit, then thy ſoul will
come to find life in the Spirit; and ſo thou wilt begin to feel
the Spirit's power, to draw thee, to lead thee, to teach thee, to
inſtruct thee, and to ſtrengthen thee, by which thou wilt come
to know that thy ſtrength is in the Spirit, and ſo thou coming
to the Spirit which hath ſtriven with thee, and yeelding thy
ſelf to the drawings and leadings of it, then thou wilt know the
Spirit's work in its own power, and wilt feel it ſtrive over the
motions of the fleſh, and give thee ſtrength to overcome them;
and ſo all thy own ſtrivings and endeavours will come into ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
by the power of the Spirit, and the Spirit will condemn
ſin in the fleſh, and manifeſt its own life in thy mortal body;
and then thou wilt know, <hi>That as ſin hath reigned unto death, even
ſo Righteouſneſs reigneth unto life by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> (Mark) here is
an overcoming Righteouſneſs reigns unto life by Jeſus Chriſt;
and that which reigns is in dominion, it hath overcome and got
the victory; and ſo it is the power of Chriſt that overcomes the
wicked one in thee; therefore joyn to the power of Chriſt in
every Reproof, &amp; thou wilt find that whatſoever he doth reprove
in thee by his power, he will by the ſame power crucifie it for
thee, and ſo redeem thee out of all iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin,
and ſet thee free from thy burdens with which thou art oppreſſed;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45034:4"/>
and here thou wilt feel Chriſt to do that, which thou couldeſt
not do for thy ſelf, nor any other for thee; and then thou wilt
know that the ſame which reproves thee for ſin, is thy Saviour
from it, and thy Redeemer out of all iniquity; and as thou
comeſt unto him, and believeſt in him, he will not caſt thee off;
therefore let not thy ſins withhold thee from coming to Chriſt,
for thou art he that he ſeeks: And who hath more need to come
unto him than thou haſt? it is thou that art diſeaſed, it is thou
that art ſick, and therefore thy need is greateſt of a Phyſician,
and thy wounds have moſt need of cure, and what elſe can heal
thee and cure thee, but Chriſt the power of God? and therefore
his compaſſion is towards thee; though thou art a ſinner, he
would not have thee die and periſh, but would have thee come
to him that thou mighteſt be healed and ſaved; for <hi>he comes to
ſave the world, and not to deſtroy it; and if thou dieſt in thy ſins, thy
deſtruction is of thy ſelf:</hi> For Chriſt is not wanting in his love to
manifeſt thy ſins unto thee, and to reprove thee; but if thou
art rebellious againſt him, and wilt not come unto him, then
thou forſakeſt thy own mercies, and thereby deſtroyeſt thy ſelf;
therefore mind the Light with a careful eye, and take heed unto
it, and thou wilt ſee thy Salvation to be in it, and ſo know from
whence thy Salvation cometh; and there will be thy ſtop and
croſs to thine own way, all thy hearts luſts will be croſſed, thy
evil thoughts, words and deeds will be all ſtopped and croſſed
by the Power of Chriſt; and it will mortifie the fleſh, and all
the deeds of it; and here thou wilt feel Chriſt to give thee power
over the world, the fleſh and the Devil, and every motion of
the fleſh in its firſt riſe thou wilt have ſtrength in the power of
Chriſt to beat it down and ſubdue it; and ſo in the Power thou
wilt know the daily Croſs to thy will, to thy wiſdom, to thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to thy corruptions, to thy vanities, to thy mirth, to thy
pleaſures, to thy cuſtoms, to thy formalities, to thy traditions,
to thy vain worſhip; and whatſoever hath its riſe and being
from the motions of the fleſh, the Power of Chriſt will croſs that
nature and deſtroy it, and ſo bring thee into death, and all thy
lovers with thee, and crucifie all down together; and here thou
wilt feel the power ſtrike over thy filthineſs and thy own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and ſtain the pride of the glory of fleſh; then in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45034:5"/>
power thy change being wrought, and thou coming into union
and fellowſhip with the Power, thy ſtrength will be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in God, and his Commands will not be grievous to thee;
for whatſoever he doth require of thee, he will give thee
ſtrength to perform it, and ſo thou wilt know that the ſame
which requireth, the ſame gives ſtrength to perform what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
and how canſt thou then want ſtrength and power, when
thou art joyned to Chriſt the Power of God, who is greater and
stronger than the power of darkneſs? Wilt thou complain for
want of ſtrength, and want of power? and wilt thou now ſay,
I would do this or the other, but I cannot, I have no ſtrength, I
have no power. Oh nay, if thou art come to Chriſt the Power
of God, thou wilt feel him to be greater in thee than he that is
in the world, and by faith in his Power thou wilt know that all
things are poſſible: for if Chriſt was not the greateſt and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
the Creation could never be reſtored, nor the ſoul redeemed
out of the fall: but Chriſt is the greateſt, and Chriſt is the
ſtrongeſt; for he is the firſt and he is the laſt, therefore with
him all things are poſſible; and though in thy own eye ſome
things may ſeem impoſſible, yet with him it is poſſible, who
works and none can let it: therefore whatſoever weakneſs is
upon thee, and that thou canſt not overcome thoſe things that
do burthen thee, Be not faithleſs but believe, and look to Chriſt
who is ſufficient to help thee and relieve thee; for thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is want of faith, and ſo thou ſtaggereſt at the Promiſes and
appearances of Chriſt; and if he utter his voice within thee,
and ſay unto thee, <hi>Turn unto me and live,</hi> thou canſt not believe
that it is he, and ſo the fleſh vaileth thee, and imbondageth thee
by the ſecret working of the Myſtery of Iniquity; for now peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cry, <hi>How are we in bondage to the things that! If I could
tell what to do, I would never go to the Worſhip that now is obſerved,
it is ſuch a bondage to me, and ſuch a burden upon me, that it makes
me to mourn under it; but what ſhall I do, the Law requires it, and
I want ſtrength to ſtand againſt it? I would willingly deny it, if I
could do it, and not come into ſufferings; but I muſt either do it, or
elſe I ſhall bring my ſelf into trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſider, What is it that convinceth thee that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Worſhip is not in the Truth? and what is it that is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45034:5"/>
with it, and would be free from it? and what is it that
reaſoneth for ſafety and cannot deny it? Read this diſtinction,
and then thou wilt plainly ſee, that thou createſt thy own bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
by giving way to thy own reaſon; for that which manifeſts
the Worſhip to be out of the Truth, that is the Light of Chriſt,
and that which is burthened with it that is the Righteous Seed
of God; but that which reaſons for ſafety that is the fleſh, and
thou entering into conference with fleſh and blood, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> goeſt
from Chriſt the Power of God, and ſo thou haſt neither ſtrength
nor power to deny and ſeparate from that which is the burthen
of the Seed; and then thou ſeekeſt out excuſes in thy reaſon, and
ſomething will be taking care for Wife, Children and Eſtate, and
the things of this life, and reaſon willbe ready to ſay, If I ſhould
deny and ſeparate, I ſhould be deprived of my Liberty, and loſe
my Eſtate, and ſo become a ſufferer; and I had better undergo
the burthen, than expoſe my ſelf to ſuffering; and though I do
conform, yet my mind not agreeing in performance, I hope it
will not be charged upon me as ſin. Oh! take heed, for this is
a greater danger, then the danger of ſuffering, or loſs of thy
eſtate; for if thou by ſuch reaſoning think to ſave thy own life,
thou loſeſt life eternal, and that will be a greater loſs unto thee
then the loſs of all things in this world; and therefore let not
ſuch things prevail over thee, for they will imbondage thee, and
cauſe thee to go heavily, and <hi>if thou love any thing more than
Chriſt, thou art not worthy of him;</hi> therefore thou muſt deny all
for him, and count nothing too dear to offer up which he requires
of thee, but let Husband and Wife go, and Children go, and
Houſe and Land go, to follow Chriſt; and yet love thy Wife
and Husband, and Children in their places, and uſe thy Houſe
and Land in their places, for in their places they are good and
comfortable; but if they lye in thy way for following Chriſt,
and that thereby thou art hindered for anſwering his requirings,
then they are ſad and miſerable, and ſo they are to be denied,
and not otherwiſe: And here thou wilt find ſtrength and power
preſent with thee, and wilt be made willing to deny and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from that Worſhip which thou art convinced is out of the
Truth, and which is thy burthen to obſerve: if thou take heed
to the Light and Power of Chriſt in thee, it will open thy eye to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45034:6"/>
look over a Priſon or Eſtate, or the neareſt things that are unto
thee, it will let thee ſee that which is beyond them all, <hi>a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Inheritance that never fades away, a Kingdom that hath no end;</hi>
and therefore obey the Spirit of God in thy own conſcience,
bow unto it, there is the true Worſhip, a Worſhip in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
a Worſhip in the Truth; worſhip God there all ye that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſerve him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if you ſay,</hi> Thus we would do, but we want ſtrength, and we
want power to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Oh caſt away all your reaſons, and wait in ſimplicity,
and the Spirit will help you; therefore come to the Spirit who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
thou art, and what condition ſoever thou art in; if thy ſins
burthen thee, come to the Spirit to eaſe thee; if thy Worſhip
burden thee, come to the Spirit for ſtrength to deny it, and then
thou wilt have power over all thy reaſonings, and all thy fears,
and all thy doubtings; for the Spirit will help thee in thy
greateſt ſtraits; it will be thy ſtrength in weakneſs, it will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thee in feebleneſs, and what is it that the Spirit will not
do for thee, if thou love it and come unto it? I tell thee from
true experience, that it will do ſo much for thee, as thou needſt
do nothing for thy ſelf, but ſtand ſtill and eye the movings of
the Spirit, and ſo yeeld thy ſelf to its drawings and leadings,
then it will ſave thee from ſin, and redeem thee out of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
it will eaſe thee of thy burdens, and ſet thee free in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of its own life: and this is the work of God's Spirit,
which ſaveth by its Grace, and therefore thy ſtrength is to ſtand
ſtill and believe in the Spirit, and in ſo doing thou wilt neither
want ſtrength nor power to overcome whatſoever corruptions
do imbondage thee, but the Spirit will releaſe thee, and give
thee dominion to reign and rejoyce over thy enemies which
have reigned and rejoyced over thee.</p>
            <p>And now ye that are panting and hungring after the living
Refreſhment, come ye alſo to the Spirit, that ye in the Spirit
may be comforted; for God regardeth your breathings, and
your tenderneſs is before him: therefore be not ye afraid to
come, becauſe ye are weak, and becauſe ye are feeble, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ye ſee ſome failings, and ſo mourn at the ſight of them,
and judge your ſelves unworthy to come; O let not theſe things
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45034:6"/>
diſcourage you, but come, though weak, come, though feeble;
come, though thou ſeeſt ſome failings, it is the Spirit muſt
give thee ſtrength, it is the Spirit muſt give thee comfort, it is
the Spirit muſt overcome thy failings; therefore come and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
not: and as thou comeſt unto it, then deny thy ſelf and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, and let not thy eye look any other way, nor to any other
thing; ſo in the living Spirit thou wilt worſhip the living God,
who is a Spirit, and there thou wilt feel his preſence, his virtue
and goodneſs, and that will anſwer thy breathings, and ſatisfie
thy hungrings; and through the nouriſhment of the Spirit thou
wilt grow in the Spirit, and live in the Spirit, and then there is
no condemnation unto thee: Therefore let every one come to
the Spirit and be ſaved, <hi>for the Lord waits to ſhew mercy:</hi> He is
pulling down the birth of the fleſh, and raiſing up the birth of
his Seed; and he is dear and tender over it whereſoever it
breathes, and therefore to the babe he ſaith, <hi>come;</hi> and to the
poor and needy he ſaith, <hi>come, I will in no wiſe caſt thee off:</hi> and
as this is his voice to the babe of Innocency, even ſo he ſaith
to the worker of Iniquity, <hi>Depart from me, I know thee not.</hi> And
here is a diſtinction in the Invitation; unto the true birth he
ſaith, <hi>Come;</hi> unto the falſe birth he ſaith, <hi>Depart: Therefore
let the wicked forſake his way, and the worker of iniquity depart from
his iniquity;</hi> then let the babe of Innocency draw nigh and
come, for thou art the babe which is tendered; and therefore
come in the drawings of the Spirit, and drink of the Water of
Life freely; for the Fountain is open unto thee that thou mayeſt
be refreſhed, nouriſhed, and comforted in the power of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
life, which hath compaſſion upon thee in mercy and loving-kindneſs.</p>
            <p>And now all people, hear the Spirits voice, obey its teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
yeeld to its drawings, and ſo come to the Church in the
Spirit, the Miniſtry in the Spirit, the Worſhip in the Spirit, the
Unity in the Spirit, and ſo ſerve God in the Spirit, in which
there is no condemnation; and there the good Shepherd will
lead you, and his voice you will know from the voice of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
therefore hearken and obey; This is your day, come;
yea let it be now, and put it not off to another time; for delays
are dangerous, and by delayes you may loſe the time that now
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45034:7"/>
is, and ſo loſe your peace and happineſs for ever: therefore let
the World go, Pleaſures go, Will-worſhip go, and come to the
Spirit, walk in the Spirit, and live in the Spirit; then no divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
any more, but one heart, one mind, and one ſoul, in one
Seed of Life, which is bleſſed for ever, in which the Saints
have communion together, and in which true love, peace
and concord aboundeth; where there is no more twain, but
<hi>one new man in Chriſt,</hi> who reconcileth all things by himſelf, and
ſo maketh peace; unto whom all come, that of his Life you
may be born, without which ye can never enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
therefore come to Chriſt the <hi>ſaving health of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the chief Shepherd and Biſhop of the ſoul;</hi> whoſe paſtures
are freſh and green; whoſe invitations are full of love; Oh
let it win you, let it draw you and overcome you, that by his
Power ye may be ſaved, and by his Virtue ye may be healed,
and ſo inherit everlaſting Life to your ſouls comfort, without
which you can never be happy, neither here nor hereafter;
therefore conſider it ſeriouſly, the matter is weighty.</p>
