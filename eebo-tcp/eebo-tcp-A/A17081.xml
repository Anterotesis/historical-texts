            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight well ſaith the Wiſe man, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
new vnder the Sunne; and further, that
there is no end of writing books. For howſoeuer
in a generalitie the ſubiect of any knowledge be
declared; yet the particulars that may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of the ſame, be ſo many, as new matter may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out of the ſame to write thereof againe: ſo great is the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie
of mans vnderſtanding able to attaine further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
then any reading can affoord him. And therefore <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>
alſo affirmeth, that it is hard to treate of any ſubiect that
hath not bene formerly handled by ſome other. Yet do we ſee
dayly men ſeeke, partly by new additions, and partly with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of ſtile, to out-go thoſe that haue gone before them:
which haply ſome atchieue, but many moe rest farre behind.
This hath bred the infiniteneſſe of bookes, which hath intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the diſtinction of good from bad, vſed in beſt Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales,
to prohibite ſuch as corrupt manners, and to giue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
to the good. For that the ſimpler ſort by the former
drinke their bane in ſteed of medicine, and in lieu of truth
(the proper obiect of mans vnderſtanding) they introduce
falſhood decked in truths ornaments, to delude the vnheedful
Reader. Whereas on the other ſide, the benefite which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
by the reading of good books being exceeding great, they
deſerue commendation that offer their endeuours to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting
of others with books of better matter. Which hath made
me reſolue to preſent vnto thy view this diſcourſe of Morall
Philoſophie, tending to the wel ordering and compoſing of thy
<pb facs="tcp:17081:4"/>
mind, that through the knowledge and exerciſe of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
therein expreſſed, thou mayſt frame thy ſelfe the better to
attaine to that further perfection which the profeſsion of a
Christian requireth; and that euerlasting felicitie, which, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſisted
with Gods grace (neuer refuſed to them that humbly
and ſincerely call for the ſame) thou mayſt aſſuredly purchaſe.
As my meaning herein is thy good chiefly: ſo let thy fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
cenſure thankfully acknowledge my labor and goodwil,
which may moue me to impart after vnto thee another trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Politike part of Morall Philoſophie, which I haue
likewiſe prepared to follow this, if I ſhall find the fauourable
acceptation hereof ſuch as may encourage me thereunto. The
booke written first for my priuate exerciſe, and meant to be
imparted to that honorable perſonage, <hi>qui nobis haec otia
fecit,</hi> hath long layne by me, as not meaning (he being gone)
to communicate the ſame to others. But partly through the
perſwaſion of friends, and partly by a regard not to burie that
which might profit many, I haue bin drawne to conſent to the
publiſhing thereof. Gather out of it what good thou canſt: and
whatſoeuer thou mayst find therein vnperfect or defectiue,
impute charitably to my inſufficiencie and weakneſſe; and let
not ſmall faults blemiſh my trauell and deſire to benefite thee.</p>
            <p>But ſay to thy ſelfe with that worthy bright light

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen it pleaſed you (my good
Lord) vpon the deceaſe of maiſter
<hi>Iohn Chaloner,</hi> her Maieſties Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie
of this State, which you
then gouerned as Lord Deputie of
this Realme, to make choice of me
to ſupply that place, and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
me by your honorable letters to that effect, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
a very ſufficient teſtimonie of your good opinion
and fauourable inclination towards me. And albeit your
intention and deſire in that behalfe tooke not effect,
whether through my vnworthineſſe, or by the labour
and practiſe of others: yet becauſe your teſtimonie was
to me <hi>inſtar multorum Iudicum;</hi> and becauſe that repulſe
ſerued you as an occaſion to do me after a greater fauor,
I haue euermore ſithens caried a continual deſire to ſhew
my ſelfe thankfull to your Lordſhip. For when at my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17081:5"/>
humble ſute, you vouchſafed to graunt me libertie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence, to reſigne the office which I had then held
ſeuen yeares, as Clerke of this Councell, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
my ſelfe from that thankleſſe toyle to the quietnes
of my intermitted ſtudies, I muſt needes confeſſe,
I held my ſelfe more bound vnto you therefore, then for
all other the benefits which you had beſtowed vpon me,
and all the declarations of honorable affection, whereof
you had giuen me many teſtimonies before. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being now freed by your Lordſhips meane from
that trouble and diſquiet of mind, and enioying from
your ſpeciall fauour the ſweetneſſe and contentment of
my Muſes; I haue thought it the fitteſt meanes I could
deuiſe, to ſhew my thankfulnes, to offer to you the firſt
fruites that they haue yeelded me, as due vnto you, from
whom onely I acknowledge ſo great a good. That they
will be acceptable vnto you, I make no doubt, were it
but in regard of the true and ſincere affection of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer;
who in admiring and reuerencing your vertues, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
place to no man aliue. Howbeit there will be other
reſpects alſo (I doubt not) to moue your liking and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of the ſame. For if the trauell and induſtrie of
thoſe men be commendable, who curiouſly ſeeke to
tranſport from farre and forraine countries, either for the
health and vſe of the bodie, or for the pleaſing of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
ſenſes, the ſtrange grafts, plants and flowers, which
excell, either for any medicinable qualitie, or for delight
of the eye, the taſte, or the ſmell: how much more will
you eſteeme of my endeuour, and be delighted with my
tranſlation of theſe choice grafts and flowers, taken from
the Greeke and Latine Philoſophie, and ingrafted vpon
the ſtocke of our mother Engliſh-tongue? Eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch as will not onely promiſe delight and pleaſing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17081:5"/>
to the ſenſes, but aſſuredly yeeld health and comfort to
the mind oppreſſed and diſeaſed? Neither is it vnlikely
but that the receiuing of ſo vnlooked for a preſent out
of this barbarous countrie of Ireland, will be ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to hold it the dearer, as a thing rare in ſuch a place,
where almoſt no trace of learning is to be ſeene, and
where the documents of Philoſophie are the more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
becauſe they are ſo geaſon. Perhaps the want of that
ſame ſweeter taſt &amp; reliſh, which thoſe Clymes of <hi>Athens</hi>
and <hi>Rome</hi> could giue vnto them, and ours here of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
and Ireland cannot affoord, may make them ſeem
vnto your Lordſhip at the firſt ſomewhat harſh and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing:
But the wholſomneſſe of their fruite will eaſily
ſupply the deſire of the pleaſing taſte, and ſatisfie you
rather with that it hath, then miſlike you for lacke of that
it cannot haue. For although our Engliſh tongue haue
not that copiouſneſſe and ſweetnes that both the Greeke
and the Latine haue aboue all others: yet is it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
altogether ſo barren or ſo defectiue, but that it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
enough of termes and phraſes meete to expreſſe
all thoſe conceits which may be needfull for the treating
and the diſcourſing of morall Philoſophie. And the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and conſent of the wiſeſt and beſt learned Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
being truly ſet downe and declared, though it be
not done with that flowing eloquence wherewith <hi>Plato</hi>
and <hi>Tullie</hi> did vtter their learning, hauing the vſe of two
ſuch noble and flouriſhing languages: yet will not the
appearing of this faire virgin-ſtranger in her homely
weeds and attire, be any impediment (I preſume) why
ſhe ſhould not be as welcome and as willingly embraced
as if ſhe had come decked in all her gorgeous ornaments
and apparell. For of her nakednes I do not feare ſhe ſhall
need to be aſhamed, though of her pompe and garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17081:6"/>
ſhee haue no cauſe to be proud and haughtie.
That your Lordſhip will not reiect her, but courteouſly
entertaine her, though ſhe be but the hand-maide of the
doctrine of Grace, I do the rather aſſure my ſelfe becauſe
I haue bene an admitted teſtimonie, how often and very
willingly you were pleaſed to recreate your ſelfe with her
companie, at ſuch times as either the waightie affaires of
this your gouernement would ſpare you, or that you
fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cauſe to refreſh your mind by drawing it from the
depth of your other ſtudies. For if I did perſwade my ſelf
that you wold, as ſoone as you ſaw her, frowne and auert
your countenance from her, as ſome men of this our age
do, and ſay, that, where her Ladie and miſtris is, ſhe is not
onely needleſſe, but alſo perillous; I would truly haue
kept her from your preſence, contenting my ſelfe alone
with her companie, and preſuming that my familiaritie
with her ſhould neither inueigle me to like the leſſe of
her ſaid Ladie and miſtris, or to vſe her otherwiſe then
as the ſeruant and hand-maide, fit to make her Ladie the
more reuerenced and the more honored. To your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
therefore I now direct her, that vnder your honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fauour and patronage ſhe may be denizened: For I
nothing doubt but that the example of your courteous
entertaining of her, will eaſily draw many others to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in her conuerſation, and to feele the true taſte of the
healthfull and delicious fruites which ſhe hath brought
with her to furniſh this our Engliſh ſoile &amp; clime withal.
Whereby we may with the leſſe labour and coſt hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
haue them to delight and nouriſh our minds, ſince
we ſhall not be conſtrained to fetch them from <hi>Athens</hi>
or from <hi>Rome,</hi> but may find them growing at home with
our ſelues, if our owne negligence and ſloth cauſe vs not
to foreſlow the culturation and manuring of the ſame.

The courſe which I hold in this treatiſe, is by way of
dialogue (which I haue choſen as beſt pleaſing my
minde) to diſcourſe vpon the morall vertues, yet not
omitting the intellectuall, to the end to frame a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
fit for ciuill conuerſation, and to ſet him in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
way that leadeth him to his ciuill felicitie. Wherein
though I haue (I feare me) hazarded my ſelfe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by ſuch as looke after formalitie in all things:
yet becauſe my intention is to giue light as well to the
meaner learned (whoſe iudgements can be content to
buſie it ſelfe rather to learne what they know not, then to
find faults) as to the learneder critiques that ſpend their
eyes to find a haire vpon an egge; I haue the more boldly
followed mine owne liking: making account, that if I
may purchaſe your liking and allowance of my labour,
to whoſe ſatisfaction I do moſt recommend it; I ſhall the
leſſe eſteeme the cenſure of any that may hap to carpe or
miſlike whatſoeuer part of the ſame. For as I can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to acknowledge my infirmitie and weaknes, and to
confeſſe and take vpon me thoſe faults which I may haue
committed, when they are ciuilly and without malice
diſcouered and made knowne vnto me: euen ſo ſhall the
ouer-curious ſearcher of errors or eſcapes, to make them
faults, very little moleſt me; being reſolued to content
mine own mind with the good that I hope wil be found
in the work, rather then to diſmay my ſelfe or be grieued
becauſe I cannot do a thing in that high degree of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie,
that there were no fault to be found by any man
in the ſame. The occaſion of the diſcourſe grew by the
viſitation of certaine gentlemen comming to me to my
little cottage which I had newly built neare vnto Dublin
at ſuch a time, as rather to preuent ſickneſſe, then for any
preſent griefe, I had in the ſpring of the yeare begunne
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17081:7"/>
a courſe to take ſome phyſicke during a few dayes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which, Doctor <hi>Long</hi> Primate of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Dillon</hi> Knight, M. <hi>Dormer</hi> the Queenes Sollicitor,
Capt. <hi>Chriſtopher Carleil,</hi> Capt. <hi>Thomas Norreis,</hi> Capt.
<hi>Warham, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Leger,</hi> Capt. <hi>Nicolas Dawtrey,</hi> &amp; M. <hi>Edmond
Spenſer</hi> late your Lordſhips Secretary, &amp; <hi>Th. Smith</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary.
Theſe coming of their curteſie to paſſe the time
with me, and chauncing to meete there one day, when
M. <hi>Smith</hi> the Apothecary was come to viſit me alſo, and
to vnderſtand what ſucceſſe the phyſick he had prepared
for me did take; Sir <hi>Robert Dillon</hi> with a ſmiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
asked of him to what intent (I being to all their
iudgements in health and well) he with his drugs ſhould
make me ſick, and force me to keepe the houſe, whereby
neither I could come to the citie, nor they being come
to me might haue my company to walke about the
grounds, to take the pleaſure of ſeeing how the workes
of my hands did proſper, now that the ſeaſon of the
yeare filling the plants and all other liuing things with
the naturall humor, which the ſharpe cold of the winter
had reſtrained and kept within the inwardeſt parts, did
bud and breake forth, to giue proofe and tokens of their
proſpering.</p>
            <p>To which M. <hi>Smith</hi> anſwered, that he had miniſtred
nothing to me but what my ſelf had preſcribed: and that
if I was ſicke therewith, it was mine owne doing and
not his, who by his trade and profeſſion could not refuſe
to compound and miniſter ſuch phyſick as ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at his hands. But to tell you the truth ſir (quoth
he) I could find in my heart to giue him a potion that
ſhould purge him of his melancholy humor, becauſe he
hath no ſmall need thereof in my opinion.</p>
            <p>And whereby perceiue you any ſuch humor to raigne
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17081:7"/>
in him, replied ſir <hi>Robert Dillon;</hi> for in my iudgment nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his complexion accuſeth him of any diſpoſition
thereunto, nor his behauiour and manner of life giueth
any token of ſadneſſe or deſire of ſolitarineſſe, which
commonly all melancholy men are much giuen vnto:
whereas he is not onely deſirous of good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
but alwayes chearefull and pleaſant among his
friends.</p>
            <p>Yea marry (ſaid M. <hi>Smith)</hi> thereof he may thanke you
and theſe other gentlemen his friends, that by comming
often to viſit him do keepe from him thoſe fits which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
it is likely enough he would fall into; whether
that his complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> draw him to it or no, which oft times
deceiueth the moſt cunning Phyſitions, or whether it
proceed of any accidentall cauſe. But (I pray you) for
proofe of my words, who but one more then halfe mad
or in a frenſie, would of his owne accord, not being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
thereunto, haue giuen ouer ſuch an office as he
hath reſigned? which beſides, that it was of good repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and profit, gaue him the meanes to pleaſure many
of his friends, and kept him ſtill in the boſome of the
State, whereby he might in time haue riſen to better
place, and more abilitie to do himſelfe and his friends
both pleaſure &amp; good? All which in a melancholy mood
he hath let ſlip, or rather put from him: for which I, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other that loue him, could find in my heart to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
him very well.</p>
            <p>In troth (quoth ſir <hi>Robert Dillon</hi> turning to me) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Smith</hi> ſeemeth to haue ſpoken more like a Phyſition,
or rather like a Counſeller, then like an Apothecary: and
it will behoue you to ſatisfie him wel, leſt we all begin to
thinke of you as he doth, and agree with him that it were
expedient to giue you a doſe of Ellebore, which the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17081:8"/>
Phyſitions ſay, hath a peculiar property to purge the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
humour. And therefore you ſhall do very well
(I think) to declare vnto him, what reaſons induced you
to reſigne that office, wherein I my ſelfe can teſtifie with
how good contentment of all the table you did ſerue ſo
many yeares. For withall ſome of vs, that haue not yet
vnderſtood vpon what foundation this reſolution of
yours is ſet and grounded, ſhall in like ſort reſt the better
ſatisfied, if from your ſelfe they ſhall be made capable of
ſome reaſonable cauſe that might induce you thereunto.
And henceforth beleeue, it hath bin well done, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you did it, but becauſe you haue done it with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and iudgment: which although we be all ſufficiently
perſwaded you take to be your guides in al your actions,
yet theſe words of maſter <hi>Smiths,</hi> and the like diſcourſes,
which we heare very often among ſome that loue you
and wiſh you wel, doth make vs ſometimes halfe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to allow of this retiring your ſelfe from the State.
Becauſe we ſuppoſe that a man of your condition and
qualities ſhould rather ſeeke to be employed, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
himſelfe in credit and reputation, then to hide his
talent, and withdraw himſelfe from action, in which the
chiefe commendation of vertue doth conſiſt. And to ſay
truly what I thinke, a man of your ſort, bred and trained
(as it ſeemeth you haue bin) in learning, and that hath
thereto added the experience and knowledge, which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
and obſeruation of many things in forraine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
muſt breed in him that hath ſeene many places, and
the maners, orders, and policies of ſundry nations, ought
rather to ſeeke to employ his ability and ſufficiency in
the ſeruice of his Prince and country, then apply them
to his peculiar benefit or contentment. For you that
were in ſo good a way to raiſe your ſelfe to credite
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17081:8"/>
and better employment, whereunto that office was but
the firſt ſtep and triall of what is in you, to forſake ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ſo direct a path, leading you to preferment, and to
betake your ſelfe to a ſolitary courſe of life, or a priuate
at the leaſt, ſeemeth a thing not agreeable to that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which euery man that knoweth you, had conceiued of
your proofe: and that of you it may be ſaid, <hi>Grauior eſt
culpa clara principia deſerentis, quàm non incipientis; Non
enim magna aggredi, ſed perſeuerare difficile.</hi> What is the
end of parents in the education of their children, wherin
they beſtow ſo much care, and ſpend their wealth to
purchaſe them learning and knowledge; but a deſire to
make them able to be employed, and a hope to ſee them
raiſed to credit and dignitie in the common-wealth? Or
who is he that doth not ſtriue by all the meanes he can
to aduance himſelfe, and to preſſe forward ſtill euen to
the higheſt places of authoritie, and fauour vnder his
Prince, though oftentimes with no ſmall hazard and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
if he may once lay hold vpon that locke, which, men
ſay, Occaſion hath growing on her forehead, being
bald behind; ſhewing thereby how fooliſh a thing it is
to let her ſlip after ſhe hath once preſented her ſelfe to be
apprehended? No doubt but this folly will be layd to
your charge by many, and not without good apparance
of reaſon, ſince you hauing had the occaſion offered
vnto you, as well to enrich your ſelfe, as to riſe in credite
and reputation, haue neuertheleſſe let her go, after you
had faſt hand in her foretop, and abandoned ſo great a
hope, nay, ſo aſſured a reward propoſed to you for your
labour and paines, to be ſuſtained ſome while in that
place.</p>
            <p>Sir (quoth I) to haue anſwered M. <hi>Smiths</hi> imputation,
I ſuppoſe would haue bin very eaſie, ſince the greateſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17081:9"/>
matter therein was the neglecting of my profit, and the
abandoning a meane to pleaſure my friends. For the firſt
is rather a commendation (though not ſo conceiued by
him) then any iuſt blame: and the other is no more but
a partiall complaint of him and others of his diſpoſition,
that looke to their owne priuate intereſt, and conſider
onely what they may miſſe, by not hauing a friend in
ſuch a place, who might ſtand them in ſtead, and regard
no whit the contentment or diſcontentment of their
friend, which they are not able to meaſure; as wanting
the generall rule by which it ought to be meaſured
according to reaſon; and ſo conſequently frame
the meaſure according to their owne minds: vſing their
owne iudgements, euen as the auncient Greekes were
wont to ſay of the Lesbian rule, which being made of
lead, the work-men would bend and fit to their worke,
and not frame their worke by a right rule. But hauing
added to his obiection your owne cenſure of me, whoſe
iudgement and prudence is ſo wel knowne, and ſo much
by me to be reſpected, I can no leſſe do, then make ſome
further Apologie for my ſelfe touching that point, and
open ſo much of my counſell and purpoſe in that behalf
as I ſhall thinke needfull to giue you and others, that will
prefer reaſon before their opinions, ſufficient ſatisfaction.
And firſt where you ſay, that my ſeruice in the place was
acceptable vnto you all, I cannot but therein acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my good hap, rather then impute it to any ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
in my ſelfe. Neither would I, in regard of that great
courteſie and fauour which I receiued therein, haue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
done any thing whereby I might haue ſeemed
vnthankfull, or to haue made ſo ſmall eſtimation of ſo
worthy a fauour. But my not hauing bin brought vp or
vſed to much writing and long ſtanding, (which of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17081:9"/>
that office doth require) beſides the extraordinary
occaſions which the ſeruice bringeth forth, to trauell, to
ſit vp late, and diſorder the body, had bred ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of rheume in me, and of infirmities cauſed therby,
as I could not without manifeſt and certaine perill of
ſhortning my dayes haue continued the exerciſe of that
place. Whereupon hauing in dutifull ſort made knowne
the cauſe of my deſire to reſigne the office to the Lord
Deputy, who was in like ſort priuy to ſome other iuſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
I had to further that my reſolution; it pleaſed him
with his accuſtomed prudence and fauour towards me,
to conſider and to allow of my requeſt, and to grant me
his honorable conſent to the accompliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſame.
Neither can this be rightly termed in me a retiring my
ſelfe from the State, or a withdrawing from action to
hide my talent. For leauing aſide the vncertaintie and
vaine iſſue for the moſt part of thoſe hopes that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
draw men on into ambitious heauing &amp; ſhouing
for dignities and places of credit and commoditie; from
which to be freed, little do men know or beleeue what
gaine it is; as of things that, when they obtaine them not,
vexe and torment their minds, and when they obtaine
them, do ſoone glut and weary them. What compariſon
can a man of reaſon &amp; iudgement make betweene them,
and that contentednes which a well tempered and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
mind doth feele in a priuate life, employed to the
bettering and amending of the principall part, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth
him from brute beaſts? Surely for my part
I confeſſe frankly vnto you, and proteſt I ſpeake truly,
I haue found more quietnes and ſatisfaction in this ſmall
time that I haue liued to my ſelfe, and enioyed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
of my bookes, when the care of my little buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and husbandry hath giuen me that ordinary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17081:10"/>
which it muſt haue, then I did before in all the
time that I ſpent in ſeruice about the State: the toile
whereof was farre too high a price for the profit I might
make of my place, and the expectation which was left
me of riſing to any better. Which neuertheleſſe, ſuppoſe
it had bin much greater then euer I conceiued, or then
you haue ſeemed to make the ſame: ſo free am I from
ambition or couetiſe (howſoeuer M. <hi>Smith</hi> would haue
me to frame my mind thereto) as I am not only content
not to flatter my ſelfe with the ſhew of good, which the
beſt hopes might haue preſented vnto me; but reſolued
alſo to put from me and tread vnder foot whatſoeuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
or inclination, that either nature, ill cuſtome, or daily
example might vrge me vnto, or ſtirre vp within me. It
is a perillous thing for men of weake braines to ſtand in
high places, their heads will ſo ſoone be giddie, and all
cilmbing is ſubiect to falling. Let men of great ſpirits,
of high birth, and of excellent vertues, poſſeſſe in Gods
name thoſe dignities and preferments, which the fauour
of the Prince and their ſufficiencie may purchaſe vnto
them: for it is they, that (as the Poet ſayth) <hi>Poſuêre in
montibus vrbem:</hi> and of whom you might iuſtly ſay,
<hi>Grauior eſt culpa &amp;c.</hi> For as for me, I am one of thoſe of
whom the ſame Poet ſayd, <hi>Habitabant vallibus imis.</hi> And
ſo I had rather to do ſtill, then to forſake my ſtudies
which I haue now begunne to renew againe: hauing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
my endeuour to lay hold vpon the foretop, which
Lady Occaſion hath offered me to that effect: for to any
other intent, ſhe neuer yet did ſo much as once ſhew her
ſelfe to me a farre off, much leſſe preſent her ſelfe to me
ſo neare as I might reach to catch her, or faſten my hand
in her golden locke. I wiſh my friends therefore rather
to allow, and giue their conſents to this my reſolution,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17081:10"/>
grounded (as I thinke) vpon a reaſonable conſideration,
and an exact weighing of mine owne abilitie and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
then to concurre with M. <hi>Smith</hi> in opinion, or
with any others that would lay to my charge folly, or
lacke of iudgement for the ſame. And that generally all
men would beleeue the Italian prouerbe, which ſayth,
that the foole knoweth better what is good and meet for
himſelfe, then doth the wiſe man what is fit for another
man. Not that I would thereby reiect good counſell and
friendly aduice, which I know well enough how bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
a thing it is to all men in matters of doubt and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie:
but my meaning is onely to reſerue to a mans
owne vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the iudgement of ſuch particular and
priuate determinations, as concerne the contentment or
diſcontentment of his mind; the circumſtances of which
perhaps are not meete to be communicated to others.
The example whereof <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> hath giuen vs,
with that graue and wiſe anſwer he made vnto his friends
that wold needs reprehend him for repudiating his wife,
alledging her many good qualities, as her beautie, her
modeſtie, her nobilitie, and other ſuch like: when put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth his leg, he ſhewed them his buskin, and ſayd;
You ſee this buskin is wel and handſomly made, of good
leather, and to your ſeeming fit enough for my foote
and leg, yet none of you knoweth (I am ſure) where it
doth wring me. Euen ſo my ſelfe may haply ſay to any
whom my former anſwer may not fully ſatisfie, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
to their ſeeming my ſtate and condition was
better by holding that office, not onely in reſpect of the
benefit and commoditie my ſelfe and my friends might
reape thereby; but alſo in regard of the expectation of
preferment &amp; aduancement that I might haue had by the
exerciſe of the ſame: yet is it to them vnknowne what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17081:11"/>
particulars might moue me to conceiue thereof o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otherwiſe,
and to like rather of the priuat life I now leade,
then of all thoſe benefits and commodities which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could promiſe vnto me.</p>
            <p>Although the reaſons by you before alledged, might
well enough be anſwered, quoth ſir <hi>Robert Dillon,</hi> yet
this laſt obiection you haue made to conclude your
ſpeech withall, is ſuch, as I ſhould hold him vnwiſe that
would go about to remoue you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your determination.
For it were a point of ouermuch curioſitie, to ſearch ſo
farre into your mind and drift in that behalfe. But ſince
it ſeemeth that your deſire is now bent to the renewing
of your ſtudies, and to apply your ſelfe to the bettering
(as you ſay) of that part which is proper vnto man,
which is the mind, or reaſonable power of the ſoule,
from whence indeed all operations worthy commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
do proceed, I pray you let vs heare from you what
kind of ſtudie that is, by which you intend to purchaſe to
your ſelfe this ſo great a good. For it is not euery ſcience
that can affoord the ſame, ſince we ſee oftentimes men
of great learning in ſundry profeſſions, to be neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
rude and ignorant in things that concerne their cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and behauiour: inſomuch as it hath bin fitly vſed for
a prouerbe among vs, that the greateſt clerkes are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the wiſeſt men. And as I for one, am deſirous to
know your determination and opinion touching that
point: ſo do I think that the reſt of theſe gentlemen here,
wil be willing and glad to ſpend this time which we haue
all diſpoſed to viſit you and keepe you companie, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
you diſcourſe vpon ſo good a Theme, by which
there cannot but ariſe ſome good and profit to euery of
vs. Becauſe we nothing doubt, but that, as you haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely
debated with your ſelfe the reaſons that haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17081:11"/>
you to take vpon you this reſolution; ſo you can
declare the ſame, and make vs partakers with you of ſo
much of your contentment, as the loue and good will
we beare you, will thereby faſten vpon vs.</p>
            <p>Sir (ſaid I) you haue right well alledged and applied
our common prouerbe, in my opinion: for it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
euery kind of knowledge and ſtudie that bettereth
the mind of man, as dayly experience teacheth vs: ſince
we ſee many men vſe the ſame as an inſtrument to worke
their miſchiefe and wickednes withall the more artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and the more dangerouſly. For though nature hath
engrafted in euery man a feruent deſire of knowledge,
which diſcouereth it ſelfe in children, euen in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
yet haue we all from the corruption of her, a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
likewiſe to abuſe the ſame, and to turne it rather to
euill than to goodneſſe, if ſpeciall grace, or an excellent
education (which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be without grace) do not faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and frame the mind to the right vſe thereof. The general
ſcope of parents, when they ſet their children to learning,
tendeth only to the enabling of them, thereby to attaine
ſome meanes to liue by the profeſſion either of Law, of
Phyſicke, or of Diuinitie: for of the meaner intentions
I wil not ſpeake. And too common an error it is in ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
themſelues, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are entred into the Arts, which
are called liberal, to ſpend their time in curious ſearching
of ſubtilties, friuolous, and to no vſe: or els in purchaſing
rather an apparance of learning in the ſcience they apply
their ſtudies vnto, thereby to win the ſhorter way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
then the profound and exact knowledge of ſciences
themſelues; whereof euery one neuertheleſſe being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
attained, would yeeld no ſmal helpe and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to that bettering of the mind, which I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:17081:12"/>
But who is he that in the profeſſion of the Law, ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
at any other marke, then at ſufficiencie to pleade
well at the barre, to draw him the more clients, or to riſe
to ſuch dignities as thereby others climbe vnto: or in
Phyſick, then to haue a reputation of skil, to procure him
much practiſe to inrich himſelfe: or in Diuinitie, then to
be accounted a good Preacher, whereby he may get a
fruitful benefice, or be inueſted with ſome Biſhopricke
and title of honor? Or which of them do we ſee, that
when he hath hit the marke he ſhot at, and is come to the
height that his profeſſion can raiſe him vnto, doth ſhew
himſelfe ſincere, or incorrupt of mind, or ſo maſter ouer
his owne paſſions, as either through couetouſnes, or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
or loue, or hatred, he will not forget the dutie
which he oweth to that place, whereunto he is called,
and to him that hath giuen him the gift as well of the
meane as of the thing it ſelfe?</p>
            <p>To anſwer you therefore directly what kind of ſtudie
I affect or thinke may moſt better my mind, I will ſay
that it is none of theſe before mentioned: for albeit I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the true ſtudy of Diuinitie to include all that
knowledge, which may any way be required for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of mans life: yet becauſe there is a more ſpeciall
calling thereunto, then to any other, and ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in a more reuerent maner, and to a further end, then
that euery man might preſume to take it in hand, I dare
not venture to make my ſelfe a profeſſor of it. As for the
profeſſion of the Law, I will not in theſe yeares, and with
this mind, alienated from troubles and buſineſſe, giue
my ſelfe to the ſame, it being the principall meane and
high way to leade me againe into the labyrinth which I
deſire moſt to eſchew and voide. To Phyſicke I was by
my fathers choice appointed; for the performance
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17081:12"/>
of whoſe wil, as became me in dutie and obedience, all
the time I ſpent by his direction in ſtudie, I employed in
the knowlegde of the principles thereof: and ſithens, as
well for the vſe thereof to mine owne behoofe, as for
the delightfulneſſe, which the diſcouery of the ſecret o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
and effects of nature worketh (I ſuppoſe) in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man as it doth in me, I haue (when time and leiſure
would permit) bent my moſt ſtudy and reading to the
authors of that ſcience; but intention to profeſſe it, or to
practiſe it, in very deed as yet had I neuer none. For how
ſoeuer the prouidence of my father, or mine owne indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
had faſhioned me to be meete to make a Phyſition,
yet the higher prouidence had otherwiſe determined,
making me to take another courſe of life, which before
was neuer ſo much as once thought of by either of vs,
and made me of a ſcholer to become a ſeruant. By which
occaſion being drawne into this countrey, and left my
ſtudies, I haue ſo many yeares led my life here in ſuch ſort
as you haue ſeene. But hauing now withdrawne my ſelfe
from the toileſome place I held, and gathered my ſelfe
into a little compaſſe, as a ſnaile into his ſhell, my purpoſe
is (if God ſhall pleaſe to giue me his gracious aſſiſtance)
to ſpend my time in reading ſuch bookes, as I ſhall find
fitteſt to increaſe my knowledge in the duties of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
man, and direct me in the right path of vertue,
without tying my ſelfe to any particular kind. And as I
haue (God be thanked) ſome ſtore of all ſorts; ſo ſhall
I diſpenſe my time accordingly, ſometime in peruſing
ſuch as may inſtruct me more and more in the true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ſeruing God; ſometime in reading of hiſtories,
which are as mirrours or looking-glaſſes for euery man
to ſee the good and euill actions of all ages, the better to
ſquare his life to the rule of vertue, by the examples of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17081:13"/>
and ſometimes, and that for the moſt part (as thus
aduiſed) in the ſtudy of Morall Philoſophie, which fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
men fitteſt for ciuill conuerſation, teaching them
orderly what morall vertues are, and particularly what
is the proper action of euery one, and likewiſe what vice
is, and how vnſeemly a thing, and how harmefull to a
good mind the ſpot and contagion thereof is. To this
haue I euer had a ſpeciall inclination, and a greedy deſire
to inſtruct my ſelfe fully therein; which hitherto, partly
through the courſe I held whiles I was a ſcholer (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſaid) I could not wel do, and euer ſithens my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
buſines and attendance about mine office, haue
diuerted me therefro. And to profeſſe plainly the truth,
not any one thing hath ſo much preuailed to make me
reſolue the giuing ouer that place, as the longing I had,
and haue to returne to the courſe of reading Morall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
which I was euen then newly entred into, when
I was called to be employed in that office; and the delight
whereof was ſo great vnto me, for that little which I had
begun to reade, and the expectation ſuch, which I had
conceiued of the vſe thereof (as by which a man learneth
not onely to know how to carry himſelfe vertuouſly in
his priuat actions, but alſo to guide and order his family,
and moreouer, to become meete for the ſeruice of his
Prince and countrey, when occaſion of employment
may be offered vnto him) that I was halfe doubtfull
when I was ſummoned to come and take the place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ſhould accept thereof or no.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid M. <hi>Dormer,</hi> Yea but it ſeemeth to me that
theſe your words imply a contradiction, when ſaying
that you haue ſo earneſtly deſired to withdraw your ſelfe
from the exerciſe of your office, wherin you had ſo good
meanes, not only to make ſhew of your owne ſufficiency
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17081:13"/>
and vertue, and to do your Prince and countrey ſeruice,
and withall to pleaſure many of your friends, you ſeeme
neuertheles to direct your ſtudies to ſuch an end, as ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not onely at the knowledge of vertue, but alſo at the
practiſe thereof, whereby a man is made fit and enabled
for ſuch employments as the Prince or State ſhall lay
vpon him. For indeed it is an approoued ſaying among
Philoſophers, <hi>Virtutis laus, actio:</hi> and you know what
<hi>Tullie</hi> ſaith, and <hi>Plato</hi> before him, <hi>Non nobis nati ſumus,
partem patria, partem parentes, partem amici ſibi vendicant.</hi>
So as M. <hi>Smiths</hi> accuſation (for ought I ſee) may be held
as yet very reaſonable againſt you, vnles you can alledge
vs ſome better reaſon in your defence then hitherto you
haue done.</p>
            <p>In faith (quoth I) if you be all againſt me, I ſhall haue
much adoe to defend my ſelfe, ſince the old prouerbe is,
that, <hi>Ne Hercules quidem contraduos:</hi> and how can I then
reſiſt ſo many? But I hope that ſome of this companie
will take my part, though he haue foreſtalled me of the
two chiefe men, whoſe patronage might beſt haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
me, hauing gotten you two lawyers to pleade for
him. Yet becauſe I ſuppoſe you haue not bin entertained
by him for that purpoſe with any fee, and that you are
here, not as lawyers or aduocates to maintaine his cauſe,
but rather as indifferent Iudges, to determine who hath
the beſt right on his ſide; I hope that vpon better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
you will be drawne to iudge vprightly, and not
be caried away with apparances, which oftentimes hide
and caſt a cloud ouer the truth. And to anſwer therefore
to your obiection, which carieth with it ſome probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
I would eaſily confeſſe my ſelfe in fault, if this reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of my office had bin an abſolute retiring my ſelfe
from action, or that I had (as they ſay) forſworne any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17081:14"/>
employment for the ſeruice of the State or my Prince.
But if you pleaſe to conſider how this my reſolution
hath bin grounded vpon a deſire to be freed onely from
a place of ſuch continuall toile and attendance, as ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me to haue no time to ſpare, wherein I might almoſt
breathe, or take any reaſonable recreation; and not to liue
idle, or ſequeſtred ſo from action, as I ſhould onely ſpend
my time in reading or contemplation, I doubt not but
you wil find my words to agree wel inough without any
contradiction, and my courſe of life well enough fitting
a man that meaneth not to liue to himſelfe alone. For if
ſuch had bin my purpoſe, I would haue ſought out a
meeter dwelling then this ſo neare the citie, and I could
well enough haue deuiſed to haue bin farre from ſuch
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptrollers as M. <hi>Smith,</hi> and to haue auoided this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that I am now ſubiect vnto, not without hazard of
my reputation, hauing two ſuch perſons to aſſiſt my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer,
and beare vp his cauſe. You ſee that I haue not ſo
eſtranged my ſelfe from all employments, but that I can
be content to take paine in the increaſing of her Maieſties
reuenue, by the care I haue of her impoſt: I refuſe not
any other ordinary employments, as of trauelling in ſuch
commiſſions as the Lord Deputie and Councel oft times
direct vnto me for the examining of ſundrie cauſes:
neither do I ſo giue my ſelfe to be priuate, but that you
and other my friends, who vouchſafe of their courteſie
ſometimes to viſite me, find me apt enough to keep them
companie, either here at home, or elſe abroad: ſo as
though I deſire to know how to do theſe things as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
well as I might, and to that end frame my ſelfe as
much to ſtudy as conueniently I can, yet do I not therin
contradict the reaſonable and iuſt diſpoſition I haue to
employ my ſelfe for the ſeruice of her Maieſtie, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17081:14"/>
ſerueth: neither doth my endeuour in that behalf
any way oppoſe it ſelfe to my deſire, of retiring from a
painefull employment to a more quiet life, which now
(I thanke God) I enioy: wherein I may frankly and truly
proteſt vnto you, I find more ſweetnes and contentment
in one dayes expence, then I could taſte in ſeuen yeares
before, whiles I was Clerke of the Councell. And were it
but in regard of that ſame contentment, I know not what
man of reaſonable ſenſe and vnderſtanding, would not
eſteeme the purchaſe thereof at a farre higher rate then
any office in Ireland whatſoeuer. M. <hi>Smith</hi> therfore may
well enough put vp his pipes, and hold his peace hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
and I hope not onely yee two, but all the reſt of
this companie will hold him ſufficiently put to ſilence,
and begin to allow of this my reſolution, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it aimeth at ſo high a marke as humane felicitie.</p>
            <p>At which word the Primate ſeemed as it were to ſtart,
&amp; ſaid, what ſir? though we can be content to admit your
reaſons againſt M. <hi>Smith,</hi> and to allow of your reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
as hauing choſen (as our Sauiour ſaid to <hi>Martha</hi> of her
ſiſter) the better part; yet muſt you not thinke that we
will let euery thing go with you which you ſay: but by
your leaue, plucke you a little backe by the ſleeue, when
we ſee you preſſe forward preſumptuouſly, as now in
my opinion you do, when you ſeeme to ſhoote at ſuch
a marke as humane felicitie, which is without, not your
reach onely, but all mens, whiles they are here in this low
and muddie world: for I wis that is no where to be found
but aboue the ſtars: mans felicity is placed only in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
where God of his mercie hath appointed it for him to be
found, and not here on earth. I ſay of his mercie, becauſe
albeit he had ordained the ſame for man from before all
ages; yet our firſt father by his diſobedience depriuing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17081:15"/>
himſelfe and all his poſteritie of all poſſibilitie thereof,
the ſame was eftſoones by the infinite goodnes and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God purchaſed to him againe at a deare price, euen
the precious bloud of his deareſt Son, which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to ſhed for the ranſome of mankind, entrapped by
the diuell, and taken captiue, whereby he might returne
into his heauenly countrie againe, to enioy that happie
inheritance prepared there for him. Whoſoeuer therfore
ſhall ſeeke to get his felicitie here in this world, will find
himſelfe deceiued: and although it be ſaid to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
fitly, that he that ſhooteth at a ſtarre, aimeth higher
then he that ſhooteth at a furbuſh: yet well ye wot, that
to ſhoot vp to the ſtarres, is but meere follie and vanitie;
and no leſſe do I hold your aiming at ſo high a marke to
be, which is ſo farre out of your reach.</p>
            <p>I crie you mercie, my Lord, quoth I, if I haue ſtepped
into your marches before I were aware. But I may the
better be excuſed, becauſe I had no intention or purpoſe
ſo to do; but ſimply, and after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon maner of ſpeech
haue vſed the general word in ſtead of the particular. For
though I ſaid I aimed at the high marke of humane feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie,
yet for ſo little as I haue read in Morall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
I haue learned that <hi>Plato</hi> hath made mention of two
diſtinct felicities of man (and others beſides him) the one
a contemplatiue felicitie (which ſome men haply draw
neare vnto, but cannot perfectly attaine in this life;) the
other an actiue or practicke felicitie, conſiſting in vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
actions, and reducing of a mans paſſions vnder the
rule of reaſon. Which practicke felicitie may not onely
be atchieued here on earth by mans endeuour, aſſiſted
with Gods grace and fauour: but is alſo a great helpe and
meane for ſuch as obtaine the ſame, to bring them after
this life vnto the other in heauen. Of this latter, the rules
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17081:15"/>
whereof are to be taken from you Church-men and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines;
I meant not when I ſaid, I aymed ſo high, at the
leſtwiſe my purpoſe was not properly to ſay, that I ſhot
at that marke by my ſtudie, for then I ſhould haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
my former words, when I proteſted I durſt not
preſume to the ſtudie of Diuinitie, which (I well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood)
required a particular calling. But onely my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was to get your approbation, in that I had reſolued
by the ſtudy of Morall Philoſophie to compaſſe, ſo farre
forth as my endeuours could preuaile, that humane pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticke
felicitie, which of all men in all ages hath bene ſo
highly eſteemed; and for the directing of men wherunto,
ſo many great learned Philoſophers haue taken ſo great
trauell and paines to find out the ready way vnto it, and
by their writings to make the ſame knowne to others:
whereby not onely particular perſons might in this life
attaine to liue happily, but alſo purchaſe the ſame happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to their families, yea to whole Cities and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.
This felicitie (I think) euery wel diſpoſed man is
to labor for in this life; &amp; the better he is borne, the more
ought he to bend his ſtudy to learne by what meanes the
ſame is to be attained: and by working accordingly, to
prepare himſelfe to be fit and capable of that other when
ſoeuer he ſhall be called out of this world, knowing how
aſſured promiſes therof are giuen to them that in this life
liue vertuouſly; and how certain he may be, that the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that good which his vertuous actions ſhall extend to
the benefite of others in this life, the greater ſhall be his
reward in the life to come, where that felicitie is prepared
for them, that by the treading downe of their paſſions
and ſenſual appetites, ſhal endeuour to reduce their ſoule
to that pureneſſe and cleannes which is required in them
to whom that euerlaſting bliſſe and felicitie is promiſed.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17081:16"/>
For my part, the thing which I moſt earneſtly deſire, is
to learne the ſhorteſt way to compaſſe the ſame: and
happpie ſhould I thinke my ſelfe if I could find any man
whoſe knowledge and learning might helpe me to direct
my ſtudy to that end; becauſe I know right well how
hard it is for a man by his owne labour to ſearch out the
ready way to vnderſtand thoſe precepts, which haue bin
ſet downe in the learned writings of Philoſophers that
haue treated of that matter, eſpecially in the Greeke and
Latine tongues, in which it hath bin ſubſtantially hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
For although I cannot truly pretend ignorance in
the Latine, in which the workes of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> are
to be read: yet I confeſſe that I do not find that facilitie
in the conceiuing of their writings, as I could wiſh, or as
the greedineſſe of my deſire to apprehend might ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.
For <hi>Plato</hi> hath couched his ſenſe thereof ſo diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
in his dialogues, as I thinke he muſt be a man of
great learning and exact iudgement that ſhall picke them
out, and ſeuer them from the other parts of Philoſophie,
which he indeed moſt diuinely diſcourſeth vpon. And
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is not to me ſo cleare nor ſo eaſily vnderſtood
without deepe ſtudy, as my meane capacitie would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
ſpecially without the interpretation of ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſcholer then my ſelfe. And herein do I greatly enuie
the happineſſe of the Italians, who haue in their mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue
late writers, that haue with a ſingular eaſie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
taught all that which <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly
or obſcurely left written. Of which, ſome I haue
begun to reade with no ſmall delight, as <hi>Alexander Picco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomini,
Gio. Baptiſta Giraldi,</hi> and <hi>Guazzo,</hi> all three hauing
written vpon the Ethick part of Morall Philoſopie both
exactly and perſpicuouſly. And would God that ſome
of our countrimen wold ſhew themſelues ſo wel affected
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17081:16"/>
to the good of their countrie (whereof one principall
and moſt important part conſiſteth in the inſtructing of
men to vertue) as to ſet downe in Engliſh the precepts
of thoſe parts of Morall Philoſophy, whereby our youth
might without ſpending of ſo much time, as the learning
of thoſe other languages require, ſpeedily enter into the
right courſe of vertuous life. In the meane while I muſt
ſtruggle with thoſe bookes which I vnderſtand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelfe to plod vpon them, in hope that God (who
knoweth the ſincereneſſe of my deſire) will be pleaſed
to open my vnderſtanding, ſo as I may reape that profit
of my reading, which I trauell for. Yet is there a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in this company, whom I haue had often a purpoſe
to intreate, that as his leiſure might ſerue him, he would
vouchſafe to ſpend ſome time with me to inſtruct me
in ſome hard points which I cannot of my ſelfe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand:
knowing him to be not onely perfect in the Greek
tongue, but alſo very well read in Philoſophie, both mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and naturall. Neuertheles ſuch is my baſhfulnes, as
I neuer yet durſt open my mouth to diſcloſe this my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
vnto him, though I haue not wanted ſome hartning
thereunto from himſelfe. For of his loue and kindnes to
me, he encouraged me long ſithens to follow the reading
of the Greeke tongue, and offered me his helpe to make
me vnderſtand it. But now that ſo good an oportunitie
is offered vnto me, to ſatiſfie in ſome ſort my deſire;
I thinke I ſhould commit a great fault, not to my ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but to all this company, if I ſhould not enter my
requeſt thus farre, as to moue him to ſpend this time
which we haue now deſtined to familiar diſcourſe and
conuerſation, in declaring vnto vs the great benefites
which men obtaine by the knowledge of Morall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie,
and in making vs to know what the ſame is, what
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17081:17"/>
be the parts thereof, whereby vertues are to be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
from vices: and finally that he will be pleaſed to run
ouer in ſuch order as he ſhall thinke good, ſuch and ſo
many principles and rules thereof, as ſhall ſerue not only
for my better inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo for the contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and
ſatisfaction of you al. For I nothing doubt, but that euery
one of you will be glad to heare ſo profitable a diſcourſe,
and thinke the time very wel ſpent, wherin ſo excellent a
knowledge ſhal be reuealed vnto you, from which euery
one may be aſſured to gather ſome fruit as wel as my ſelf.
Therfore (ſaid I) turning my ſelfe to M. <hi>Spenſer,</hi> It is you
ſir, to whom it pertaineth to ſhew your ſelfe courteous
now vnto vs all, and to make vs all beholding vnto you
for the pleaſure and profit which we ſhall gather from
your ſpeeches, if you ſhall vouchſafe to open vnto vs the
goodly cabinet, in which this excellent treaſure of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
lieth locked vp from the vulgar ſort. And thereof in
the behalfe of all, as for my ſelfe, I do moſt earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
you not to ſay vs nay. Vnto which words of mine
euery man applauding moſt with like words of requeſt,
and the reſt with geſture and countenances expreſſing
as much, M. <hi>Spenſer</hi> anſwered in this maner.</p>
            <p>Though it may ſeeme hard for me to refuſe the requeſt
made by you all, whom, euery one alone, I ſhould for
many reſpects be willing to gratifie: yet as the caſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
I doubt not but with the conſent of the moſt part
of you, I ſhall be excuſed at this time of this taske which
would be laid vpon me. For ſure I am, that it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
vnto you, that I haue already vndertaken a work
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to the ſame effect, which is in <hi>heroical verſe,</hi> vnder
the title of a <hi>Faerie Queene,</hi> to repreſent all the moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
aſſigning to euery vertue, a Knight to be the patron
and defender of the ſame: in whoſe actions and feates
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17081:17"/>
of armes and chiualry, the operations of that vertue,
whereof he is the protector, are to be expreſſed, and the
vices &amp; vnruly appetites that oppoſe themſelues againſt
the ſame, to be beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe &amp; ouercome. Which work,
as I haue already well entred into, if God ſhall pleaſe to
ſpare me life that I may finiſh it according to my mind,
your wiſh (M. <hi>Bryſkett)</hi> will be in ſome ſort accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
though perhaps not ſo effectually as you could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
And the ſame may very well ſerue for my excuſe, if
at this time I craue to be forborne in this your requeſt,
ſince any diſcourſe, that I might make thus on the ſudden
in ſuch a ſubiect, would be but ſimple, and little to your
ſatisfactions. For it would require good aduiſement and
premeditation for any man to vndertake the declaration
of theſe points that you haue propoſed, containing in
effect the Ethicke part of Morall Philoſophie. Whereof
ſince I haue taken in hand to diſcourſe at large in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme
before ſpoken, I hope the expectation of that work
may ſerue to free me at this time from ſpeaking in that
matter, notwithſtanding your motion and all your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties.
But I will tell you, how I thinke by himſelfe he
may very well excuſe my ſpeech, and yet ſatisfie all you
in this matter. I haue ſeene (as he knoweth) a tranſlation
made by himſelfe out of the Italian tongue, of a dialogue
comprehending all the Ethick part of Moral Philoſophy,
written by one of thoſe three he formerly mentioned,
and that is by <hi>Giraldi,</hi> vnder the title of a dialogue of ciuil
life. If it pleaſe him to bring vs forth that tranſlation to be
here read among vs, or otherwiſe to deliuer to vs, as his
memory may ſerue him, the contents of the ſame; he ſhal
(I warrant you) ſatisfie you all at the ful, and himſelfe wil
haue no cauſe but to thinke the time well ſpent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiewing
his labors, eſpecially in the company of ſo many
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17081:18"/>
his friends, who may thereby reape much profit, and
the tranſlation happily fare the better by ſome mending
it may receiue in the peruſing, as all writings elſe may do
by the ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame. Neither let it trouble
him, that I ſo turne ouer to him againe the taske he wold
haue put me to: for it falleth out fit for him to verifie the
principall part of all this Apologie, euen now made for
himſelfe; becauſe thereby it will appeare that he hath not
withdrawne himſelf from ſeruice of the State, to liue idle
or wholy priuate to himſelfe, but hath ſpent ſome time
in doing that which may greatly benefit others, and hath
ſerued not a little to the bettering of his owne mind, and
increaſing of his knowledge, though he for modeſty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
much ignorance, and pleade want in wealth, much
like ſome rich beggars, who either of cuſtom, or for coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes,
go to begge of others thoſe things whereof they
haue no want at home.</p>
            <p>With this anſwer of M. <hi>Spenſers,</hi> it ſeemed that all the
company were wel ſatisfied: for after ſome few ſpeeches,
whereby they had ſhewed an extreme longing after his
worke of the <hi>Faerie Queene,</hi> whereof ſome parcels had
bin by ſome of them ſeene, they all began to preſſe me
to produce my tranſlation mentioned by M. <hi>Spenſer,</hi>
that it might be peruſed among them; or elſe that I
ſhould (as neare as I could) deliuer vnto them the
contents of the ſame, ſuppoſing that my memory
would not much faile me in a thing ſo ſtudied, and adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
ſet downe in writing, as a tranſlation muſt be. And
albeit I alledged for mine excuſe, that I had done it but
for mine exerciſe in both languages, not with purpoſe to
haue it ſeene, nor ſo aduiſedly, as had bin needful to come
vnder their cenſures: yet would they haue no nay, but
without protracting time in excuſes, I muſt needs fulfill
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17081:18"/>
their deſires; and ſo with a courteous force they made
me riſe from where I ſate to go fetch my papers. Which
being brought before them, I ſaid: Loe, here you may ſee
by the manner of theſe looſe ſheetes, how farre I meant
this labour of mine ſhould come to light: and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
lying of them, and the blots and interlinings which
you ſee, may giue you well enough to vnderſtand, how
hard a thing it is to haue it read before you, as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Beſides that, it is of ſuch a bulke and volume,
as you may eaſily vnderſtand, it cannot in a ſhort time
be runne ouer. And therefore ſince you haue ſo eaſily
acquited M. <hi>Spenſer</hi> of that charge which you all with me
ſeemed ſo deſirous to impoſe vpon him: you may do wel
in like courteous manner to diſcharge me of the like bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
that you would lay vpon me.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid ſir <hi>Robert Dillon,</hi> though it appeare indeed
vnto vs, that the loſe and diſorderly placing of the papers
with the interlinings, do make it vnfit to be read as we
deſired, and that the often interrupting of the ſenſe to
find out and match the places, would take away the beſt
part of the delight which the ſubiect might yeeld vs: yet
becauſe we know that you, hauing tranſlated the whole,
may eaſily with your memory ſupply the defects of the
papers; I for my part do thinke, and ſo I ſuppoſe do the
reſt here preſent, that it is no ſufficient reaſon to free you
from ſo profitable a labour, as this, whereby you may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
vs with thoſe worthy conceits in our owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which you haue in the Italian found to be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull,
and fit to be communicated by your trauell to
others. Therfore if you ſhal not think it good to reade it
vnto vs as it is ſet downe in the tranſlation preciſely; at
the leaſt yet this we will vrge you vnto, that you will be
content to deliuer vnto vs the general points of the ſame,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17081:19"/>
marſhalling them in their order, though in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the dialogue and perſons you follow not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
the forme of the author; and our diſpenſation in
that caſe ſhall ſerue to deliuer you from the blame, that
otherwiſe as an interpreter you might be ſubiect vnto.
For being done to vs, and at our requeſt, we ſhall be your
warrants, notwithſtanding any law or cuſtome to the
contrary. Be you onely willing to gratifie vs, and for the
reſt feare you no danger; ſince we ſit not here as in the
courts, to examine whether there be as well due forme,
as ſufficient matter in bills &amp; pleadings that are brought
before vs: but are here to paſſe the time with you in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and vertuous conuerſation. And the drift of our
ſpeeches hauing growne to this iſſue, that we ſhould
ſpend this ſhort ſpace which we may be together, in the
diſcourſing vpon the Ethick part of Morall Philoſophie,
and you hauing the ſubiect ſo ready at hand, in Gods
name we pray you, delay vs not by loſing time in friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
excuſes, but begin to open to vs this treaſure, which
you would ſo faine hide from our eyes.</p>
            <p>Here they began all to ſecond his ſpeeches, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunatly
to intreate me to accompliſh their deſire, that
being no further able to ſay them nay: I anſwered.</p>
            <p>Since ſuch is your will, I can no longer reſiſt you:
onely thus much I muſt proteſt vnto you, that you are
guiltie, not onely of whatſoeuer fault or error I ſhal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
againſt the lawes of an interpreter, but alſo of breach
of the law of hoſpitalitie, in ouerruling me in mine owne
houſe. And as for this I may iuſtly complaine of viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
yet perhaps find no redreſſe, ſo if any ſhal find fault with
me for not obſeruing the preciſe rules of a tranſlator, let
him impute the ſame not to me, but vnto you, hauing
ſome compaſſion vpon me, that beſides being conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17081:19"/>
to produce that which I purpoſed to haue kept to
my ſelfe, I am alſo forced to do it, not according to mine
owne choice, but in ſuch ſort as it hath pleaſed you to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
me. Well then, to gaine as much time as may be, I wil
omit the introduction of the author to his dialogue, as a
thing depending vpon former matter and occaſion, by
which the perſons introduced by him are fitted for his
purpoſe, &amp; ſuppoſing this preſent companie to be as apt
to conceiue the reaſons by him ſet downe, &amp; to make as
pertinent obiections as they did, I will begin euen there
where he, following the courſe of moſt others that haue
writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon that ſubiect, maketh entry into his diſcourſe.
But with this prouiſo, that, becauſe this day will not ſerue
vs to runne ouer the whole, you wil be content, that, as he
hath deuided his whole work into three dialogues, ſo we
may meete here three ſeuerall dayes, to giue euery ſeueral
dialogue of his one day to explane the ſame: for ſo much
(I think) may well be performed euery day. To which
they all agreeing, I tooke my looſe papers in hand, and
began in this manner following. I muſt now preſuppoſe
that ye, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I eſteeme to be as thoſe gentlemen introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by this author, haue likewiſe moued the ſame queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which they did, to wit, what maner of life a gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is to vndertake and propoſe to himſelfe, to attaine to that
end in this world, which among wiſemen hath bene, and
is accounted the beſt; beginning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the day of his birth,
and ſo guiding him therein vntill he be meet to purchaſe
the ſame end. And likewiſe where any occaſion of doubt
or queſtion, for the better vnderſtanding may happen in
the diſcourſe, that ſome one of you deſiring to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
therein, wil demaund ſuch queſtions as ſhal be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Wherein you ſhall find this author plentifully to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your expectations, not tying himſelfe abſolutely
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17081:20"/>
to follow neither <hi>Plato</hi> nor <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but gathering from
both, and from other excellent writers beſides, ſo much
as may yeeld you the greater and fuller ſatisfaction. Giue
eare therefore vnto his words.</p>
            <p>THe end in all things that men do in this world, is the
firſt that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, though afterwards it be the laſt
to be put in execution. And as, when it is brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
it beareth the name of effect, ſo is it the cauſe that
moueth all other to bring it to effect. And therefore to
treate of that end, which is now the motion inducing vs
to diſcourſe hereupon, we muſt come to the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
which may be the cauſes to bring a man to this end.
In which reſpect it were needfull for me firſt to ſpeake
of the generation of man, ſince as all ſeeds bring forth
their fruit like to themſelues; ſo falleth it out for the moſt
part in men: for ſuch as are the father and the mother,
ſuch are moſt commonly the children. I ſhould likewiſe
declare, how he that wil be a commendable father, ought
to haue a ſpeciall care, not of himſelfe onely (for him we
wil ſuppoſe to be a man endewed with all the ornaments
required for a wel compoſed body and mind) but of the
mother alſo. For albeit ſhe receiue the ſeed of generation
from the man; yet howſoeuer it be, the children when
they be once conceiued, take their nouriſhment from the
mother, and in her wombe, vntill the time of their birth:
whereby we see the children very often to retaine the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the mother. Alſo that in regard hereof, euery man
that intendeth to take a wife, ought to be very carefull in
the choice of her; ſo that ſhe may not be baſe of paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
vitious, wanton, deformed, lame, or otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
or defectiue: but well borne, vertuous, chaſte, of
tall and comely perſonage, and well ſpoken; to the end
that of father and mother, by kind gentle, vertuous, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17081:20"/>
and comely of ſhape and proportion, like children
may betweene them be brought forth. For fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wiſe men
hath proceeded that warning to men, that ſuch wiues
they ſhould chuſe as they wiſhed to haue their children.
And <hi>Archidamus</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> was condemned by
his citizens to pay a fine, for hauing taken to wife a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of very low ſtature; becauſe (ſaid they) ſhe is like to
bring vs forth no kings, but dandiprats. Thereby decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
how they accounted no ſmall part of the maieſtie of
a king, to conſiſt in the comely preſence and ſtature of his
body; and not without cauſe. For it is written, that the
goodly ſhew and apparance of a man, is the firſt thing
worthy ſoueraigntie. But becauſe in the requeſt made to
me, I am required to begin onely at his birth, I thinke it
ſhall ſuffice, if I declare vnto you in what maner he ought
to be nouriſhed, and brought vp, and inſtructed, till he
come to ſuch ripe yeares and iudgement as he may rule
himſelfe, and be his owne guide to direct all his actions
to that ſame end, which in all humane things is the laſt
and beſt. Neuertheles before I begin therewith, I would
haue you to vnderſtand, that the firſt gift which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beſtoweth on the ſon after he is borne, is his name,
by which he is all his life time to be called. Which name,
is to be wiſhed, may be decent and fit, ſo as it may ſeeme
the life of the child is marked with a ſigne or pronoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of good hap, and of being framed to the courſe
of vertue: for ſome are of opinion, that the name often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
preſageth the qualities and conditions of the child.
And therefore they are not to be commended that name
their children by the names of brute beaſts, as in ſome
countries is vſed; where the names of <hi>Leo,</hi> of <hi>Orſo,</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore,</hi>
of <hi>Pardo,</hi> of <hi>Cane,</hi> and ſuch like are in vſe: as if their
deſire were that their children ſhould reſemble thoſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17081:21"/>
wild and bruite beaſts in their conditions. Let men ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Gods name be intitled with names meet for men,
and ſuch as may ſignifie or carry with them dignitie, or
rather holineſſe and religion, and leaue to bruite beaſts
their owne poſſeſion.</p>
            <p>Then, ſaid ſir <hi>Robert Dillon,</hi> before you proceed any
further, I pray you let vs vnderſtand whether that point
be cleare or no, of the nouriſhing all manner of children.
For among <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his lawes, there was one, whereby
it was ordained, that ſuch children as were borne vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in any part of their bodies, crooked, miſ-ſhapen,
of ill aſpect, ſhould not onely, not be foſtered vp, but
alſo be throwne downe from the top of a high rocke, as
creatures condemned by God and nature in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
and ſo marked by them, to the end that men
might know, that ſuch (if they were through ignorance
bred &amp; nouriſhed) were likely to bring harme and ruine
to the houſes and common-wealths wherein they ſhould
liue. Let vs therfore heare your authors opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that law.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt (ſaid I) but that ſuch was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and ſuch his law, though cruell and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt.
Neuertheles though the felicitie of man be a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of all the good gifts of body and mind, and he that
is ſo borne, cannot indeed be properly termed happie in
the higheſt degree of worldly happines: yet much more
prudently haue thoſe wiſe men determined, who ſay,
that the imperfections of mens bodies which are borne
with them, are not to be imputed to them as hurtful or
ſhamefull, becauſe it is not in their power to auoid them.
And who is he that can be ſo hard hearted as to ſlay an
infant ſo cruelly, onely becauſe nature hath ſhaped him
vnperfect in any of his lims? The mind of any good man
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17081:21"/>
abhorreth to thinke ſuch a thing, much more to put it in
execution.</p>
            <p>Indeed (replied ſir <hi>Robert Dillon)</hi> pittie ought alwaies
to be before the eyes of al men, as a thing natural to them,
and without which they are vnworthy the name of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie:
yet muſt not this pittie extend ſo farre for any
particular compaſſion, as thereby to confound the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
order of things. The pittie which <hi>Hecuba</hi> had of
<hi>Paris</hi> (as Poets haue taught vs) was the cauſe that <hi>Troy</hi>
was burnt, and <hi>Priamus</hi> with all his worthy family de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:
which things (ſay they) had neuer happened, if
contrary to the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Gods (who by her dreame
forewarned her of thoſe euils) ſhe had not ſaued him.
If then it were true, as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> affirmed, that the markes
or tokens, ſo brought into the world by children from
their mothers wombe, ſhould foretell ſuch to be likely to
bring ruine or calamitie to their cities or countries; were
it not better that he that is ſo brone, ſhould rather die in
his cradle, then be nouriſhed to become the ouerthrow
and deſolation of a whole people? We know that by the
opinion of the wiſeſt, it is expedient rather one ſhould
die to ſaue a multitude, then by ſparing his life a number
ſhould periſh.</p>
            <p>That opinion (ſayd I) is not vnworthy wiſe men, but
it is deepely to be conſidered, and their meaning to be
looked into, for ſo ſhall we find no ſuch ſenſe therein, as
you inferre: for thoſe men ſpake not of children newly
borne, who are not able, either by ſpeech or deed, to giue
any ſigne or token, whereby it may be gathered, that
they will proue either good or euill; but of ſuch, as being
commonly heads and ring-leaders of factious and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
people, do make themſelues authors of the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of noble families and whole cities: ſuch as were
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17081:22"/>
both the <hi>Gracchi</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſundry others in <hi>Greece.</hi>
And ſo it is to be applied, to wit, that ſuch a man ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
die, then for the ſauing of his life, a whole citie or
people ſhould go to wracke. Or otherwiſe, when in time
of warre, by the ioyning of two armies in battell, a great
multitude were likly to be ſlaine, it were farre better that
one, or two, or moe, in certaine number on each ſide
ſhould fight and hazard their liues in ſtead of the reſt,
then their whole powers to meet, and venter the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the moſt part of them. As in the beginning of the
State of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Horatij</hi> and the <hi>Curiatij</hi> did to keepe
from hazard of battell both people, which were ready ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and prepared to fight together. In like manner may
that ſaying be applied, in caſe a whole citie be in danger
of deſolation, &amp; that the death of one man may redeeme
the ſame. As by <hi>Curtius</hi> the ſame citie of <hi>Rome</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued:
who with ſo great courage threw himſelfe armed
on horſebacke into that peſtilent pit which infected the
whole citie, to the end that by his death he might ſaue
the people from that mortalitie and infection. And the
ſame effect (but farre more excellently) did our Sauiour
likewiſe work, who to redeeme mankind from the bands
of hell, tooke vpon him all our ſinnes, through which we
were become thrals to Satan; and for our ſaluation yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
himſelfe willingly to a moſt bitter death. But as in
ſuch caſes it is to be allowed, that one ſhould die for the
people: ſo is it much more to be diſcommended then I
can declare, that an infant newly borne ſhould be killed,
though by defect of nature, want of ſeed, or any ſtraine
or miſchance of the mother, or through abundance of ill
humors, or any other ſtrange accident, it be borne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
or marked as is ſaid.</p>
            <p>Well, ſaid ſir <hi>Robert Dillon,</hi> it is true indeed that the law
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17081:22"/>
of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was too cruell and vniuſt. But <hi>Plato</hi> in his
books <hi>de Repub<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> deuiſed a more mild and reaſonable way:
for he allowed not that ſuch children ſhould be killed, as
holding it inhumane, yet he ordained that they ſhould
be brought vp in ſome place appointed out of the citie,
and that they ſhould be debarred all poſſibilite of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any rule or magiſtracie in the Common-wealth. For
it ſeemed, he thought that through the intemperance and
diſordinate liuing of the parents, children came to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
no leſſe deformed and corrupt in mind then in
body: and therein the exceſſe of drinking wine to be a
principall cauſe. In which reſpect he forbad as wel to the
man as to the woman the vſe of wine at ſuch times as
they were diſpoſed to attend the generation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> (ſaid I) muſt not be left vnanſwered, neither wil I
ſpare to ſay (by his leaue) that his law, though it be milder
then the other, was neuer the more allowable for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
aboue ſpecified. For it is not alwayes true, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
of the body are likewiſe in the mind: or that
a faire body hath euermore a faire mind coupled vnto it.
Haue we not ſeene men of miſ-ſhapen bodies that haue
had diuine minds, and others of goodly perſonages that
haue bin very furies of hell? as <hi>Plato</hi> himſelfe conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the force of truth and dayly experience could
not but confeſſe. The good or bad ſhape of the body
therefore, muſt be no rule for vs to bring vp, or not to
bring vp our children, though it be to be eſteemed a
great grace to be borne with ſeemely and wel proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
members: and that it is a ſpeciall point of happineſſe
to haue a faire mind harbored in a comely body, becauſe
both together beare with them a naturall grace, pleaſing
and gratefull to the eyes of men, conſtraining in a ſort
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17081:23"/>
the loue of all that behold them: which thing <hi>Virgil</hi> wel
vnderſtanding, when he ſpake of <hi>Eurialus,</hi> ſaid,</p>
            <p>Gratior &amp; pulchro veniens in corpore virtus,
Adiuuat, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For although vertue of it ſelfe be louely and to be highly
eſteemed, yet when ſhe is accompanied with the beauty
of the bodie, ſhe is more amiable (whatſoeuer <hi>Seneca</hi> the
Stoicke, more ſeuere then need, pleaſe to ſay) and with
more affection embraced of all them that ſee her.
Which thing appeared in <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> when he met
with <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> his enemy in the preſence of king <hi>Siphax:</hi>
for as ſoone as the ſubtill African had beheld the comely
preſence and gratefull countenance of <hi>Scipio,</hi> he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
conceiued that, which afterward fell out, to wit,
that <hi>Scipio</hi> would draw <hi>Siphax</hi> to ioyne with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
againſt the Carthaginians. But for all this we are
not in any wiſe to eſteeme a perſon in body miſ-ſhapen
or deformed, leſſe worthy to be nouriſhed, or to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to magiſtracie, if he be vertuous, then the other
that is of gratefull preſence. For though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thinke
the deformitie of the body to be an impediment to the
perfect felicitie of man, in reſpect of exteriour things;
yet he determineth, that it is no hindrance to the courſe
of vertue. To conclude therfore this point, though chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
be borne weake, crooked, miſ-ſhapen, or deformed
of body, they are not therefore to be expoſed, but as wel
to be brought vp and inſtructed as the other, that they
may grow and increaſe in vertue, and become worthy
of thoſe dignities which are diſpenſed in their common-weales.
And, me thinketh, <hi>Socrates</hi> that wiſe man ſpake
very well to his ſcholers, and to this purpoſe, when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed
them, that they ſhould often behold themſelues in
looking-glaſſes: to the end (ſaid he) that if you ſee your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17081:23"/>
faces and bodies comely and beautifull, ye may endeuor
to ſet forth and grace the gifts of nature the better, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning
vertues thereunto: and if ye perceiue your ſelues
to be deformed and il-fauoured, you may ſeeke to ſupply
the defects of nature, with the ornaments of vertue,
thereby making your ſelues no leſſe grateful and amiable
then they that haue beautiful bodies. For it is rather good
to ſee a man of body imperfect and diſproportioned en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with vertues, then a goodly body to be nought elſe
but a gay veſſell filled with vice and wickednes. Children
are to be bred, ſuch as nature giueth them vnto vs, and we
are to haue patience to abide their proof, and to ſee what
their actions will be: and if theirs that be of deformed
body, do proue good and vertuous, they are ſo much the
more to be commended, as they ſeemed leſſe apt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by their birth. And on the contrary ſide, they that
being beautifull of body, are lewd and vitious, deſerue to
be driuen from the conuerſation of ciuil men; yea chaſed
out of the world, as vnthankful acknowledgers of ſo great
a gift beſtowed vpon them, and as vnworthy to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men. Theſe how faire ſoeuer (be they children or
men) that cary one thing in their tongue, and another in
their heart, be they that deſerue to be hunted out of all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
ſocietie, that are ingrate for benefites receiued; who
hurt, or ſeeke to hurt them that haue done them good,
and hate them, onely becauſe they cannot but know
themſelues to be bound vnto them. Theſe be they that
in very truth are crooked, miſ-ſhapen and monſtrous,
and might well be condemned to be buried quicke: not
ſimple innocent babes, who, hauing no election, can
yeeld not tokens either of good or euill; againſt whom
to pronounce ſentence of death before they haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
is great iniuſtice and exceeding crueltie. And this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17081:24"/>
(loe) is the ſentence of this author touching the doubt
propoſed, wherein (if you reſt ſatisfied) I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede.</p>
            <p>All the companie aſſented to the ſame: and then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Dormer</hi> ſaid; Now then (I pray you) let vs heare you
declare what this end is, whereof you were diſcourſing
when this doubt was propoſed, and withall we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that you ſhall ſhew vs and ſet vs in the way wherein
we are to trauel for the attaining thereof, and giue vs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
whereby that perfection may be purchaſed, vnto
which all men deſirous to become happie in this life, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their actions and their endeuours.</p>
            <p>Of this expectation (quoth I) you need not feare to
be fruſtrated, for here ſhall you haue enough (I aſſure my
ſelfe) to fulfill your deſire: and therewith, peruſing my
papers, I thus followed. The end of man in this life, is
happineſſe or felicitie: and an end it is called (as before
was ſaid) becauſe all vertuous actions are directed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and becauſe for it chiefly man laboureth and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelleth
in this world. But for that this felicitie is found to
be of two kinds, wherof one is called ciuill, and the other
contemplatiue: you ſhall vnderſtand that the ciuill feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
is nothing elſe then a perfect operation of the mind,
proceeding of excellent vertue in a perfect life; and is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued
by the temper of reaſon, ruling the diſordinate
affects ſtirred vp in vs by the vnreaſonable parts of the
mind, (as when the time ſhall ſerue will be declared)
and guiding vs by the meane of vertue to happy life.
The other which is called contemplation, or contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
felicitie, is likewiſe an operation of the mind, but of
that part thereof which is called intellectiue, ſo that thoſe
parts which are void of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue no intermedling with
the ſame: for he which giueth himſelfe to follow this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17081:24"/>
ſuppreſſeth all his paſſions, and abandoning all
earthly cares, bendeth his ſtudies and his thoughts who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnto heauenly things; and kindled and inflamed with
diuine loue, laboureth to enioy that vnſpeakable beauty,
which hath bin the cauſe ſo to inflame him, and to raiſe
his thoughts to ſo high a pitch. But foraſmuch as our
purpoſe is now to intreate onely of the humane precepts
and inſtructions, and of that higheſt good, which in this
vale of miſery, may be obtained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye ſhall vnderſtand that
the end whereunto man ought to direct all his actions,
is properly that ciuill felicitie before mentioned; which
is, an inward reward for morall vertues, and wherein for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
can chalenge no part or intereſt at all. And this end
is ſo peculiar to reaſon, that not onely vnreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
can be no partakers thereof, but yong children alſo
are excluded from the ſame. For albeit they be naturally
capable of reaſon, yet haue they no vſe of her, through
the imperfection of their yong age, becauſe this end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be attained by perfect operations in a perfect life,
neither of which, the child, nor the yong man is able to
performe, it followeth that neither of them can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
happie. And by the ſame reaſon it commeth to
paſſe, that though man be the ſubiect of felicitie, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the child nor the yong man may be ſaid properly to
be the ſubiect therof, but in power and poſſibilitie only:
yet the yong man approcheth nearer thereunto then the
child. And thus much may ſuffice for a beginning,
to ſatisfie the firſt part of your demaund.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid Captaine <hi>Carleil,</hi> ſeeing you haue propoſed
to vs this end, which is the marke (as it were) whereat all
ciuill actions do leuel, as at their higheſt or chiefeſt good,
we will now be attentiue to heare the reſt, and how you
will preſcribe a man to order his life, ſo as from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17081:25"/>
and ſo forward from age to age, he may direct his
thoughts and ſtudies to the compaſſing of this good, or
<hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> as Philoſophers do terme it.</p>
            <p>That ſhal you alſo vnderſtand, quoth I, but then muſt
the diſcourſe thereof be drawne from a deeper conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Thoſe men that haue eſtabliſhed lawes for people
to be ruled by, ought to haue framed ſome among the
reſt for the foundation of mans life, by which a true and
certaine forme of life might be conceiued, and ſuch, as
beginning to leade him from his childhood, might haue
ſerued him for a guide, vntill he had attained to thoſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
yeares, wherein he might rather haue bin able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
others, then need to be himſelfe inſtructed. For the
foundation of honeſt and vertuous liuing, beginneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in childhood: neither ſhal he euer be good yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that in his childhood is naught; nor a wicked yong man
lightly proue good when he is old. For, ſuch as are the
principles and beginnings of things, ſuch are the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
Whereupon the wiſeſt men of the world, haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thought, that the way to haue cities and common-wealths
furniſhed with vertuous and ciuil men, conſiſted
in the bringing vp of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commendably. But among
all the lawes of our time, there is no one that treateth of
any ſuch matter. There are orders and lawes both vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
and particular, how to determine cauſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie,
to end ſtrifes and debates, and how to puniſh
malefactors: but there is no part in the whole body of
the law, that ſetteth downe any order in a thing of ſo
great importance. Yet <hi>Plato</hi> held it of ſuch moment,
as knowing that the well bringing vp of children, was the
ſpring or wel-head of honeſt life: he thought it not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
that the fathers onely ſhould take care of nurturing
their children, but appointed beſides publike magiſtrates
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17081:25"/>
in the common-wealth, who ſhould attend that matter,
as a thing moſt neceſſary. For though man be framed by
nature mild and gentle, yet if he be not from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
diligently inſtructed and taught, he becometh of
humane and benigne that he was, more fierce and cruell
then the moſt wild and ſauage beaſt of the field. Wheras
if he be conueniently brought vp, and directed to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
courſe of life: of benigne and humane that he
is, he becometh through vertue in a ſort diuine. And
to the end the cauſe may be the better knowne, why ſo
great diligence is needful and requiſite, you muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that although our ſoule be but one in ſubſtance,
and properly our true forme, yet hath it not one onely
part, power, or facultie, or vertue (as we may call it) but
diuers, appointed for diuers and ſundry offices. For we
being participant of the nature of all things liuing, and
thoſe being deuided into three kinds; it is neceſſary that
man ſhold haue ſome part of euery of thoſe three. There
is then one baſe and inferiour kind of life of leſſe eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then the reſt, and that is the life of trees and plants,
and of all ſuch things as haue roote in the earth, which
ſpring, grow, bloome, and bring forth fruite: which fruit
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, cometh from them in ſtead of excrement,
together with their ſeed. And theſe trees and plants, and
ſuch like growing things, haue onely life, deuoid of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(though <hi>Pythagoras</hi> thought otherwiſe) or of any
knowledge: but by the benefite of nature onely, they
ſpring, they grow, and bringforth fruite and ſeed for the
vſe of man, and for the maintaining of their kind. There
is another kind of life, leſſe imperfect then that, which is
the ſame that perfect liuing creatures haue (for of that
life, which is in maner a meane between the life of plants
and this of ſenſible creatures, we need not now to ſpeake;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17081:26"/>
or if it were, we ſhould reſemble it to that which Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
call <hi>Embrio,</hi> and is the creature vnperfect in the
wombe, whiles it is betweene the forme of ſeed, and of
the kind whence it cometh) which life of perfect liuing
creatures, hath in it by nature power to feele, and to
moue from place to place. For we ſee they ſtir and feele,
and haue power to deſire thoſe things that are meete for
the maintaining of their life and of their nature. And by
natural inclination, and for the increaſe and continuance
of their kinds, they couet the ioyning of their bodies, to
yeeld vnto nature that, which of nature they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that is, to ingender the like vnto themſelues. But
this power of the ſoule, cannot vſe that force and vertue
which naturally it hath, if it haue not withall that former
part which is proper (as is ſaid) to plants, &amp; is called <hi>vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue</hi>
(you muſt giue me leaue to vſe new words of Art,
ſuch as are proper to expreſſe new conceits, though they
be yet ſtrange, and not denizened in our language) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it giueth life and increaſe to growing things, and
without it the power of feeling doth vtterly faile. Next
after this, cometh that excellent and diuine part of the
ſoule, which bringeth with it the light of reaſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
in it the powers, faculties, or vertues of the other
two. For it hath that life which proceedeth from plants;
it hath ſenſe or feeling, &amp; motion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the ſecond kind; and it hath beſides that other part,
wherby it knoweth, vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, diſcourſeth, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſulteth,
chuſeth, and giueth it ſelfe to operation, and to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
things naturall and diuine: and this part is proper
only to man. And as by the two other faculties before
mentioned, we are like to plants and to bruite beaſts: ſo
by this laſt, we do participate of the diuine nature of God
himſelfe. Wherefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, that man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17081:26"/>
vpright, for no other cauſe, then for that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
was diuine, whoſe nature and office is to know
and vnderſtand. And truly this gift is giuen vnto vs by
the maker and gouernour of all things, becauſe we might
know our ſelues to be of a nature moſt perfect among
earthly things, and not farre inferiour to the diuine. And
that we haue receiued ſo ſingular a gift from Almightie
God for no other cauſe, but onely to the end we might
perceiue how all other things that grow and liue on
earth, are corruptible, and do reſolue into their firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
or beginnings, and ceaſe any more to be, as ſoone
as the ſoule of life departeth from them: but that our
minds are immortal and incorruptible, whereby we may
reſt aſſured of an eternall life. Since then theſe three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of the ſoule are in vs, it is cleare, that as the plants,
among things that beare life, are the moſt imperfect; ſo
that part of the ſoule is moſt vnperfect which is proper
to their kind: but it is ſo neceſſary to all other kinds, as
without it there is no life, and with it the reſt of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
that are ioyned therewith, though they be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier,
decay and fall. And this neceſſitie of nature, that
without it ſhe giueth no life, maketh the ſame to be moſt
baſe and ignoble. For among natural things, thoſe, which
are ſo neceſſary, as without them nothing can be done,
are alwaies held and reputed the moſt vnworthy. Which
thing we may ſee in that we call <hi>Materia prima:</hi> which
though it be in nature before the <hi>forme,</hi> yet becauſe of
the neceſſitie thereof, it is eſteemed of no nobilitie in
compariſon of the <hi>forme.</hi> And euen ſo likewiſe among
the ſenſes, that of feeling is held the baſeſt, becauſe no
perfect liuing creature can be without it, nor yet the reſt
of the ſenſes, vnleſſe that be preſent. And therefore <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
ſaid, that the other ſenſes were giuen to man, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17081:27"/>
thereby he might liue the better; but the ſenſe of feeling
was giuen him, becauſe without it he could neither be,
nor liue. Now for ſo much as life may be without ſenſe,
becauſe the <hi>ſenſitiue</hi> ſoule is not of ſuch neceſſitie as is the
<hi>vegetatiue,</hi> therefore is that of more nobilitie then this
ſomewhat, yet inferiour to the <hi>intellectiue,</hi> which can no
more be without the <hi>ſenſitiue,</hi> then the <hi>ſenſitiue</hi> without
the <hi>vegetatiue.</hi> And becauſe the <hi>intellectiue</hi> ſoule is not
of neceſſitie ſeruing to any other facultie or power, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is ſhe as Lady, Miſtris, and Queene ouer all other the
powers, faculties, or vertues of the ſoul; ſo as there is none
proper vnto man, but that whereby he may be either
good or bad, happie or vnhappie: and the ſame is it,
whereby we vnderſtand and make choice rather of one
courſe of life then of another. This great gift hath God
beſtowed vpon vs, to ſhew his great grace and goodnes,
and for this purpoſe, that, as he hath inuited vs through
vertue of our vnderſtanding to the knowledge of truth,
and by this knowledge to become like vnto himſelfe; ſo
we ſhould bend all our ſtudy and endeuours thereunto,
as the end and ſcope of our life in this world. Of which,
the occaſion of this our preſent ſpeech did firſt ariſe.</p>
            <p>Here I pawſing a while, as to take breath, and withall
to order ſome of the papers, the Lord Primate ſpake, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Hauing treated thus farre of the powers, faculties,
vertues, or parts of the ſoule, I thinke it not impertinent
to moue a queſtion, whether they be in man ſeparate,
and in ſeuerall places; or whether they be vnited all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and ſeated in one place?</p>
            <p>This queſtion (quoth I) is very pertinent to this place,
and by the author here reſolued as a doubt, not lightly
or eaſie to be anſwered. Firſt, for that there haue not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſome, who would needs haue that theſe three powers
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17081:27"/>
of the ſoule, were three diſtinct ſoules, and not ioyned in
one ſoule, appointed for ſeuerall offices. But becauſe that
opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath bin eſteemed but vaine, it needeth not to be
inſiſted vpon; but briefly that I declare, what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
and <hi>Plato,</hi> with their followers, haue held. The firſt, with
his ſcholers, affirme the reaſonable ſoule to be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
indiuiſible: and albeit they aſſigne vnto her diuers
vertues, yet will they not haue them to be indeed ſeueral
and diuers, but that the diuerſitie ſhould proceed &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
only in the maner of vnderſtanding them: ſuppoſing
them to be in the ſoule after ſuch a ſort, as in the line of
a circle, the inner part which is hollow or embowed, and
the outward which is bended. Which two parts, though
we vnderſtand them diuerſly, yet are they but one line,
and not ſeuerall. Neither do they aſſigne vnto her diuers
places: but ſay that ſhe is all and whole in all our body,
and in euery part of the ſame, and apt there to exerciſe
all her functions, if the parts were apt to receiue them.
But becauſe euery part is not diſpoſed to receiue them,
therefore ſhe maketh ſhew of them onely in ſuch as are
made fit inſtruments to execute her powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
So giueth ſhe vertue to the eye to ſee, to the eare
to heare, and to the reſt of the members that are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of our ſenſes. But <hi>Plato</hi> and his ſect, haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to euery power of facultie of the ſoule, a peculiar ſeate in
mans body: for though they held the ſoul to be but one,
endued with ſeueral vertues or powers; yet they affirmed
that euery one of thoſe had a ſeuerall ſeate appointed in
mans body. To the <hi>vegetatiue</hi> (from which, as from a
fountaine, they ſaid, the <hi>concupiſcible</hi> appetite doth flow)
they appointed the Liuer for her place. To the <hi>ſenſitiue,</hi>
whence cometh (ſay they) the feruent paſſion of anger,
they gaue the Heart. But the reaſonable ſoule (as being
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17081:28"/>
the moſt diuine thing vnder heauen, they aſſigned to
hold her ſeate, like a Queene in a royal chaire, euen in the
head: vnto which opinion, all the Greek authors of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke
haue leaned, and ſpecially <hi>Galen</hi> the excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who hath not onely attributed
three ſeuerall ſeates to the three ſeuerall faculties of the
ſoule, in reſpect of their operations; but hath alſo ſhewed
with what order thoſe members are framed, that muſt be
the receptacles of thoſe faculties. For he ſheweth how
the firſt member, that taketh forme after the conception,
is the liuer, from whence ſpring all the veines, that like
ſmall brookes, carry bloud ouer all the body. And in this
member doth he place the liuing or nouriſhing ſoule,
which we haue termed <hi>vegetatiue,</hi> affirming it to be moſt
approching to nature. Next vnto this, he placeth the
heart, wherein all the vitall ſpirits are forged, and receiue
their ſtrength: for the generation whereof, the liuer ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
bloud thither, where it is refined, and made more
pure and ſubtill; and from thence by the arteries (which
all ſpring from the heart) the ſame ſpirits are ſpread tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout
the whole body. And theſe two principall
members, are the ſeates of the two principall appetites,
the <hi>iraſcible</hi> and the <hi>concupiſcible;</hi> of that the heart, of this
the liuer. And becauſe all this while the creature hath
yet no need (as being vnperfect) of ſenſe or motion, it
is buſied about nothing but receiuing of nouriſhment.
Somewhat further off from the heart, beginneth the
braine to grow, and from it do all the ſenſes flow; and
then (loe) beginneth the child to take forme and
ſhape of a perfect creature, the face, the hands, and the
feet being then faſhioned, with the other parts of the
body, apt for feeling and voluntary mouing: and from
thence be deriued the ſinewes, the bands or ligaments,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17081:28"/>
and muſcles are framed, by which the motions of the
members are diſpoſed. This part is the ſeate of the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
ſoule, by vertue and power of which, we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
we will, we diſcourſe, we know, we chuſe, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
and do all thoſe operations which appertaine
vnto reaſon. And as nature hath placed the braine a good
diſtance off from the other two principall members; ſo
hath ſhe framed a cartilage, or thin rynd, or skin to ſeuer
the heart from the liuer and other inward bowels, as with
a fence or hedge betweene them and the other baſer parts
that are leſſe pure. For the heart is purer, and ſo is that
bloud which conueyeth the ſpirits from it throughout
the body, then the liuer; or the bloud which is ingendred
in the ſame. And in this reſpect was <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by <hi>Galen,</hi> in that he gaue to the heart alone,
that which appertained to all three the principall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
aforeſaid. For though he aſſigned diuers vertues or
powers to the ſoule, yet he placed them all in the heart
alone; from which he ſaid (contrary to that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe and experience teacheth) that all the veines,
arteries and ſinewes of the body were deriued. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we ſhould go too farre aſtray from our purpoſe, if
I ſhould diſcourſe particularly all that which may be ſaid
in this matter, I will returne (if you ſo thinke good)
to our former purpoſe, which I left to ſatisfie your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund.</p>
            <p>Thus much (ſaid the Lord Primate) hath not a little
opened the vnderſtanding of this matter, and therefore
you may proceed, vnleſſe any other of the company
haue any other doubt to propoſe. But they all being ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and ſeeming attentiue to heare further, I ſaid; Now
that you haue vnderſtood what the powers and faculties
of the ſoule are, it followeth to be declared, how the ages
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17081:29"/>
of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life haue ſimilitude with the ſame. As the ſoule of
life therfore, called <hi>vegetatiue,</hi> is the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reſt,
and conſequently of the baſeſt: ſo is the age of childhood
the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the other ages, and therfore the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for the neceſſity which it carieth with it. And becauſe
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, the other ages are built, there ought the greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
to be vſed about the ſame, to make it paſſe on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the other more noble then it ſelf: ſo as we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue a hope, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a wel-guided childhood
the child may enter into a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable youth, and thence
paſſe to a more riper age, by the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vertue. But firſt
ye muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wil in no wiſe yeeld, that
this inferior ſoule ſhould be capable of reaſon; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
placeth in the ſenſible ſoule, both the <hi>concupiſcible</hi>
and the <hi>iraſcible</hi> appetites. And contrariwiſe, <hi>Plato</hi> (as
before is ſaid) diſtinguiſheth theſe two affects, into both
theſe faculties of the ſoule, giuing to the firſt the <hi>concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible,</hi>
and the <hi>iraſcible</hi> to the other. And becauſe <hi>Plato</hi>
his opinion hath generally bin better allowed then <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles,</hi>
I will ſpeake thereof according as <hi>Plato</hi> hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
This baſer ſoule then, being that, whereby we
be nouriſhed, we grow, we ſuſtaine life, and receiue our
body and being; about whoſe maintaining and increaſe,
ſhe vſeth continually, whether we wake or ſleep, without
any endeuour of our owne, her vertue and operation (if
food and nouriſhment faile not) is in her ful force, chiefly
in childhood: and as ſoone as the child is borne, ſtirreth
vp the deſire of food, to the end that by little and little
it might gather ſtrength of body, to become apt for the
vſe of the ſoule, whoſe organ or inſtrument it is, for the
accompliſhing of the more noble operations meet for
man. And becauſe the milk of the mother, or of the nurſe,
is the firſt fit food for the infant; it were to be wiſhed,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17081:29"/>
that it ſhould receiue the ſame rather from the mother,
then from any ſtrange woman: for, in reaſon, the ſame
ſhould be more kindly and natural for the babe then any
other. In conſideration whereof, the inſtructors of ciuill
life, haue determined and taught, that it is the fathers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to teach and inſtruct the child, but the mothers to
nouriſh it. For wiſe men ſay, that Nature hath giuen to
women their breſts, not ſo much for defence of the hart,
as becauſe they ſhould nouriſh their children: and that
ſhe hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them two paps, to the end that they might
nouriſh two, if by chance they ſhold be deliuered of two
at once. And truly it cannot be, but that would much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
both the loue of the mother to the child, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that of the child to the mother. Neuertheles, if it fal
out (as oftentimes it doth) that the mother cannot giue
ſucke to her child, or for other conſiderations ſhe giue it
forth to be nurſed to another woman; yet is there ſpecial
regard to be had, in getting ſuch a nurſe as may be of
good complexion, and of louing nature, and honeſt
conditions, that with milke it may alſo ſuck a diſpoſition
to a vertuous and commendable life.</p>
            <p>By your licence (ſaid M. <hi>Dormer)</hi> let me aske you a
queſtion, whether you thinke that the mind taketh any
qualitie from the nutriment of the body: for if the mind
be diuine, me ſeemeth it is againſt reaſon, that it ſhould
not be of greater power, then to receiue corruption from
the nutriment of the body.</p>
            <p>You ſay very well, quoth I, and here ſhall you be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
of that doubt. That the mind is a diuine thing,
cannot be denied. And if the vertue of the mind (which
is reaſon) could be freed from the company of thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two faculties of the ſoule, void of reaſon, in reſpect
of themſelues, it would doubtleſſe remaine ſtill in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17081:30"/>
of one nature, and not receiue any vice from that
nutriment, which yeeldeth matter to the baſeſt facultie
of the ſoule to maintaine and increaſe the body, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore
practiſe her proper operations and vertue: but
becauſe it hapneth too often, partly by the ill qualitie of
the nutriment, and partly for want of care in the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the part wherein the <hi>vegetatiue</hi> power lieth,
getteth ouermuch ſtrength, and allured by the delights
of the ſenſible part, giueth it ſelfe wholy to follow the
pleaſures of the ſenſes, the mind being oppreſſed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
performe the offices and functions pertaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
And for this cauſe <hi>Plato</hi> affirmed, that vnhealthfull
bodies make the minds weake. And the body can neuer
be ſound or healthfull, when it is giuen to follow that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
part of the ſoule, and the luſts and ſenſualities of the
ſame, whereby it forceth the mind preuailing againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Not but that the mind is neuertheles diuine, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the body being the neceſſary inſtrument of the
mind, when it is wreſted and drawne to an ill habit, the
mind cannot vſe it as it would, and the light of reaſon is
darkned &amp; hindred, not through any defect of the mind,
but onely in reſpect of the inſtrument that is become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious.
Euen as if a candle ſhould be put into a cloſe
veſſell, that the light thereof could not appeare: for the
not yeelding of light, ſhould not proceed from the defect
of the candle, but of the veſſell that incloſed the ſame.
To the end therefore that the child receiue not any vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
habit by the qualitie of his firſt food and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
wiſe men haue aduiſed, that the nurſe to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
for a child, ſhould not be baſe or of vile condition,
that the child might be the apter to be brought vp to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
that ſhe be not of ſtrange nation, leſt ſhe ſhould giue
it ſtrange or vnſeemely manners, vnfit or diſagreeable
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17081:30"/>
to the cuſtomes and conditions of the houſe or citie
wherein it is borne, and wherein it is to liue: and laſtly,
that ſhe be of good and commendable behauiour, to the
end that with the milk it may ſuck good conditions, and
an honeſt diſpoſition to vertuous life. And becauſe the
nurſe may be kept in houſe, or ſuffered to carry the child
to her owne dwelling place; of the two, it is to be wiſhed
that the parents ſhould rather keepe her in their owne
houſe, to the end that euen from his infancy it might
learne to know the father and mother, and the reſt of the
family, and take by little and little the faſhions and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the houſe. For the minds of children, whiles they
be yong, are like to the yong tender ſlips of trees, which
a man may bend and ſtraighten as he liſt; and are faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to ſuch cuſtomes and conditions as may beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeme
them. For looke what behauiour they firſt learne,
the ſame they retaine and keepe a long while after.
Wherefore <hi>Phocilides</hi> ſaid right well:
<q>
                  <l>Whiles yet in tender yeares the child doth grow,</l>
                  <l>Teach him betimes conditions generous.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Great is the care then that fathers ought to vſe in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the manners and diſpoſition of their children,
when they be yong and tender in their owne houſes,
and are yet in their nurſes laps. Hauing regard not to vſe
them either ouer-curſtly, or ouer-fondly: for as the firſt
ouer-aweth them, maketh them dull and baſe, and vile
minded, by taking away the generoſitie of their minds;
the other bringeth them to be wantons and waiward,
ſo as they will neuer be ſtill, but euer crying and wraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for they wote not what. For being yet but new in
the world, and not acquainted with thoſe things, the
images whereof are preſented to them by the ſenſes of
hearing and ſeeing; they eaſily giue themſelues to way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17081:31"/>
and crying, when they ſee any ſtrange ſight or
images, or heare a fearfull ſound or noiſe, the rather by
reaſon of the melancholy humor, which they bring with
them from the mothers womb, (reaſon hauing yet little
or no force in them, and their iudgments being too weak
to diſtinguiſh good from euill, or what is hurtfull, from
what may do them good:) not that naturally they be ſo,
for that tender age is rather ſanguine and aëriall; but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the remnant of that bloud, from which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
their nutriment in their mothers belly: vnto which
their crying, the vſuall remedy is the mouing them from
place to place, the rocking of them in their cradles, &amp; the
dandling of them; for ſuch motions do diuert them from
thoſe fearfull impreſſions, and make them the leſſe way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and comberſome, quieting the inward paſſions of
the mind. Beſides that, ſuch ſtirring of them, wakeneth
and kindleth in them that naturall heate which helpeth
the digeſtion of humors in them, and maketh them apt
to be well nouriſhed and ſtrengthened againſt thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
feares, which cauſe their waywardnes and crying.
Hereunto may be added the ſinging of their nurſes,
whereby they commonly ſtill them, vſing it, as taught by
nature onely: which ſome men thinke cometh to paſſe,
by reaſon that the ſoule is (as they ſay) compoſed of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and therefore is delighted with that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and naturall to it ſelfe. Others (haply of better iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
ſay, that children are ſtilled by the ſinging of their
nurſes, becauſe one contrary expelleth and driueth away
another, when it is the ſtronger: ſo as the nurſes ſinging
being lowder then the childs crying, therefore it preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.
But the moſt effectuall reaſon is, that the <hi>vegetatiue</hi>
power or facultie being of moſt force in that age, and it
taking pleaſure in things delightfull, and abhorring thoſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17081:31"/>
that are diſpleaſant and noiſome; when with crying it fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it ſelfe annoyed, it doth more willingly admit the
nurſes ſinging, and becometh calme and ſtill by hearing
the numbers and ſweetnes of the voice delighting them.
Thus then are children drawne from way wardnes to be
ſtil, from crying to mirth, and become thereby the more
liuely and fuller of ſpirit, and ſtirred vp to a better kind of
life; growing by little and little apt to vnderſtand, and to
ſpeake as nature may permit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In which time ſpecially,
great diligence is to be vſed, that they neither heare any
diſhoneſt or vnſeemely ſpeeches, vnfit for a generous
mind to conceiue, nor ſee any ſights that be ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
or vndecent to behold. For theſe two ſenſes, of all
the reſt, are of moſt importance in this life; for that the
images of things are repreſented to the mind by the eies,
and by the eares do the conceits and words enter into the
ſame. And of theſe two ſenſes, do the eares ſo much the
more helpe vs towards the learning of a ciuill life, as the
ſentences of wiſe men paſſe thereby into our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
And whereas the things which we learne by the
eyes, are but dumbe words: ſo do the eares heare the
liuely voices, by which we learne good diſciplines, &amp; the
true maner of well liuing. And therefore <hi>Xerxes</hi> ſaid, that
the mind had his dwelling in the eares, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with the hearing of good words, and grieued at
the hearing of vnſeemely. And the auncient wiſe men
conſidering the great profit which the eares yeelded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the attaining of knowledge, accounted them as
conſecrated to Prudence and to Wiſdom. In which
reſpect alſo, when they met their children, they kiſſed
them on the eare, as if they meant to make much of that
part chiefly, by which they hoped their children were to
learne wiſedome. And for this cauſe ought they that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17081:32"/>
haue the care of bringing vp children to be very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
neuer to pronounce any word before them, but
ſuch as are modeſt, and may tend to the inſtruction of a
good life. For though it ſeeme not, that yong children
marke ſuch things; yet what they heare and ſee, doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
enter into their tender minds, and there take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
rootes: which, when men think leaſt of any ſuch
matter, bringeth foorth fruite agreeable to the ſeed was
ſowne. And of ill ſeed, the fruite cannot but alſo be euill.
Let fathers then take great heed to the modeſty of ſpeech
and honeſt behauiour of all his family, and ſpecially of
the nurſes, in whoſe boſoms their children are euer held,
and in whoſe faces their eyes are alwayes fixed; becauſe
they note and obſerue moſt what they do or ſay, hauing
leſſe regard to others. And thus, vnderſtanding, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in the child with yeares, as ſoone as he is come to be
capable of any precept, before all other things it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
that care be had to make him conceiue a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that ſimple, pure and omnipotent nature, the
moſt high and euerliuing God, and that the ſame be ſo
imprinted in his heart, as he may learne God to be the
Creator of all things, the giuer of life, and maintainer
therof, the diſpoſer of all gifts &amp; graces, and the only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer
of al goodnes: ſo as he may be made to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
that he receiues al goodnes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his diuine Maieſty. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they that giue vnto him any thing, how ſmal ſoeuer
a trifle it be, or a toy, ſhall do well to offer it vnto him, as
a thing ſent vnto him, or made for him by God, by little
and little to acquaint his mind, and to faſhion it to the
knowledge of God, and of his diuine power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
For by this meanes ſhall there be a ſure and firme
foundation layd, whereupon a ſtrong and neuer-failing
frame of good manners and godly inſtructions may be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17081:32"/>
built: and without this foundation, all other care will be
ſpent but in vaine. For he that is void of religion, and of
that feare of God, which is in effect but a due reuerence
vnto his Maieſty, can neuer in all the whole courſe of his
life, do any thing worthy prayſe or commendation.
Whereas on the other ſide, he that hath this holy feare
fixed in his mind, will alwayes abſtaine from doing any
thing vnfitting or diſhoneſt, or that may offend God,
and bring him to his wrath and indignation. And if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
through the frailtie of our nature apt to offend, by
reaſon of the ſpot of ſinne, wherein we are conceiued,
throgh the diſobedience of our firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to fall ſomtime into any ſin, he is forthwith ſtrucken
with that ſame religious feare and reuerence, and being
aſhamed of himſelf, ſeeketh to make reconciliation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to the end he may not dwell in the wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
of Almighty God, from whom he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
as well his life and being, as whatſoeuer good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
he hath in this mortall life. To the attaining of this
religion, will the example of the father greatly further
the child, if to him he ſhew himſelfe ſuch, as he wiſheth
he ſhould become. For though the children of <hi>Socrates</hi>
(as it is written) proued not capable of good diſcipline,
though the father were a patterne or fountaine of honeſt
and vertuous life, yet are we to aſſure our ſelues, that the
example of the fathers life is the true and perfect mirror
for the child to faſhion himſelfe by, that he may attaine
a commendable courſe of life. For if the dumbe and ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
images of excellent men, which the auncient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
held in their houſes, were ſufficient to ſtirre vp in
young men, when they beheld them, a deſire to follow
their ſteps, and to reſemble thoſe noble perſonages of
their aunceſtors, whoſe reſemblances they beheld; ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17081:33"/>
themſelues not to degenerate from the vertues
and the nobilitie of their parents: how much more, may
we thinke, that it wil moue the child to ſee in his fathers
liuely face, and in his actions vertue imprinted, and daily
repreſented. I know right well, that ſometimes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is ſeene, through the inconſtancy of humane things:
but if we conſider what happeneth for the moſt part, we
ſhall find that good examples commonly are cauſes of
good, and bad examples cauſes of euill. Since the child
therfore is chiefly to learne of the father his forme of life,
it is the fathers part to be to him in his tender yeares a
liuely patterne of vertue, as we haue ſaid, wherby he may
(as it were) ingraft into his childs mind that good and
commendable kind of life, which may bring him by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
actions to honour and eſtimation. But becauſe it
cometh oftener to paſſe then were requiſite, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being buſied about other matters concerning the
order of his houſe and family, or elſe in the managing of
the affaires of the common-wealth, he cannot attend the
bringing vp of his child with that care that he ought, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
muſt he prouide for his education, ſo as the ſame be
not neglected. For as the true images of vertue are eaſily
imprinted in the minds of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiles they be tender:
ſo do they quickly weare out and vaniſh, if they be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed
and reuiued by the diſcretion and induſtry of
ſome meet perſon appointed for that purpoſe, and their
contraries as ſoone ingraued in their places. The father
therefore ought in any wife to make choiſe of ſome ſuch
man, to whom he may commit the charge and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his child, when he is paſt the age of three yeares,
as may be meet to giue him good example of life, and
ſeaſon him with ſuch doctrine, as he may not degenerate
or decline from that vertuous courſe of life which he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17081:33"/>
hath endeuored to put into the babes mind, euen whiles
he was yet in his nurſes armes, and vnder the charge of
women. For if in thoſe firſt dayes of infancy, when yet
he had almoſt no vnderſtanding, ſo great care was to be
taken (as we haue ſaid) to lay a good foundation, how
much more diligence is there now to be vſed, when he
beginneth to haue ſome knowledge and iudgement,
that the building may riſe anſwerable to the ſame. Wiſe
men haue wiſely ſaid, that nature is the beſt miſtris we
can haue: and the cuſtome of vertuous behauiour and
wholſome doctrine being taken in tender yeares, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
not onely into an habite, but euen into nature.
Wherefore let the father at thoſe yeares giue his child in
charge to ſome vertuous and godly man to be trained
and inſtructed, who muſt be neither too mild nor too
ſeuere; but ſuch, as may in ſome things agree with the
manner of the nurſes bringing vp, to the end he may
gently turne to other manners and behauiour then he
had learned when he was moſt among women. For to
take a child from the breſt, and from his nurſes boſome,
and to put him ſuddenly vnder the hard gouernment of
a curſt maſter, would be too violent a change, and force
that te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der nature ouermuch. But if he that ſhal then haue
the ruling of him, ſhall diſcreetly win him with mildnes
from being fond after the nurſe, and by little and little
draw him to a more firme kind of behauiour, in ſuch ſort
as he ſcarſe perceiue that he hath forſaken his nurſes
lap: the child wil quickly delight to be with him as much
as with his nurſe, yea or with his father or mother: and
pratling or childiſhly crauing, now one thing, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of him, there wil ſoone ſpring in his mind a deſire of
knowledge: which deſire, though indeed it be naturall &amp;
borne with vs, yet hath it need to be holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſtirred vp
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17081:34"/>
to come forth and put it ſelfe in action; for elſe will it lie
hidden and couered with the vnworthieſt part of the
ſoule, like to the fire which is couered with aſhes: which
though it haue naturally vertue to giue light and heate,
yet vnleſſe that impediment be taken away, it wil do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of both, nor be apt to worke his naturall effect. And
therefore (as before is ſaid) he which ſhall take the charge
of the child after the nurſe, muſt be very diſcreet to win
him to his diſcipline without bitternes or ſtripes, which
do rather dull and harden the childs mind, then worke
any good effect. And the ſeruile feare which the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſharpe
and vnaduiſed vſage or beating of the child brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
him vnto, (not fit for a generous mind) maketh
him to hate the thing he ſhould learne, before he can
come to know it, much leſſe to loue it. It is alſo a thing
very profitable for his better inſtructing, that there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of like yeares in his company to learne with him;
for ſo will there ariſe a certaine emulation among them,
through which, euery of them will ſtriue to ſtep before
his fellow: beſides that the conuerſation of ſuch as are
like in age and qualitie, wel bred and brought vp, is a very
fit occaſion to make them all wel mannered and of good
behauiour, thoſe yong yeares being (as before is ſayd)
apt for the ſimplicitie thereof, to take whatſoeuer forme
is giuen vnto them. And for this cauſe was <hi>Merides</hi>
King of the Aegyptians greatly commended among the
auncient wiſe men, for that as ſoone as his ſonne <hi>Siſoſtres</hi>
was borne, he cauſed all the children that were borne in
the citie that ſame day, to be gathered together, and
brought vp with his ſaid ſon, where they were inſtructed
in all thoſe diſciplines and noble arts, that in thoſe dayes
were in eſtimation, and meet to direct to a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
life. And that the manner of good education is to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17081:34"/>
proceed by degrees, it appeared by the order which the
Kings of Perſia held in the bringing vp of thoſe who
were to ſucceed them in their Empire. But becauſe our
diſcourſe tendeth not to the inſtructing of Princes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but onely of ſuch gentlemen of meaner qualitie as
may be fit inſtruments for the ſeruice of their common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
or country: it will be beſt to paſſe that ouer in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>Whiles in this place I was pawſing a while, as to take
ſome breath, Captaine <hi>Carleil</hi> ſayd in this ſort: I hope
your author giueth not ouer ſo this matter. For howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
his purpoſe was to diſcourſe of the ciuill life of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
men, yet the declaring of the order which was held
in the inſtructing and training vp of the children of thoſe
Princes, cannot but be as well profitable as delightfull.
Therefore let vs (I pray you) heare what is ſayd by him
touching the ſame.</p>
            <p>That ſhal I willingly do, ſaid I, for that the like requeſt
was made to him by one of that company; and thus he
proceedeth, ſaying, that though it might ſuffice to refer
them to what <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his <hi>Ciropaedia</hi> hath left written
of that ſubiect, hauing learnedly and diligently vnder the
perſon of <hi>Cirus,</hi> framed an <hi>idaea</hi> or perfect patterne of an
excellent Prince: yet he meaning to follow <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
in his treatiſe, will therefore report what he hath
gathered out of <hi>Plato</hi> to that purpoſe, and adde therunto
briefly as much out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> as may ſerue for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vnderſtanding of the reſt. You ſhall vnderſtand then
that the cuſtome among theſe kings, was to giue the child
who was to ſucceed in the kingdome, ſoone after he was
borne, into the hands of thoſe Eunuchs that were eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of beſt life in the court: whoſe care was chiefly to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
his body with all diligence, that it might be ſtraight
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17081:35"/>
and moſt comely of ſhape and proportion; becauſe the
firſt thing that is offred to the ſight in a King, is the grace
and comelineſſe of his perſon, which maketh him to be
reuerenced of his people, and beloued of his Peeres. His
infancy being paſt, he was giuen in charge to others, that
exerciſed him in handling his weapons, horſe-manſhip,
and feates of armes; and likewiſe in hunting, as a meet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
to frame him fit for military diſcipline. And this
the father did, becauſe he was perſwaded that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of warre was one of the ſureſt foundations for the
vpholding of a State or kingdome. When he was come
to the age of 14. yeares, then was he deliuered ouer to
foure other excellent perſonages, who were called the
royall ſchoole-maſters, the one moſt wiſe and prudent,
the other moſt iuſt, another moſt temperate, and the laſt
moſt valiant. The firſt inſtructed him to know and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God, and taught him the knowledge of things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
and eternall, and withall, ſuch as appertaine to the
life of a good Prince: by which he became learned, as
wel in things contemplatiue, as in things concerning the
actions neceſſary and conuenient for a King. For they
exerciſed him dayly in the vnderſtanding of ſciences,
and in the knowledge of good and vertuous behauiour,
as two moſt neceſſary things to humane life, and which
ſhould leade him the ready way to his felicitie and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in this world; making him to know, that nothing was
more miſerable in man then ignorance, and how by the
generall conſent of the moſt wiſe men, he that is ignorant
is eſteemed an ill man. To which purpoſe it is ſaid by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi>
that there is no greater euill can befall a man then to
be ignorant. And <hi>Plato</hi> (from whom the other drew his
ſentence) ſayth, that all ignorant perſons were in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
alſo miſerable. For Temperance being the rule
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17081:35"/>
and meaſure of Vertue, vpon which dependeth mans
felicitie; the opinion of this diuine Philoſopher was, that
he that was ignorant could not know temperance, and
conſequently muſt be to ſeeke in the way of vertue: the
defect whereof eſtrangeth a man from God, euen as the
hauing of this ſingular vertue of temperance (wherof we
ſhall ſpeake hereafter more at large) doth draw him neare
vnto his Maieſty, to his great comfort and ſatisfaction.
Ignorance therfore being a mortall infirmitie vnto mans
mind, and ſuch a one as ſuffereth him not to enioy his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie,
to which (as to the marke propoſed) he leuelleth
all his actions: it is written that they of <hi>Mitilene</hi> intending
ſeuerely to puniſh certaine of their confederates, who
being armed with them in the field, had forſaken them,
made a decree againſt them, that from thenceforth they
ſhould not ſet their children to ſchoole to learne arts or
ſciences. This firſt ſchoole-maſter teaching him thus, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and the feare of God; and training him in the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and behauiour appertaining to a King, did ſo long
hold him vnder his gouernance, till it appeared he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
well and perfectly that diſcipline. Then the ſecond
maſter taking him in charge, taught him that which in
conſequence next followeth to religion, that is, that there
is nothing more fitting for a King then truth and veritie;
that ſpeciall care was to be taken ſo to embrace the ſame,
as he ſhould neuer haue one thing in his mouth, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in his heart, as wicked and deceitful men haue, who
are borne for the deſtruction of vertue, and of honeſt and
wel-diſpoſed perſons: and that thoſe, who were to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
therewith, were not only deceiuers, but worthy the
name of traitors. In regard wherof (as <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> writes)
among the Indians, if any man bearing magiſtracy, were
detected of a lie, he was preſently depriued of his magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17081:36"/>
and diſabled for euer after to beare any. And this
did they, becauſe they conceiued (and that rightly) that
he which reſpected not truth in matters of moment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
as much, as in him lay, the ſocietie and ciuill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
of men, ſince no man can truſt or beware of a
lyer. Therfore (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth) <hi>Epenetus</hi> affirmed,
that all iniuries and wickednes proceeded from a lyer.
This ſchoole-maſter gaue him to vnderſtand, that as the
nature of God is pure and ſimple, neuer deceiuing vs,
whether we ſleepe or wake: ſo, ſeeing there was no dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
vnder God ſo great as the Kings, he ought firſt, and
aboue all things, to conforme himſelfe and his actions
vnto that high and eternall truth, the feare &amp; knowledge
of whom, had bin formerly taught him. And as it ſeemed
to them, that by truth he attained a reſemblance of God
himſelfe: ſo did they think that by lying, a man was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to looſe the title of a man. Which thing haply he
meant, who deuiſed <hi>Pan</hi> to be the ſon of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenter
of ſpeech, as Poets haue fained; ſignifying by the
ſhape of <hi>Pan,</hi> vnder which is comprehended as well the
falſe ſpeaker as the true; that the vpper part of his body
bearing humane ſhape, betokeneth truth (then the which
nothing is more proper to a man of vertue) but by the
lower parts being crooked, and of ſhape like a goate, falſe
and vntrue ſpeaking was ſignified: inferring that man by
ſpeaking vntruth, becometh monſtrous, and of a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
creature falleth to be a bruite beaſt: whence alſo
proceeded that among the Perſians, a lie was reputed a
moſt hainous offence. And we ſee that euen now among
vs, it is reputed ſo great a ſhame to be accounted a lyer,
that any other iniury is cancelled by giuing the lie; and
he that receiueth it, ſtandeth ſo charged in his honor and
reputation, that he cannot disburden himſelfe of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17081:36"/>
but by ſtriking of him that hath ſo giuen it, or
by chalenging him the combat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Norreis</hi> hearing thus much ſpoken of truth,
and of the lie, interrupting me, ſaid; God grant your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
follow this theame a while, that we ſoldiers may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
haue ſome inſtruction from him. For this matter of the
lie giuing and taking, is growne of late among vs to be
confuſed and dangerous, ſo as a man can hardly tell, how
to carry himſelfe in ſo many occaſions, and ſundry caſes,
as dayly happen in companies, wherein perhaps the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
and reaſons of ſuch a man may yeeld vs no ſmall
light.</p>
            <p>Your wiſh therin (quoth I) ſhal not be fruſtrate, for the
matter is by him handled at large: but let vs heare what be
the points that you would ſpecially be reſolued in; for it
is not vnlikely but that they will iump with the queſtion
propoſed by one of thoſe perſons ſuppoſed in his dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>
            <p>Marry ſir (ſaid he) I would gladly know, ſince he hath
ſpoken of truth and vntruth, and declared how the iniury
receiued by taking the lie, cannot be cancelled, but by
ſtriking or chalenging the partie who gaue it; whether
this kind of chalenging and fighting man to man, vnder
the name of <hi>Duellum,</hi> which is vſed now a dayes among
ſouldiers and men of honour, and by long cuſtome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized,
to diſcharge a man of an iniury receiued, or for
want of proofes in ſundry cauſes, be ancient or no? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it concerne honor or no? and whether it appertaine
to ciuill life, and that felicitie which we are diſcourſing
vpon or no?</p>
            <p>You haue (ſaid I) moued your queſtion very right, and
to the purpoſe; which to anſwer at full, would require a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
ſpeech: ſo deepe rootes like an ill weed, haue the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17081:37"/>
opinions of men taken concerning the ſame in this our
age; which to cut downe or roote vp, many ſithes and
howes would ſcarce ſuffice. But as briefly as may be, you
ſhall be ſatisfied in part; and he will make it appeare vnto
you, that the reaſons which are ſet downe in defence of
this fooliſh cuſtome and wicked act, are falſe and abſurd.
And firſt of all you ſhall heare him ſay, that this maner of
combatting, which through the corruption of the world
hath taken ſtrength, and is permitted of ſome Princes, is
nothing auncient at all. For in hiſtories it is not to be
found, that for reuenge of iniury, for want of proofes,
for points of honour, or for any ſuch like cauſes, this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and vnlawfull kinde of fight, was euer graunted
or allowed in auncient time. For when any difference or
controuerſie fell out among men of honor, which might
concerne their credit and reputation for matter of valor,
they neuer tried the quarrell by combat betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
but ſtroue to ſhew which of them was moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
honor, by making their valour well knowne in fight
againſt their common enemies, as in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
we haue a notable example. And the ſingular fights
or combats, that are mentioned in the Greeke or Latine
hiſtories, or fained by the Poets, happened euermore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
enemies of contrary nations, or otherwiſe in time
of publike warre, though perhaps the quarrell might be
priuat betweene ſome of the chiefe men of both camps,
as betweene <hi>Turnus</hi> and <hi>Aeneas, Paris</hi> and <hi>Menelaus. Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
labouring that <hi>Aeneas</hi> might not haue <hi>Lauinia</hi> to his
wife: and <hi>Menelaus</hi> ſeeking to recouer his wife whom
<hi>Paris</hi> had taken from him. Or elſe they fought for the
publike quarrell, one to one, or more in number on each
ſide, for preuenting of greater bloodſhed, as did the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratij</hi>
and the <hi>Curiatij</hi> before Rome. Or by the ordinance
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17081:37"/>
of ſome publike games, as thoſe called <hi>Pithij</hi> and <hi>Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pici</hi>
among the Greeks, and thoſe called <hi>Circenſes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Romanes, whether they were celebrated in
honour of their Gods, or at the funerals of their dead, or
for other cauſes. In which games or ſpectacles were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
certaine men, named by the Romanes <hi>Gladiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
and by the Greeks <hi>Monomachi,</hi> to fight together;
the firſt inuention wherof, appeareth to haue come from
the people of <hi>Mantinea.</hi> But other priuate combats for
cauſes aboue mentioned, was neuer ſo much as heard of
among them, much leſſe receiued or allowed in their
common-weales, which were well ordered and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by honeſt and vertuous lawes. The name of <hi>Duellum</hi>
was giuen by the Latins, not to ſingular fight betweene
man and man, but to the generall warre betweene two
nations or States, as may be ſeene by <hi>Plautus, Horace, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,</hi>
and other authors. And as for them that ſay, the
name of <hi>Duellum</hi> was vnproperly applied to an vniuerſal
warre, they are not to be heard or beleeued, becauſe they
that ſo vſed it, were the fathers of the Latine tongue, who
knew better the proprietie of the words of their owne
language, then theſe fellowes now do. But rather they
are to be blamed for wreſting that auncient name to ſo
wicked a fight, which they rightly gaue to the generall
warre allowed by the lawes, and by all ciuil and politike
conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>The Primate, who had bin attentiue to this ſpeech, ſaid,
as concerning the Latins, it is true that hath bin alledged:
but it ſeemeth, the Greeks knew very well this combat,
as may be gathered by the word <hi>Monomachia,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
the fight of one man againſt another. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>Plato</hi> in his dialogue intituled <hi>Laches,</hi> maketh
mention of this ſame ſingular fight, which ſheweth, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17081:38"/>
in his dayes the combat of body to body was knowne
and vſed.</p>
            <p>Two things (ſaid I) the author hath ſaid, the one, that
this ſort of battell or fight which is now in vſe, and called
<hi>Duellum,</hi> was not knowne to the ancient Greeks nor Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
in their wel-ordered Common-weales, and that
therefore they gaue no ſuch name vnto the ſame: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the Romanes gaue that name of <hi>Duellum</hi> to the
publike warre betweene two people or nations, being
enemies. But that the Greeks gaue not the name of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomachia</hi>
to thoſe ſingular fights which were vſed among
them, that hath he not ſaid. But though the name of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomachia</hi>
were vſed among them, yet was it not meant of
this kind of combat which we ſpeake, but of that onely
which was ſometimes vſed in their publike games and
ſpectacles, or elſe might fall out ſometimes accidentally
in their warres. And that ſame place of <hi>Plato</hi> which you
haue alledged, doth ſufficiently declare it. For if my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
faile me not, he ſaith there, that when the generall
battell ceaſeth, and that it is requiſite either to fight with
them that reſiſt, or to repulſe thoſe that would aſſault, in
ſuch a caſe the <hi>Monomachia,</hi> or fight of man to man was
meet to end all ſtrife. Which word of <hi>Monomachia,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles
I remember not to be vſed by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in any
place of all his works, from whom neuertheles theſe men
that defend this folly, ſeeme to fetch their arguments, as
hereafter I ſhall declare. But by this you may perceiue
that the vſe of <hi>Monomachia,</hi> was a fight betweene two
men in their publike games and ſhewes, not for priuate
quarrell or hatred, nor for want of proofes, or for points
of honour. And further I will ſay, that in well ordered
martiall diſcipline, and warres lawfully enterpriſed,
after the fury of the battell was ceaſed, it was not lawfull
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17081:38"/>
to kill or hurt the publike enemy. Which thing is cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet foorth by <hi>Xenophon</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Chriſantas,</hi>
who although he had caſt downe his enemy, and faſtned
hold in the haire of his head, ready to haue ſtricken it off;
yet hearing the trumpet ſound the retreit, forbare to
ſtrike him, but let him go: holding it not fit to offend his
enemy after the time of fight was paſt, ſignified by the
retreit ſounding. This ſort of fight was likewiſe ſuffered
againſt publike enemies by the Romanes when their
ſtate flouriſhed. For we reade in their hiſtories of ſundry
that haue in the warres fought hand to hand with their
enemies; but yet could not the Romane ſouldier, though
he were prouoked by his enemy to ſingular battell, fight
with him without the licence of his General or Captain.
And this was ſo religiouſly obſerued among them in
that Common-weale (which was the patterne of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
that the father ſpared not to condemne and ſlay
his owne ſonne, who had gotten a notable victory in his
abſence, becauſe he had without his fathers licence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to fight with the enemy. True it is, that for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of valor, we reade that <hi>Alexander</hi> granted a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
betweene <hi>Dioſippus</hi> and his aduerſary, both being his
ſouldiers and in his campe, though the one were a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian,
and the other an Athenian; which <hi>Dioſippus</hi>
vnarmed, hauing onely a clubbe for weapon, ouercame
the Macedonian armed with ſpeare and ſword, and other
armour on his body. But this was not for quarrell of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury
receiued, for reuenge or want of proofes. Neither
from this one example, is any concluſion to be drawne,
that for ſtrife of valour the combat ſhould be granted.
For the not admitting it afterwards in wel-ordered com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales,
nor by any other generall that we can reade,
aboue once, doth plainly ſhew that it was rather a toy of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17081:39"/>
               <hi>Alexanders</hi> head, then grounded vpon any reaſon: who
among ſo many vertues as he had, wanted not other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
motions, which ſtained his nobleſt and moſt
glorious actions, as that of the death of <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> and
ſome others. By this then you may vnderſtand that amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
the Greeks our maner of combat was vnknown, &amp; that it
was not that which they cal <hi>Monomachia.</hi> But this wicked
and deteſtable cuſtom of the combat ſprong firſt among
the Longobards, a barbarous people; &amp; much more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
is the thing it ſelfe growne, by the abuſe therof in
our daies. For though they in ſome caſes gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
yet ſuffered they not their champions to fight with
weapons of ſteele or iron, but only with ſtaues &amp; targets,
vnles it were in caſes of treaſon. But now vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
they come to fight with ſwords &amp; daggers, and other
like ſharp weapons, and with minds cruelly bent to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and miſchiefe like moſt wild and ſauage beaſts. And
thus much concerning the firſt queſtion may ſerue,
ſince time wil not permit to treate of euery one at large.</p>
            <p>Yea but, I think, ſaid captain <hi>Carleil,</hi> that if the combat
be lawfull in caſes of treaſon or iniury to the Prince, the
ſame reaſon ſhould make it lawfull alſo for other cauſes.</p>
            <p>Not ſo, ſaid I, for treaſons or offences againſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
perſons, offend the publike State, which repoſeth
vpon the perſon of the Prince, and therefore the iniuries
of priuate men are not to be compared vnto them. And
as touching the ſecond point, whether it concerne honor
or no: my author ſaith, that he that taketh ſo vniuſt a
courſe to reuenge his priuate wrong, is ſo farre from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
honor thereby, as he rather looſeth whatſoeuer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
or reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had before; the combat being a thing
odious and offenſiue vnto God. For it is ſaid, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth
reuenge vnto himſelfe; which, they that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17081:39"/>
ſeeke to wreake themſelues, take vpon them to do by
their owne power and ſtrength, againſt all lawes diuine,
naturall and poſitiue, in contempt of magiſtrates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the orders and conſtitutions of all wel-founded
Common-weales: and finally contrary to all equity, and
all ciuill and honeſt conuerſation. Howbeit I know there
want not ſome, who with their confuſed arguments go
about to make men beleeue, that ſo great an iniuſtice
ſhould be equitie: not knowing, or faining not to know,
that equitie is the tempering or mitigating the rigor of
the law, which otherwiſe (like a tyrant) condemneth
without mercy; being farre from fauouring the rigor of
ſo vnreaſonable and ſo ſharpe a conflict, then the which,
none can be imagined more furious or contrary to the
nature of man. Yet forſooth to equitie do theſe maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the combat ſeeke to draw this crueltie; arguing
that of two euils, it is the leſſer; and that the leſſer euill
is to be reputed in liew of a good, if not truly, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiuely.
Which argument is no way to be admitted,
ſince that (God be thanked) without this leſſer euill, ſo
many good Common-weales haue euer bin ruled, and
at this day are ruled with good and politike gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the ſame neuer permitted, but where men
forſake to follow reaſon, and like mad and deſperate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are tranſported by rage and fury. For what common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
either auncient or moderne, well framed vpon
honeſt and godly lawes, hath euer admitted this leſſer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill?
And yet, Iwis, in all places and in all ages haue iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
words and deeds paſt betweene men. Nay, the
ſame hath euermore bin forbidden vtterly, and the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and puniſhment of the wrong-doers bin reſerued to
the magiſtrates. Neither doth their allegation of being
included within the kind of warre generall, ſerue to their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17081:40"/>
purpoſe. For the combat is not contained vnder warre,
as the particular vnder the vniuerſall: for thoſe things
that are contained vnder any vniuerſall, are of the ſame
nature that the vniuerſal is: as we ſee man hath the nature
of the liuing creature, vnder which he is contained,euen
as is the bruite beaſt; but the combat is cleane contrary
of nature to the vniuerſall warre, as ſhall be declared. Firſt
great Lords and Princes who make warre, haue no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
ouer them to decide by iuſtice, and to end their
controuerſies, as priuate men haue. Beſides that, when
warre is moued againſt any Prince, the State and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale
is offended, publike orders are peruerted,
honeſty put in danger, the way layd open to all iniury to
the offence of Almightie God, and finally, whatſoeuer is
good or honeſt in citie or country, brought into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
And man being borne for the behoofe of his
country, his Prince, his kinred and friends, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of religion, publike honeſty and of vertue; it is the
dutie of euery man of vertue and honor, to oppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
againſt the fury of the enemy for the defence of all
thoſe things aboue ſpecified. Furthermore, the vniuerſal
warre is allowed by the lawes of all thoſe who haue bin
founders of famous Common-weales, to take away ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and reduce ſuch as were rebellious to obedience,
and to maintaine temperance and order among all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
And God himſelfe is called the God of hoaſts, but
not the God of combats: for they are none of his works,
but of the diuell himſelfe. Whereupon it is alſo ſayd in
the Scripture, that the ſtrength of warre conſiſteth not
in the multitude of ſouldiers, but that it commeth from
heauen. And S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, that warre is not vniuſt,
vnleſſe it be raiſed with purpoſe to vſurpe or to ſpoyle:
and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in like ſence affirmeth, that the valour of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17081:40"/>
thoſe men that defend their countrey from barbarous
people, is full of iuſtice. By all which may clearly be ſeene
how farre they are aſtray, that would bring this kind of
combat to be comprehended vnder the kind of warre v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall.
And if in all ages, ciuill warres haue bin odious
and accounted cruell, what praiſe or commendation can
be iuſtly giuen to two gentlemen of one citie or country
that fight together with purpoſe to kill one another?
whereas then the circumſtances aboue mentioned make
the vniuerſall warre iuſt and lawfull: this wicked kind of
priuate fight or combat, is voyde of them all, and cannot
therefore be but moſt vniuſt and vnlawfull. With like
wrong do they alſo labour to make it ſeeme commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
affirming that men thereby ſhew their valour and
fortitude. For valour or fortitude being a principall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
how can it haue place in ſo vniuſt and ſo vnnaturall
an action, proceeding onely from anger, rage, fury, and
raſhnes? Finally, theſe men that will needs haue <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
to be their warrant, might (if they liſt) ſee that he in his
Ethikes, where he directeth man vnto vertue, and to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
felicitie, putteth not among thoſe whom he calleth
<hi>fortes,</hi> or men of valour, ſuch men as are delighted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
but giueth them the title of warlike or <hi>bellicoſi.</hi>
And in the ſame bookes he ſayth, that whoſoeuer doth
any thing contrary to the lawes, is to be accounted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt.
And (I pray you) what can be more directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the lawes then this kind of combat or priuate
fight? And if by taking iuſtice from the world, all vertue
muſt needs decay, becauſe ſhe is the preſeruer and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of vertue; how can this ſo excellent a vertue of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
be in them, that deſpiſing the lawes and the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
and neglecting all religion, and good of their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
and weale publike, do practiſe this wicked combat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:17081:41"/>
Moreouer, they perceiue not, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Ethikes
(from whence the rules of ciuill life are to be drawne,
and not from his Rhetorikes, out of which theſe men
fetch their doutie arguments, becauſe elſewhere they can
find none for their purpoſe) ſaith, that to fight for cauſe
of honour, is no act of fortitude. Whereupon enſueth,
that ſuch as come to the combat vpon points of honour,
as men do now a dayes for the moſt part, make not any
ſhew of their fortitude, but onely of their ſtrength and
abilitie of body, and of their courage: whereas true for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
is to vſe theſe gifts well and honeſtly, according
to reaſon. And what honeſtie or reaſon can there be in
this ſo miſchieuous and wicked a fight? which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
theſe men ſo farre allow and commend, as they are
not aſhamed to ſay (moued ſurely by ſome diuelliſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)
that a man for cauſe of honour may arme himſelfe
againſt his country, the reſpect whereof is and euer was
ſo holy; yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt his father, and with curſed hands
violate his perſon, vnto whom (next after God) he muſt
acknowledge his life and being, and what elſe ſoeuer he
hath in this world. This cannot be but a moſt peſtiferous
opinion, and a ſpeech hardly to be beleeued could come
out of the diuels owne mouth of hell; who though he be
the author of all euill, yet ſcarce thinke I that he durſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo abhominable a conceit or ſentence. But it is a
world to ſee how ſolemnly men wil become ſtarke mad,
when they once vndertake to defend a mad cauſe. For to
make their frantike fancie to ſeeme reaſonable, they vtter
ſuch abſurdities as are not only deteſtable to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
bruite beaſts alſo abhorre. For among beaſts, many there
are, that by naturall inſtinct, not onely feare and reſpect
their begetters, but do alſo nouriſh them diligently when
they are waxen old, and not able to purchaſe foode for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17081:41"/>
themſelues, repaying thankfully the nouriture which
themſelues receiued whiles they were yong, as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
knowne the Storke doth. But here to colour their
aſſertions, they ſay, that ſo ought children to do to their
parents, and citizens to their country, ſo long as the one
ceaſeth not to be a father, and the country forgetteth not
her citizens: a ſaying no leſſe fooliſh then the other. For
when can that come to paſſe? what law of nature, or
what ciuill conſtitution hath taught vs this leſſon? or
out of what ſchoole of Philoſophie haue they learned it?
what iniuries can a father or a mans country do vnto him
that may make him not to acknowledge his countrey,
which ought to be deerer vnto him then his life, or to
caſt off the reuerence due to his father? Good God what
els is this but to inuite men, and as it were to ſtir them vp
to <hi>parricide,</hi> a thing odious euen to be mentioned. It is
no maruel therfore, if ſuch as attribute ſo much to points
of honor, &amp; wil needs defend the combat in that reſpect,
fall by Gods ſufferance (as men blinded of the light of
naturall reaſon) into ſuch abſurd opinions, fit for ſenſleſſe
men: which opinions, in very truth, are no leſſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
then wicked hereſies, and the authors of them
worthy ſharpe puniſhment to be inflicted vpon them
by ſuch as haue authoritie in that behalfe. And this do
they the rather deſerue, becauſe they ſeeke to maske and
diſguiſe the good and commendable opinions of the beſt
Philoſophers, and to wreſt them in fauour of their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and wicked doctrine. But I ſhould digreſſe too far
if I ſhould ſay all I could to confute this impietie, and
theſe wicked writings and cruell opinions: and therefore
returning to our purpoſe of honour, whereof we were
ſpeaking, you may vnderſtand by that which I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſayd, that honour there is none to be gotten by the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17081:42"/>
combat; yet becauſe among other things they ſay the
combat hath bin deuiſed for cauſe of honour, I muſt let
you know that in true and ſound Philoſophie, they that
reſpect honour as the end of their actions, are not onely
vnworthy to be accounted vertuous men, but deſerue
blame and reproch. But hereof I ſhall haue occaſion to
ſpeake more amply in a fitter place. Onely this I wil now
adde, that no actions are commendable but thoſe that are
honeſt, and where honeſtie is not, there can be no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
And honeſtie in truth there is none (as before hath
bin ſaid) in ſuch a fight contrary to all vertue, odious to
all lawes, to all good magiſtrates, and to God himſelfe;
though the folly of the fauourers of this diuelliſh deuice
ſeeke moſt wrongfully to draw the ſumme of all vertues
to this iniuſtice. Furthermore, either the offences done
to men, may be auouched before Princes and magiſtrates
in iudgement, as no wrongs, but lawfull acts, or not. If
they may be ſo auouched and proued, then a thouſand
combats cannot take them away: neither is there any
cauſe of combat if ſo wicked a cuſtome were allowable.
If not, then he that hath done the iniury, is already diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and diſhonored; and the victorie ouer ſuch a man,
in faith what honour can it purchaſe? <hi>Plato</hi> the diuine
Philoſopher, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> his diſciple after him, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the nature of iniury, and finding that it caried with
it alwayes vice and reproch, affirmed that it was better to
receiue an iniury then to do it. And <hi>Plato</hi> concludeth,
that he that doth iniury, cannot attaine to happineſſe:
both which ſayings are moſt agreeable to Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirmeth, that the magnanimous or
great minded man, vtterly deſpiſeth all iniuries, for that
an ill man cannot by any iniury he can do vnto him, ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
thoſe vertues wherewith he muſt be adorned to be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17081:42"/>
truly magnanimous. With theſe worthy men therefore
I conclude, that iniuries are to be contemned and light
ſet by, ſpecially of magnanimous men. For, as <hi>Seneca</hi>
ſaith, a magnanimous man will neuer thinke that a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man hath done him iniury, though his meaning
were to do it; but referre the puniſhment of his ill inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the magiſtrate, and the reuenge to God. And
whoſoeuer doth otherwiſe, entring into this reuengefull
humour of the combat, he doth not onely not purchaſe
any honor to himſelfe thereby, but heapeth on his owne
head Gods wrath and indignation, and ſhame of the
world in the iudgement of wiſe men, who know what
is honeſt, and what not, what things deſerue praiſe, and
what blame; and how, when, and wherefore a man of
vertue ought to venture his life. For he that thinketh by
the combat to right himſelfe, taketh vpon him the office
of God, and of the magiſtrate, as if himſelfe were ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to them both, and were able of himſelfe (as ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lord) to do iuſtice: which thing how dangerous
it is in a wel-ordered Common-weale, all lawes, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it ſelfe doth plainly teach vs.</p>
            <p>But yet theſe goodly defenders of this abuſe ſay, that
a man, both by order of nature, and by the opinion of
Philoſophers, may well repulſe an iniury by his owne
vertue, and not by law. And I ſay (as before) that if the
iniury be done vnto a man of magnanimitie; the way to
ſhake it off, is to deſpiſe it, becauſe the excellencie of his
vertue is greater then any iniury that can be done vnto
him: and if it be done to him that is not come to that
degree of vertue as to be magnanimous, he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
at the inſtant repulſe the ſame, or reuenge himſelf
in hot bloud without any great reproch. But to reſerue
a malice or hatred any long time, and therupon to come
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17081:43"/>
to the combat with a reuengefull mind, as bruite beaſts
do; will alwayes be eſteemed of wiſe men, a vicious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and contrary to all lawes and ciuill order. And they
that are of ſuch reuengefull minds, are termed by <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
bitter and ſharpe men, as if he would ſay without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
In which reſpect he iudgeth them to be (as hereafter
ſhal be ſhewed) men vnworthy of ciuil conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And
by him it is eſteemed the part or office of a vertuous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
man, and a point of magnanimitie to pardon and
forgiue offences and iniuries. For <hi>Plato</hi> and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were euer of opinion, that magnanimitie was giuen
to man, not becauſe he ſhould diſpoſe himſelfe to hatred,
fury, reuenge and wrath, but to honeſtie and vertue.
Wherefore <hi>Seneca</hi> alſo ſaid, that it was a kind of reuenge
to forgiue. And the temple of the <hi>Graces</hi> (according to
<hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion) was placed in the midſt of the citie
of <hi>Athens,</hi> becauſe all men might thereby vnderſtand,
that they were to render good for good, not ill for ill.
For as by the firſt, cities are the better preſerued and
maintained: ſo by the other, they are deſtroyed and
brought to ruine. Yet if the magnanimous man would
wiſh him chaſtiſed that hath offended him, he will not
vouchſafe himſelfe to file his hands vpon ſo baſe and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a perſon as thoſe be (by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
who are iniurious to others; but ſuffereth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
according to the order of law to reuenge his
cauſe by the puniſhment of the offender, according to
his deſert, to the end the vertue of the one, and the vice
of the other may be manifeſted, and the one chaſtiſed,
and the other honored thereby. And what more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reuenge can a man deſire, or what more notable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of his vertue, then to haue him corrected, and
reſt infamous by the puniſhment which law ſhall inflict
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17081:43"/>
vpon him who hath done him iniury? Or what elſe do
theſe furious minded men ſeeke in fine by their combat?
But yet they alledge further (as wiling to maintaine their
wrong opinions with ſome ſhew of reaſon) that combats
are ſought only in caſes of iniuries, not determinable by
law. Which anſwer is as inconſiderate as the reſt. For
what kind of iniuries can grow betweene man and man,
whereunto the authoritie of the Prince and of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
doth not extend? who indeed are not to regard
the obſtinacie of the parties, but to puniſh them by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
and ſuch other meanes as law doth allow
and permit; to bridle the inſolencie and diſobedience of
ſuch as will not obey and be ameinable. For if in ciuill
actions that courſe be held, wherefore ſhould not the
ſame rigor be the rather vſed in this ſo vnlawfull and
beaſtly a debate? Neither is there any reaſon in that they
ſpeake of publike and priuate iniuries, ſince the caſes are
farre vnlike. For publike iniuries come from lawfull ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
ſuch as offend or offer wrong to States or Cities:
but they that are priuatly iniuried in their perſon, cannot
call them their lawfull enemies that ſo haue done them
iniury: rather they themſelues are to be eſteemed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
enemies to their countrey, whiles in following their
rage and furious appetite of reuenge, they oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
againſt the publike and ciuill gouernement, and
deſerue in that reſpect to be ſeuerely puniſhed by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
as men that eſteeme more their priuate iniuſtice
then publike iuſtice. And thus much for the ſecond part
of your queſtion. Now touching the laſt point, whether
it appertaine to ciuill felicitie or no: you may eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by that which is already ſaid, that there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more contrary to good diſcipline in a wel-ordered
commonweale, then this wicked and vniuſt kind of fight,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17081:44"/>
which deſtroyeth, ſo farre foorth as it beareth ſway, all
ciuill ſocietie. For it breedeth the contempt of God and
his commandements, of Religion, of lawes, conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ciuill gouernement, of Princes, of magiſtrates,
and finally of countrey, parents, friends and kinred: to
all which men are bound by reaſon naturall and ciuill,
and for defence of them to ſpend their liues in maner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid:
but not at their owne appetite, inſtigated by
rage and furie to be prodigall thereof, or for reuenge of
priuate quarrels or iniuries. Will you ſee how abſurd
and ſenſleſſe a thing theſe men maintaine, that ſet vp
and magnifie this glorious combat? then take but this
one inſtance. They ſay, in good ſooth, that if two gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ſubiect to the ſelfe and ſame lawes, ſtirred by this
furious conceit, haue chalenged the one the other to the
combat, and that their ſoueraigne Lord or Prince forbid
them to proceed therein, that they are not to obey him,
but to ſeeke to accompliſh their chalenge elſewhere out
of his iuriſdiction. And can any reaſonable man, or a
good ſubiect endure to heare ſuch a propoſition main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without ſtomacke or diſpleaſure? That which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Painims and Gentiles was not lawful without
ſpeciall licence of the ſuperiours to be attempted againſt
a publike enemie, armed to the ruine of their State and
Common-weale: will theſe iolly politicians haue now
to be lawfull among Chriſtians in deſpite of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and lawfull Lords and Princes, vpon whom the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of well pollicied States is layd, and in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
towards whom, ciuill felicitie it ſelfe doth reſt?
But we neede not to maruell, if ſuch men contemne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
lawes and ordinances, when they ſticke not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
God himſelfe; vnto whom they knowing mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
this kind of fight to be odious and diſpleaſing;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17081:44"/>
yet are they not aſhamed by publike writings to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it, and thereby to draw ſouldiers and men of valour
into their errror of a wilfull madneſſe and miſchieuous
mind. It is a more mockery, and a thing worthy to be
laughed at, to ſee how buſily ſuch fellowes build vpon
a falſe foundation, as if their building were like to ſtand.
For leauing and forſaking the patterne and true rules of
vertuous behauiour, of policie and ſtates, and of good
lawes written by that excellent Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
they take hold (forſooth) of ſome fragments or parcels
of his Rhetorikes to worke vpon: as though from thence
men were to take the precepts of ciuill conuerſation or
politike gouernement, whence onely the rules and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of well ſpeaking are to be taken, and not of ciuill fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie.
Out of his Rhetorikes they haue culled out name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this place, where he ſaith, that God helpeth thoſe that
are wronged, not vnderſtanding, or ſeeming not to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in that place ſpeaketh of ciuill
iudgements or criminall; and not of battels or combats,
ſuch as this that he neuer knew, ne yet euer heard ſpoken
of: and if he had, would haue ſought to haue driuen it
out of the frantike fancie of all men. It is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
but that in good and godly iudgements managed
by men deſirous to maintaine iuſtice, God is alwayes
at hand to help and vphold the right, and to tread downe
and ouerthrow the wrong. For by him haue iudgements
bin appointed and ordained, and magiſtrates to rule and
ouerſee them, not only for the common benefit of men,
but alſo for the defence of truth and righteouſneſſe, and
for the puniſhment of vntruth and wickedneſſe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
it is to be vnderſtood, that onely ſuch places in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles</hi>
Rhetorikes are to be approoued and allowed in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
or politike life, as are by him confirmed in his Ethikes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17081:45"/>
and Rhetorikes: as that it is lawfull for a man to repulſe
an iniury, and to defend himſelfe, and ſuch other like.
For, as himſelfe affirmeth, the drift of his booke of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torikes,
is to inſtruct a man how to frame his ſpeech to
perſwàde, and how to moue the minds of Iudges to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
hatred, reuenge, compaſſion, and ſuch like other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
which oftentimes wreſt the truth, and make wrong
to preuaile. So as if the Orator preuaile, and attaine the
end he ſeeketh, which is to perſwade, or vſe the meanes
to attaine it artificially, he hath done his dutie. By which
it appeareth, that Rhetorike is ordained for iudgements
and controuerſies, but not for inſtruction of ciuill life
and manners. But let vs ſee what they get by this place
taken out of the Rhetorikes. For my part, I ſee not wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any man ſhould looke or hope for any helpe or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
at Gods hands in this ſo vniuſt, vnlawfull and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
an action, moſt offenſiue to his diuine Maieſtie, as
contrary to his expreſſe commandement, and a worke
moſt pleaſing and acceptable to the diuell, by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
the ſame is wholy ſet forward. Nay rather may
the preuailing of them that haue the wrong cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
as oftentimes we ſee it happen in the combat, ſerue
for a moſt cleere argument, that it falleth out by Gods
ſpeciall permiſſion to vnſeele the eyes (if it were poſſible)
of ſuch as are ſo wilfully blinded, to the end they might
ſee how vniuſt the conflict is, which theſe men ſay, was
firſt inuented (among other cauſes) that truth might be
knowne, and right from the wrong. But how is truth or
right found out, if he which hath right on his ſide be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome,
as oftentimes it falleth out? Forſooth they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that it ſo hapneth by reaſon of ſome other offences
of him that is ouercome, and that God will haue him ſo
puniſhed for the ſame. By which reaſon it ſhould follow
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17081:45"/>
that God (who is truth it ſelfe) ſuffereth in this fight
(which they ſay was deuiſed for trying out of the truth)
that in reſpect of puniſhing him for other offences that
maintaineth the truth, the other who hath the wrongfull
cauſe in hand, ſhould triumph in his vniuſt victory, and
truth ſhould be borne downe and defaced. Then which
reaſon, what can be imagined more contrary to the
goodnes, iuſtice, and power of God? as if he could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
puniſh ſinners, then by a meane that ſhould
ſpot and ouerthrow truth, in which he is ſo well pleaſed.
It is therfore a moſt euident ſigne &amp; certaine teſtimonie,
that this kind of proofe or trial of truth is moſt vncertain,
and the fight to that end vniuſt and wicked. And that it is
no other then the work of the very diuell, who being the
author of all diſcord, hatred, debate, falſhood, ſeditions,
vniuſt wars, of death, &amp; mortal enemy to truth, reioiceth
when he ſeeth right ouerwhelmed with wrong, reaſon
oppreſſed by iniuſtice, truth defaced by falſhood, and by
meanes thereof, men drawne to euerlaſting damnation.
And when it doth come to paſſe, that he which maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the right doth preuaile (if any right or reaſon may
be ſuppoſed in ſo wicked and vnlawfull an action) euen
that it ſelfe is to be imputed to the ſubtiltie of the diuell,
to draw men on as with a baite, becauſe he is loth to loſe
the great gaine of ſoules which he maketh by the humor
of this deteſtable combat. By which, not onely the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
themſelues, but they that hauing power, permit
them or grant them libertie to fight; all they that counſel
them therunto, &amp; all they that giue them the looking on
in ſo damnable an action, become ſubiect vnto him, and
enemies to God their Creator and Redeemer. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there is no vice or ſinne in the world, whereby he
winneth more to his kingdome, then by this; becauſe at
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17081:46"/>
once he purchaſeth thouſands of ſoules: ſo fooliſhly do
men flocke to be the beholders of a bloudie ſpectacle,
with inhumane deſire to ſee the ſpilling of mans blood.
But now to conclude this matter, it is a lamentable thing
that any Chriſtian Prince, or other generall commander,
ſhould permit ſo pernicious and ſo damnable a thing,
and conſent, that vnder their authoritie it ſhould be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for one man to kill another for priuate quarrell, and
they to ſit themſelues <hi>protribunali,</hi> to behold ſo vniuſt
and cruell a fight. For they ought rather to conſider, that
they are Gods miniſters, and by his diuine prouidence
called to ſo high and ſo eminent a place, not to fauour or
giue reputation to the diuels works (among which there
is none more wicked then this) but to execute his will,
to which the combat is directly and expreſly contrary,
though it haue bin accepted and allowed by ill vſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abuſe, and bene entituled by the name of a cuſtome
by ſuch as defend the ſame: who conſider not that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
is to be obſerued in good and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable things,
and not in wicked and vnlawfull, as this is. And if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that any abuſe do grow and ſhrowd it ſelfe vnder the
name of a cuſtome, the ſame ought to be taken away
and aboliſhed; and thereto do all Philoſophers agree.
Of which kind, this combat being manifeſtly one, it
ſhould be rooted out, and not ſuffered to continue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that name. For good cuſtomes are agreeable to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in which reſpect it is ſaid, that cuſtome is another
nature. But that which is contrary to nature (as this is)
ought not to be named a cuſtome, but a vile abuſe, be it
neuer ſo much cloked with the name of cuſtome: the
rule whereof is preſcribed by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his ſecond
booke of Politikes, and ſhould therefore not only not be
permitted or maintained, but being crept in, be remoued
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17081:46"/>
and baniſhed as a moſt peſtilent and dangerous thing.
And wheras <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Rhetorikes ſaith, that reuenge
is better then pardon, that is to be ruled according to the
ciuill orders and conſtitutions of good common-weales.
For he ſayth not ſo vniuerſally, but onely in reſpect of an
Orator, and (as is ſaid already) he in his Rhetorikes tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
but what is requiſite for an Orator to conſider, to
perſwade, and not what is meete in ciuill life, as he doth
in his Ethikes.</p>
            <p>And thus much this author hauing ſaid effectually to
the purpoſe of your demaund, I may, if you pleaſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the former matter, from which this queſtion hath
occaſioned him and vs to digreſſe.</p>
            <p>All the companie agreed thereunto, and hauing well
allowed of the diſcourſe, framed themſelues attentiuely
to heare the reſt.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſaid, You remember well (I doubt not)
that the next was to ſpeake of the third maſter of the
Kings ſon; who after the good inſtructions giuen by
the former two to their diſciple, taught him that his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
was in all things to be ſubject to reaſon, and that
he ought neuer to ſuffer himſelfe to be drawne from
that which was honeſt by any inticement: for that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie
was the end and ſcope of all vertue. He ſought
to perſwade him, that the chiefeſt thing that maketh
a King to be knowne for a King, was to know how to
rule himſelfe before he ruled others, and to maſter his
owne appetites rather then other mens. So the firſt
hauing faſhioned him to Religion, and the ſecond to
truth, this third framed him to be temperate and iuſt.
Whereby it came to paſſe, that although he know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be aboue the law, yet did he not onely not ſeeke
to ouer-rule the law, but became a law to himſelfe:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17081:47"/>
ſo as he was neuer led, either by loue or hatred, in his
iudgements (whether he puniſhed or rewarded, nor by
anger, or deſire to benefite any man) from that which
was iuſt and honeſt. Thus holding vnder reaſons awe
the diſordinate appetites of his mind, with the direct rule
of iuſtice, (vnder which, <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, all vertues are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
becauſe it is grounded vpon truth) he alwayes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
his actions to the marke of honeſtie, euer doing
good, but neuer harming any. And knowing, that who ſo
is ſubject to his owne appetites, deſerueth not the title of
a free man, much leſſe of a King: he framed himſelfe to
be moſt continent, and ſhewed in himſelf an example of
honeſt life and behauior to all his ſubjects. His benignitie
he declared to them by his liberalitie, and by ſhewing
more care of the publike good then of his owne; and that
he would rather giue of his owne, then take from them
their goods. With his mildneſſe and affabilitie he made
himſelfe ſingularly beloued, and wan their hearts, and
with gentleneſſe in word and deed, and with loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his people, &amp; truth in al his actions, he made them
vnderſtand that indeed he approched as neare to God in
theſe excellent qualities, as a mortall man could do. By
meanes whereof, no man fearing harme from him, he
was beloued and reuerenced as a God among them.
Now hauing learned of his three firſt maſters, Religion,
Prudence and Wiſedome, Truth, Iuſtice and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
with thoſe other vertues belonging vnto them;
the fourth then taught him all that appertained to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and made him vnderſtand, that onely he is to be
eſteemed a man of fortitude and valour., who can hold
a meane betweene furie and feare. And that when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of perill and danger is offred vnto him, bearing with
it honeſtie, and wherein he might make ſhew of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17081:47"/>
and courage, did readily embrace and take hold of
the ſame. And that albeit he were deare to himſelfe, in
reſpect of thoſe vertues which he knew himſelfe to be
poſſeſſed of; yet eſteeming more an honeſt and a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
death then a naturall and reprochfull life, he would
make no difficultie to hazard his life for the benefite of
his countrey, knowing that an honorable end would be
crowned with immortall fame. And foraſmuch as it is
ſeldome ſeene, that men can vſe this princely vertue as it
ought to be vſed, and when it ſhould be vſed, with ſuch
other circumſtances as are requiſite thereto; therefore
did his maſter inſtruct him and make him vnderſtand,
that he which matcheth not his naturall courage with
Prudence, and thoſe other vertues, which the former ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
had taught him, could not rightly be called a valiant
man. And how that this vertue, being ſtirred vp by mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie,
ſtoutly purſued honeſt things without reſpect
of difficulties: and that though things formidable and
terrible be naturally ſhunned of men, yet the valiant man
deſpiſeth them, and feeleth them not in reſpect of iuſtice
and honeſtie, whereby ſuch men became equall to the
Gods, as Poets fained. And that if Prudence and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
were not ioyned with this royall vertue of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
the ſame was turned into fooliſh hardineſſe. And
becauſe his diſciple ſhould know how to auoid this vice,
he declared to him how ſuch men as, to auoyde infamie,
onely exerciſed their valour, and expoſed their liues to
perill, or onely to purchaſe honour, were not to be called
properly valorous men; but they onely who for hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
ſake made triall of their valour, becauſe honeſtie is
the onely end of vertue, by which humane felicitie is to
be atchieued. And that he likewiſe was not to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
valiant, who for feare of paine or puniſhment, tooke
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17081:48"/>
in hand fearefull and dangerous enterpriſes, nor yet they
that through long experience in warfare, or becauſe they
haue bin often in the brunt and danger of battels, went
cheerfully or couragiouſly into the warres to fight, as it
were by cuſtome, for that they did it rather by art and
practiſe then by free election, without the which can be
no vertue. Neither he that by rage and furie ſuffered
himſelfe to be tranſported to attempt any danger; ſince
there can be no vertue, where reaſon guideth not the
mind. And for this cauſe wilde beaſts (though they be
terrible and fierce by nature) cannot be termed valiant,
becauſe they being ſtirred onely by naturall fierceneſſe,
wanting reaſon, do but follow their inſtinct, as do the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Tygers, Beares, and ſuch other like. Neuertheles he
denied not but that anger might acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany fortitude; for
that it is rather a help vnto it, then any let or impediment,
ſo long as reaſon did temper them, and that it ſerued but
for a ſpurre to pricke men forward in the defence of iuſt
and honeſt cauſes. Moreouer he declared vnto his ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
that there is a kind of fortitude that hath no need of
any ſuch ſpurre of anger: which kind concerned the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of grieuous and diſpleaſing accidents, and the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
of a mans ſelfe in happie and proſperous ſucceſſes.
And this is that bleſſed vertue which neuer ſuffereth a
man to fall from the height of his minde, being called by
ſome men patience: who will not onely haue her to be
a vertue ſeparate from the foure principall vertues, but
alſo that ſhe ſhould be aboue them. But this opinion of
theirs is not well grounded, ſince in truth ſhe is but a
branch of fortitude: through which (as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſayth) men
beare ſtoutly all iniuries, whether they proceed from
wicked perſons, or from the inconſtancie and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe
of fortune; but remaineth alwayes inuincible
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17081:48"/>
and conſtant againſt all the croſſes, thwarts and deſpites
of fortune. This vertue is fitly deſcribed by <hi>Cicero,</hi> where
he ſaith, that it is a voluntary and conſtant bearing of
things grieuous and difficult, for honeſties ſake. And in
the Scriptures it is ſaid, that it is better for a man to beare
with inuincible courage ſuch things, then to be otherwiſe
valiant, or to hazard himſelf, how, where, &amp; when it is fit.
For who ſo beareth ſtoutly aduerſities, deſerueth greater
commendation and praiſe then they which ouercome
their enemies, or by force win cities or countries, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
defend their owne, becauſe he ouercometh him
ſelfe, and maſtereth his owne affects and paſſions. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
reſpect to theſe things, this wiſe ſchoole-maſter ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
his diſciple, that the valiant man was like a ſquare ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
body, as is the die, whereunto <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo agreeth,
which in what ſort ſoeuer it be throwne, euer ſtandeth
vpright: ſo he being ſtill the ſame man, which way ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the world frame with him, or the malice and enuie
of wicked men, or the freakes of fortune toſſe him; which
fortune, ſome call the Queene of worldly accidents,
though, as a blind cauſe, ſhe alwayes accompanieth her
ſelfe with ignorance. Moreouer he added that hope of
gaine or profit ought not to moue a man to put his life
in apparant danger: for if it chanced (as often it doth)
that the hope began to quaile, forthwith courage failed
withall, and the enterpriſe was abandoned, becauſe vaine
conceiued hope, and not free choice of vertue had gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him. A thing which neuer happeneth to them that
in honeſt cauſes hazard their liues. For though any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
terror chance vnto them, ſo as on the ſudden
they cannot deliberate what were beſt to do: yet euen
by habite which they haue made in the vertue of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
they looſe not their courage; but the more difficult
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17081:49"/>
and fearefull the accident appeareth, the more ſtoutly
will they reſiſt and oppoſe themſelues againſt the ſame.
Likewiſe he declared to him, that it was not true forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
when men (not knowing what the danger was
which they entred into) did vndertake any perillous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe:
for it muſt be iudgement, and not ignorance,
that ſhall ſtirre men to valorous attempts. Neither yet
that they were to be eſteemed properly valiant, who like
wilde ſauage beaſts, moued by rage and fury, ſought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
and to hurt them that had prouoked them to
wrath: for ſuch were tranſported by paſſion, and not gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by reaſon. Laſt of all he concluded that he was iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be accounted a man of valour, who feared not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thing that was perillous, yet of ſome things would be
afraid. So as true fortitude ſhould be a conuenient mean
betweene raſhneſſe and fearefulneſſe: the effect whereof
was to be ready and hardie to vndertake dangerous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in ſuch time, place, and maner as befitted a man of
vertue; and for ſuch cauſes as reaſon commanded him ſo
to do: and becauſe the doing thereof was honeſt and
commendable, and the contrary was diſhoneſt and
ſhamefull. All theſe points did this worthy ſchoolmaſter
ſeeke to imprint in the yong Princes mind, that he might
become ſtout and haughtie of courage, to the end that
he (who was borne to rule and commaund) might not
through any ſudden or vnlooked for accidents be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with feare, or become baſe and cowardly minded:
nor yet by ouermuch raſhneſſe or furie waxe fierce and
cruell; but with mild, yet awfull behauiour, gouerne and
commaund the people ſubject vnto him. Theſe were the
ſeeds of vertue, which theſe wiſe and worthy maſters
did caſt into the tender mindes of thoſe yong Princes,
from whence (as out of a fertile ſoile) they hoped to reape
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17081:49"/>
in their riper yeares fruite anſwerable to their labour and
trauell. And this is all (ſaid I) that this author hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
vpon this matter, and as much (I ſuppoſe) as is
needfull for the education of children, till they come to
yeares of more perfection, wherein they may begin to
guide themſelues.</p>
            <p>And then ſir <hi>Robert Dillon</hi> (who as well as the reſt
had giuen a very attentine eare to the whole diſcourſe)
ſayd: Truly theſe were right good and worthy docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and meete to traine a Prince vp vertuouſly; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could any other then a glorious iſſue be expected of
ſo vertuous principles and education. And though this
diligence and care were fitting for ſo high an eſtate as the
ſon of a mightie monarke, yet hath the declaration therof
bin both pleaſing and profitable to this companie, and
may well ſerue for a patterne to be followed by priuate
gentlemen, though not with like circumſtances; ſince
the ſame vertues ſerue as well for the one as for the other
to guide them the way to that ciuill felicitie, whereof our
firſt occaſion of this dayes diſcourſe began. But euening
now haſting on, and the time ſummoning vs to draw
homeward, we will for this preſent take our leaues of
you; hauing firſt giuen you harty thanks for our friendly
entertainment, eſpecially for this part thereof, whereby
with your commendable trauell in tranſlating ſo good
and ſo neceſſary a worke, you haue yeelded vs no ſmall
delight, but much more profite; which I am bold to ſay
as well for all the companie as for my ſelfe: whereunto
they all accorded.</p>
            <p>But, ſaid the Lord Primate, we muſt not forget one
point of your ſpeech, which was, that you tied vs to
a condition of three dayes aſſembly; that as the author
had deuided his work into three dialogues, ſo we ſhould
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17081:50"/>

of his dialogues. Suppoſing therefore that you haue fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
his firſt, we will to morrow (if this company pleaſe
to giue their conſent thereunto) be here to vnderſtand
whether he haue as ſufficiently ſet downe rules for the
faſhioning a yong man to the courſe of vertue, as he hath
done for the education of his childhood. Therefore
you may looke for vs, &amp; prepare your tongue, as we will
bring attentiueneſſe to heare his doctrine by your ſtudy
made ready for our vnderſtanding. And ſo they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all together towards the citie.</p>

         <div n="2" type="day">
            <head>The ſecond dayes meeting, and diſcourſe
of Ciuill life.</head>
            <p>WHen the next morning was come, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
faire and cleare, the companie (which
the day before had bin with me) came walking
to my houſe, all, ſaue onely M. <hi>Smith</hi> the Apothecary,
whoſe buſineſſe being of another ſort, was not ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to ſpend his time in hearing diſcourſes of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which brought no profit to his ſhop. And being
entred into the houſe, they found me ready to go walke
abroade to take the ſweete and pleaſant ayre: wherefore
though they had already had a good walke from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
thither, being ſomewhat more then a mile; yet were
they not vnwilling to beare me companie, and would
needs go with me. So I led them vp the hill to the little
mount, which ſtandeth aboue my houſe, along a pleaſant
greene way, which I had planted on both ſides with
yong aſhes: from whence hauing the proſpect not onely
of the citie, but alſo of the ſea and hauen, we there ſate vs
downe, and ſome commending the ayre, ſome the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulneſſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17081:50"/>
of the view, we ſpent the time in ſundry
ſpeeches, vntil one of the ſeruants came to ſummon vs to
walk home to dinner. Whereupon returning home, and
finding the meate on the table, we ſate vs downe; I telling
them that they found a Philoſophers dinner, for ſo I
would now begin to take vpon me to entitle my ſelfe,
ſince they had made me (at the leſt) the trucheman or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of one that was worthy that name. And that I
had the rather prepared no greater ſtore of meate for
them, becauſe I would imitate the temperance of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
as we were in number a conuenient companie
for a Philoſophicall dinner.</p>
            <p>Why, ſaid the Lord Primate, what meane you by
that? is there any determinate companie appointed for
ſuch meales as are fit for Philoſophers?</p>
            <p>Yea ſir, quoth I, if my memory faile me not, I haue
read that to ſuch refections as might as wel feed the mind
as the body, there would not be any ſuch great company
of gueſts inuited, as by the confuſion of their talke and
communication, the ſerious and yet delightful diſcourſes
that might be propoſed, ſhould not be imparted to all,
nor yet ſo few, as for want of matter the ſame were to
be omitted. Therfore it was determined that the number
ſhould be betweene the Graces and the Muſes, that is to
ſay, not vnder three, nor aboue nine. We are therefore
a fit companie for a Philoſophicall dinner., and your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
ſhall be according for your cheere.</p>
            <p>Wel, ſaid ſir <hi>Robert Dillo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> you ſhal need no ſhifts with vs,
for as we wil not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend your cheere (which is the thing
is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly begged by the excuſing of want of meate) ſo
ſhal you not need to take any care, either for the ſatisfying
of our appetites with dainty fare, or to entertaine vs with
Philoſophicall diſcourſes at dinner: for we expect ſuch a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17081:51"/>
at your hands after dinner in that kind, as we ſhall the
better paſſe ouer our dinner without them, which we
deſire in that reſpect may be the ſhorter, to the end that
our bodies being fed temperatly, our mindes may be the
ſharper ſet to fall to thoſe other dainties which you haue
prepared for vs.</p>
            <p>Yea but let not our dinner I pray you (ſaid Captaine
<hi>Dawtrey)</hi> be ſo temperate for ſir <hi>Robert Dillons</hi> words,
but that we may haue a cup of wine: for the Scripture
telleth vs that wine gladdeth the heart of man. And if
my memory faile me not, I haue read, that the great ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
of the Sages of Greece, deſcribed by <hi>Plutarke,</hi> was
not without wine; &amp; then I hope a Philoſophical dinner
may be furniſhed with wine: otherwiſe, I will tell you
plainly, I had rather be at a camping dinner then at yours,
howſoeuer your rerebanket will haply be as pleaſing to
me as to the reſt of the company</p>
            <p>Whereat the reſt laughing pleaſantly, I called for ſome
wine for Captaine <hi>Dawtrey;</hi> who taking the glaſſe in his
hand, held it vp a while betwixt him and the window, as
to conſider the colour: and then putting it to his noſe,
he ſeemed to take comfort in the odour of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Lord Primate, I thinke (Captain <hi>Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey)</hi>
that you meane to make a ſpeculation vpon that cup
of wine, you go ſo orderly to worke, as if you were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
him vpon his qualities; whereof two principall
you haue already reſolued your ſelfe of, by the teſtimony
of your two principall ſenſes. The colour, we all deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
with you is good, the ſmell ſeemeth not to miſlike
you: it is conſequent therefore that when you haue
drunke it vp, you will alſo reſolue vs whether all three the
qualities concurring together, it may deſerue the title of
<hi>vinum Cos</hi> or no: for ſuch was the wine wont to be enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17081:51"/>
among the ancient Romanes, that caried the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to be the beſt.</p>
            <p>And what (I pray you, ſaid I) might be the cauſe that
their beſt wine was ſo called? for I haue heard that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
ſundry times demaunded, but I could neuer heare
it yet anſwered ſufficiently to my ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>It is no maruell (ſayd the Lord Primate) for although
the matter haue bin long in controuerſie, and debated by
many ful learned men, and among them ſome that loued
wine ſo well, as their experience might make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that their verdit ſhold be very ſound; yet for ought
I find, we may ſay <hi>adhuc ſub iudice lis eſt.</hi> Some ſay it
ſhould be taken for <hi>vinum Coſſentinum,</hi> as coming from
a territory ſo named, which commonly bare the beſt
wines neare about Rome. Others interprete it by letters,
ſaying that <hi>Cos</hi> is to be taken for <hi>corpori omnino ſaluberri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi>
But they that preſume moſt to haue hit the marke,
ſay that it is ſo to be vnderſtood, that <hi>Cos</hi> ſhould ſignifie
the wine to be beſt by theſe three qualities, which Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Dawtrey</hi> ſeemeth to inſiſt vpon, that is to ſay, <hi>colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
odoris,</hi> and <hi>ſaporis;</hi> which three reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending a wine,
it cannot but be called very good. And this is as much
as I haue read or heard, and will be content to be of the
Iurie with Captaine <hi>Dawtrey</hi> to giue my verdit whether
this of yours be ſuch or no.</p>
            <p>In good faith (ſaid Captaine <hi>Dawtrey)</hi> if I be the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the Iurie, as I haue bin the firſt to taſte the wine,
I will pronounce it to be indeed ſingular good, and well
deſeruing the title of <hi>Cos:</hi> for all three thoſe qualities
which you haue ſayd wine is to be commended for.</p>
            <p>If the wine be good (ſaid I) you may be ſure I am right
glad, as well becauſe I haue it to content ſuch my good
friends, as becauſe I haue made my prouiſion for my ſelf
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17081:52"/>
ſo well; whereby I hope you will all thinke me worthy
to be a taſter for the Queenes aduantage, and my office
to be well beſtowed vpon me, ſince I can taſte a cuppe of
wine ſo well; for it is indeed of mine owne choice.</p>
            <p>Marry ſir (ſaid M. <hi>Dormer,</hi> who had euen then finiſhed
his draught) me thinkes it fareth not with you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the common prouerbe, which ſaith, that none
goeth worſe ſhod then the ſhoomakers wife: for in good
ſooth this is a cup of wine fit to recommend your taſte,
and conſequently your ſelfe to be employed in your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
But ſince you asked my Lord Primate the meaning
of <hi>vinum Cos:</hi> and withall ſaid that you neuer heard that
queſtion anſwered to your contentment; let vs (I pray
you) heare what is your conceit therein, and whether
you can giue any more probable ſence thereof then
thoſe which he hath told vs.</p>
            <p>Nay in good faith, ſaid I, that wil I not preſume to do;
for I am not ſo affected to mine owne conceits, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
them before other mens. A better interpretation
I will not therefore offer vnto you: but if you will needs
haue me tell you how I, among others, conceiue of that
<hi>vinum Cos:</hi> which is read of, I thinke that it was ſo called
for that the cuſtome being in thoſe dayes, that whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Romane Conſul came, when he went in his ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
towards his gouernment, or els within his prouince,
they of the good townes or cities preſented him with
ſuch dainties as the place affoorded, and ſpecially with
the choiſeſt wines that were there to be had, thereupon
the beſt and moſt excellent wine was termed <hi>vinum
Conſulare,</hi> to wit, ſuch as of choiſe was taken for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
himſelfe. And the common abbreuiation of Conſul
being written in all auncient authors with theſe three let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>Cos:</hi> ſo commeth <hi>vinum Cos:</hi> to be vnderſtood (as
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17081:52"/>
I haue ſaid) for <hi>vinum Conſulare,</hi> which was the beſt.
And this is my opinion, which if it be worthy to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to go in companie with the reſt, I will not deſire
it ſhould go before them: and if you will be pleaſed to
accept of this my interpretation of <hi>vinum Cos:</hi> together
with the wine which you ſay is ſo good, and let the ſame
ſupply the badneſſe of your fare, (wherein my wife hath
the greateſt fault) I ſhal go the more cheerfully to the reſt
of my taske, which I am comforted by your ſpeeches,
you are ſo well diſpoſed vnto, as it maketh you haſten to
make an end of your bad dinner. Fruite therefore being
brought, and the table taken vp, ſir <hi>Robert Dillon</hi> ſaid; It
is an approoued opinion of all antiquitie, that after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
a man ſhould ſit a while, and after ſupper walk a mile:
we muſt not therefore ſo ſuddenly riſe from dinner to
go to our rerebanket; yet may we gather vp ſome of the
crums of yeſterdayes feaſt, how full ſoeuer our bellies be
with the good meate we haue eaten here. I remember
then that the ſubſtance of a childs education, that was to
be ſet in the right way to his ciuill felicitie, was yeſterday
declared by the example of the order held by the Kings
of Perſia, in the training of their ſons, which were to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
them in their kingdome. Which order, though it
were both pleaſing and profitable to be vnderſtood, and
that with change of circumſtances it might well ſerue for
the direction of a priuate gentleman how to bring vp his
child: yet I for my part thinke that it would haue bin very
good that there had bin ſet downe a courſe more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
in what learning or ſtudy of the liberal arts the child
ſhould haue bin exerciſed. For I haue found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the care and diligence of parents may aduance
very much the forwardneſſe of their children, ſo as ſome
being well plied, ſhall not onely reade perfectly, but be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17081:53"/>
alſo well forward in his Grammer, when the other of like
wit and capacitie ſhall for lacke of plying drag and come
very farre behind.</p>
            <p>That is (ſaid I) moſt true, and I can verifie it in my ſelf;
for ſuch was my fathers care (who not onely in the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his children, but alſo in the ordering of his
houſhold, was ſecond to no man of his degree that euer
I knew) as before I was full fiue yeares of age, I had gone
through mine Accidence, &amp; was ſent to ſchoole to Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
20 miles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> London, and if either the aire of the
place, or ſome other diſpoſition of my body had not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
my health by a quartaine ague that tooke me there, I
might haue bin a forward ſcholer in my gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer at 6 yeres
old, and haue bin ready to haue accompanied my lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with thoſe corporall exerciſes which by ſome are ſet
downe as fit to be vſed by children betweene the yeares
of fiue and ten, as well to harden their bodies and to
make them apt for the wars (if their diſpoſition be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto)
as for health. But by that vnhappie accident, not
onely the health and ſtrength of my body, but my lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
alſo met with a ſhrewd checke, which I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſithens recouer ſufficiently. Neuertheleſſe as much
as my father could performe, he omitted not to haue me
trained both to my booke and to other exerciſes agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his calling &amp; abilitie, following (as I ſuppoſe) ſuch
precepts as he had found ſet downe by ſome worthy au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
treating of that matter. The exact forme of which
education perhaps is hard to be obſerued, but by ſuch as
haue together with a fatherly and vigilant care, wealth
and meanes anſwerable to finde in their owne houſes
ſchoole-maſters to inſtruct and faſhion their children ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thoſe rules and precepts. For by them, before
the child attaine the age of 14. yeares, he ſhould not only
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17081:53"/>
haue learned his Grammer, but alſo Logike, Rhetorike,
Muſike, Poetrie, drawing and perſpectiue, and be skilfull
at his weapons, nimble to runne, to leape and to wreſtle,
as exerciſes neceſſary vpon all occaſions where fortitude
is to be employed for the defence of his countrey and
Prince, his friends, and of his faith and religion. And this
is that which I conceiue your meaning was, when you
ſaid, that you thought it had bin needfull there had bin
ſome more particular courſe ſet downe for the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the childs time in his learning. All which <hi>Piccolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi>
hath ſo exactly ſet downe in his learned booke of
Morall inſtitution, written firſt in the Italian tongue, as
it may ſeeme he rather propoſed or ſet foorth a perfect
child, as <hi>Cicero</hi> hath a perfect Orator, and <hi>Caſtiglione</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Courtier, then that it were eaſie to bring vp or traine
any in that ſort or according to that patterne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſince that which our author hath ſayd of the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kings children of Perſia, ſeemeth enough if it
be fitly applied for the inſtruction of any children during
their childhood, we may (if you pleaſe) now proceede
to his ſecond dialogue, treating of the inſtruction of a
yong man from his childhood forward: for I haue made
ready my papers, ſo as I hope without much interruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I may in Engliſh deliuer vnto you his mind, ſet downe in
his owne language, though not with like ſmoothneſſe
of ſtyle. But ſince yeſterday I heard you find no fault,
I may the better be encouraged to go on this day
with my plaine manner of penning, though it be vnpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
            <p>Yea marry, anſwered ſir <hi>Robert Dillon,</hi> very willingly:
and all the company aſſenting thereunto, I aroſe, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them not to ſtirre, for that I would preſently returne
vnto them with my bookes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:17081:54"/>
Which being done, and euery man lending an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
eare, thus I began: As yeſterday the infancy or child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of man was reſembled vnto that part of the ſoule
which giueth life, and is called <hi>vegetatiue,</hi> being the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the other parts: ſo muſt youth now be likened
to that part which giueth ſenſe and feeling, and is named
<hi>ſenſitiue.</hi> And as it is harder to rule two horſes to guide
a coach or charret then one: ſo is there farre greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie
in guiding a yong man then a child: for he is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
much more with paſſions then the ſimple age of a
child, and is more violently caried away with things that
delight him; becauſe he hath now the ſecond power of
the ſoule in force to draw him, which for the moſt part
is much more contrary to reaſon then the firſt. For
wheras that firſt coueted only that which was profitable,
and which might nouriſh the bodie without any great
regard of that which was honeſt, as whereof it had no
knowledge at all; this other being wholy bent to delight,
reſpecteth little any other thing: which delight hauing
greateſt force in yong mindes, draweth them ſundry
wayes, and by allurements maketh them ſo much the
more greedy to attaine the things they take pleaſure in, as
the ſpurres wherewith they be pricked are more ſharpe
and poignant. This appeareth by their actions moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly.
For hunting egerly after pleaſure, they are neuer
quiet vntill they compaſſe their deſires: and albeit that
their deſires be vehement in euery thing they fancie, yet
do they moſt of all diſcouer themſelues in the luſts of the
fleſh, which in them are firie, by reaſon of the abundance
of blood and naturall heate that is in them, increaſing
thoſe their diſordinate deſires beyond meaſure, yea they
grow infinite in them, and variable, as themſelues are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
miſliking this day that, which yeſterday they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17081:54"/>
which proceedeth onely becauſe their ſaid deſires
are not forged in that part of the mind where reaſon hath
her firme ſeate, and proper dwelling. To this imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of luſt, is alſo added the violent motion of anger, to which
they are ſubiect, and thereby ſoone drawne from the
courſe of reaſon and iuſtice. By this paſſion are they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
to enter in to debate and quarrels vpon euery light
occaſion, and as people deſirous of honour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as ſoone as they thinke they receiue any iniury, they
feare no perill nor danger of their liues, but boldly and
raſhly vndertake to fight, led by a deſire of reuenge, and
hope to haue the victorie ouer their enemies. Of money
or goods they make ſmal reckoning, through lacke of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
becauſe of their youth, and want of prudence,
which groweth from experience: and therefore little
know they, how neceſſary the goods of fortune are to
humane life, and into what inconueniences they fall
that are without them. So as they ſpend and conſume
without diſcretion, not regarding the time to come, but
ſuppoſing the world will alwayes be at one ſtay. They be
eaſily deceiued, not knowing the ſaying of <hi>Epicarmus,</hi>
that not to beleeue raſhly was the ſinewes of wiſedome,
And becauſe they conſider not how variable are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
of this world and humane affaires, they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
full of good hope, ſeldome fearing that any thing
may befall them other then wel: which hope layeth open
the way to ſuch as lie in waite to intrap them and deceiue
them. They ſeeme likewiſe to haue a touch of magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
by reaſon of the heate of their youth, which ſtirreth
them vp to vndertake great matters, but yet inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly,
as folke moued rather by nature then by election:
and ſo are they inclined rather to attempt things ſeeming
honorable, then things profitable. They loue their frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17081:55"/>
much more feruently then any other age, becauſe they
delight more in company, and meaſure not friendſhip
by profit or by honeſtie, but onely by their delight, as
they find them conformable to their appetites. They flie
eaſily into that which is in all things vicious, that is, too
much; which too much, is harmeful euen in iuſtice it ſelf:
whereupon is growne (I thinke) our Engliſh prouerbe,
that too much of a mans mothers bleſſing is not good:
not conſidering the precept of <hi>Chilo,</hi> who with three
words taught the ſumme and effect of all vertue, <hi>Ne quid
nimis.</hi> Whereby we may vnderſtand, that vertue conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
in the meane betweene two extremes, which on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide are too much or too little, wherein yong men
do moſt incline to that extreme of too much: for they
loue too much, they hate too much, they hope too much,
they feare too much, they truſt too much, they ſpend too
much, they beleeue too much, they preſume too much:
and by preſuming too much, they build more then they
ought to do vpon the vncertaine and variable chances of
fortune, without ſetting before their eyes thoſe good
courſes by which men through vertuous and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
acts do attaine a happie life. And this is the cauſe
why they giue ſo deafe an eare to friendly admonitions,
and to wiſe &amp; graue aduice &amp; counſel. For they, not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
their owne ignorance, thinke they know all things,
ſuch is the quickneſſe and vehemencie of ſpirit which
raigneth in them, and giueth them a certaine ſhadow of
nobilitie of courage, by which they preſume they are
able to do all things of themſelues well and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
but they find themſelues farre deceiued when they
come to the triall. They do oftentimes iniury to others,
rather vnaduiſedly then maliciouſly of purpoſe to harme
or offend. And hauing generally a good opinion of all
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17081:55"/>
men, ſimply meaſuring others words by their owne hart:
they are ſoone moued to compaſſion and pittie. They
delight exceedingly (as voide of care) to laugh, to ſport,
and to be merrie: and with quips and biting ſpeeches to
taunt their fellowes, and ſuch as conuerſe with them:
and heare more willingly pleaſant conceits and merrie
tales, then graue ſayings or auncient admonitions of wiſe
and learned men.</p>
            <p>In faith (ſaid Captaine <hi>Norreis)</hi> you haue painted or
deſcribed a yong man in ſo ſtrange a figure, as to me it
ſeemeth, I ſee a monſter before mine eyes, with moe
heads then the auncient Poets ſaid that <hi>Hydra</hi> had, the
ſame that gaue <hi>Hercules</hi> ſo much to do to ouercome her:
and it is to be maruelled, that all yong men are not ſoone
weary of that age, which bringeth with it ſuch varietie of
imperfections, and all contrary to reaſon and vertue. You
make vs almoſt to conceiue an opinion, that there can be
no Art nor prudence ſufficient to deliuer vs from ſuch a
multitude of errors that enuiron vs on euery ſide.</p>
            <p>If there were cauſe of complaint that youth ſhould be
thus deſcribed, ſaid I, yet am not I the man you ſhould
complaine of, but rather of mine author, or of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
who long before deſcribed the ſame eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he hath done:
and of <hi>Horace</hi> in like ſort, who taking the matter out of
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> concluded it in ſubſtance much like, though in
fewer words, ſaying:
<q>
                  <l>The yong man on whoſe face no beard yet ſhewes,</l>
                  <l>When firſt he creepeth out of others charge,</l>
                  <l>Delights to haue both horſe and hound at will,</l>
                  <l>With them to hunt, and beate the woods and fields,</l>
                  <l>Like waxe to vice is eaſie to be wrought,</l>
                  <l>And ſowre to them that tell him of his fault:</l>
                  <l>Too late he learnes his profit for to know,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:17081:56"/>
And in expence, aye too too lauiſh ſtill,</l>
                  <l>His heart is high, and full of hote deſires,</l>
                  <l>And ſoone he loathes that earſt he loued deare.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And truly the nature of a young man is very perillous,
and vnapt of it ſelfe to be ruled and directed to any good
courſe; partly becauſe of the ignorance accompanying
that age, and partly for that following the vanities and
delights which the worſer part of the ſoule or mind doth
ſet before him, he reſpecteth not that which is honeſt and
vertuous, as a thing he neuer knew or taſted. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being intent onely to pleaſures and delights, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth
not any thing but what is preſent before him.
For wanting (as is ſaid) experience, meete to foreſee acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
to come, he beleeueth much more them that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
him &amp; flatter him, by praiſing all he doth, then thoſe
men that reproue or check him for doing ill, or ſhew him
the way to vertue, by telling him the truth. Neither is
there any thing that more ſetteth a yong man aſtray from
the courſe of vertue, then flattery: and ſpecially are yong
Princes to take heede thereof, about whom are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
flatterers to winne their fauor, and by harming them
with that ſubtil engin, to purchaſe to themſelues as much
gaine &amp; profit as they can. Theſe, who (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith)
bend all their wits to euill, with continuall lying and ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
make yong men beleeue that they are excellent in
all things aboue courſe of nature; whereunto they
(ſimple) giuing a readier eare then they ſhould, become
ſo blind and fooliſh, that they diſcerne not their owne
good: but pricked forward with thoſe falſe praiſes, apply
themſelues to that onely which is pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and become a prey vnto their flatterers, who like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites
affirme all that they heare their maſter ſay, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
whatſoeuer he denieth. In which reſpect <hi>Diogenes</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:17081:56"/>
did right well ſay, that flatterers were worſe then crowes,
who feed but on the carcaſſes of the dead, but theſe iolly
companions deuoure the mindes of men aliue, making
them become (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) fooliſh or mad. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſe
conceit <hi>Epicarmus</hi> varied not much, who ſaid, that crows
pick out the eyes but of dead carcaſſes, but flatterers pick
out the eyes of the mind, whiles men are yet aliue. And
to ſay truly, this curſed generation, with their leaſings
and ſoothing, induce ſuch as harken to them and beleeue
them, to be their own foes, and to barre themſelues from
the attaining of true glory, whiles they make them glory
in the falſe praiſes of wicked flatterers. Who to the end
they may be the better beleeued when they flatter, vſe all
art poſſible to ſhew themſelues affectioned (though
counterfetly) to them, in whoſe harts they ſeeke to poure
their poiſon. For they kill in them all ſeeds of vertue, and
they take from them the knowledge of themſelues, and
of all truth: to which, flattery is a moſt peſtilent and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
enemie. And happy might indeed Princes thinke
themſelues, if they had about them men that would
frankly and reſolutely reſiſt the attempts of flatterers,
ſuch as was <hi>Anaxarcus Eudemonicus</hi> about <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great. This <hi>Anaxarcus</hi> miſliking that <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der</hi> throgh the
flattery &amp; falſe praiſes of ſuch as magnified his acts, grew
ſo prowd, as he wold needs be eſteemed a God, &amp; ſeeing
on a time his Phyſition to bring him a potion to eaſe the
griefe of his diſeaſe when he was ſicke, ſaid, <hi>Is it not a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
caſe, that the health of our God ſhould conſiſt in a draught
of licour and drugs compoſed by a man?</hi> Words full wel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming
the ſincere mind of a free harted man. As on the
other ſide it was vile adulation which <hi>Demades</hi> the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
vſed, who being at an aſſembly of Councell, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a decree, by which he would haue had <hi>Alexander</hi> to
be reputed for the thirteenth of the great Gods. But the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17081:57"/>
people perceiuing his flattering purpoſe and ſmall reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to diuine things, condemned him in a fine of an
hundred talents. If Princes, and ſuch as manage States,
would follow this example, and haue an eye to ſuch fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
there would not be ſuch ſtore of Sycophants as
now a dayes there are; and the vertues and merites of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
men, worthy honour and fauour, would be better
knowne and regarded then they are; and rewards and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences
would be giuen to ſuch men, and not to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
who ſeeke to put them beſides themſelues. This
I ſay of ſuch as ſuffer themſelues to be ſeduced by theſe
charmers, but not of wiſe Princes, who giue no more
eare to their inchantments, then doth the ſerpent to the
charmer; becauſe they know that their praiſes and ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
are but ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gling morſels ſmeared ouer with hony.
<hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon, the father of <hi>Alexander,</hi> had a flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
in his Court, called <hi>Ciſofus</hi> (or as ſome ſay <hi>Cleophus)</hi>
who did not onely affirme and deny all that <hi>Philip</hi> ſayd
or denied, but alſo on a time when <hi>Philip</hi> had a ſore eye,
and ware ſome band or ſcarfe before it, he in like manner
came before the King with the like: and another time
when <hi>Philip</hi> hauing hurt one of his legs, limped vpon it,
and had clothes wrapped about it, the flatterer came like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with his leg ſo wrapped and halting into the Court;
ſeeking thus not only by his words as other Paraſites do,
but alſo with his geſtures and whole body to transforme
the King, and put him beſide himſelfe. But although <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
tooke delight in this skim of men, yet could they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
draw him by their charming to incurre thoſe vices
which his ſonne ranne into: who albeit he was of a moſt
noble nature and mind, yet did he ſo much attribute to
theſe bad companions, and was ſo caried away with their
flattering praiſes, that he could not endure the truth that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17081:57"/>
               <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> told him, but miſerably ſlue him, ſpotting
with ſo cruell and barbarous a fact, all that euer he did
before or after, were it neuer ſo noble and worthy of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
But contrariwiſe, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> did ſo deſpiſe and hate all
flatterers, that he wold neuer giue any man leaue to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his vertues, but onely ſuch as had authoritie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
his vices. Whereas <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo diſtraught
&amp; rauiſhed with the delight of ſuch flatterers, that he not
onely ſuffered himſelfe to be perſwaded by them that he
was the ſonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but became alſo ſo fooliſh as to
endure ſacrifices to be made vnto him, and to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
like a God. From which folly he could neuer be
brought, vntill ſuch time as he was grieuouſly wounded
in an incounter with an arrow. Out of which his wound
<hi>Depoſippus</hi> the Athenian wraſtler ſeeing the blood to run
aboundantly, ſaid, to taxe <hi>Alexanders</hi> vaine glory; Why
then, do the Gods immortal bleed as we mortal men do?
which his words <hi>Alexander</hi> hearing, and feeling the pain
and ſmart of his wound, he perceiued himſelf to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
and no God; opening thereby in ſuch ſort the eyes
of his mind, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Anaxander</hi> the Philoſopher (though
vnworthy that name becauſe he was a flatterer) ſtanding
once by <hi>Alexander</hi> when it thundred, asked him, whether
it were he that had cauſed that thunder-cracke, as the ſon
of <hi>Iupiter?</hi> No, ſaid he, mildly reiecting his flattery, I will
cauſe no ſuch terror vnto men. And another time when
a medicine which he had taken troubled him grieuouſly
in the working, and <hi>Niceſias</hi> had ſaid vnto him, What
ſhall we mortall men do, if ye Gods endure ſuch paine
and agonie? he looking angrily vpon him, anſwered,
What Gods? I feare me rather that the Gods do hate vs.
This noble King likewiſe, after ſickneſſe and hurts had
made him know himſelfe, did a worthy and noble act
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17081:58"/>
towards <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> the Hiſtoriographer. For this <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi>
hauing written a booke of the deeds of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
and being with him in boate vpon the riuer <hi>Hidaſpe</hi> in
<hi>India,</hi> he beſought leaue that he might reade his booke
vnto him: which when he had obtained, and that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
perceiued, by the vntrue reports made in his praiſe
beyond all meaſure, that he was a flatterer, and no Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer:
deſpiſing his ſhameleſſe flattery, he tooke the
booke out of his hands, in a rage throwing it into the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and fiercely turning to him, ſaid, Thou wretch, thou
haſt thy ſelfe deſerued to be throwne after thy booke,
ſince thou haſt not bin aſhamed to ſet downe to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of poſteritie the reports of my acts in ſuch a falſe
and flattering manner. By this, which we haue ſayd,
may eaſily be gathered, that they, who once giue eare to
flattery, cannot diſcerne the harme and deceit of flatterers
towards them, vntill ſome bitter ſtorme or croſſe of fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
fortune befall them, to open their eyes, and to giue
them to vnderſtand how they haue bin deceiued by ſuch
lying companions, and harmed more then by their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
enemies. Which thing this wicked generation well
conſidering, leſt Princes ſhould perceiue their flatterie,
they neuer ceaſe, as ſoone as they haue gotten truſt and
credit by their lies, to vſe all meanes and deuices poſſible,
to put into their diſgrace and hatred all ſuch as they think
may be like to diſcouer their ſubtilties, and to make
knowne the harme which they procure. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of inuenting falſe and colourable cauſes, they labor
to remoue them from being about the Prince, that they
may the better turne topſie-turuie all at their pleaſure. By
this meanes they ſo blind the eyes of thoſe poore Princes
whom they poſſeſſe, that whiles they are in proſperitie
they not onely loue them and hold them deare, but alſo
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17081:58"/>
beſtow vpon them offices, lands, and great Lordſhips.
As by <hi>Philip</hi> before named it appeared, who made <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideus</hi>
the flatterer, Lord of his countrey, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he were a man of little worth and wiſedome. And
that <hi>Philip</hi> who was the laſt King of Macedon ouercome
by the Romanes, had a flatterer in his Court, whoſe name
was <hi>Proclides:</hi> who albeit he were a ſtranger (to wit, a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine)
and a very vaine fellow, yet crept he ſo farre into
the ſaid Kings fauour, that he was able to breede great
broyles and troubles in the kingdome. Theſe and ſuch
like inconueniences would not happen, if the ignorance
of yong men (not diſcerning themſelues) did not open
the way to flattery, and leade her as it were by the hand
into the preſence of Princes, inducing them to delight in
her. Hereof I haue ſpoken the more, becauſe, the number
of flatterers being infinite, and very many thoſe that by
them are blinded and ſeduced to eſteeme them and raiſe
them into reputation, all yong gentlemen, and Princes
ſpecially might be forewarned of the harme they may do
vnto them, if before they offer their poiſon of lies and
ſoothing praiſes, they be not armed to repulſe their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes,
and aduertiſed of their ſnares. Which thing the
Theſſalians conſidering, when they had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a citie called
Melia, they razed it, only becauſe it bare the name of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
in the Greeke language, ſo much did they hate and
abhorre euen the name of ſo abhominable a vice. And
where ſome Princes haply think themſelues wiſe inough
to take heed of ſuch caterpillers, and therefore care not
to rid their Courts of them: let them aſſure themſelues
that therein they do like men that will feede on hurtfull
meates, and preſume they ſhal not offend their ſtomacks.
For theſe gallants can ſo cunningly watch and eſpie their
times to worke their feate, that in the end they caſt out
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17081:59"/>
their poiſon, and infect their minds with ſome fawning
deuice or other before they be aware: ſo as there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes to auoid this miſchiefe, but onely to keepe it
farre off, and not to ſuffer it to approch. True it is neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
that if Princes (hauing flatterers about them)
would looke well into themſelues, and learne the precept
of <hi>Noſce teipſum</hi> (which onely precept is of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as without it no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be happie) they might reape
profit by their flattery: not by delighting in it, but by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it as a rule or a ſquare to examine their mindes and
their actions by. For when they ſhall find themſelues
praiſed and magnified by any flatterer, they wil endeuor
themſelues to garniſh their minds with thoſe vertues, for
which they were by him commended and extolled, and
were not before in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; to the end they might afterwards
be truly and deſeruingly praiſed for the ſame by men of
vertue and honeſtie, whoſe propertie is to exalt and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
the actions of worthy and famous men, and not
to lie and flatter, to purchaſe fauour to themſelues, and
to draw ruine vpon the heads of thoſe that they ſhal haue
put beſides their wit, as flatterers do. <hi>Diogenes</hi> was ſo
great an enemy to flattery, that he choſe rather to liue in
his tub, then in the courts of mightie Princes, who offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him fauour and entertainment, diſdaining to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of things gotten by ſo vile a vice. Contrariwiſe
<hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> though he were one of the diſciples of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
did ſo degenerate from the doctrine and behauior of
his maſter, that he became a paraſite to <hi>Dionyſius</hi> tyrant of
Sicile, eſteeming more the profit he got that way, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
reputation he might haue won by the profeſſion of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie:
and grew in the end to be of ſo baſe a mind,
that although the Tyrant did ſpit in his face, yet would
he not be angry; but being rebuked for enduring ſo vile
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17081:59"/>
a diſgrace, he laughing at them that rebuked him, ſayd:
If fiſher-men to take a ſmall fiſh can be content to go to
ſea, and to be waſhed all ouer with the waues; ſhall not I
endure that the King with a little ſpittle wet me, to the
end I may catch a Whale? This ſame <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> ſeeing
<hi>Diogenes</hi> on a day to waſh a few herbes which he had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
for his ſupper, he ſaid to him: Go to ſirra, if you
would frame your ſelfe to follow the humor of Princes,
you ſhould not need to feed vpon herbes. Neither thou
(ſaid <hi>Diogenes)</hi> if thou kneweſt thy ſelfe to be (I will not
ſay) a Philoſopher, but a man, thou wouldſt not be (as
thou art) the dog of <hi>Dionyſius.</hi> For dogs for their meate
fawne vpon their maſters; and ſo did this Philoſopher
ſhew how baſe and vile a thing it is to be a flatterer.
Which, by this digreſſion, my author hath in like ſort
laboured to make apparant by reaſons and examples. But
now returning to his former matter, becauſe he hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhewed the harme that comes by flattery, and how
it increaſeth vice in yong mens minds, then inſtructed
them which way to roote it out, you ſhall heare how he
goeth about to pull vp the ill weeds that choke the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
good ſeeds in their minds, that by the increaſe of the
good, they may haue ſufficient ſtore to furniſh them in
the way of their felicitie. It is already declared what bad
qualities and conditions the two worſer powers of the
ſoule ſtirre vp in yong mens minds, for that they be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and vehement, and apt to oppoſe themſelues againſt
reaſon, and to reſiſt her. And how reaſon in yong folkes is
ſcarce felt or perceiued, ſuch is the force of the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
faculties, which draw them to luſtfull appetites and
diſordinate paſſions. The cauſe whereof, <hi>Heraclitus</hi> aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
to the humiditie, wherwith theſe two ages abound:
for it ſeemed to him that drineſſe was the cauſe of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17081:60"/>
and therefore ſayd, that the wiſeſt mind was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but a drie light. To which opinion <hi>Galen</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
thought the ſtarres to be moſt wiſe becauſe they be
moſt drie. But leauing them with their opinions, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
the cauſe onely to the worſer powers or faculties
of the ſoule, let vs follow our two firſt choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> guides, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
&amp; <hi>Plato.</hi> They ſay then, that the ſoule which giueth
ſenſe or feeling, and containeth in it the other that giueth
life, is not yet ſo rebellious againſt reaſon, but that ſhe
maybe ſubdued, and brought to be obedient. So as you
muſt not think, but that youth, though it be incombred
with thoſe paſſions and deſires before mentioned, may
neuertheleſſe be directed to that good courſe which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
man to his moſt perfect end in this life, and for
which all vertues are put in action. For aboue or ouer
theſe two powers or faculties, is placed a third, like a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
or Queene to commaund if ſhe be not hindred in the
execution of her charge. And if theſe two vnruly and
wild powers, which are the ſpring and fountaine head of
all diſordinate affections, be once wel tamed and broken,
they do no leſſe obey her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, then the wel
taught horſes obey the coach-man. For we are all drawne
as it were by two vnbridled colts in this life, by theſe two
baſer powers of the ſoule. Wherof the one ſheweth it ſelf
in moſt vigour and ſtrength in childhood, and the other
in youth. Concerning the firſt of which, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his
maſter do diſagree. But when they both are ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſtrong, they become the more vnruly, vnleſſe
the former (as was ſaid yeſterday) be well tamed and
made meeke by good inſtruction and diligent care of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.
For if childhood be faſhioned according to
the good precepts of the learned; that firſt power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
humble &amp; obedient to be coupled with the other,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17081:60"/>
and thereby is there the leſſe labor requiſite for him that
ſhall haue the guiding of them both in youth. But in
youth deſcribed euen now, as you haue heard, in whom
both theſe faculties are rude and vndiſciplined, the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are altogether incited and ruled by the naturall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
For though nature (if ſhe be not hindred) bring forth
her effects perfectly in reſpect of their ſubſtances; yet are
they often vnperfect in regard of the accidents. And for
this cauſe is Art and induſtry needful to induce vertuous
habits, to ſupply that wherin nature accidentally may be
defectiue. Whereby it cometh to paſſe, that although the
vertues and faculties of the ſoule haue all that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can giue vnto them; yet haue they need of mans wit
and diſcipline to bring forth laudable and perfect opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And this is done by that part of Philoſophie which
is called Morall, becauſe from it we do draw the forme
of good manners, which being actually brought into the
mind of a yong man, as well as by the doctrine and wiſe
inſtruction of others: and ſo by long cuſtome, conuerted
into an habite, do breake and make ſupple thoſe parts
which by nature are rebellious to reaſon. And of ſo great
importance is the well training vp of childhood, euen
from the firſt, that it may be aſſuredly beleeued, that the
youth ſucceeding ſuch a childhood as was yeſterday pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
muſt needs be ciuill and well diſpoſed: and on
the contrary ſide, that the life of ſuch youths will be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and diſordered, as hauing bin ill brought vp in their
childhood, do enter into ſo hopeleſſe a courſe, as may be
likely to be the foundation of all vice and wickedneſſe
during the whole life to come. And hopeleſſe may they
be thought indeed, who by ill doing beginne euen from
their tender yeares to induce an ill habit into their minds:
for from age to age after it increaſeth and taketh roote
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17081:61"/>
in ſuch ſort, as it is almoſt impoſſible to be rooted out
or taken away. Neither can there be any greater euil wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
to any man, then that he be ill-habituated, which
thing by <hi>Aelianus</hi> report, the Cretans were wont to wiſh
to their enemies whom they hated moſt extremely, and
not without cauſe. For he that is fallen into an ill habite,
is no leſſe blind to vertuous actions, then he that wanteth
his ſight to things viſible. And as the one is euer plunged
in perpetual darknes: ſo doth the other liue in euerlaſting
night of vice, after he hath once hardned himſelfe to euil.
And this is the worſt kind of youth that may be, which
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aduiſed ſhould be driuen out of the citie, when
neither for honeſties reſpect, nor for admonitions, nor
ſhame, nor for loue of vertue or feare of lawes, they could
poſſibly be reclaimed to vertuous life.</p>
            <p>I pray you (ſaid Captain <hi>Norreis)</hi> let me interrupt you
a little, ſo ſhall you the better take breath in the meane
while. I noted not long ſithens a ſaying of your author,
which me ſeemed ſomewhat ſtrange, and that is, that the
ſubſtance of the ſoule ſhould be made perfect by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>
            <p>You ſay right, quoth I, but let not that ſeeme ſtrange
vnto you: for it ought rather to ſeeme ſtrange vnto you
if it were otherwiſe; becauſe the ſubſtance of euery thing
is ſo called, by reaſon that it is ſubiect vnto accidents; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can there be any accident (to which it is proper to
be in ſome ſubiect) but it muſt fall into ſome ſubſtance:
and hardly would the ſubſtance perhaps be diſcerned by
ſenſe, but that the accidents do make it to be knowne.
Yet hath nature giuen to the ſubſtance all that ſhe could
giue to enable the ſame, to wit, that it might by nature
be of it ſelfe alone, hauing no need of any other thing
in reſpect of being; and that it ſhould be ſo neceſſary to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17081:61"/>
all things elſe that is not a ſubſtance, as without it they
ſhould be nothing. Therefore the nature of the ſoule is
ſuch, as the parts thereof haue their vertues and faculties
perfect: but in that concerneth the directing of them to
ciuill life, man cannot by nature onely compaſſe it, nor
attaine to that end of which we treate.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid Captaine <hi>Norreis,</hi> If it be ſo, as by nature
we cannot haue that wherewith we ſhould compaſſe our
felicitie, it muſt belike be in vs contrary to nature. And, all
things contrary to nature, being violent, and of no conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance;
I cannot perceiue how this felicitie of ours may
ſtand.</p>
            <p>Sir (ſaid I) it followeth not, that whatſoeuer is not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
muſt needs be contrary to nature. But moſt true it is
that the meanes to guide vs to this felicitie; or our felicity
it ſelfe, is in vs not by nature: for if it were ſo, all men
ſhould naturally be happy, and by nature haue the means
to purchaſe the ſame, becauſe all men ſhould of neceſſitie
worke after one ſort. For things naturall, vnleſſe they be
forced or hindered, do alwayes bring foorth the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
whereſoeuer they be; and the powers which nature
beſtoweth, are indifferently diſpenſed to all alike. Which
thing is to be vnderſtood by the <hi>vegetatiue</hi> part of the
ſoule, which in plants and in creatures ſenſible attendeth
onely by nature, without counſell or election, to nouriſh,
to increaſe, to procreate, and to preſerue: ne ceaſeth at any
time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe offices, but alwaies produceth like effects
in al things that haue life. And the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible ſoule euermore
giueth the power and vertue of feeling to creatures ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and neuer altereth her operation, nor ceaſeth to
yeeld the ſame whiles life endureth, except by ſome
ſtrange accident ſhe be forced. Seeing therefore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie
of mans will, the varietie of his operations, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17081:62"/>
how differently they vſe the faculties of the ſoule, we
muſt needes conclude, that in reſpect of ciuill life, they
work not according to nature. But we muſt not therfore
ſay, that their working to purchaſe their felicitie, and the
end we ſpeake of, is contrary to nature. For ſuch things
are properly ſaid to be contrary to nature, as are violently
forced to that which is not naturall, and whereunto they
haue no aptneſſe or diſpoſition at all. As for example, if a
ſtone (which is naturally heauy, and therfore coueteth to
moue to the center of the earth) be caſt vpward into the
aire by force, it is to be ſaid, that the motion of that ſtone
ſo forced vpward is contrary to nature; becauſe it hath
no inſtinct or mouing from nature to go vpward: and
though it were throwne vp ten thouſand times, ſo often
wold it fal downe again, if it were not retained otherwiſe
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falling. And if fire, which is light, &amp; couets to aſcend,
ſhould be forced downeward, that force would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to nature, and the force ceaſing, it would by nature
aſcend again, becauſe it hath not any vertue, or principle,
or motion to deſcend, but onely to aſcend, by which it
ſtriueth to come to the place which is proper to it by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as it is fire, and by which it is fire naturally. For the
elements haue alwayes their eſſence moſt perfect, when
they are neareſt to the place aſſigned them by nature. But
man being a creature capable of reaſon, and thereby apt
to receiue thoſe vertues, the ſeeds whereof nature hath
ſowne in his mind, it cannot be ſaid, that the meanes (by
which he is to be led to ſo noble an end as his felicitie)
ſhould be in him contrary to nature. For neuer any thing
worketh contrary to nature, in which is the beginning of
that operation that it is to do.</p>
            <p>Why, ſaid Captaine <hi>Norreis</hi> againe, ſince you ſay that
the ſeeds of vertues are in our minds naturally, it ſeemeth
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17081:62"/>
ſtrange to me that they ſhould not bring forth generally
in all men their fruite; as the ſeed which is caſt into the
earth, ſpringeth, buddeth, flowreth, and laſtly in due ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
yeeldeth fruite according to kind.</p>
            <p>Marry (ſaid I) and ſo they do. For if mans care and
induſtry be not applied to manure the earth diligently,
and to weed out the il weeds that ſpring among the good
ſeed which is ſowne, they would ſo choke the ſame as it
would be quite loſt. And euen ſo, if the ſeeds of vertue be
not holpen with continuall culture, and care taken to pul
vp the vices which ſpring therewith, and whereof the
ſeeds are naturally as well in our mind, as thoſe of vertue,
they wil ouer-grow and choke them, as the weeds of the
garden ouer-grow and choke the good herbes planted
or ſowne therein. For ſo grow vp the diſordinate appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
vnreaſonable anger, ambitions, greedie deſires of
wealth, of honour, wanton luſts of the fleſh, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affections ſpoken of before, which haue their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
rootes in thoſe two baſer parts of the ſoule deuoyde
of reaſon. And as we ſee the earth, without manuring to
bring forth wyld herbs and weeds more plentifully then
other good ſeed, which by induſtry and labor is caſt into
the ſame: ſo do thoſe paſſions, affects, and appetites of
thoſe baſer parts of the ſoule, ſpring and grow vp thicker
and faſter then the vertues; whereby (for the more part)
the fruit of thoſe good ſeeds of vertue is loſt, if the mind
be not diligently cleaned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them by the care of others.
And theſe ill qualities are in yong men the worſe, when
they ſuffer themſelues to be tranſported without regard
of reaſon or honeſtie, and their right iudgement to be
corrupted, and their crooked to preuaile. Which crooked
iudgement is in effect the cauſe of all vices and ill affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp; turnes the braine, making them like drunken men,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17081:63"/>
much like as coccle doth to them that feed thereupon.
But this hapneth not vnto that youth which ſucceedeth
a well faſhioned childhood, ſuch as yeſterday was ſpoken
of; though it be not ſufficient to haue a childe either well
brought vp or well inſtructed. For a new care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and new diligence be vſed to cheriſh the growth of
the good ſeeds beſtowed &amp; manured in the mind of the
child: which made <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſay, that education onely was
not enough to make a man vertuous. For though the
child be ſo well bred as hath bin preſcribed, yet vnleſſe
ſome care be had to bridle it (ſo vnpleaſing a thing it is
for youth to liue within the compaſſe of modeſtie and
temperance) it is eaſily turned to that part, to which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and delight doth draw it. Neuertheles that firſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
beſtowed vpon childhood, doth ſo much auaile, as
the yong man that is diſpoſed to hearken, to good admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,
ſhall haue the leſſe to do to liue vertuouſly, and
to tame that ſenſitiue part which he hath onely to ſtriue
withall, and to make obedient to the rule of reaſon.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Carleil</hi> then ſaid, I pray you (before you go
any further) let me aske this one queſtion, why vntil now
your author hauing ſpoken of this moral ſcience, hath all
this while made no mention of the ſpeculatiue ſciences,
wherein me thinketh a yong man hath ſpecial need to be
inſtructed? for they alſo (I ſuppoſe) are neceſſary to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
of life.</p>
            <p>That doubt the author anſwereth thus, ſaid I: Vertues
are generally deuided into Speculatiue and Practike; or
we may ſay, into Intellectiue and Actiue. The ſpeculatiue
habites are fiue in number, viz: Vnderſtanding, called by
the Latines <hi>Intellectus,</hi> Science, Wiſedome, Art, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And becauſe hitherto he hath ſpoken onely how
men in ciuill life may attaine to be good, or decline from
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17081:63"/>
being euill; and that the ſpeculatiue ſciences declare, but
how wiſe, how learned, or how prudent they be, and not
how good or vertuous they be: and that theſe two firſt
ages are not of capacitie ſufficient to embrace them,
therefore he reſerueth the treating thereof vntill a fitter
time, which the courſe of our ſpeech will leade vs
vnto.</p>
            <p>Yea but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith (quoth the Lord Primate) that
yong men may be Arithmeticians and Mathematicians,
and finally therin wiſe, but yet he affirmeth that they can
not be prudent.</p>
            <p>That place of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (ſaid I) is to be vnderſtood, not
of this firſt degree of youth, whereof the author hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hitherto, but of the perfection and ripeneſſe that in
time it may attaine, as after ſhall be declared when time
doth ſerue.</p>
            <p>That time (ſaid Captaine <hi>Carleil)</hi> we will attend. But
becauſe we ſee both vertues and ſciences are to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and that I haue heard queſtion and doubt made of
the manner of learning them, I pray let vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heare whether
your author ſay ought thereof, and ſpecially whether
our learning be but a rememorating of things which we
knew formerly, or elſe a learning a new.</p>
            <p>This is indeed (ſaid I) no light queſtion which mine
author handleth alſo euen in this place: and there are on
either ſide great and learned authors, as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
firſt, whereof the one was accounted the God of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
and the other the maſter of all learned men:
and ech hath his followers, who with forcible arguments
ſeeke to defend and maintaine the part of their maſter
and captaine. But before we enter into that matter, you
muſt vnderſtand that <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> haue held a ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
way each of them in their teaching. For <hi>Plato</hi> from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17081:64"/>
things eternall, deſcended to mortall things, and thence
returned (as it were by the ſame way) from the earth to
heauen againe; rather affirming then proouing what he
taught. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> from earthly things (as moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
to our ſenſes) raiſed himſelfe, climing to heauenly
things, vſing the meane of that knowledge which the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
giue, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, that al humane know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
doth come. And where ſenſible reaſons failed him,
there failed his proofes alſo. Which thing, as it hapned to
him in diuine matters, ſo did it likewiſe in the knowledge
of the ſoule intellectiue (as ſome of his interpreters ſay):
which being created by God to his owne likeneſſe, be
hath written ſo obſcurely thereof, that his reſolute opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in that matter cannot be picked out of his writings;
but that reaſons may be gathered out of them, in fauour
of the one part and of the other: as though the treatie of
a matter ſo important and neceſſary to our knowledge,
were (as ſchoole-men ſay) a matter contingent, about
which arguments probable may be gathered on both
ſides: yet had he before him his diuine maſter, who (as far
as mans wit could ſtretch without grace) had taught him
cleerly that which was true, that mans ſoule is by nature
immortall, and partaker of diuinitie; howſoeuer ſome of
the <hi>Peripatetikes</hi> ſeeme out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> to affirme that
<hi>Plato</hi> was contrary to himſelf, as making the ſoule ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles
immortall, and otherwhiles not: which in truth is
not in <hi>Plato</hi> to be found, if he be rightly vnderſtood. But
to the purpoſe. The opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was, that our
ſoule did not only not record any thing, but that it ſhold
be ſo wholy voyd of knowledge or ſcience, as it might be
reſembled to a pure white paper: and therefore affirmed
he, that our knowledge was altogether newly gotten;
and that our ſoule had to that end need of ſenſe; and that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17081:64"/>
ſenſe failing her, all ſcience or knowledge ſhould faile
withall. Becauſe the ſenſes are as miniſters to the mind,
to receiue the images or formes particular of things:
which being apprehended by the common ſenſe, called
<hi>ſenſus communis,</hi> bring foorth afterwards the vniuerſals.
Which common ſenſe, is a power or facultie of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue
ſoule, that diſtinguiſheth betweene thoſe things
that the outward ſenſes offer vnto it; and is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
common, becauſe it receiueth commonly the formes
or images with the exteriour ſenſes preſent vnto it, and
hath power to diſtinguiſh the one from the other. But as
thoſe ſenſes know not the nature of things; ſo is the
ſame vnknowne alſo vnto the common ſenſe, to whom
they offer things ſenſible. Wherefore this commonſenſe
being (as we haue ſaid) a facultie of the <hi>ſenſitiue</hi> ſoule, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
them to the facultie <hi>imaginatiue,</hi> which hath the
ſame proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the vertue <hi>intellectiue,</hi> as things ſenſible
haue to the ſenſe aforeſaid. For it moueth the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
after it hath receiued the formes or images of things
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the outward ſenſes, &amp; layeth them vp materiall in the
memory where they be kept. This done, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his
followers ſay, that then the part of the ſoule capable of
reaſon, beginneth to vſe her powers; and they are (as they
affirme) two: the one <hi>intellectus poſsibilis,</hi> and the other
<hi>intellectus agens:</hi> theſe latin words I muſt vſe at this time,
becauſe they be eaſie enough to be vnderſtood, and in
Engliſh would ſeeme more harſh; whereof the firſt is as
the matter to the ſecond, and the ſecond as forme to the
firſt. Into that poſſible facultie of the vnderſtanding, do
the kinds or <hi>ſpecies</hi> of things paſſe, which the fantaſie hath
apprehended, yet free of any materiall condition: and
this part is to the vnderſtanding, as the hand is to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
For as the hand is apt to take hold of all inſtruments;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17081:65"/>
ſo is this power or facultie apt to apprehend the formes
of all things, from whence grow the vniuerſals: which
though they haue their being in the materiall particulars
which the Latins cal <hi>indiuidua;</hi> yet are they not material,
becauſe they are not (according to <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> yet in act.
In which reſpect it is ſayd, that ſenſe is buſied about
things particular, and that onely things vniuerſall are
knowne, becauſe they be comprehended by the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
without matter. It is neuertheleſſe to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
that the kindes of things are in this poſſible part
thus ſeparated from matter, but blind and obſcure: euen
as colours are ſtil in ſubſtances, though the light be taken
away; which light appearing and making the ayre tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
which before was darkened, it giueth to things
that illumination, by which they are comprehended and
knowne to the eye, whoſe obiect properly colours are.
And the Sunne being the fountaine of light, wiſe men
haue ſaid, that the ſame Sunne giueth colours to things;
for that by meanes of his light they are ſeene with thoſe
viſible colours which naturally they haue neuertheleſſe
in themſelues, though without light they could not be
diſcerned, and remaine there as if they were not at all.
This part of the ſoule then, wherein reaſon is, worketh
the ſame effect towards things intelligible that the Sun
doth towards things viſible; for it illumineth thoſe kinds
or formes which lie hidden in that part poſſible, dark and
confuſed, deuoyde of place, time, and matter, becauſe
they are not particular. And hence it cometh that ſome
haue ſaid this poſſible vnderſtanding (as we may terme it)
to be ſuch a thing, as out of it all things ſhould be made,
as if it were in ſtead of matter; and the other agent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
to be the worker of all things, and as it were
the forme, becauſe this part which before was but in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17081:65"/>
power to things intelligible, becometh through the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the agent vnderſtanding to be now in act. And
for this cauſe alſo is it ſaid, that the vnderſtanding, and
things vnderſtood, become more properly and truly one
ſelfe ſame thing, then of matter and forme it may be ſaid.
For it is credible, that both the formes of things and the
vnderſtanding being immateriall, they do the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
vnite themſelues, and that the vnderſtanding doth
ſo make it ſelfe equall with the thing vnderſtood, that
they both become one. To which purpoſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid
very well, that the reaſonable ſoule, whiles it vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
things intelligible, becometh one ſelfe ſame thing
with them. And this is that very act of truth, to wit, the
certain ſcience or knowledge of any thing: which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or ſcience is in effect nought elſe then the thing ſo
knowne. And this knowledge is not principally in man,
but in the ſoule, wherin it remaineth as the forme therof.
This is briefly the ſumme of the order or maner of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which thoſe that follow <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> do ſet downe:
who therefore affirme that his ſentence was, that who ſo
would vnderſtand any thing, had need of thoſe formes
and images which the ſenſes offer to the fantaſie. From
which ſentence ſome (not well aduiſed in my opinion)
haue gone about to argue, that the ſoule of man ſhould
be mortal, becauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aſſigned no proper operation
vnto her, as if ſuch had bin his opinion. But they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his bookes <hi>de Anima,</hi> ſpake of the
ſoule as ſhe was naturall, and the forme to the body, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
her operations together with the body, and as
ſhe was the mouer of the body, and the body moued by
her, but not as ſhe was diſtinct or ſeparate from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
And right true it is, that whiles ſhe is tied to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
ſhe cannot vnderſtand but by the meanes of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17081:66"/>
but that being free and looſed from the body, ſhe
hath not her proper operations, that is moſt falſe. For
then hath ſhe no need at all of the ſenſes, when being
pure and ſimple, ſhe may exerciſe her owne power and
vertue proper to her, (which is the contemplation of
God Almightie, the higheſt and onely true good) nor
yet of any other inſtrument but her ſelfe. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
perchance the better ſort of <hi>Peripatetikes</hi> following
their maſters opinion, haue ſaid, that the ſoule ſeparated
from the body, is not the ſame ſhe was whiles ſhe was
linked thereunto, as well becauſe then ſhe was a part of
the whole, and was troubled with anger, deſire, hatred,
loue, &amp; ſuch like paſſions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to her with the body; as
becauſe being impriſoned in the body, ſhe had neede of
the ſenſes; but now that ſhe was freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor any way bound to the body, ſhe might vſe her
ſelfe and her vertue much more nobly and worthily
then before. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, that the ſoule,
ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, could no more be called a ſoule,
but equiuocally. But here is to be noted, that it is one
thing to ſpeake of the intellectiue ſoule which is diuine
and vncorruptible, and another thing to ſpeake of the
ſoule, ſimply. For doubtleſſe, the <hi>vegetatiue</hi> and <hi>ſenſitiue</hi>
ſoules, which cannot vſe their vertues and operations
but by meane of the body, die with the body. But the
intellectiue ſoule, which is our onely true forme, not
drawne from the materiall power, but created and ſent
into vs by the diuine maieſtie, dieth not with the body,
but remaineth immortal and euerlaſting. And thus much
touching the maner of our learning, according to <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi>
opinion may ſuffice. But <hi>Plato</hi> doubtleſſe was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that our ſoule, before it deſcended into vs, had the
knowledge of all things; and that by comming into this
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17081:66"/>
mortall priſon (which his followers haue termed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
of the ſoule) ſhe was plunged as it were into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
darkneſſe from a moſt cleere light, whereby ſhe
forgat all that erſt ſhe knew. And that afterwards by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of thoſe things, which by meanes of the ſenſes
come before her, the memory of that ſhe knew before
being ſtirred vp and wakened, ſhe came to reſume her
former knowledge, and in this ſort by way of rememo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating,
and not of learning a new, ſhe attained the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ſciences; ſo as we learned nothing, whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we had not the knowledge. In conformitie of which
their maſters ſentence, the <hi>Platonikes</hi> ſay, that ſince the
body bringeth with it the ſeeds that appertaine vnto it by
nature, it is to be beleeued, that the ſoule likewiſe, being
much more perfect, ſhould bring with it thoſe ſeeds that
appertaine to the mind. And to this reaſon they adde,
that men euen from their firſt yeares deſiring things that
are good, true, honeſt and profitable: and ſince no man
can deſire a thing which he knoweth not after ſome ſort,
it may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, that we haue the knowledge of thoſe
things before. But becauſe it would be too long a matter
to rehearſe all the arguments which <hi>Plato</hi> his followers
bring to proue this, by our deſiring of things, by ſeeking
them, by finding them, and by the diſcerning of them; it
may ſuffice to referre you to what <hi>Plato</hi> hath left of this
matter written vnder the perſon of <hi>Socrates,</hi> in his dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logs
intitled <hi>Menon</hi> and <hi>Phoedon,</hi> and diuers other places.
And likewiſe to that which his expoſitors haue written,
among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Plotinus,</hi> though he be ſomewhat obſcure,
deſerueth the chiefe place, as beſt expreſſing <hi>Plato</hi> his
ſence and meaning. But let our knowledge come how it
will, either by learning anew, or by recording what the
ſoule knew before; ſhe hauing need (howſoeuer it be) of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17081:67"/>
the miniſtery of the ſenſes, and ſeeing it is almoſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to paſſe through the ſame meanes from not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to knowledge: we ſhall euer find the like difficulties,
whether we rememorate or learne anew. For without
much ſtudy, great diligence, and long trauel, are ſciences
no way to be attained. Which thing <hi>Socrates</hi> (who haply
was the author of <hi>Plato</hi> his opinion) ſhewed vs plainely.
For when the curtizan <hi>Theodota</hi> ſcoffing at him ſaid, ſhe
was of greater skill then he: for ſhe had drawne diuers of
<hi>Socrates</hi> ſcholers from him to her loue, where <hi>Socrates</hi>
could draw none of her louers to follow him: he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he thereat maruelled nothing at all: for (ſaid he)
thou leadeſt them by a plaine ſmooth way to luſt and
wantonneſſe; and I leade them to vertue by a rough and
an vneaſie path.</p>
            <p>Here Captaine <hi>Norreis</hi> ſaid, Though this controuerſie
betweene two ſo great Philoſophers be not (for ought I
ſee) yet decided, and that if we ſhould take vpon vs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
whoſe opinion were the better, it might be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to preſumption: yet would I for my part be very glad
to know what was the reaſon that induced <hi>Plato</hi> to ſay
that our ſoule had the knowledge of all things before it
came into the body; and I pray you, if your author ſpeake
any thing thereof, that you will therein ſatisfie my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
            <p>Yes marry doth he ſir, ſaid I, and your deſire herein
ſheweth very well the excellencie of your wit, and your
attention to that which hath bin ſaid: and both may ſerue
for a ſufficient argument, what hope is to be conceiued
of a gentleman ſo inclined and deſirous to learne. Thus
therefore he ſaith to your queſtion. That whereas we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to truth beleeue, that our ſoules are by the diuine
power of God, incontinently created and infuſed into
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17081:67"/>
our bodies, when we beginne to receiue life and ſenſe in
our mothers womb. <hi>Plato</hi> contrarily held, that they were
long before the bodies created, and produced in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
certaine by God, and that they were as particles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from the Gods aboue into our bodies: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he thought it nothing abſurd, that they ſhould haue
the knowledge of al things that may be knowne. For that
they being in heauen buſied in the contemplation of the
diuine nature, free from any impediment of the body:
and that diuine nature containing in it (as he ſaid) the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall
<hi>Ideas</hi> of all things, which <hi>Ideas</hi> (according to his
opinion) were ſeparate and eternall natures remaining in
the diuine minde of God, to the patterne of which, all
things created were made, they might (ſaid he) in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
haue the knowledge of all that could be knowne.</p>
            <p>If this opinion were true, ſaid Captaine <hi>Norreis,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
had it bin for vs, that our ſoules had continued ſtil, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were ſent into our bodies, to be of that ſort that
they had bin in heauen, for then ſhould we not haue nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſo much labour and paine in ſeeking that knowledge
which before they had ſo perfectly. And being ſo perfect
to what end did he ſay, they were ſent into our bodies to
become vnperfect?</p>
            <p>His opinion (ſaid I) was, that the ſoules were created
in a certaine number, to the end they might informe ſo
many bodies: and therfore if they ſhould not haue come
into thoſe bodies, they ſhould haue failed of the end for
which they were created. In which bodies, the <hi>Platonikes</hi>
ſay further, that they were to exerciſe themſelues, and
were giuen to the bodies, not onely becauſe they ſhould
giue them power to moue, to ſee, to feele, and to do thoſe
other operations which are naturall; but to the end that
they ſhould in that which appertaineth to the mind, not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17081:68"/>
ſuffer vs to be drowſie, and lie (as it were) aſleepe, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to waken and ſtirre vs vp to the knowledge of thoſe
things that are fit for vs to vnderſtand: and this was the
moſt accompliſhed operation (ſayd they) that the ſoule
could giue vnto the bodie whiles it was linked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſee (ſaid the Lord Primate) how this hangeth
together. For I haue read that theſe kind of Philoſophers
held an opinion, that our ſoules all the while they were
tied to our bodies, did but ſleepe: and that all, which they
do or ſuffer in this life, was but as a dreame.</p>
            <p>It is true (ſaid I) that the <hi>Platonikes</hi> ſaid ſo indeed; and
that was, becauſe they knew that whatſoeuer we do in
this life is but a dreame, in compariſon of that our ſoules
ſhal do in the other world, when they ſhal be looſed from
thoſe bands which tie them to our bodies here: through
which bands they are hindred from the knowledge of
thoſe things perfectly which here they learne. In regard
whereof <hi>Carneades, Arceſilas,</hi> and others the authors of
the new Accademie ſaid conſtantly, that in this world
there was no certaine knowledge of any thing. And <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifanes</hi>
affirmed, that of all thoſe things which here ſeeme
to vs to be, we know nothing ſo certainly as that they
were not. Vnto which opinion <hi>Protagoras</hi> alſo agreed,
ſaying, that men might diſpute of any thing <hi>pro &amp; contra;</hi>
as if he ſhould ſay, that nothing could be aſſuredly kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
to vs whiles we are here, as our ſoules ſhall know
them whenſoeuer they ſhall be freed from our bodies,
and lie no more inwrapped in theſe mortall ſhadowes,
becauſe then they ſhall be wholy buſied in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of truth: neither ſhal they be deceiued by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as in this life they are oftentimes, who offer vnto them
the images of things vncertainly, not through default
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17081:68"/>
of the ſenſes, but by reaſon of the meanes whereby they
apprehend the formes of things. For the ſenſe by his
owne nature (if he be not deceiued or hindred in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of things ſenſible) comprehendeth them perfectly,
nay becometh one ſelfe ſame thing with them. And this
is the cauſe why it is ſaid, that our ſoules ſleepe whiles
they remaine in this life, and that our knowledge here
is but as a dreame. According to which conceit, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured
Poet, ſpeaking of his Ladie <hi>Laura,</hi> ſaid very
properly vpon her death in this ſort:
<q>
                  <l>Thou haſt (faire Damſell) ſlept but a ſhort ſleepe,</l>
                  <l>Now wak'd thou art among the heau'nly ſpirits,</l>
                  <l>Where bleſſed ſoules interne within their maker.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Shewing that our life here is but a ſlumber; and ſeeming
to infer that ſhe was now interned or become inward in
the contemplation of her maker, being wakened fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her
ſleepe among thoſe bleſſed ſpirits, as ſhe had bin, before
ſhe was incloſed in this earthly priſon. And likewiſe he
ſeemed to leane to <hi>Plato</hi> his opinion in another place,
when ſpeaking of her alſo, he ſaid ſhe was returned to her
fellow ſtar. For <hi>Plato</hi> thought the number of ſoules crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
was according to the number of the ſtarres in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
and that euery ſoule had a proper ſtarre to which it
returned after this life. But as for our knowledge, in truth
it is but a ſhadow in reſpect of the knowledge our ſoules
ſhall haue by the contemplation of the diuine eſſence.
Whereupon <hi>Socrates,</hi> one of the wiſeſt and moſt learned
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that euer were, yet euermore affirmed reſolutely, that
the only thing he knew, was, that he knew nothing. And
to ſay truly, this his knowing of nothing, might well be
termed a learned ignorance.</p>
            <p>Well (ſaid the Lord Primate) captain <hi>Carleil</hi> and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Norreis</hi> haue by their demaunds miniſtred a very
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17081:69"/>
fit occaſion vnto you, to diſcourſe out of your author
the conſiderations of the maner of our knowledge, and
conſequently of the ſoule of man, and to declare withall
the opinions of two ſo excellent Philoſophers and of their
followers. But though both agree in this, that whether
the ſoule learne of new, or by rememorating, ſhe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
need of the ſenſes as her miniſters to attain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
yet is it to be beleeued, and that aſſuredly, that the
ſoule of man being created by God Almightie to his
owne image and likeneſſe, ſhe hath alſo ſome proper o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
or action reſembling his; to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof, ſhe hath no need of the ſenſes. And that
being diſſolued from the body, or after, when he ſhall be
re-united to the ſame in the reſurrection, ſhe hauing then
the ſame image and likeneſſe of God ſtill in her, ſhe ſhall
euerlaſtingly be wholy and onely intent to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of his diuine maieſtie, who is the onely true and
perfect good and happineſſe. The perfection of which
diuine maieſtie, is the knowledge of himſelfe; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelfe to know all things by him created and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
But it is time now for you to returne to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you had in hand, when you were drawne by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds
to make this digreſſion.</p>
            <p>And euen ſo will I, ſince you be ſo pleaſed, quoth I,
and ſo proceeded in this maner. In the beginning of
youth, the yong man is fitly to be reſembled to a traueller
that is arriued in his iourney to a place where the way is
deuided into two parts, and ſtandeth in doubt which of
them he ſhall take: for in either of them he ſeeth a guide
ſtanding ready to leade him; whereof, the one inuiteth
him to pleaſure, and the other to vertue. The firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to him his delights and eaſe, and the other labour
and trauell. And foraſmuch as that age is inclined natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17081:69"/>
to pleaſures, and enemy to paine-taking and labour,
it is greatly to be doubted that the yong man leauing the
way that leades to vertue, wil betake himſelfe to the other
guide to follow the way that leadeth to delight. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if at any time it be needfull for the father to haue a
watchfull eye vpon his ſonne, it is then moſt important
when his child is to make his paſſage from his childhood
into his youth: and at that time to ſet before his eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
inſtructions, wherby he may conceiue how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie
and good behauiour, with ciuill conuerſation, are
the foundation of good and happie life: and this chiefly
is he to do by his owne example. For though it be very
good, that his ſon in thoſe yeares, and at all other times,
ſhould ſee the whole family ſo ordered, as he may learne
nothing therein but vertue and honeſty; yet muſt he not
thinke but that his ſonne will better beleeue and follow
what he ſhal ſee himſelfe do or ſay, then all the family be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.
And if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aduiſe maſters to endeuour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to giue good example to their ſeruants and ſlaues;
how much more ought the father to be carefull to do the
like to his owne children, who are dearer to him then his
ſeruants, being his owne liuely images. For as it is the
mothers care and office to breed and nouriſh her childe;
ſo is it the fathers dutie to ſee him well inſtructed and
taught in vertues and good behauiour: and the ſpeeches
and demeanour of the father in his houſhold or family,
are to his children as lawes in a citie to the citizens, and
do aſſuredly enter into the mindes of children with farre
greater force then men would think. Which made <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
to ſay, that the ſtopping of young mens eares was
more needful then the arming of their bodies againſt the
ſtrokes of their enemies; becauſe the danger was greater
which they incurred by hearing an vnſeemely ſpeech,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:17081:70"/>
ſpecially from their parents mouth, then that which they
might feare by fighting with their enemies. The father
therefore muſt be very circumſpect that his ſonne heare
him not ſpeake any word vndecent or diſhoneſt: for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with a certain hidden vertue perſwadeth youth, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
a weltaught childhood, to beare great reuerence
and reſpect to the graue and ripe yeares of their parents,
and of all aged perſons; who euen in the firſt view repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
vnto them vertue, prudence, and all good and graue
behauiour. And ſuch is he to ſhew himſelfe to his ſonne,
as euen in his countenance, geſtures and words he may
as in a table behold therein the lawes of honeſt life. And
that his actions may be in all points to his ſon a patterne
and example of ciuill conuerſation and vertuous liuing.</p>
            <p>It is a very neceſſary and important inſtruction and
aduertiſement (ſaid M. <hi>Dormer)</hi> that you haue laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
for fathers to obſerue. But I would faine that you
ſhold tel me, whether you haue not ſeen (as I oftentimes
haue done) wicked children begotten of very good and
honeſt parents.</p>
            <p>Yes (quoth I) oftener then I would. Neither can it be
denied, but that as there are ſome young men by nature
and through their happie conſtellation wholy bent to
vertuous and honeſt conditions; ſo are there others na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
diſpoſed to vice and lewd behauiour: yet ſince it
ſeemeth not credible, that of good parents ill children
ſhould come; and that diligent care in bringing them vp
ſhould not plucke vp (if not wholy, yet in part) thoſe euil
weeds which choke the good ſeeds, ſo as the fruit might
in due ſeaſon be expected: ſeeking to finde the reaſon
hereof, I haue called to mind the precept of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
giuen to the Phyſitions, to wit, that it is not ſufficient for
recouery of the ſicke patient, that the Phyſition be well
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17081:70"/>
diſpoſed to cure him, and employ his diligence to that
effect: but that other things muſt likewiſe concurre for
the recouery of his health, as the care and ſollicitude of
ſuch as watch and tend him, with other exteriour things.
For euen ſo me thinketh, that to the good proofe of a
young man, beſides the example of the father, and of the
reſt of the family, be it neuer ſo vertuous, there muſt alſo
concurre the goodneſſe of his conuerſation abroade, to
make his domeſticall familiaritie worke due effect: ſince
many times I haue ſeene it fall out, that the haunting of
ill company from home, hath done a young man much
more hurt, then all the good inſtructions or vertuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
domeſticall could do him good. So ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
are the minds of yong men, and apt (as was formerly
ſaid) to be wrought like waxe to vice. And this cometh to
paſſe, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the ſenſitiue part calling youth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and diuerting it from the trauell and paine which
learning and vertue require, is hardly ſubdued and
brought vnder the rule of reaſon, by which it eſteemeth
it ſelfe forced, when it is barred from that it deſireth. And
if by any exteriour occaſion it be pricked forward, it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
as we ſee it oftentimes do with young hard-headed
colts, who take the bit in the mouth, and run away with
the rider, carrying him, will he, nill he, whether they liſt.
It ought therefore to be none of the leaſt cares of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to prouide, that the forraine conuerſation of his ſon
may be ſuch as ſhall rather help then hinder his care and
home-example. To which effect, it would be very good,
if it might be poſſible, that the young man were neuer
from his fathers ſide. But foraſmuch as many occaſions
draw men to attend other waightier affaires, as well pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
as priuat, wherby they are driuen to haue their minds
buſied about exterior things, and to neglect their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:17081:71"/>
who are their owne bowels. Therefore is it their parts
in ſuch caſes to appoint for their children, when they are
paſt their childiſh yeares, ſome learned and honeſt man
of vertuous behauiour to gouerne them and take care
of them, whoſe precepts they may ſo obey, as they ſhall
feare to do any thing that may breede reproch or blame
vnto them. For ſuch things are mortall poiſon to yong
mens minds, and not only put them aſtray from the path
that ſhould leade them to vertue, but imprint in them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
a vitious habit that maketh them vnruly and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to all wholeſome admonitions and vertuous actions.
This man ſo choſen to haue the charge of youth, muſt be
carefull among other things to foreſee, that his diſciples
may haue ſuch companions, as the Perſian Princes had,
prouided for them, to wit, equall of age and like of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
with whom they may be conuerſant &amp; familiar.
For ſuch ſimilitude of age and conditions doth cauſe
them to loue and like one another, if ſome barre or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
fall not betweene them. The auncient wiſe men
aſſigned to youth the Plannet of <hi>Mercury,</hi> for no other
cauſe (as I ſuppoſe) but for that <hi>Mercury</hi> being (as Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers
ſay) either good or bad, according as he is accom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panied
with another plannet good or euil: euen ſo youth
becommeth good or bad, as the companies to which it
draweth or giueth it ſelfe. And therefore ought not yong
men to haue libertie to haunt what companie they liſt,
but to be kept vnder the diſcipline of wiſe men, and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vp in the companie of others of their age well bred,
vntill it may be thought, or rather found by experience,
that they be paſt danger, and become fit to guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
hauing brought their mind obedient to reaſon ſo
farre, as it cannot any more draw him to any delights, but
ſuch as are honeſt and vertuous. This delight in vertue
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17081:71"/>
and honeſtie, is beſt induced into a yong mans mind by
that true companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vertue that breedeth feare to do or
ſay any thing vnſeemely or diſhoneſt: which companion
<hi>Socrates</hi> ſought to make familiar to his ſcholers, when he
would tell them how they ſhould endeuour themſelues
to purchaſe in their minds prudence, into their tongues
truth with ſilence, and in their faces baſhfulneſſe, called
by the Latins <hi>verecundia,</hi> deriuing it from the reuerence
which yong men vſe to beare to their elders. This we call
ſhamefaſtneſſe, and is that honeſt red colour or bluſhing
which dieth a yong mans cheekes when he ſuppoſeth he
hath done or ſaid any thing vnſeemely or vnfit for a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
mind, or that may offend his parents or betters: a
certaine token of a generous mind, and well diſciplined,
of which great hope may be conceiued that it will proue
godly and vertuous. For as a ſure and firme friend to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie
and vertue, like a watch or guard ſet for their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
it is euer wakefull and carefull to keepe all diſordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
concupiſcences from the mind, whereby (though
of it ſelfe it be rather an affect then a habit) neuertheleſſe
ſhe induceth ſuch a habite into a yong mans mind, that
not onely in preſence of others he bluſheth, if he chance
to do any thing not commendable, but euen of himſelfe
he is aſhamed, if being alone he fall into any errour. For
though ſome ſay, that two things chiefly keepe youth
from euill, correction, and ſhame, and that chaſtiſement
rather then inſtruction draweth youth to do well; yet I
for my part neuer think that yong man well bred or trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vp, who for feare of puniſhment abſtaineth from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things ſhamefull or diſhoneſt: puniſhment being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
but for them that are euill: which made the Poet
ſay:
<q>
                  <l>For vertues ſake good men ill deeds refraine:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:17081:72"/>
Ill men refraine them but for feare of paine.</l>
               </q>
For the wickedneſſe of men hath cauſed lawes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed
and eſtabliſhed for the conſeruation of honeſt and
vertuous ſocietie, and ciuil life, whereunto man is borne:
which lawes haue appointed penalties for the offenders,
to the end that for feare thereof, as <hi>Xenocrates</hi> was wont
to ſay, men might flie from ill doing, as dogs flie harme
doing for feare of the whip. And becauſe <hi>Plato</hi> formed
his Common-weale of perfect and vertuous men, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſet he downe no lawes in his bookes <hi>de Repub.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſuppoſed the goodneſſe of the men to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for the gouernement thereof without a law, either
to commaund good order, or to puniſh offenders. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles
the ſame diuine Philoſopher conſidering how
the imperfection of mans nature will not ſuffer any ſuch
Common-wealth to be found: he wrote alſo his bookes
of lawes to ſerue for the imperfection of other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales,
which were compoſed of men of all ſorts,
good and bad, meane or indifferent, in which both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and puniſhment were needfull, as well to make
the euill abſtaine from vice, as to confirme the good, and
to reduce thoſe that were indifferent to greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Lawes therefore haue appointed puniſhments, that
vertue might be defended and maintained, ciuill ſocietie
and humane right preſerued. But young men bred as our
author would haue them, are by all meanes to be framed
ſuch, as for vertues ſake, for feare of reproch, for loue and
reuerence to honeſtie, and not for feare of puniſhment
to be inflicted on them by the magiſtrates or their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
for doing of euill, they may accuſtome themſelues
neuer to do any thing, for which they ſhould neede to
bluſh, no not to themſelues alone. Which thing they ſhal
the better performe, if they vſe to forbeare the doing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17081:72"/>
of any thing by themſelues, which they would be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of if they were in company. It is written, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the auncient Romanes one <hi>Iulius Druſus Publicola</hi>
hauing his houſe ſeated ſo as his neighbours might looke
into it, a certaine Architect offered him for the expence
of fiue talents to make it ſo cloſe as none of his neighbors
ſhould looke thereinto, or ſee what he was doing. But he
made him anſwer againe, that he would rather giue him
ten talents to make it ſo, as all the citie might ſee what he
did in his houſe; becauſe he was ſure he did nothing
within doores whereof he neede be aſhamed abroade,
though euery man ſhould ſee him. For which anſwer
he was highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended. True it is that <hi>Xenophon</hi> eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
this bluſhng to a mans ſelf, to be rather temperance
then baſhfulnes: but let it be named how it wil, it is ſurely
the propertie of a gentle heart ſo to do. And therefore
<hi>Petrarke</hi> ſaid well:
<q>
                  <l>Alone whereas I walkt mongs woods and hils,</l>
                  <l>I ſhamed at my ſelfe: for gentle heart</l>
                  <l>Thinkes that enough, no other ſpurre it wils.</l>
               </q>
Yet would I not neither, that our young man ſhould be
more baſhfull then were fit, as one ouer-awed or doltiſh,
not able to conſider perils or dangers when they preſent
themſelues, not yet to looſe his boldneſſe of ſpirit. For
<hi>Antipater</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Caſſander</hi> through the like quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
caſt himſelfe away, who hauing inuited <hi>Demetrius</hi> to
ſupper with him at ſuch a time, as their friendſhip was not
ſure but ſtood vpon doubtful termes, and he being come
accordingly: when <hi>Demetrius</hi> afterwards as in requital of
his kindneſſe inuited <hi>Antipater</hi> likewiſe to ſupper, though
he knew right well what perill he thruſt himſelfe into if
he went, conſidering the wyly diſpoſition of the ſaid <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius:</hi>
yet being aſhamed that <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17081:73"/>
him to be ſo miſtruſtful, would needs go, and there
was miſerably ſlaine. This is a vice, named in the Greeke
<hi>Diſopia,</hi> and which we may in Engliſh call vnfruitfull
ſhamefaſtneſſe, wherewith we would not wiſh our yong
man ſhould be any way acquainted, but onely with that
generous baſhfulneſſe that may ſerue him for a ſpurre to
vertue, and for a bridle from vice. But becauſe <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith,
that though baſhfulneſſe be moſt properly fit for young
men, yet that it is alſo ſeemly inough for men of al yeares.
And that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> contrariwiſe thinketh it not meete for
men of riper years to bluſh: it may therefore be doubted
to whether of theſe two great learned mens opinions we
ſhould incline. For cleering hereof, you muſt vnderſtand
that the <hi>Platonikes</hi> ſay two things among others are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
giuen to for a diuine gift vnto man: Baſhfulneſſe
the one, and Magnanimitie the other: the one to hold vs
back from doing of any thing worthy blame &amp; reproch:
the other to put vs forward into the way of praiſe and
vertue; whereby we might alwayes be ready to do well
onely for vertues ſake, to the good and benefit of others,
and to our owne contentment and delight. Of which
courſe, the end is honour in this world, and glory after
death. But becauſe the force of the Concupiſcible appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
is ſo great, and ſetteth before vs pleaſure in ſo many
ſundry ſhapes, as it is hard to ſhun the ſnares which theſe
two enemies of reaſon ſet to intrap vs, and that the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of old age cannot wholy extinguiſh the feruour of
our appetites; for my part I think that as in all ages it is fit
that Magnanimitie inuite vs to commendable actions; ſo
alſo that we haue neede of ſhamefaſtneſſe to correct vs
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer we ſhal go beyond the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds or limits of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in what yeares ſoeuer, and to check vs with the bridle
of tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſay, that ſhame ought
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17081:73"/>
to die red in a mans cheekes, but for voluntary actions
only: yet <hi>Plato</hi> conſidering that none but God is perfect
without fault; and that euery man, euen the moſt vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
falleth ſometimes through humane frailtie, thought
(according to Chriſtianitie) that ripeneſſe of yeares or
wiſedome ſhould be no hinderance to make them aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but rather make them the more baſhfull whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they ſhould find in themſelues, that they had run into
any errour vndecent or vnfitting for men of their yeares
and quality. Not intending yet thereby that the errors of
the ancienter men were to be of that ſort that yong mens
faults commonly are, who through incontinencie runne
oftentimes into ſin wilfully: whereas men of riper yeares
erre or ought to erre only through frailty of nature. Much
better were it indeede for men of yeares not to do any
thing of which they might be aſhamed, if the condition
of man would permit it, then after they had done it to
bluſh thereat: and much more reprochfull is his fault, if
he offend voluntarily then the young mans. But ſince
no man (though he haue made a habite in wel-doing)
can ſtand ſo aſſured of himſelfe, but that ſometime in his
life he ſhal commit ſome error: it is much better (in what
age ſoeuer it be) that bluſhing make him know his fault,
then to paſſe it ouer impudently without ſhame. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid in his booke of Offices, that
ſhamefaſtneſſe was meet for all ages, for all times, and for
all places. And for the ſame cauſe perhaps haue wiſe men
and religious held, that an Angell of heauen aſſiſteth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man to call him backe from thoſe euils, which the ill
Angell with his ſugred baite of delight and diſordinate
appetite inticeth him vnto, onely for his ruine. For they
thought that our forces were not able to reſiſt ſo mighty
prouocations. As for <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſeemeth they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17081:74"/>
differed in opinion, for that, the one conſidered humane
nature as it ought to be, and the other as it commonly is
indeed. Which may the better be beleeued, becauſe <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
in his booke of Rhetorike, reſtrained not this habite
of ſhamefaſtneſſe ſo preciſely to young men, but that it
may ſometimes beſeeme an aged mans cheekes alſo,
though ſo farre as grace and wiſedome may preuaile, it
would beſt beſeeme him neuer to do the thing whereof
he need be aſhamed, as before was ſayd. And the ſame
rule ought young men alſo to propoſe to themſelues,
whereby they ſhall deſerue ſo much the more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
as the heate of their yeares beareth with them fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
appetites, and they the leſſe apt to reſiſt ſo ſharpe and
ſo intollerable prickes. The way to obſerue that rule, is
to ſtriue in all their actions to maſter themſelues, and to
profit in vertue: whereunto will helpe them chiefly, that
they endeuour themſelues to bridle ſuch deſires as they
find moſt to moleſt them, not ſuffering them to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them beyond the limits of honeſtie. But becauſe
the day goeth away, and that to treate particularly of all
that might be ſaid concerning the direction of youth to
vertue, which leadeth him to his felicitie, would require
more time then is remaining, I wil briefly knit vp the reſt
that concerneth this matter. Young men haue naturall
heate ſo much abounding in them, that they cannot reſt,
but be ſtill in motion as well of body as of mind. The one
with running, leaping, and other exerciſes, and when all
they faile, the tongue ceaſeth not, which by reaſon of
their age is the more bold and ready. The other with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
from one diſcourſe to another, and from one paſſion
to another; now louing, now hating, now boyling with
anger and choler, now ſtill and quiet, with ſuch like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the mind. And becauſe the motions of the body,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17081:74"/>
and the affections of the minde muſt haue their meaſure
and their rule, and the one and the other conuenient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
and moderate reſt: therefore did the auncient wiſe
men deuiſe two ſpeciall Arts, moſt apt and fit for both
theſe purpoſes. Whereof, the one they called <hi>Gymnaſtica,</hi>
which is a skilfull and moderate exerciſe of the body; and
the other Muſike, by which name it is well knowne in
all languages. And when they had cauſed their youth to
ſpend part of the day in learning thoſe ſciences and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines
which they thought fit for that age (for of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things they abhorred the training them vp in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
becauſe ſeldome can an ignorant man be good,
and that men without knowledge and learning are but
figures of men, and images of death without ſoule or life)
then would they draw them to honeſt exerciſes of the
body by degrees. For they held it a thing moſt neceſſary
for the wel-founding of a Common-wealth, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
carefull of the framing youth both in body and
mind; becauſe they knew right well that good education
maketh young men good: and that ſuch are Common-wealths
and States, as are the qualities and conditions of
the men which they do breed. Touching the body ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they did deuiſe to ſtrengthen and harden it with
conuenient and temperate exerciſes: as the play at ball,
leaping, running, danſing, riding, wraſtling, throwing the
barre, the ſtone or ſledge, and ſuch like. For the minde,
they thought beſt to ſtay and ſettle it ſelfe with the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of Muſike: and from theſe two they reſolued,
that two great good effects did enſue: From the firſt,
ſtrength of body and boldneſſe of ſpirit; and from the
latter, modeſty and temperance, inſeparable companions
for the moſt part vnto fortitude. For ſome of them were
of opinion, that our ſoules were compoſed of harmonie;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17081:75"/>
and beleeued that Muſike was able ſo to temper our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and paſſions, as they ſhould not farre or diſcord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelues, but be ſo interlaced the one with the
other in a ſweet conſent, as wel guided and ordered actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſhould proceed from the ſame, euen as ſweet and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Muſike proceedeth from the wel-tempering of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
voices, or well conſorted inſtruments. Neither
would they haue the one to be exerciſed, and the other
omitted: for that they thought, if yong men ſhould giue
themſelues onely to the exerciſes of the body, they wold
become too fierce and hardy; and ſo be rather hurtfull to
their commonweales then otherwiſe. And if they ſhould
follow onely Muſike, which is proper to reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and vſed as a recreation of the mind, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith,
they would become ſoft minded and effeminate. But by
ioyning both theſe faculties together in one, they ſought
to make a noble temper, and to induce a moſt excellent
habite, as well in the mind as in the body. So that if valor
were required for the defence of their countrey, or van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing
of their enemies, they were made fit and apt
thereunto by the exerciſes of the body; but with ſuch
meaſure and temper as ſhould not exceed. Which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and temper, they obtained from that harmonie
which Muſike imprinted in their mindes: vnder which
they comprehended not onely the ordering of the voice
and ſounds of inſtruments, but all other orderly and
ſeemely motions of the body; which vpon their ſtages,
or Scaenes in the acting of Tragedies, was chiefly to be
diſcouered. And that all orderly motions were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
vnder Muſicke, was held ſo certaine by <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,
Archetas, Plato, Cicero,</hi> &amp; other famous Philoſophers,
that they were of opinion, that the orderly courſe and
motions of the heauens could not be ſuch as it is, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17081:75"/>
without harmony, though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> do oppoſe him
ſelfe to their opinion. And for this cauſe did <hi>Lycurgus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
that Muſike ſhould be conioyned with the military
diſcipline of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> not onely to temper the
heate and furie of their minds in fight; but alſo to cauſe
them to vſe a certaine meaſure in that marching, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occaſions of war. In which reſpect they were wont
to battell without certaine pipes, according to the times
whereof they vnderſtood how to vſe their bodies and
weapons: from which reſpect alſo cometh our vſing of
drums and trumpets to giue ſouldiers knowledge when
to march, when to ſtand, when to aſſault, and when to
retire: and conſequently how to ioyne order and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
with their valour againſt the enemy: and the Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knight
and the Switzer vſe alſo the fife at this day with
the drum. And to ſay truth, great is the force of Muſike
skilfully vſed to ſtirre vp or to appeaſe the mind. For we
reade, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> finding a wanton yong man enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with luſt, ready to force the doore of an honeſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
he ſo calmed his mind, onely by changing the Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian
tune and number into the Spondean, that he gaue
ouer his wicked purpoſe. And <hi>Therpander,</hi> when a great
ſedition was raiſed among the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> he with his
muſike ſo quieted their mindes bent to fury, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
them to a perfect peace. It is alſo written of the
great <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was ſo moued by that tune and
nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Muſikes, which the greeks called <hi>Orthios nomos,</hi>
which was a kind of haughtie tune to ſtirre men to battel,
that he roſe from the boord to arme himſelfe, as if the
trumpet had ſounded the allarme. But what talke we of
the auncient opinions concerning the force of Muſike
to moue mens minds, when we find they beleeued that
their Gods were forced by the vertue of Muſike to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17081:76"/>
their wrath? For, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being infeſted
with a great peſtilence, <hi>Thales</hi> of <hi>Candia</hi> was ſaid by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſike
to haue mitigated their anger, and ſo to haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that mortality. The which thing <hi>Homer</hi> alſo
ſignified, when he ſaid, that the yongmen of Greece with
their ſongs did appeaſe <hi>Apollo</hi> his wrath, and cauſed the
plague to ceaſe which had infected their campe. And the
Romanes likewiſe being annoied with a great peſtilence,
receiued then firſt the ſinging of Satires into the Citie
though but rudely tuned then, as a remedy for that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
The force &amp; efficacie of muſike then being ſuch as I
haue declared, it is no maruel that the Aegiptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, after they
had once receiued it into their Commonwealth, as meet
for the inſtruction of their youth, wold neuer after allow
that it ſhold be altered or changed, but ſuch as it was whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they firſt admitted it, ſuch they continued it without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the ſpace of ten thouſand yeres, according to their
manner of contemplation, hauing a conceit or rather a
firme opinion that they could not alter muſike but with
danger to their State. Which opinion the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
likewiſe ſo embraced, that when <hi>Timotheus</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Muſition in Sparta, had preſumed to adde but one
ſtring to the Cyther, they baniſhed him out of the citie
and territories, as a violater of lawes, and a corrupter of
honeſt diſcipline. Albeit with <hi>Phrine</hi> they dealt more
mildly, who hauing added to the Cyther two cords, one
ſharpe, and another graue or flat, they onely cauſed him
to take them away againe, ſuppoſing that ſeuen ſtrings
were enough to temper the ſound thereof, as a number
comprehending all muſike; and that the increaſing therof
was but ſuperfluous and harmefull. Theſe ancient exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
&amp; conſiderations, are not ſleightly to be paſſed ouer:
for though many other occaſions of corruption in our
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17081:76"/>
age may be aſſigned; yet one of the principall, in the
iudgement of wiſe men, may wel be imputed to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of that corrupted muſike which is moſt vſed now a
dayes; carrying with it nothing but a ſenſuall delight to
the eare, without working any good to the mind at all.
Nay, would God it did not greatly hurt and corrupt the
mind. For as muſike well vſed is a great help to moderate
the diſorderly affections of the minde: ſo being abuſed
it expelleth all manly thoughts from the heart, and ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminateth
men, that they are little better then women:
and in women breedeth ſuch laſciuious and wanton
thoughts, that oftentimes they forget their honeſtie,
without which they cannot be worthy the name of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Not that I would hereby inferre, that muſike ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
were to be miſliked, or vnfit for women alſo: but
my meaning is of this wanton and laſciuious kind of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſike,
which is now a dayes moſt pleaſing, and reſembleth
the Lydian of old time, which <hi>Plato</hi> ſo abhorred, as he
would not in any ſort admit it into his Common-weale,
leſt it ſhould infect the minds of men and women both.
And from him may we learne what kinde of muſike he
would haue men to embrace, to ſtirre their mindes vp to
vertue, and to purge the ſame from vice and errour. Like
as alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his 8. booke of Politikes, taken per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
out of the writings of his maſter. But if that aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
kinde of muſike, framed and compoſed wholy to
grauitie, were now knowne and vſed, which kinde was
then ſet forth with the learned and graue verſes of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Poets, we ſhould now alſo ſee magnificall and high
deſires ſtipped vp in the minds of the hearers. Which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
contained the praiſes of excellent and heroicall perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages,
and were vſed to be ſung at the tables of great men
and Princes, to the ſound of the Lyra; whereby they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:17081:77"/>
the mindes of the hearers to vertue and generous
actions. For the force of Muſike with Poeſie, is ſuch, as is
of power to ſet the followers and louers thereof into the
direct way that leadeth them to their felicitie. <hi>Socrates</hi>
demaunding of the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> what he ſhould do
to make himſelfe happie: he was willed to learne Muſike;
whereupon he gaue himſelfe forthwith to the ſtudie of
Poeſie, conceiuing with himſelfe, that verſes and Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
numbers are the perfecteſt Muſike, and that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
like liuely ſparkes into mens minds, to kindle in them
deſires of dignitie, greatneſſe, honor, true praiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
and to correct whatſoeuer is in them of baſe
and vile affection. In auncient time therfore men cauſed
their children to be inſtructed in Poeſie before all other
diſciplines, for that they eſteemed good Poets to be the
fathers of wiſedome, and the vndoubted true guides to
ciuill life, and not without cauſe. For they raiſe mens
thoughts from humble and baſe things, ſuch as the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
and common ſort delight in, and make them bend
their endeuours wholy to high, yea heauenly things. As
who ſo liſt to attend diligently the excellencie of the
Pſalmes and Hymnes compoſed by the Kingly Prophet
<hi>Dauid,</hi> and others called the ſingers of the Hebrew
Church, ſhall eaſily diſcerne. But ſince our muſike is gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
now to the fulnes of wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and laſciuious paſſions,
and the words ſo confuſedly mingled with the notes,
that a man can diſcerne nothing but the ſound and tunes
of the voices, but ſence or ſentence he can vnderſtand
none at all; euen as it were ſundry birds chanting and
chirping vpon the boughes of trees: yong men are much
better in the iudgement of the wiſe, to abſtaine from it
altogether, then to ſpend their time about it. For as good
diſciplines are the true and proper nouriſhment of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:17081:77"/>
ſo are the euill the very poiſon of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid Captaine <hi>Carleil,</hi> as concerning the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the auncient muſike and ours in this age,
I do eaſily agree with you, and wiſh it were otherwiſe,
that we might ſee now a dayes thoſe wonderfull effects
of this excellent Art, which are written of it in auncient
authors. But where you ſo highly extoll the ſtudie of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſie,
you make me not a little to maruel, conſidering how
<hi>Plato,</hi> being ſo learned a man, did not onely make ſmall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation
thereof, but baniſhed it expreſly from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.</p>
            <p>Let not that ſeeme ſtrange vnto you, ſaid I: for <hi>Plato</hi>
condemned not Poeſie, but onely thoſe Poets that abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſo excellent a facultie, ſcribling either wanton toyes,
or elſe by fooliſh imitation taking vpon them to expreſſe
high conceirs which themſelues vnderſtood not. And
ſpecially did he reprehend thoſe Poets, who in their ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
did aſcribe to the Gods ſuch actions as would haue
bin vnſeemely for the moſt wanton and vicious men of
the world: as the adultery of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> thoſe of
<hi>Iupiter</hi> with <hi>Semele,</hi> with <hi>Europa,</hi> with <hi>Danaë,</hi> with <hi>Caliſto,</hi>
and many moe. Though ſome haue vnder ſuch fictions
ſought to teach morall and maruellous ſences, which <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
likewiſe in his ſecond <hi>Alcibiades</hi> declareth. But he bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
not thoſe Poets, who frame their verſes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
to the honor of God, and to good examples of
modeſtie and vertue. For in his books of Lawes he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
Poets to ſing Himnes to their Gods, and teacheth
the maner of their Chori in their ſacrifices, and to make
prayers for the Common-weale. Howbeit, to ſay truth,
though he ſo do, he would not haue it lawfull for euery
man to publiſh any compoſition that he had made, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the allowance and view of ſome magiſtrate elected
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17081:78"/>
in the citie for that purpoſe. Which magiſtracy he would
haue to be of no fewer in number then fiftie men of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
and wiſedome: of ſuch importance did he hold the
compoſitions of Poets to be. Which regard if it were had
now a dayes, we ſhould not ſee ſo many idle and profane
toyes ſpred abroade by ſome that think the prepoſterous
turning of phraſes, and making of rime with little reaſon,
to be an excellent kinde of writing, and fit to breed them
fame and reputation. Suppoſing (as men blinded in their
owne conceits) that they exceed all other writers, and
that from them only others that write in that kind ſhold
take their rules and example. So drowning their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
iudgements in their ignorance, that where they be
worthy blame, they eſteeme themſelues comparable to
the moſt famous and excellent Poets that euer wrote, and
that they ought to be partakers of their glory and greateſt
honors. But to men of iudgement, and able to diſcerne
the difference betweene well writing and preſumptuous
ſcribling, they miniſter matter of ſcorne and laughter,
when they conſider their diſioynted phraſes, their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen
figures, their ſhallow conceits lamely expreſſed,
and diſgraced, in ſtead of being adorned, with vnproper
and vnfit metaphors, well declaring how vnworthy they
be of the title of Poets. Such are they, who being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ful of intemperance and wantonnes, write nothing
but diſhoneſt and laſciuious rimes and ſongs, apt to root
out all honeſt and manly thoughts out of their mindes
that are ſo fooliſh as to loſe their time in reading of them.
Theſe indeed ought to be driuen out, and baniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al
Commonweales, as corrupters of manners, and infecters
of young mens mindes: who may well be compared to
rocks that lie hidden vnder water, amid the ſea of this our
life, on which, ſuch yong men as chance to ſtrike, are like
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17081:78"/>
to ſuffer ſhipwracke, and ſinking in the gulfe of luſt and
wantonneſſe, to be drowned and dead to all vertue. But
true Poeſie well vſed, is nothing elſe but the moſt ancient
kind of Philoſophie, compounded and interlaced with
the ſweetneſſe of numbers and meaſured verſes. A thing
(as ſaith <hi>Muſaeus)</hi> moſt ſweet and pleaſing to the mind,
teaching vs vertue by a ſingular maner of inſtruction, and
couering morall ſences vnder fabulous fictions: to the
end they might the ſooner be receiued vnder that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
forme, and yet not be vulgarly vnderſtood, but by
ſuch onely as were worthy to taſt the ſweetneſſe of their
inuentions. For ſo did the Philoſophers of old write
their myſteries vnder ſimilitudes, to the end they might
not be ſtraight comprehended by euery dul wit, and loſe
their reputation, by being common in the hands and
mouth of euery ſimple fellow. This maner firſt began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the wiſer Aegiptians, and was afterwards followed
by <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi> And <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> though he wrote
not by ſimilitudes and allegories, yet wrapt he vp his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
in ſo darke a maner of ſpeech and writing, as hardly
were they to be vnderſtood by thoſe that heard himſelfe
teach and expound his writings. But to make an end
with Poets, he that marketh thoſe fictions which <hi>Homer</hi>
hath written of their Gods, like as thoſe of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the heathen Poets, though at the firſt they ſeeme
ſtrange and abſurd; yet he ſhall find vnder them naturall
and diuine knowledge hidden to thoſe that are not wiſe
and learned: which neither time nor occaſion would, that
I ſhould here inſiſt vpon. Let it ſuffice that yong men are
to make great account of that part of Muſike which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
with it graue ſentences, fit to compoſe the mind to
good order by vertue of the numbers and ſound; which
part proceedeth from the Poets, whom <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17081:79"/>
the fathers and guides of thoſe that afterwards were
called Philoſophers. But this that by varietie of tunes,
and warbling diuiſions, confounds the words and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and yeeldeth onely a delight to the exterior ſenſe,
and no fruit to the mind, I wiſh them to neglect and not
to eſteeme.</p>
            <p>Indeed (ſaid captain <hi>Carleil)</hi> I agree with you, that our
muſike is far different from the ancient muſike, and that
well may it ſerue to pleaſe the eare: but I yeeld that it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminateth
the minde, and rather diuerteth it from the
way of bliſſe and felicitie, then helpeth him thereunto.
But are there not other diſciplines, beſides theſe two
which you haue ſpecified laſt, wherein yong men are to
be inſtructed to further them to the attaining of that end,
about which all this our diſcourſe is framed?</p>
            <p>Yes marry (ſaid I) and ſo far as youth is capable, it might
well be wiſhed that he had knowledge of them all. But
of theſe our author hath firſt ſpoken, ſuppoſing that from
Grammer, and ſuch other the liberall Arts, as thoſe firſt
yeares could reach to vnderſtand, he ſhould be ſtraight
brought to the excerciſe of the body and to Muſike. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles
it is requiſite withal, that, as his yeares increaſe,
he ſhould apply himſelfe without loſſe of time to learne
principally Geometry and Arithmetike, two liberal arts,
and of great vſe and neceſſitie for all humane actions in
this life; becauſe they teach vs meaſure and numbers, by
which, all things mans life hath need of are ordered and
ruled. For by them we meaſure land, we build, we deuiſe
Arts, and ſet them forth, all things are directed by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and meaſure, as occaſions ſerue: and without the help
of theſe two faculties, all would be confuſed and diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And therefore did the Aegyptians ſet their children
carefully to learne them: for that by them they decided
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:17081:79"/>
the diſcords and differences growing among the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
along the banks of the riuer of Nyle, which with her
inundations, and breaking of their meares and limits did
giue them often cauſe to fall at variance and ſtrife among
themſelues. For nauigation likewiſe how needfull they
are, all men do know, that know the neceſſitie of the vſe
thereof for humane life, ſince all that nature produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to all people and nations in the world particularly,
is thereby made common to all, with the helpe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
and of coyne. From theſe two alſo cometh the
exact knowledge, not onely of the earth and of the ſea,
but of the heauens likewiſe and of their motions, of the
ſtarres and courſe of time, of the riſing and ſetting of the
plannets: and to conclude all in few words, of the whole
frame and order of nature, and of her skill, by which ſhe
knitteth and vniteth together in peace and amitie things
in themſelues moſt contrary. All done ſo cunningly by
number and meaſure, as a whole yeares diſcourſe would
not ſerue to diſplay the ſame at large. The Art of warre
in like maner, ſo needful for States and Commonweales,
to keepe in due obedience ſtubborne and rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
and to repell the violence of forreine enemies, if it
were not directed by meaſure and number: what would
it be but a confuſion, and a moſt dangerous and harmfull
thing, which would ſoone fall from the reputation it hath
and euer had. For theſe conſiderations therefore and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is youth, that bendeth his courſe to vertue, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
it ſelfe in Geometry and Arithmetike, which in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times men would acquaint their children withall, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from their childhood: as Arts that haue more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
then any other. But they are not to be attained
without Logike, becauſe from it are gotten the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and the maner to deuide, to compound, to inuent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:17081:80"/>
and find out reaſons and arguments; and finally to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
and iudge of truth and falſhood. But here I muſt
tel you, that he meaneth not of that Logike which is vſed
now a dayes moſt in ſchooles, ſtanding for the moſt part
vpon brawlings and contentions, and propounding of
friuolous queſtions, ſeruing to nought elſe but ſubtilties,
and inextricable knots, fitter to nouriſh arguments then
to teach or explane the truth. Which abuſe <hi>Antiſthenes</hi>
miſliking, ſaid, it was meeter to inſtruct him that conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
then by contention to ouercome him. For Logike
being indeed the way and meane to inſtruct and teach,
and (as before is ſaid) the proper inſtrument of ſciences,
ſuch as learne it onely to contend, forſake the right end
and ſcope of that Art, and are as fruitleſſe to their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
or ſcholers, as myre is to the way faring man, which
beſides the defiling of his garments, doth oftentimes
make him alſo to fall. Therfore <hi>Plato</hi> in his time cried out
vpon the ſame, iudging it not without cauſe to be a meer
folly that hindred the knowledge of truth, and the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of thoſe things which the ſoundeſt and wiſeſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
taught as well touching vertuous and ciuill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as naturall and diuine ſciences: from which, this
vaine ſcience putteth men aſtray, ſo long as it teacheth
onely to argue and to contend. Whereby it commeth to
paſſe, that whiles they are more intentiue to the words
and circumſtances then to the matter, the more they
ſtriue to ſeeme learned and ſubtill, the leſſe they ſhew
themſelues to vnderſtand. Next to Logike is Rhetorike
to be placed, or the Art of Oratory, which <hi>Leontinus</hi> did
preferre before all other, becauſe it maketh it ſelfe Ladie
ouer mens minds, not by force or violence, but by their
owne conſents and free-will. And as <hi>Zeno</hi> expreſſed the
difference betweene theſe two Arts, by reſembling the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17081:80"/>
former to his hand cloſed, and the latter to his hand ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
out. So doth Rhetorike vſe arguments with leſſe
force and efficacie then Logike; yet fetcheth them from
Logike, as from a fountaine or well head, not to ſeek out
the truth exactly, but only to perſwade or diſſwade with
them that, which he thinketh moſt profitable for the
ſpeaker, or the perſon for whom he ſpeaketh. And of this
Art, haue all publike and priuate actions appertaining to
ciuill life need to perſwade what is good and profitable,
and to diſſwade what is hurtfull or vnprofitable, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
tumults and diſſentions, to treate of leagues and
peaces, to ſtirre vp the mindes of men to the defence of
their friends, their parents, their Prince and country, and
their Religion: to ſearch out and inueſtigate the truth of
all things, to aſſiſt the innocent and oppreſſed in courts
of iudgement, to accuſe the faultie and offenders: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to giue vnto vertue her due praiſe and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and vnto vice due blame and reproch. By theſe
meanes and ſtudies which we haue briefly touched, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then perfectly declared, ought a young man to be
framed to ciuill conuerſation, and inſtructed with all
carefulneſſe, that he may learne to bridle his concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deſires, his angry and diſordinate motions, occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the ſenſes, and ſtirred vp by thoſe two parts of the
minde, which are rebellious and contrary to reaſon:
whereby he may giue himſelfe wholy to honeſt and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
endeuours. And becauſe ſtore of wealth oft times
cauſeth young men (when they poſſeſſe it) to turne aſide
from vertue, becauſe riches is the nurſe of wantonneſſe
in thoſe yeares, great regard is to be had, that as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo farre as his ſtate requireth, is not to ſuffer his ſon
to want any thing that is neceſſary for his calling; ſo muſt
he take heede that he be not ſo fed with money, as fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17081:81"/>
therby his luſts and ſenſuall appetites, he may aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the good thoughts of vertue, and receiue in ſteed of
them the ſeeds of vnruly and diſorderly affections, which
of themſelues are by nature in youth much more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
then were fit, and need not to be holpen by plentie of
riches. For to giue a yong man money at will, to diſpoſe
as he liſt (vnleſſe the father find, as in ſome yong men it
happeneth, that he hath preuented his yeares with ſtaid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and diſcretion) is euen as much as to put a ſword
into the hands of a furious or mad man.</p>
            <p>By this the Sun was ſo farre declined towards our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
as all the companie thought it time to depart, that
they might before ſun-ſet reach to the citie.</p>
            <p>Wherfore ſir <hi>Robert Dillon</hi> riſing vp, ſaid: Howſoeuer
the latenes of the day call vs away, yet the deſire to heare
on further the diſcourſe of ſo good a matter, hath drawne
vs on in ſuch ſort, as we haue ſcarce perceiued how the
time is paſt. And for your ſecond feaſt, you haue right
daintily and plenteouſly entertained vs. We muſt now
expect the third, which to morow (God willing) we wil
not faile to come and accept: in hope that though we be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berſome &amp; troubleſome vnto you, yet as wel in regard
of diſcharging your promiſe, as of accompliſhing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of ſo many your friends, you will not thinke it much
to affoord vs your patience and your breath in deliuering
to vs the ſubſtance of your authors third dialogue of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
life; by which we may learne as much as he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of the Ethike part of Moral Philoſophie, teaching the
ready way for euery man in his priuate courſe of life to
attaine his felicitie, and that end, of which all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of yours hath had his beginning. And ſo taking
their leaue all together they departed.</p>

            <head>The third dayes meeting, and diſcourſe
of Ciuill life.</head>
            <p>I Was not yet fully apparelled on the next morrow,
when looking out of my window towards the citie,
I might perceiue the companie all in a troupe coming
together, not as men walking ſoftly to ſport, or deſirous
to refreſh themſelues with the morning deaw, and the
ſweete pleaſant ayre that then inuited all perſons to leaue
their ſluggiſh neſtes; but as men earneſtly bent to their
iorney, and that had their heads buſied about ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of greater moment then their recreation. I therefore
haſted to make me ready, that they might not find me in
caſe to be taxed by them of drowſineſſe, and was out of
the doores before they came to the houſe: where ſaluting
them, and they hauing courteouſly returned the good
morrow vnto me; the Lord Primate asked me whether
that company made me not afraide to ſee them come in
ſuch ſort vpon me being but a poore Farmer: for though
they came not armed like ſoldiers to be ceſſed vpon me,
yet their purpoſe was to coynie vpon me, and to eate me
out of houſe and home. To whom I anſwered, that as
long as I ſaw Counſellers in the companie, I neede not
feare that any ſuch vnlawful exactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as coynie ſhould be
required at my hand: for the lawes had ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
for the aboliſhing thereof. And though I knew
that among the Iriſhry it was not yet cleane taken away,
yet among ſuch as were ameynable to law, and ciuill, it
was not vſed or exacted. As for ſouldiers, beſides that
their peaceable maner of coming freed me from doubt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17081:82"/>
of ceſſe, thanked be God the ſtate of the realme was ſuch
as there was no occaſion of burthening the ſubiect with
them, ſuch had bin the wiſedome, valour and foreſight
of our late Lord Deputie, not onely in ſubduing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
ſubiects, but alſo in ouercoming the forreine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie:
whereby the garriſon being reduced to a ſmall
number, and they prouided for by her Maieſtie of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
at reaſonable rates, the poore husbandman might now
eate the labors of his owne hands in peace and quietnes,
without being diſquieted or harried by the vnruly ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</p>
            <p>We haue (ſaid ſir <hi>Robert Dillon)</hi> great cauſe indeed to
thanke God of the preſent ſtate of our country, and that
the courſe holden now by our preſent Lord Deputie,
doth promiſe vs a continuance, if not a bettering, of this
our peace and quietneſſe. My Lord <hi>Grey</hi> hath plowed
and harrowed the rough ground to his hand: but you
know that he that ſoweth the ſeede, whereby we hope
for harueſt according to the goodneſſe of that which
is caſt into the earth, and the ſeaſonableneſſe of times,
deſerueth no leſſe praiſe then he that manureth the land.
God of his goodneſſe graunt, that when he alſo hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
his worke, he may be pleaſed to ſend vs ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bayly to ouerſee and preſerue their labours, that this
poore countrey may by a wel-ordered and ſetled forme
of gouernement, and by due and equall adminiſtration
of iuſtice beginne to flouriſh as other Common-weales
do. To which all ſaying Amen, we directed our courſe
to walke vp the hill, where we had bene the day before;
and ſitting downe vpon the little mount awhile to reſt
the companie that had come from Dublin, we aroſe
againe, and walked in the greene way, talking ſtill
of the great hope was conceiued of the quiet of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17081:82"/>
countrey, ſince the forreine enemie had ſo bin vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and the domeſticall conſpiracies diſcouered &amp; met
withall, and the rebels cleane rooted out, till one of the
ſeruants came to call vs home to dinner. Where finding
the table furniſhed we ſate downe, and hauing ſeaſoned
our fare with pleaſant and familiar diſcourſes, as ſoone as
the boord was taken vp, they ſollicited me to fetch my
papers that I might proceede to the finiſhing of my laſt
diſcourſe of the three by me propoſed. But they being
ready at hand in the dining chamber, I reached them, and
layd them before me, and began as followeth. Hitherto
hath bin diſcourſed of thoſe two ages, which may for the
cauſes before ſpecified, be wel ſaid to be void of election,
and without iudgement, becauſe of their want of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
For which cauſe haue they had others aſſigned to
them, for guides to leade them to that end, which of
themſelues they were not able to attaine, that is, their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
in this life. And now being to ſpeake of that age
which ſucceeds the heate of youth; we muſt a litle touch
the varietie of opinions concerning the ſame. <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith,
that a citizen of Rome might be created Conſul (which
was the higheſt ordinary dignitie in that citie) when he
was come to the age of 23. yeares. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his <hi>Panegyrike</hi>
ſaith, that it was decreed <hi>lege Pompeia,</hi> that no man might
haue any magiſtracie before he were thirtie yeeres old.
And <hi>Vlpian, lege S. Digeſt.</hi> treating of honours, writeth,
that vnder the age of 25. yeares no man was capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
magiſtracie. Among theſe three opinions, the laſt of
the ciuill lawyer holdeth the <hi>medium,</hi> and is therefore the
fitteſt to be followed: for then is a young mans mind ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and he is become fit (being bred and inſtructed as
hath bin before declared) to be at his owne guiding and
direction: and then doth the ciuill law allow him libertie
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17081:83"/>
to make contracts and bargaines for himſelfe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could not do, being in pupillage and vnder a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
Howbeit our common law cutteth off foure yeeres
of thoſe, and enableth a yong man at 21. yeeres of age to
enter into his land, and to be (as we terme it) out of his
wardſhip. Which time being (I know not for what reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect)
aſſigned by our lawes, may well be held not ſo well
conſidered of, as that which the ciuill law appointeth, if
we marke how many of our yong men ouerthrow their
eſtates by reaſon of their want of experience, and of the
diſordinate appetites which maſter them: all which in
thoſe other foure yeares from 21. to 25. do alter to better
iudgement and diſcretion. Whereby they are the better
able to order their affaires.</p>
            <p>Why, ſaid Captain <hi>Dawtry,</hi> I haue knowne, and know
at this day ſome young men, who at 18. yeeres of age are
of ſounder iudgement and more ſetled behauiour, then
many, not of 25. yeeres old onely, but of many moe, yea
then ſome that are grey-headed with age.</p>
            <p>Of ſuch (ſaid I) there are to be ſeene oftentimes as you
ſay ſome, that beyond all expectation, and as it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the rules of nature, ſhew themſelues ſtayed in beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
and diſcreete in their actions when they are very
yong, to the ſhame of many elder men. Of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
I may well of mine owne knowledge, and by the
conſent I thinke of all men, name one as a rare example
and a wonder of nature, and that is ſir <hi>Philip Sidney;</hi> who
being but ſeuenteene yeeres of age when he began to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
and coming to Paris, where he was ere long ſworne
Gentleman of the chamber to the French King, was ſo
admired among the grauer ſort of Courtiers, that when
they could at any time haue him in their companie and
conuerſation, they would be very ioyfull, and no leſſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17081:83"/>
delighted with his ready &amp; witty anſwers, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſtoniſhed
to heare him ſpeake the French language ſo wel, and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hauing bin ſo ſhort a while in the countrey. So was he
likewiſe eſteemed in all places elſe where he came in his
trauell, as well in <hi>Germanie</hi> as in <hi>Italie.</hi> And the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Maieſtie employing him, when he was not
yet full 22. yeeres old, in Embaſſage to congratulate with
the Emperour that now is his comming to the Empire,
may ſerue for a ſufficient proofe, what excellencie of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and what ſtayedneſſe was in him at thoſe
yeeres. Whereby may well be ſaid of him the ſame that
<hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> to wit, that vertue was
come faſter vpon him then yeeres. Which <hi>Africanus</hi> was
choſen Conſull being abſent in the warres, by an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
conſent of all the tribes of Rome, before he was of age
capable to receiue that dignitie by the law. But theſe are
rare examples, vpon which rules are not to be grounded:
for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſo long ago ſaid, as we do now in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
prouerbe, that one ſwallow makes not ſummer. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
young men there are ſome diſcreete, ſober, quicke
of wit, and ready of diſcourſe, who ſhew themſelues ripe
of iudgment before their yeeres might ſeeme to yeeld it
them: ſo are there among aged men on the other ſide
ſome of ſhallow wit and little iudgement; of whom the
wiſeſt men of al ages haue eſteemed, that to be old with a
yong mans mind, is all one as to be yong in yeeres. For it
is not grey haires or furrowes in the face, but prudence
and wiſedome that make men venerable when they are
old: neither can there be any thing more vnſeemly, then
an old man to liue in ſuch maner as if he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but then to
liue; which cauſed <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to ſay, that it imported little
whether a man were young of yeeres or of behauiour.
Neuertheleſſe, becauſe dayly experience teacheth vs,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17081:84"/>
that yeares commonly bring wiſedome, by reaſon of the
varietie of affaires that haue paſſed thorough old mens
hands, and which they haue ſeene managed by other
men: and that commonly youth hath neede of a guide
and director, to take care of thoſe things which himſelfe
cannot ſee or diſcerne. Therefore haue lawes prouided
tutors for the ages before mentioned, vntill they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the yeers by them limited, &amp; thenceforth left men
to their owne direction, vnleſſe in ſome particular caſes
accidentall, as when they be diſtraught of their wits, or
elſe through extreme olde age they become children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
as ſometimes it falleth out. Knowledge then is the
thing that maketh a man meete to gouerne himſelfe; and
the ſame being attained but by long ſtudie and practiſe,
wiſe men haue therefore concluded, that youth cannot
be prudent. For indeed the varietie of humane actions,
by which, from many particular accidents, an vniuerſall
rule muſt be gathered; becauſe (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth) the
knowledge of vniuerſalities ſpringeth from ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
maketh knowledge ſo hard to be gotten, that many
yeares are required thereunto. And from this reaſon is it
alſo concluded, that humane felicitie cannot be attained
in yong yeares, ſince by the definition thereof it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
operation according to vertue in a perfect life: which
perfection of life is not to be allowed but to many yeers.
But the way vnto it is made ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by knowledge, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by the knowledge of a mans ſelfe. To which good
education hauing prepared him and made him apt, when
he is come to riper iudgement by yeares, he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
make choiſe of that way which ſhall leade him to the
ſame, as the moſt perfect end and ſcope of all his actions.
And this by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering wel of his own nature, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
annexed vnto it a ſpark of diuinitie, he ſhal not only
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17081:84"/>
as a meere earthly creature, but alſo as partaker of a more
diuine excellency, raiſe himſelf, &amp; haue perfect light to ſee
the ready way which leadeth to felicitie. To this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of himſelfe, ſo neceſſary for the purchaſing of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
felicitie, is Philoſophie a ſingular helpe, as being
called the ſcience of truth, the mother of ſciences, and the
inſtructor of all things appertaining to happie life: and
therefore ſhould yong men apply themſelues to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
thereof with all carefulneſſe, that thereby they may
refine their mindes and their iudgements, and find the
knowledge of his wel-nigh diuine nature, ſo much the
more eaſily. And as this knowledge is of all other things
moſt properly appertaining to humane wiſedome; ſo is
the neglecting thereof the greateſt and moſt harmefull
folly of all others: for from the ſaid knowledge (as from
a fountaine or well head) ſpring all vertues and goodnes;
euen as from the ignorance thereof ſlow all vices and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
that are among men. But herein is one ſpecial regard
to be had, which is, that ſelf loue cary not away the mind
from the direct path to the ſame: for which cauſe <hi>Plato</hi>
affirmed, that men ought earneſtly to pray to God, that
in ſeeking to know themſelues, they might not be miſled
by their ſelfe loue, or by the ouer-weening of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Spenſer</hi> then ſaid: If it be true that you ſay, by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie
we muſt learne to know our ſelues, how happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it, that the <hi>Brachmani</hi> men of ſo great fame, as you
know, in <hi>India,</hi> would admit none to be their ſchollers
in Philoſophy, if they had not firſt learned to know them
ſelues: as if they had concluded, that ſuch knowledge
came not from Philoſophie, but appertained to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
skill or ſcience.</p>
            <p>Their opinion (ſaid I) differeth not (as my author thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth)
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17081:85"/>
from the opinion of the wiſe men of Greece. But
that the ſaid <hi>Brachmani</hi> herein ſhewed the ſelfe ſame
thing that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth, which is, that a man ought
to make ſome triall of himſelfe before he determinate to
follow any diſcipline, that he may diſcerne and iudge
whether there be in him any diſpoſition wherby he may
be apt to learne the ſame or no. And to the ſame effect in
another place he affirmeth, that there muſt be a cuſtome
of wel-doing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wil learne to be vertuous, which
may frame in them an aptneſſe to learne, by making them
loue what is honeſt and commendable, and to hate thoſe
things that are diſhoneſt and reprochfull. For all men are
not apt for all things: neither is it enough that the teacher
be ready to inſtruct and skilfull, but the learner muſt alſo
be apt of nature to apprehend and conceiue the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that ſhall be giuen vnto him. And this knowledge
of himſelfe, is fit for euery man to haue before he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the ſtudie of Philoſophie, to wit, that he enter into
himſelfe to trie whether he can well frame himſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the diſcipline of this mother of ſciences, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
which is required in al thoſe things beſides, which
appertaine to honeſtie and vertuous life. For he that will
learne vertue in the ſchoole of Philoſophie, muſt not
bring a mind corrupted with falſe opinions, vices, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,
diſordinate appetites, ambitions, greedie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of wealth, nor wanton luſts and longings, with ſuch
like, which will ſtop his eares that he ſhall not be able to
heare the holy voice of Philoſophie. Therefore <hi>Epictetus</hi>
ſaid very well, that they which were willing to ſtudy Phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loſophie,
ought firſt to conſider well whether their veſſel
be cleane and ſweet, leſt it ſhould corrupt that which they
meant to put into it. Declaring thereby withall, that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
put into a vicious mind is dangerous. But this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17081:85"/>
of knowing a mans ſelfe, is not that which I ſpake of
before, though it be that which the ſayd Indian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
meant, and is alſo very neceſſary and profitable.
For to know a mans ſelfe perfectly, according to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
maner, is a matter of greater importance then ſo.
Which made <hi>Thales,</hi> when he was asked what was the
hardeſt thing for a man to learne, anſwer, that it was, to
know himſelfe. For this knowledge ſtayeth not at the
conſideration of this exteriour maſſe of our body, which
repreſents it ſelfe vnto our eyes, though euen therein alſo
may well be diſcerned the maruellous and artificiall han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-work
of Gods diuine Maieſtie, but penetrateth to the
examination of the true inward man, which is the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall
ſoule, to which this body is giuen but for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
here in this life. And this knowledge is of ſo
great importance, that man guided by the light of reaſon,
knoweth that he is, as <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> ſaith, a diuine miracle,
and therefore not made (as bruite beaſts are) to the belly
and to death, but to vertue and to eternall life, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he may vnite himſelfe at the laſt with his Creator and
maker of all things, when his ſoule ſhall be freed from
theſe mortall bands and fetters of the fleſh. Towards
whom neuertheleſſe, it is his part of raiſe himſelfe with
the wings of his thoughts euen whiles he is here in this
world, ſoaring aboue mortall things, bending his mind
to the contemplation of that diuine nature, the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
roote of all goodneſſe, the infallible truth, and the
aſſured beginning and foundation of all vertues. And
therefore ſaid <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that the ſcience of the ſoule was
profitable to the knowledge of all truth. Whereunto
may be added that which <hi>Plato</hi> and his followers haue
affirmed, to wit, that the ſoule knowing her ſelf, knoweth
alſo her maker; and diſpoſeth her ſelfe not onely to obey
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17081:86"/>
him, but alſo to become like vnto him: whereof in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place occaſion of further ſpeech will be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.
Moreouer, a man by knowing himſelfe, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in this life ſage and prudent, and vnderſtandeth
that he is made not to liue onely, as other creatures are,
but alſo to liue well. For they that haue not this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
are like vnto bruite beaſts: and he ſeeth likewiſe,
that nature, though ſhe produceth man not learned, yet
ſhe hath framed vs to vertue, and apt to knowledge.
And that a man is placed as a meane creature betweene
bruite beaſts and thoſe diuine ſpirits aboue in heauen,
hauing a diſpoſition to decline (if he liſt) to the nature
of thoſe bruite beaſts, and alſo to raiſe himſelfe to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of God himſelfe. Which things he weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and conſidering, he reacheth not onely to the
knowledge of himſelfe, but of other men alſo. And
by the guiding of Philoſophie, to direct himſelfe and
others to the well gouerning of himſelfe, of families,
and Common-wealths, to the making of lawes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
for the maintaining of vertue and beating
downe of vice; and finally to ſet men in the way to
their felicitie, by giuing them to vnderſtand, that they
onely are happie which be wiſe and vertuous, and
meete to be Lords and rulers ouer other men, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all things elſe created for the vſe of mankind. Of all
which things when they ſhall conſider man onely to be
the end, maruelling at his excellencie, they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to acknowledge how much they are bound to the
heauenly bountie and goodneſſe, for creating him ſo
noble a creature, and ſetting him ſo direct a courſe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting
ioy and felicitie. Hence groweth a deſire in
them of what is good, beautifull, and honeſt, and of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and to make themſelues like vnto their maker: who
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17081:86"/>
(as the <hi>Platonikes</hi> ſay) is the centre, about which all ſoules
capable of reaſon turne, euen as the line turneth about
the mathematicall point to make a circle: and ſo by good
and vertuous operations to purchaſe in this life praiſe
and commendation, and in the life to come eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.
Theſe were the men whom the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
accounted diuine, and the <hi>Platonikes</hi> called the images of
God.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid Captain <hi>Carleil,</hi> this your diſcourſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you haue ſhewed the importance and right meant of
knowing our ſelues, hath bin very wiſe &amp; fruitful, and fit
to declare how we ought to frame our life in this world.
But I make a doubt, whether all this that you haue layed
before vs to be done, be in our power or no? for it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
ſtrange, that, if it be in our power to giue our ſelues
to a commendable life, there be any (as we ſee there are
many) ſo peruerſe, and of ſo crooked iudgement, as to
bend themſelues to wickedneſſe and naughtie life, who,
when they might be vertuous, would rather chuſe to be
vicious. And this maketh me oftentimes to thinke that
the doing of good or euill is not in our power; but that
either deſtinie (which as <hi>Thales</hi> was wont to ſay) ruled
and maſtred all things, or the ſtarres with their influences
doth draw vs to do what we do.</p>
            <p>To this demaund of yours, ſaid I, you ſhal haue an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
ſuch as mine author maketh, who, as a Philoſopher
naturally diſcourſing of the actions of the ſoule, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his minde according to the ſentence of all Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.
But becauſe ſome part of your queſtion toucheth
a point now in controuerſie concerning Religion, it is
good we haue a ſafe conduct of my Lord Primate, that
his ſence as a Philoſopher may haue free paſſage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger of his cenſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:17081:87"/>
That ſhall you haue (ſaid my Lord Primate) with a
good will: for ſince we are here to diſcourſe of Morall
Philoſophie, we wil for this time put Diuinitie to ſilence,
ſo farre forth as your author ſay not any thing ſo repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the truth, as that it may breed any errour in the
minds of the hearers.</p>
            <p>Then (ſaid I) the demaund of Captaine <hi>Carleil</hi> hath
three ſeuerall points or articles: the one is, whether vertue
and vertuous actions be in our power or no? Another,
that it ſeemeth ſtrange, if vice &amp; vertue be in our power,
that any man ſhould be ſo ſenſleſſe as to apply himſelfe
to vice and forſake vertue. The laſt is, whether the good
or euill we do, proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the influence of the heauens,
or from neceſſitie of deſtinie, and not from our owne
free election. And my author beginneth with the laſt,
which he affirmeth to be moſt contrary to truth, and to
the excellencie of mans nature, proceeding thence to
the ſecond, and laſtly to the firſt. Therefore he ſaith, that
whoſoeuer holdeth mans will and election to be ſubiect
to the neceſſitie of deſtiny, deſtroyeth vtterly (according
to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> ſaying) all that appertaineth to humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
either in the care of himſelfe or of his family, or in
the ordering of lawes, and the vniuerſall gouernment of
Kingdomes and Common-weales, as well in peace as in
warre: for if it were ſo, what need haue men to do any
thing, but idly to attend what his deſtinie is to giue him
or to denie him, or to prouide for any of thoſe things
whereof our humane life hath neede. What difference
were there betweene the wiſe man and the foole, the
carefull and the rechleſſe, the diligent and the negligent?
The puniſhment of malefactors, and the rewarding of
wel-doers, ſhold be vniuſt and needleſſe. For euery thing
being done by the order of fatall diſpoſition, and not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17081:87"/>
by election, no man could either deſerue praiſe, or incurre
blame. Beſides, nature ſhould in vaine haue giuen vs the
vſe of reaſon, to diſcourſe or to conſult, or the abilitie to
will or chuſe any thing; for whatſoeuer were appointed
by deſtinie, ſhould of neceſſitie come to paſſe; and if of
neceſſitie, then neither prudence, counſell, nor election
can haue any place. And the vſe of free-will being ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from vs, we ſhould be in worſe ſtate and condition
then bruite beaſts; for they guided by inſtinct of nature,
bend themſelues to thoſe things whereunto their nature
inclineth them: whereas we notwithſtanding the vſe of
reaſon, ſhould be like bond-ſlaues, tied to what the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
of deſtinie ſhould bind vs vnto. This was the cauſe
why <hi>Chryſippus</hi> was worthily condemned among all the
auncient Philoſophers, for that he held deſtinie to be a
ſempiternal and vneuitable neceſſitie and order of things
which in maner of a chaine was linked orderly in it ſelf,
ſo as one ſucceeded another, and were fitly conioyned
together. By which deſcription of deſtinie appeereth,
that he meant to tie all things to neceſſitie. For albeit he
affirmed withall, that our mind had ſome working in the
matter, yet did he put neceſſitie to be ſo neceſſary, that
there could no way be found, whereby our mind might
come to haue any part. For to ſay that our mind or will
concurred, by willing or not willing whatſoeuer deſtinie
drew vs vnto, was nought elſe but a taking away of free
choice from our vnderſtanding or will, ſince our mind
like a bond-ſlaue was conſtrained to will, or not to will,
as deſtinie did inuite it, or rather force it. And like to this
were the opinions of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> of <hi>Parmenides,</hi> and of
<hi>Heraclitus,</hi> who ſubiected all things to neceſſitie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
no leſſe to be condemned then <hi>Chryſippus</hi> Prince
of the Stoikes. Among which, ſome there were, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:17081:88"/>
many things to happen by chance or fortune; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it appeared that it could not be true, that things came
by neceſſitie, leſt they ſhould denie a thing ſo manifeſt
to ſenſe, they ſuppoſed the beginnings and the endings
of things to be of neceſſitie, but the meanes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
they yeelded to be ſubiect to the changes and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
of fortune. And of this opinion was <hi>Virgil</hi> (as
ſome thinke) in the conducting of <hi>Aeneas</hi> into <hi>Italie.</hi> For
it ſhould ſeeme that he departed his country to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Italie</hi> by fatall diſpoſition, that he might get <hi>Lauinia</hi>
for his wife: but before he could arriue there, and winne
her, he was mightily toſſed and turmoyled by fortune;
which neuertheleſſe could neuer croſſe him ſo much, but
that in the end he obtained his purpoſe, which by deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
was appointed for him. But howſoeuer <hi>Virgil</hi> thought
in that point, which here need not to be diſputed, ſure I
am, that he in the greateſt part of his excellent Poeme, is
rather a <hi>Platonike</hi> then a <hi>Stoike.</hi> Howbeit ſome <hi>Platonikes</hi>
(as I thinke) were not farre different in opinion from the
<hi>Stoikes:</hi> for they ſay, that fortune with all her force was
not able to reſiſt fatall deſtinie. Though <hi>Plotinus</hi> thought
otherwiſe, and indeed much better, who anſwering them
that would needs haue the influence of ſtarres to induce
neceſſitie, prooued their reaſons to be vaine onely by an
ordinary thing in dayly experience: which is, that ſundry
perſons borne vnder one ſelf ſame conſtellation, are ſeene
neuertheleſſe to haue diuers ends and diuers ſucceſſes,
which they could not haue, if thoſe influences did worke
their effects of neceſſitie. And as for <hi>Epicures</hi> opinion,
which was, that the falling of his motes or <hi>Atomi</hi> ſhould
breed neceſſitie in our actions; he rather laughed at, then
confuted. Yea he was further of opinion, that not onely
humane prudence, and our free election, was able to reſiſt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17081:88"/>
the influences of the ſtarres, but that alſo our complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
our conuerſation and change of place might do the like:
meaning that the good admonitions, and faithfull aduice
and counſell of friends, is ſufficient to ouercome deſtinie,
and to free our mindes from the neceſſitie of fatall diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
Wherefore though it be granted that there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinie,
or that the ſtarres and heauens, or the order of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
haue power ouer vs to incline or diſpoſe vs more to
one thing then to another; yet is it not to be allowed that
they ſhall force vs to follow the ſame inclination or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
For though the heauens be the vniuerſall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
or beginning of all things, and by that vniuerſalitie
(as I may call it) the beginning of vs alſo according to
naturall Philoſophie; yet is it not the onely cauſe of our
being and of our nature: for to the making man, a man
muſt concurre, and ſo reſtraine this vniuerſall cauſe to a
more ſpeciall. And as the heauen, or the order of higher
cauſes, cannot ingender man without a man (ſpeaking
according to nature): ſo can they do nothing to bind the
free election of man without his conſent, who muſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
yeeld himſelfe to accompliſh that whereunto
the heauen or the order of cauſes doth bend and incline
him. And if we haue power to maſter our complexion,
ſo, as being naturally inclined to luſt, we may by heed and
diligence become continent; and being couetous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
liberall (though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſay, that couetiſe is as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
a diſeaſe of the mind, as the Dropſie or Ptiſike is
to the body): what a folly is it to beleeue that we cannot
reſiſt the inclinations of the ſtars, which are cauſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vs, and not the onely cauſes of our being; but haue
need of vs, if they will bring forth their effects in vs? The
beginning of all our operation is vndoubtedly in our
ſelues: and all thoſe things that haue the beginning of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17081:89"/>
their working in themſelues, do worke freely and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily.
And conſequently we may by our free choiſe and
voluntarily giue our ſelues to good or to euill, and maſter
the inclination of the heauens, the ſtarres, or deſtinie,
which troubleth ſo much the braines of ſome, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
of nature they will needes make themſelues bond
being free: whom <hi>Ptolomie</hi> doth fitly reprehend, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the wiſe man ouer-ruleth the ſtarres. For well
may the heauens or the ſtars, being corporall ſubſtances,
haue ſome power ouer our bodies, but ouer our mindes
which are diuine, ſimple, and ſpirituall ſubſtances, can
they haue none: for betweene the heauens &amp; our minds
is no ſuch correſpondence, that they may againſt our wils
do ought at all in our minds which are wholy free from
their influences, if any they haue. And therefore do the
beſt of the <hi>Platonikes</hi> ſay very wel, that man muſt oppoſe
himſelfe againſt his deſtinie, fighting to ouercome the
ſame with golden armes and weapons, to wit, vertues,
which is (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) the gold of the mind. For he that
behaueth himſelfe well, that is to ſay, ruleth wel his mind
or ſoule, which is the true man indeed, as we haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſhewed, ſhall neuer be abandoned to deſtinie or
fortune: againſt which two powers mans counſell and
wiſedome reſiſteth in ſuch ſort, if he ſet himſelf reſolutely
thereunto, as it may wel appeere that he is Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
ouer his owne actions. Neither without cauſe did
<hi>Tully</hi> ſay, that fatall deſtinie was but a name deuiſed by
old wiues, who not knowing the cauſes of things, as
ſoone as any thing fell out contrary to their expectation,
ſtraight imputed it to deſtinie; ioyning thereunto ſuch a
neceſſitie, as it muſt needs (forſooth) force mans counſell
and prudence. A thing moſt falſe, as hath bin declared.
Is it not ſaid in the Scripture, that God created man, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17081:89"/>
left him in the power of his owne counſell? How then
doth <hi>Menander</hi> ſay, that men did many euils compelled
by neceſſitie? I meane not by neceſſitie, as commonly we
do, want or pouertie, but by neceſſitie of deſtinie. We
may then conclude, that our will and election is free, and
that it is in our power to follow vice or vertue. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
true it is that man may abuſe this his libertie, and
of a free man make himſelfe bond if he will: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do the <hi>Platonike</hi> ſay, that a good and a wel-minded
man doth all his actions freely; but that if he giue himſelf
to do euill, forſaking the light of reaſon, he becommeth a
bruite beaſt, and looſeth the diuine gift of his libertie:
for thenceforth doth he work no more freely of himſelf,
but yeeldeth his minde, which ought to be the Lord of
our libertie, ſlaue to the two baſeſt parts of the ſoule, and
then reigneth no more the reaſonable ſoule, but the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,
which maketh him abandon the care of the minde,
and onely to attend the pleaſures of the body, as brute
beaſts doe.</p>
            <p>Hitherto (ſaid my Lord Primate) I find nothing to be
miſliked in your diſcourſe, which (as a Philoſopher) is
declared according to morall reaſon. But, as a Chriſtian,
what ſayth your author to Gods predeſtination? Is it not
neceſſary, that whatſoeuer God hath determined of vs
from the beginning in his fore-knowledge (being the
moſt certaine and true knower of all things) ſhall come
to paſſe?</p>
            <p>This is (ſaid I) no ſmall queſtion to be fully anſwered,
and being alſo not very pertinent to the matter we haue
in hand (being meerely morall) my author medleth not
with the particular points of the ſame: onely hereof he
ſaith, that <hi>Euripides</hi> had little reaſon to ſay, that God had
care of greater things, but that he left the care and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17081:90"/>
of the leſſer to fortune. For we are bound by holy
writ to beleeue (and ſome of the auncient Philoſophers
haue likewiſe ſo thought) that there moueth not a leafe
vpon a tree, nor falleth a haire from our heads, but by the
will of God. Whereupon the holy Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayd,
that God dwelleth on high, and beholdeth the things
that are humble in heauen and in earth. And the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetikes</hi>
ſeemed to conſent thereunto, when they ſayd,
that the heauenly prouidence foreſeeing that the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
were not apt to preſerue themſelues eternally, had
therfore ordained that they ſhould be continued in their
vniuerſalities, which are the ſeuerall kinds or <hi>ſpecies,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
vnder them the particulars, which of themſelues
are mortal and periſhable, but are made perpetual in them
through generation. He ſayth alſo, that predeſtination is
an ordinance or diſpoſition of things in the mind of God
from the beginning, of what ſhal be done by vs in this life
through grace. But he thinks not that it tieth our free wil,
but that they go both together; that our well doing is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
and pleaſing to God, and our euil deeds diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and offenſiue to his diuine Maieſtie: and that for the
good we ſhall receiue reward, and puniſhment for the
euill. The further diſcuſſing whereof appertaining rather
to Diuines then Morall Philoſophers, he thinketh fit to
referre vnto them, and to beleeue that this is one of thoſe
ſecrets which God hath layed vp in the treaſury of his
mind, whereunto no mortall eye or vnderſtanding can
reach or penetrate, humbling our ſelues to his holy will,
without ſearching into that which we cannot approch
vnto. And if <hi>Socrates</hi> in that time of darkneſſe and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
of the heathen could exhort men to aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
that God hauing created them, wold haue no leſſe
care of them, then a good and iuſt Prince would haue of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17081:90"/>
his ſubiects: how much more are we to beleeue that our
heauenly Lord and God Almightie, who hath ſent his
onely begotten Sonne to redeeme vs from the bondage
of Sathan, doth diſpoſe and ordaine of vs as is beſt for vs,
and for the honor of his diuine Maieſtie. For as they are
to be commended that referre themſelues humbly to
whatſoeuer he hath determined of them, doing their beſt
endeuours to purchaſe his grace and fauour: ſo are they
to be miſdoubted, who ouer-curiouſly will needes take
vpon them the iudgment of Gods predeſtination or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
And that ſentence cannot but be very good,
which ſayeth, that <hi>he that made thee without thee, will not
ſaue thee without thee.</hi> For were a man certaine to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
yet ought he not to do otherwiſe then well, becauſe
he is borne to vertue and not to vice: which the very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
by the onely light of reaſon could well perceiue. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it is thoght, that al they, that are ſigned with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Chriſt in baptiſme, may ſtedfaſtly beleeue that
they are predeſtinated and choſen to ſaluation: not that
our predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giueth vs a neceſſitie of wel doing, but
becauſe we hauing the grace of God to aſſiſt vs, diſpoſe
our ſelues by the ſame grace to keep his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements
for our ſaluation, and for the honor and glory of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie:
whereas by doing otherwiſe it is our owne wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
that excludeth vs from that bliſſe. And further
mine author ſaith not.</p>
            <p>In good ſooth (ſaid ſir <hi>Robert Dillon)</hi> this ſeemeth to
me to be well and Chriſtian like ſpoken. For he that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
not ſo great a gift from God, being a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
marke or token by which we are diſtinguiſhed from
brute beaſts, who wanting the vſe of reaſon, can haue no
free election, is not onely vnthankfull, but doth fooliſhly
thruſt himſelfe into the number of vnreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17081:91"/>
while he will needs depriue himſelf of that he hath
ſpecially different from them. Neither doth the reuerent
regard to Gods prouidence impeach our free wil: which
prouidence the <hi>Platonikes</hi> partly vnderſtanding, affirmed
(as I haue heard) that it did not alter or change the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things, but guided and directed deſtinie: impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
no neceſſitie of doing good or euill vpon vs. And if
any it did impoſe, it ſhould be onely to good, and neuer
to euill. For what is diuine muſt needes worke diuinely,
and diuine working can produce none but good effects.
Wherefore they concluded that our election was not
conſtrained by Gods prouidence. This they confirmed
by common experience. For (ſayd they) if prouidence
tie things to neceſſitie, then chance or fortune can haue
no place in the actions of men. But we ſee dayly many
things maturely debated, which ſhould by the naturall
and ordinary courſe of cauſes haue a determinate and
certaine end, yet miſſe their effect whereunto they are
ordained, and another produced which was neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
which is the proper worke of fortune. I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
heard ſome Diuines ſay, that it ſhould ſeeme ſtrange,
if wiſe &amp; prudent men in this world by their prouidence
and foreſight, ſeek euermore to bring perfection to thoſe
things which are vnder their gouernement, God contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe
(who is the fountaine of all wiſdome &amp; prudence,
and the true and abſolute preſeruer and conſeruer of all
things by him produced) ſhould not giue perfections
and continuance through his prouidence to ſo ſingular
a gift giuen vnto man aboue all other creatures of the
earth, but ſhold ſuffer it to periſh, to bind vs to ſeruitude.
And that if his prouidence ſhould tie our free will to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie,
he ſhould do that which is contrary to his owne
nature: for that therby he ſhould take from vs the reward
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17081:91"/>
of vertue, ſince doing well by neceſſitie, we could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
neither praiſe nor recompence; he ſhould alſo take
from vs all counſell and deliberation, which is needleſſe
and ſuperfluous in all things, that of neceſſitie muſt come
to paſſe: and laſtly iuſtice it ſelfe, whereby malefactors
are puniſhed, if conſtrained by neceſſitie they did wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly,
for then were their puniſhment vniuſt: which
made S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſay, that God would neuer damne a
ſinner, vnleſſe he found that he had ſinned voluntarily.
We may therefore (as I think) conclude, that being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God, and endowed with ſo excellent a gift, as free
choice and election, which, beſides the place of Scripture
aboue mentioned, is confirmed by another, where it is
ſaid, that God ſet before man life and death, good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
that he might take whether he liſt to chuſe; he by his
diuine foreſight doth rather giue perfection thereunto,
then take it from vs. Yet the particular conſideration and
debating of this matter being fitter for Diuines then for
vs, let vs leaue the ſcanning of it to them, and be content
like men ſeeking by the rules of Morall Philoſophie to
find the ready way to humane felicitie in this life, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
our ſelues in that point to the mercifull goodneſſe
of Almightie God. And therefore (I pray you) proceed
to the reſt of your diſcourſe, and ſhew vs the cauſe why
ſo many giue themſelues rather to vice then to vertue,
when they may do otherwiſe, which your author ſaid
he would declare in the ſecond place.</p>
            <p>So ſhall I (quoth I) and for the reſoluing of the ſame,
you ſhal vnderſtand that <hi>Plato</hi> was of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that no man
willingly was wicked, becauſe the habite of vice was not
voluntarily receiued by any man. And for confirmation
of this his opinion, this reaſon he made: as vertue (ſayd
he) is the health of the mind, ſo is vice the infirmitie of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17081:92"/>
the ſame: and as the body receiueth willingly his health,
and ſickneſſe againſt his will; euen ſo the mind receiueth
willingly vertue as his health, and vice vnwillingly; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that thereby it becometh ſicke and infected. But <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi>
aſſigned another reaſon, not needfull here to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed.
Now <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was of another mind, for he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that man had free will by his owne choice and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>How can man voluntarily embrace vice (ſaid M. <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)</hi>
which of all things is the worſt, ſince the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſaith, that al men couet what is good, and ſince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vertue there can be no good.</p>
            <p>Theſe two ſayings (ſaid I) are not contradictory: for
the moſt wicked man aliue deſireth what is good: and if
vice ſhould ſhew it ſelfe in his owne proper forme, he is
ſo vgly and ſo horrible to behold, that euery man would
flie from him: therefore knowing how deſeruedly he
ſhould be hated and abhorred, if he were ſeene like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he preſents himſelfe vnder the ſhape of goodneſſe,
and hiding all his il fauoured face, deceiueth the ſenſitiue
appetite; which being intiſed by the falſe image of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
is ſo ſeduced, and through the corruption of his mind
and iudgement, by the ill habit, contracted from his child
hood, he embraceth that which (if his iudgement were
ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) he wold neuer do. Wherfore <hi>Plato</hi> his meaning was
(as it may be thought) that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was willingly vicious,
ſince, euill couering it ſelfe vnder the cloke of goodneſſe,
he was induced to do euill, thinking to do good: and ſo
the opinions of both Philoſophers concurre. But <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
by the report of <hi>Ariſtotle, lib. 8. Ethicor.</hi> aſſigneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
cauſe, to wit, that ill doing is an infinite thing, and
that by a thouſand wayes men are led to wickednes and
vicious actions, all eaſie to be taken: but to vertue there is
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17081:92"/>
but one onely way, and the ſame ſo enuironed and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the bypaths that guide men to vice, as it muſt
needs be hard to keepe it without entring into ſome of
the by-wayes leading to vice and errour. For the eye that
is not made cleere ſighted by Philoſophie, is not able to
diſcerne that way from the reſt.</p>
            <p>It ſhold ſeeme (ſaid M. <hi>Dormer)</hi> by this, that ignorance
is the cauſe of well doing, and not mans choice or electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for where ignorance is, it may be ſaid there is no ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Not ſo (ſaid I) if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be to be beleeued, who ſaith
that ignorance ſo farre foorth as it concerneth mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is of two ſorts: the one is, when a man doth ill, not
through ignorance, but ignorantly: the other is, when he
doth it of meere ignorance, becauſe he neither knoweth
nor might know that ſuch an action was euill. In the firſt
caſe, are thoſe that are haſtie &amp; cholerike, and drunkards:
for though they knew before, that haſtineſſe and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe
be euill, yet when the heate of choler, or the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
appetite of wine blindeth them, they erre igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly,
but not of ignorance. In the latter are they that
fall through meere ignorance, not knowing that what
they do is euill. As if a Prince make a reſtraint or prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that no man vpon paine of death ſhall enter into his
Forreſt to hunt there, and a ſtranger not knowing this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
cometh thither with his hounds to hunt, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
time haply he had done. This ſtranger breaketh the
will of the Prince, and committeth a fault, but altogether
through ignorance, becauſe he had no knowledge of the
prohibition. But if a haſtie man knowing of the reſtraint,
purſuing his enemy in his rage, or a drunken man, when
wine hath made him not to diſcerne his way, entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that forreſt, haue his dog following him, and the dog
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17081:93"/>
kill a Deere; his fault though it be ignorantly committed
ſhould not be through ignorance. And as the ſtranger,
being ſorie for his offence, and thereby ſhewing that he
meant not to breake the Princes commaundement, were
worthy pardon: euen ſo the other were iuſtly to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
ſince knowing the penaltie threatned to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
he would not bridle his furie, or abſtaine from wine,
but by following his paſſion or vnruly appetite, incurre
the danger of the ſame. And as the one may well be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to haue made a fault againſt his wil; ſo may the other
be deemed to haue wilfully broken the commandement.
In which latter caſe of ignorance are all they that be vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or wicked, who through the ill habite which they
haue made in vice, do any act contrary to law and the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
ſocietie of men, for which they deſerue to be adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
wilfully euill, and by their owne free choice and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
For all men ought to know thoſe things that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
are to be knowne, touching honeſt and ciuil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation;
and if they do not know them when they do il,
it is becauſe they chuſe not to know that which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for them to know. In which reſpect it is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that who ſo for want of knowing this generalitie
will do amiſſe, ſhould be eſteemed wicked by his owne
free wil and election. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid very fitly, that ſuch men
did in the mids of the cleere light make darknes to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
And this is that ignorance which <hi>Plato</hi> calleth the
defiling of the ſoul. Let vs ſuppoſe that there may be one
that knoweth not adultery to be ſin or vice, and that in
ignorance committeth adultery; ſhal we ſay he deſerueth
to be excuſed? God forbid: for he is cauſe of his owne
ignorance, ſince it is in his power and in the power of all
reaſonable men to know what is fit and honeſt for vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life; and that the ſame is made knowne, as well by
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17081:93"/>
Gods law, as by the ordinances and cuſtomes of man, to
all thoſe that will not wittingly hood-winke themſelues.
Wherefore it is a wilfull ſin committed by free election,
and worthy puniſhment as a voluntary offence. And S.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayed not without cauſe, that all ignorance
was not worthy pardon, but onely that of ſuch men as
had no meanes to attaine knowledge or learning: but
they that haue teachers to inſtruct them, and for want of
ſtudie and diligence abide in their ignorance, and ſo do
euill, are not onely vnworthy excuſe, but deſerue alſo
ſharpe puniſhment. So in another place he ſayth, that no
man is puniſhed for that which naturally he knowes not:
as the child for that he cannot ſpeake, or becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reade. But when he will not ſet his mind to learne as
he ought, being of yeeres, and vrged thereunto, he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to be chaſtiſed, becauſe it is in euery mans power
to be able to learne all that is neceſſary for him to know
how to liue well, and what things are to be embraced as
good, and what to be eſchewed as euill: and he that
will not learne them, remaineth wilfully in his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Yea but if I ſhould chance (ſaid Captaine <hi>Dawtrey)</hi> to
be abroade with my bow and arrowes, and perceiuing
ſomewhat to ſtirre in a buſh, ſhould ſhoote thereat, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
it to be a Deere or ſome other game, and ſhould
ſo kill my wife that were hidden there, as <hi>Cephalus</hi> did,
ſhould not my ignorance in that caſe excuſe me?</p>
            <p>This caſe (ſaid I) appertaineth to the ſecond part of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
already ſpoken of, which is about the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the particular things, the ignorance whereof
deſerueth excuſe, and ſo ſhould this. But this ignorance
ſhould become wilfull wickedneſſe, if when you ſaw
you had ſlaine your wife, intending to kill a Deere, you
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17081:94"/>
were not heartily ſory therefore, but rather glad to be ſo
rid of her: and ſo farre ſhould you then be from excuſe,
that you ſhould deſerue to be ſeuerely puniſhed for the
fact. Much like to the caſe of <hi>Cephalus</hi> was that of <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi>
but more miſerable, in ſlaying of <hi>Atys</hi> the ſonne of
<hi>Croeſus</hi> King of <hi>Lidia.</hi> For <hi>Croeſus</hi> hauing giuen in charge
to <hi>Adraſtus</hi> his ſonne, and they being one day gone to
hunt a great wild Bore that did great harme in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
accompanied with many yong gentlemen of <hi>Lidia,</hi>
whiles the Bore was ruſhing forth, <hi>Adraſtus</hi> threw a dart
at him, and <hi>Atys</hi> comming by chance in the way, the dart
hit him and ſlew him. Now though <hi>Atys</hi> were the only
ſonne of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> and were ſlaine by the hand of him that
had him in charge; yet finding that it was done by meere
miſchance and through ignorance, and knowing how
grieuouſly <hi>Adraſtus</hi> ſorrowed for the ſame, he not onely
freed him of any puniſhment therefore, but frankly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
him. And the repentance of the fact might haue
ſufficed the doer; but he ouercome with extreme griefe
ſlew himſelfe at the funerall of the dead young Prince,
being vnable to beare with a ſtout courage the anguiſh
and vexation of minde that his miſhappe did breed him.
But this ſhewed <hi>Adraſtus</hi> to be rather faint-hearted and
weake of minde, then otherwiſe: for the purchaſing of
death to auoyde griefe or any other annoyance of the
mind, is not the part of a valorous and couragious man,
as the beſt among the ancient Philoſophers haue alwaies
held. And becauſe we know by the rule of Chriſt, that it
is no matter diſputable, it needeth not that thereof any
further words be made.</p>
            <p>You ſay well (ſaid my Lord Primate) and I know that
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is of minde, that it is a vile act for a man to kill
himſelfe to auoyde ignominie or afflictions. But to omit
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17081:94"/>
the iudgement of the auncient Romanes, who held it the
part of a ſtout heart, for a man to kill himſelfe rather then
to ſuffer ſhame or ſeruitude, as we reade that <hi>Cato</hi> did, and
<hi>Caſsius</hi> and <hi>Brutus:</hi> yet it ſeemeth that <hi>Plato,</hi> whom your
author determined to follow as well as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<hi>Socrates</hi> (in his dialogue intituled <hi>Phoedon)</hi> to ſay,
that a Philoſopher ought not to kill himſelfe, vnleſſe God
lay a neceſſitie of doing it vpon him. Out of which words
it may well be gathered, he thought that not onely the
common ſort, but euen Philoſophers themſelues, when
neceſſitie conſtraineth them, might ridde themſelues of
their life.</p>
            <p>That place (ſaid I) is aduiſedly to be examined: for
<hi>Socrates</hi> there meant not that any man willingly ſhould
lay violent hands vpon himſelfe; but if there be no
remedy but that die he muſt, and that diuers kindes of
deaths are propoſed vnto him, he may chuſe that kind
which is leſſe noyſome to him or leſſe grieuous: as <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
choſe to die with the iuice of hemlocks, and <hi>Seneca</hi> by
the opening of his veines.</p>
            <p>You may haply conſter that meaning out of that place
(ſaid my Lord Primate): but what will you ſay to that
which is in his bookes of the Common-weale, where he
writeth, that a man ſicke of any grieuous or long infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
when he ſhall ſee himſelfe out of hope to procure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie,
he ſhould then make an end of his life.</p>
            <p>To that place I ſay (quoth I) that it is to be conſidered
how <hi>Plato</hi> ſought to frame his Common-wealth in ſuch
ſort as it ſhould be rather diuine then humane: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the citizens of the heauenly Common-wealth
liue in continuall happineſſe and contentment, without
feeling any annoyance or moleſtation at all: euen ſo was
his purpoſe, that the citizens of his Common-wealth
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17081:95"/>
ſhould haue no grieuance, paine or moleſtation among
them: but in an ordinary humane Common-wealth
he would not haue ſet downe any ſuch precept.</p>
            <p>You haue ſalued that ſore reaſonable well alſo (ſayed
my Lord Primate) though there might be obiections
made againſt your anſwer. But how will another place of
his be defended, which is in his booke of Lawes, where
he ſayth, that whoſoeuer hath committed any offence in
the higheſt degree, and findeth, that he hath not power
to abſtaine from the like eftſoones, ought to rid himſelfe
out of the world.</p>
            <p>The anſwer to that (ſaid I) is eaſie: for <hi>Plato</hi> his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
therein is, that whoſoeuer is wickedly giuen, and of
ſo euill example as there is no hope of his amendment,
ſhould rather kill himſelfe, then by liuing inuite ſo many
others to the like courſe of life: not vnlike to the opinion
alreadie recited, that it is better one die for a people, then
that his life ſhould be the occaſion of the death of many.
For <hi>Plato</hi> aymed euermore at the purging of all cities fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſuch caterpillers; which appeereth manifeſtly by the pain
he would haue inflicted vpon parricides. But that it
was abhomination to him for a man to kill himſelfe, he
plainely ſheweth in his ninth booke of Lawes, by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
he ſetteth downe againſt ſuch men. Neuertheleſſe
this indeed may be found in <hi>Plato,</hi> that vice was ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
vnto him, that he would rather haue a man to die,
then to vndertake any vile &amp; vicious action, which might
breed him perpetuall infamie. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in this point
agreeth with his maſter (though in many he delight to
carpe him) that a man ought to chuſe rather to die then
commit any abhominable or grieuous fact, or do that
which might be for euer reprochful vnto him. And <hi>Plato</hi>
his expreſſe ſence of this matter, is to be vnderſtood in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17081:95"/>
the ſame dialogue which you firſt ſpake of, where <hi>Socrates</hi>
is brought to ſay, that the Lord and Ruler of this whole
world hauing ſent vs into this life, we are not to deſire to
leaue it without his conſent: and who ſo doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
offends nature, offendeth God. And this is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of that precept of <hi>Philolaus,</hi> which forbiddeth a man
to cleaue wood in the high way: meaning that a man
ſhould not ſeuer or deuide the ſoule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, whiles
he was in his way on this earthly pilgrimage; but ſhould
be content, that as God and nature had vnited and tied
the ſoule to the bodie, ſo by them it might be vnlooſed
againe: therefore the <hi>Peripatetikes</hi> alſo thought, that they
which die a violent death, cannot be thought to haue
ended their dayes according to the courſe of time and
nature. And with this my Lord Primate reſted ſatisfied. I
turned me to Captaine <hi>Carleil,</hi> and ſayd: Now (ſir) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
your doubts propoſed, you may haue percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that whatſoeuer deſtinie be, neither it, nor the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
prouidence of Almightie God impoſeth any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
vpon vs: that vertue and vice are in our power, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
growing in vs by the right vſe of our free choice, and
vice by the abuſe of the ſame, when through corruption
of the iudgement to do that is in apparance good, it chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the euill: and laſtly what kind of ignorance is excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and which not.</p>
            <p>Concerning my demaunds (ſayd Captaine <hi>Carleil)</hi> I
am reſolued. But ſince I ſee our doings proceed from ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
I would gladly know of you what maner of thing
it is; for I cannot perceiue whether it be a deſire, or an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or an opinion, or what I ſhould call it.</p>
            <p>None of all theſe (ſaid I) but rather a voluntary deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
following a mature and aduiſed counſel: which
counſell by <hi>Plato</hi> was termed a diuine thing. For election
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17081:96"/>
is not made in a moment; but when a thing is propoſed
either to be accepted or refuſed, there muſt firſt be a
counſell taken, reſpecting both the end of the action, and
the meanes by which the ſame is to be compaſſed: ſo as
there is required a time of conſultation: and therefore it
is ſaid, that haſt is enemie to counſell, and that oftentimes
repentance followes them that reſolue without diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
or debating of matters. Next vnto counſell cometh
iudgement, and after iudgement followeth election, and
from election iſſueth the action or the effects that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
vpon, and accepted as the beſt. And becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
(though ſhe be a cauſe rather by accident then of
her ſelfe) hath no ſmall part in moſt of our actions, the
wiſeſt men haue ſaid, that counſel is the eye of the mind,
by helpe whereof, men of prudence ſee how to defend
themſelues from the blind ſtrokes of fortune, and eſchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which may hurt them, take hold of that which is
profitable.</p>
            <p>Why then (ſaid my Lord Primate) it ſhold ſeeme that
our counſell were wholy in our power. But <hi>Xenophon</hi> is
of a contrary opinion: for he ſayeth, that good counſell
cometh from the Gods immortall, and that their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
proſper who haue them to be their friends, and theirs
not, who haue them to be their enemies.</p>
            <p>To haue God fauourable vnto vs (ſaid I) in all our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
is not onely deſirable, but that it may pleaſe him to
grant his grace ſo to be, ought all men to craue by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
prayer at his hands. But that God is the author of our
counſels otherwiſe then as an vniuerſall cauſe, is to be
doubted: not that the ſingular gift of the mind, and the
power thereof to deliberate and conſult, commeth not
from him; for the not acknowledging thereof, were not
onely a groſſe ignorance, but alſo an expreſſe impietie,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17081:96"/>
&amp; an vnexcuſable ingratitude. Howbeit ſince it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him to beſtow vpon vs ſo great and liberal a gift as the
mind, we may well beleeue that he will not take from vs
the free vſe therof. For to ſay that God were the imediate
cauſe of our counſell, were as much as to take from vs the
vſe of reaſon, without which we are not any more men,
as of late was ſayd. And therfore beſides <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
grounded in that point vpon good reaſon, we find
in the Scripture, that after God had made man, and giuen
him (by breathing vpon him) the ſpirit of life, which is
the ſoule of vnderſtanding, he left him in the hand of his
owne counſell. Whereby it appeereth, that counſel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from our ſelues, and that election is the office of
prudence, which is called the ſoule of the mind, and the
<hi>Platonikes</hi> call the knowledge of good and euill: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
it ſeemed that <hi>Tullie</hi> agreed, when he ſaid, that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
was the ſcience of things deſirable, or to be eſchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
which ſentence S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reporteth. And <hi>Fabius
Maximus</hi> ſaid, that the Gods through prudence and our
vertues, did grant vs proſperous ſucceſſes in our affaires:
as if he ſhould haue ſaid, that though God (as an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
cauſe) concurred to accompliſh our deliberations; yet
we were to endeuour our ſelues, and to ſharpen our wits
to conſult on the beſt meanes to compaſſe our good
purpoſes, if we deſire to haue his fauour, and not to
ſit idle, expecting what will fall out. And to end the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
hereof, the auncient Philoſophers of the beſt ſort
held, that the Gods ſeeing vs employ our vertues and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of the mind (which hath a reſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto them)
well and wiſely, become our friends, and the rather grant
vs their helpe and fauour. According to which opinion
<hi>Euripides</hi> ſayed, that the Gods did helpe them that were
wiſe. But becauſe we ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake more
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17081:97"/>
largely hereafter of Prudence, we will now returne to
that which we left long ſithens to ſpeake of, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of the doubts moued: and that is the knowledge
of our ſelues, as the thing that muſt guide vs to that beſt
and moſt perfect end; the inquiry wherof is the occaſion
of all this diſcourſe. And becauſe we are not of a ſimple
nature, but compounded of ſeuerall qualities, and (as we
may ſay) liues, according to that which in our firſt dayes
diſcourſe was declared: it is alſo neceſſary that theſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
&amp; faculties of the ſoule which are in vs, and by which
we participate of the nature of all things liuing, ſhould
haue their ends and ſeuerall goods, as I may terme them:
and that thoſe ends ſhould orderly anſwer ech to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
power or facultie of the ſoule, though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
thinke otherwiſe. Theſe ends or goods are firſt profite,
which reſpecteth the <hi>vegetatiue</hi> power: next, delight or
pleaſure, peculiar to the <hi>ſenſitiue</hi> power: and laſtly hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
proper to the reaſonable part or facultie of the ſoule.
Wherefore <hi>Zeno</hi> may wel be thought to haue bin aſtray,
when he aſſigned one onely end or good to nature, and
the ſame to be honeſty. For albeit I cannot, nor meane to
denie, but that honeſtie is not onely a good, but alſo the
greateſt good among all thoſe that concurre to our feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie;
and without which, there can be no vertue: yet to
ſay it is the onely good, I cannot be perſwaded. For peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
euery thing that hath life, common ſenſe it ſelf ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs, that ech kind of life hath his peculiar and ſeuerall
end and good; and that honeſtie is the only proper good
of creatures capable of reaſon, and not of other ſenſible
creatures, or of plants and <hi>vegetables.</hi> And becauſe it is a
greater good, and containeth both the other, therefore is
it more to be priſed and valued then they. And man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the moſt perfect creature of the earth, is by nature fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17081:97"/>
to haue a deſire and an inſtinct vnto them all, and to
ſeeke to purchaſe them all three for the perfection of his
felicitie in this life. Now foraſmuch as all theſe three po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
are in vs, to the end we may enioy the benefite that
redoundeth from them, we cannot ſeuer them one from
another,if we meane to be happie in this life: neither yet
ought we ſo to apply our ſelues to any one, or two of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
leſſe proper vnto vs, that therefore we forſake or neglect
that other which is of moſt worth and proper to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and that is honeſtie, which neuer can be ſeuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vertue. For that is it that giueth to vs dignitie and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
not ſuffering vs to do any thing vnſeemely, but ſtil
directing vs in all our actions, which proceed from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
For he that ſtayeth himſelf only vpon profit, or vpon
pleaſure, or vpon them both, ſheweth plainly that he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
not himſelfe: and therefore ſuffereth thoſe things
that are not proper to his nature, to maſter and ouer-rule
him. And not knowing himſelfe, he cannot vſe himſelfe,
nor take hold of that which is his proper good and end.
Thus following (through the not knowing of himſelfe)
that which is good to other natures, he looſeth his owne
good, and falleth into euill, by the deſire of profit, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
appetite to pleaſure. The conſideration hereof
perhaps cauſed ſome of the auncient Poets to faine, that
men were turned into brute beaſts, and into trees; to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
vnder that fictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſome propoſing to themſelues
onely profite, ſome onely delight, without regard to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and their owne proper good, had loſt the excellent
ſhape or forme of men, and were transformed into beaſts
or trees, hauing made the moſt excellent part of man,
which is the mind and reaſonable ſoule, ſubiect to the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
and ſenſual parts and pleaſures of the bodie. And this
ignorance, concerning the knowledge of a mans ſelfe, is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17081:98"/>
the cauſe that he cannot tell how to vſe himſelf. For theſe
vnreaſonable affections do ſo darken the light of reaſon,
that he is as a blind man, and giueth himſelfe ouer to be
guided, as one that hath loſt the right way, to as blinde a
guide as himſelfe, and ſo wandreth aſtray which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
his bad guide doth leade him. For he hath loſt the
knowledge of truth, which <hi>Plato</hi> ſayeth, is the beſt guide
of men to all goodneſſe, and is comprehended by the
mind onely, which (according to the ſaying of <hi>Epicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus)</hi>
doth only ſee &amp; heare, all the reſt of the parts of man
being blind and deafe. They then which follow profite
only, liue the baſeſt life of all, &amp; may well be reſembled to
flies &amp; gnats, the moſt imperfect among liuing creatures,
or like to the ſhel-fiſhes that cleaue to the rockes, as theſe
men do to their pelfe; and ſo hauing propoſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
the baſeſt end of all others, they may worthily be
eſteemed the baſeſt ſort of men.</p>
            <p>Nay, in good faith ſir (ſaid Captaine <hi>Dawtry)</hi> not ſo,
for I ſee them onely honored and eſteemed that are rich;
and I haue knowne, and yet know ſome of very baſe and
abiect condition, who being become rich, are cheriſhed
and welcome in the beſt companies, &amp; accepted among
honorable perſonages: therefore (me thinketh) he ſpake
aduiſedly that ſaid,
<q>
                  <l>Honour and friends by riches are acquired,</l>
                  <l>But who is poore ſhall ech where be deſpiſed.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And I remember I haue read, that ſometime there was a
citizen in Rome, who was commonly held for a foole,
and therefore in all companies his words were litle regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the rather becauſe he was alſo poore; but after that
by the death of a rich man to whom he was heire, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
wealth, he grew to be had in great eſtimation, euen
in the Senate, and his opinion euermore ſpecially requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

in matters of greateſt moment.</p>
            <p>Yea marry (ſaid M. <hi>Dormer)</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that the end of the father of a families care is, the
purchaſing of riches; which being ſo, they are not ſo
ſleightly to be regarded, as your author ſayes.</p>
            <p>Did I not tell you (ſaid I) that truth being gone, the
true light and knowledge of things is taken out of the
world; for it is ſhe only that giueth vs light to know, what
and of what price all things are. And euen as if the Sunne
were taken away from the earth, there would remaine
nought but darknes and blindneſſe among men: ſo truth
being taken away, man is blinded from diſcerning any
thing aright. This I ſay, becauſe rich men onely for their
wealth are eſteemed worthy honour and dignity by ſuch
chiefly as want the light of truth, which is the vulgar ſort,
whoſe iudgement is ſo corrupt and crooked, that they
cannot diſcerne what true honor and dignity is. For they
being weake minded and imperfect, admire ſhowes and
ſhadowes, being dazeled with the bright gliſtring of gold
and precious ſtones, and cannot diſtinguiſh betweene
things neceſſary and ſuperfluous. Which ignorance of
theirs, <hi>Byas,</hi> one of the ſeuen ſages of Greece, conſidering
anſwered one of thoſe baſe minded fellowes, who wold
needes perſwade him, that they were happie that could
compaſſe great wealth: My friend (quoth he) much more
happie are they that do not deſire the ſame. The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the wiſer ſort, hath euer bin farre different from
this vulgar opinion. For they vnderſtand, that riches is
none of thoſe goods which alone make men happie; and
that they do but go and come, as tides flow and ebbe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
at the pleaſure of fortune, who giueth and taketh
them as ſhe liſt. And therefore they are no otherwiſe to
be eſteemed, then as they are neceſſary for the ſuſtaining
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17081:99"/>
of life, nature being content with little, and the deſire of
hauing being infinite; neuer content with what it hath,
but euer coueting what it hath not. Therefore right wiſe
men haue held that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was in truth
poorer and needier then he that ſaid
<q>
                  <l>Let others hardly ſeeke to hoord vp wealth</l>
                  <l>For me I force not, though that pouertie</l>
                  <l>Chaſe from me idleneſſe, and breed me health, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For that mans deſires had their determinate ſtint, wheras
<hi>Alexanders</hi> increaſed ſtil, the more he enlarged his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
being grieued that he had not conquered one
world, becauſe he had heard ſay, that <hi>Democritus</hi> was of
opinion there were many. And although <hi>Epicurus</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things hath deſerued blame, becauſe he placed the
higheſt good of man in pleaſures proceeding from the
ſenſes; yet deſerued he praiſe in that he ſaid, that they to
whom a little ſeemeth not enough, a great deale wil ſeem
but a litle. Much to the like effect <hi>Curius,</hi> hauing conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Samnites, and for recompence of his great ſeruice
the Romanes purpoſing to giue him a far larger portion
of the conquered land, then to the reſt of the ſouldiers: he
who had taught his deſires to be brideled, and could cut
ſhort the ſuperfluitie of his appetites, would in no wiſe
take any more then a like ſhare or portion, as was allotted
to the reſt of the ſouldiers, that were waxen olde in the
warres, for their liuing and maintenance; ſaying, that he
that could not content himſelfe to liue with that which
ſufficed others, could not be a good citizen. This worthy
man made it appeere, that he indeede is to be accounted
rich who deſireth not to haue much: and that in reſpect
of what is needfull for mans life, euery man may be rich;
but in regard of our deſires, euery man is poore, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be rich, becauſe they be infinite. <hi>Socrates</hi> (according
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17081:99"/>
to the ſaying of <hi>Byas</hi> before rehearſed) ſaid that it was far
better not to deſire any thing, then to compas what a man
deſireth. For it was not vnknowne to that graue wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that from immoderate deſires cometh greedineſſe of the
mind, whereby it is made vnreaſonable, and diſpoſed to
thinke a great deale to be but a little; whereas not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
maketh a little to ſeeme much. The way therefore to
quiet the minde, is not to increaſe wealth, but to plucke
from a mans deſires, which otherwiſe will ſtill increaſe as
riches increaſeth: for it is the honeſt and neceſſary vſe of
riches that cauſeth them to be had in conſideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
wiſe men, who eſteeming them accordingly, are
eaſily contented with a little; and where others admire
thoſe that haue their coffers full of golde and pelfe, they
little regard them, but deſpiſing ſuperfluities, turne their
minds to better thoughts, meete to make them purchaſe
that felicitie which none of them can haue, who amid
great abundance of wealth &amp; worldly riches, are voyd of
vertue. For this reſpect did <hi>Crates</hi> the Philoſopher (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how the great care of gathering them withdrew
the minde, which of it owne nature is excelſe and high,
from the knowledge of ſublime matters, ſinking it into
the depth of baſe and vile cogitations) gaue ouer his patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
which was in value neere fifteen hundred pounds,
and betooke himſelfe to thoſe ſtudies which he thought
were apteſt to ſet him the right courſe of getting (in
ſteed of exterior riches) the true gold of the mind, which
is vertue. And in truth happie is that man that can get
ſtore of that gold, by meanes whereof he may compaſſe
his felicitie, which the other can neuer purchaſe, and are
not to be coueted but for humane neceſſitie, as being of
no value, or litle among wiſe men in reſpect of happines.
For to ſay truly, what happines can there be in any thing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17081:100"/>
that alike diſquieteth as well them that haue it, as them
that haue it not. Since he that wants it, by deſiring it, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
his mind in continuall anguiſh and trouble; and he
that hath it, is euermore tormented with feare of loſſe of
it: and if he happen to looſe it indeed, is miſerably cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for the loſſe thereof. Which thing made <hi>Democritus</hi>
to ſay, that man was in his eſtimation ſo farre from being
made happie by his riches, as he could not in truth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
them to be to him any good at all. So <hi>Solon</hi> being
with <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> who accounted himſelf of all
men in the world the moſt happie, becauſe of his exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue
treaſure; when the King had cauſed his treaſury to be
be ſhewed vnto him, ſeemed to make ſleight eſtimation
of the ſame: whereupon the King, as one dazeled with
the glittering ſhow of his gold, held him but for a foole.
But fooliſh indeed was he himſelf, &amp; not <hi>Solo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> who knew
very wel, that ſuch things came to him by his great power
and ſoueraignetie, not by his vertue, and therefore could
they not make him happie. Neuertheleſſe <hi>Croeſus</hi> yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to vnderſtand what <hi>Solons</hi> opinion was touching
happines, asked him if he euer knew any man more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
then he: who anſwered him, yes; and among many,
one named <hi>Pellus</hi> a citizen of <hi>Athens,</hi> who being a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man, and hauing begotten children like himſelfe, was
dead in the field, fighting valiantly againſt the enemie in
defence of his countrey, leauing after him an immortall
fame of his valour. So much more did this wiſe man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
vertue then riches, that he thought ſo mightie a
Monark with all his treaſure not comparable to a meane
citizen of <hi>Athens</hi> furniſhed with vertue. For he held them
as needleſſe and ſuperfluous to him that had them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vſing them, as to them that did admire them and
could not enioy them. Let vs therefore conclude, that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17081:100"/>
plentie of wealth makes not any man happie: and that
they who hunt after profit to become rich, are of al others
the moſt baſe and ignoble, though the vulgar ſort deeme
them otherwiſe. And when <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayd, that the end of
<hi>Oeconomie</hi> (for ſo he calleth the orderly diſtributing of
things for houſhold) was riches, he ſpake according to
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vnderſtanding and phraſe: for in his Ethikes
he ſheweth plainely, that riches is but a certaine aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of neceſſary inſtruments for the vſe of a family.
Whereby it may be vnderſtood, that for themſelues they
are not deſirable, but as they are directed to a better end,
which end is humane felicitie. As for the Senator you
ſpake of, whom the whole Senate grew to eſteeme when
he was growne rich: you may be ſure that it was not for
nought that <hi>Cicero</hi> ſcoffed at them, when he asked one
day in the aſſembly, whoſe that inheritance was, which
was called Wiſedome. And thus much may ſuffice for
ſuch as follow profite onely. Now for thoſe that apply
themſelues wholy to their pleaſures and delights, it is to
be held, that they neither can be accounted happie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
forſaking their proper end and good, which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie,
they bend themſelues to the <hi>ſenſitiue</hi> part onely
which is common with them to brute beaſts.</p>
            <p>Here M. <hi>Dormer</hi> interrupting me, deſired that I would
ſtay a while to reſolue him of one doubt, which my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
words had bred in his mind, which was, that hauing
ſaid riches were of ſmall account among wiſe men, and
could not make men happie, it might ſeeme that nature
had in vaine produced them.</p>
            <p>That followeth not (ſaid I) of any thing which I haue
ſpoken. For I haue not ſaid, that they were not neceſſary
for the vſe of them: for common ſence, experience, and
the want of things behouefull to mans life, would ſay the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17081:101"/>
contrary. Beſides that, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his tenth booke of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thikes
affirmeth, that not onely to the attaining of ciuill
felicitie, but alſo for the contemplatiue life, theſe exterior
goods are needfull, becauſe a man may the better thereby
contemplate when want diſtractetth not his minde:
though among the <hi>Platonikes,</hi> ſome ſay the contrary; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that men are better diſpoſed to contemplation
without them, then with them. But thus much indeede
I ſaid, that they are not the true end or good of man, nor
could yeeld him happineſſe of themſelues, or make him
worthy honour. And that they, that bend their mindes
onely to ſcrape and heape together mucke and pelfe, are
of all others the baſeſt and vnworthieſt: yet being vſed
as they ought to be, for the behoofe and maintenance of
mans life, and not as an end, or the proper good of man,
I do not only not diſcommend them, but do alſo eſteeme
them in their quality ſo far forth as the infirmity of mans
nature hath neede of them; whereof, ſince we ſhall haue
occaſion to ſpeake more hereafter, let vs in Gods name
proceed to ſpeake of the life of them that haue ſubiected
their minds to that part of the ſoule which is wholy bent
to ſenſualitie and delight. Theſe men are like vnto brute
beaſts wanting reaſon, and worſe: for brute beaſts follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
their naturall inſtinct and appetite, paſſe not the
bonds of nature, and though they get no praiſe thereby,
yet incurre they not any blame in that behalfe. But man,
who ſetting reaſon aſide, chuſeth vaine pleaſures as his
ſcope and end, and ſo plungeth his minde in them, that
reaſon cannot performe her office and dutie, can in no
wiſe eſcape from exceeding blame and reproch for the
ſame. Of which ſort of men, the <hi>Platonikes</hi> opinion was,
that they were ſo far from being happie, as they were not
to be reputed among the liuing, but the dead: not only
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17081:101"/>
in reſpect of the body, but of the ſoule likewiſe. For they
held that the ſoule being drowned in delights, might wel
be reckoned as dead, becauſe beaſtly delight (like an ill
weed) ſpreadeth it ſelfe in mans mind, till it ouergrow all
goodneſſe, and ſo taketh away the vſe of reaſon, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth
him of the qualitie proper to man, and draweth
him into the pure qualitie of vnreaſonable creatures:
which, how grieuous and hatefull a thing it is, neede not
be declared. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reſembleth them to wilde young
Stiers, that muſt be tamed with the yoke. But to ſhew
you how this diſordinate or tickling itch of delight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth,
in this ſort it is: wheras man is compoſed of two
principall parts, the body, and the ſoule or mind: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to rule and commaund, the former to obey and ſerue.
They, which propoſe to them their delight and pleaſure,
onely take a cleane contrary courſe, making the body to
commaund and rule, and the minde to ſerue and obey.
And as in a houſhold or family, al wold go to wrack, if the
maſter or father of the family being prudent and carefull,
ſhould be conſtrained to obey his ſonne or ſeruant, who
were fooliſh and negligent: euen ſo muſt it of neceſſitie
be in him, that by vice maketh his mind ſubiect to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
making it ſerue onely for the delighting thereof, and
neglecting that which he ſhould moſt earneſtly ſtudy to
maintaine and cheriſh; whence cometh (as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaith)
all euill and ruines among men. For from theſe diſordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
pleaſures, which ſpring from the ſenſes of the body,
through that power which the facultie of the ſoule mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth
vnto them, do all wicked affections take their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
as angers, furies, fond loues, hatreds, ambitions,
luſtes, ſuſpicions, ielouſies, ill ſpeaking, backbiting, falſe
ioyes, and true griefes; and finally the conſuming of the
body and goods, and the loſſe of honor and reputation.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17081:102"/>
And oftentimes it is ſeene, that whiles a man ſpareth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo as he may purchaſe the fulfilling of his appetites,
how vnruly ſoeuer they be, he looſeth by infirmitie or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnhappie accidents, his owne bodie, for whoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
he ſo earneſtly trauelled. For ſo it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
who being growne ful of ſicknes through his diſordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
life, died miſerably tormented with pains &amp; griefes:
the like wherof we may daily ſee in many, if we conſider
their life and end. In reſpect hereof, ſome wiſe men haue
thought that pleaſures are not in any wiſe to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among the goods that are requiſite for the attaining
of humane felicitie: and <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> ſo hated them, that
he wiſhed he might rather become mad, then to be ouer
maſtered by his ſenſuall delight. And in very deed they
are no otherwiſe to be eſteemed then mad men, who ſet
their delights and pleaſures before them as their end, not
caring what they do, ſo as they may compaſſe the ſame.
<hi>Plato</hi> therfore not without good cauſe ſaid, that pleaſure
was the baite which allured men to all euil. And <hi>Architas</hi>
the Tarentine was of opinion, that the peſtilence was a
leſſer euill among men then pleaſure of the bodie: from
whence came trecheries, and betraying of countries, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
of common-weales, murders, rapes, adulteries,
and all other euils, euen as from a ſpring or fountain. The
cauſe whereof <hi>Pythagoras</hi> deſiring to find out, ſaid, that
delight firſt crept into cities, then ſatietie, next violence,
and laſtly the ruine and ouerthrow of the Common-wealth.
And to this opinion <hi>Tullie</hi> in his firſt booke of
Lawes ſeemeth to leane, where he ſayth, that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfetter
of goodneſſe, and mother of all euils (meaning
pleaſure) intruding her ſelfe into our ſenſes, ſuffered vs
not to diſcerne thoſe goods which are naturall and true
goods indeed, and cary not with them ſuch a ſcabbe and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17081:102"/>
itch, which pleaſure euermore hath about her; who fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
is the roote of thoſe principall paſſions, from which
(as from the maine roote) all the reſt do ſpring, as hope
and feare, ſorrow and gladneſſe. For we receiue not any
pleaſure, but that ſome moleſtation hath opened the way
for it into our mindes: as no man taketh pleaſure to eate
vntill the moleſtation of hunger call him thereunto, nor
yet to drinke, if the annoyance of thirſt go not before: to
ſhew that the vnnobleſt and baſeſt power of the minde
muſt miniſter vnto vs the matter of thoſe pleaſures which
we ſeek. And as we haue ſaid that moleſtation goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vaine and vnruly delight, ſo doth diſpleaſure and
griefe follow, as if it ſhould finally reſolue into his firſt
principle and beginning. The feare whereof diminiſheth
part of the hope a man might haue to liue ſtil contented,
&amp; diſturbeth the ioy which he feeleth in his vnruly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and delights. But to thoſe pleaſures and delights
which accompany vertue, which are pleaſures of ſuch a
kind as they neuer carry with them any diſpleaſure or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance
at all: wheras the other that are vnruly, beginne
with pleaſure and end with bitter paine. And this moued
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to ſay, that the right iudgment of thoſe pleaſures
is to be made at their farewell, not at their comming; for
that they leaue behind them euermore ſadnes and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
So ſaid <hi>Theocritus,</hi> that he that ſtroue to fulfill his
pleaſures and delights, prepared to himſelf matter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
griefe and ſorow. There was a Sophiſt called <hi>Ileus,</hi>
who though he had ſpent his youth wantonly in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
yet he ſo called himſelfe home when he was come
to riper yeeres, that he neuer after ſuffered any vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
to tickle him, neither beauty of women, nor ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of meates, nor any other ſuch pleaſures to draw him
from a ſober and temperate life. To which ſobrietie and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17081:103"/>
temperance of life <hi>Licurgus</hi> being deſirous to draw the
<hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> by his lawes he forbad them all thoſe
things that might turne their minds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manly thoughts,
and make them ſoft and effeminate: for he ſaid, that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
pleaſures were the flatterers of the mind. And as flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
by their deuices and arts, draw men that giue eare
vnto them beſides themſelues, as hath bin already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
ſo pleaſures through their ſweetneſſe corrupt the
ſenſe, together with the mind to whom they are the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.
And <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> being once asked what good the
lawes of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had done to <hi>Sparta:</hi> Marry (ſayd he)
they haue brought our men to deſpiſe thoſe delights
which might haue made them to be no men. There are
ſo many wiſe and graue ſayings to this purpoſe, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate
them all, the day would be too ſhort. It may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuffice what is already ſayed, and confirmed by the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of all the wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world, to ſhew you mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly,
that the true &amp; proper end of man is not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued
by this ſenſual kind of life. And ſince that which
is truly proper to any thing, cannot be common with any
other (as to laugh is ſo proper to man, as no other creature
can laugh but he) and pleaſure is common to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
beſides man, therefore it cannot in any wiſe be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to him.</p>
            <p>It cannot be gaineſaid with any reaſon (ſaid my Lord
Primate) and therefore no doubt but euery man ought
to apply himſelfe to follow that which is moſt proper to
his owne nature; for that is his beſt: and pittie it is, and
maruell eke, to ſee ſuch numbers, that neither for loue of
vertue, nor feare of God, will frame themſelues to a good
and comendable courſe of life, but follow their vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and pleaſures inſatiably.</p>
            <p>Pittie indeed it is (ſaid I) but no great maruell, becauſe
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17081:103"/>
perfect iudgements are rare; and many there be, who
though they know the truth of things, yet ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to be caried away with apparances. For their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
propoſing to them certaine figures or images of
what is good and faire, they are content to be deceiued,
and to become bondſlaues to their ſenſes, or rather char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by them, as by ſome witch or inchantreſſe, and by
them to be guided. But this notwithſtanding I muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe
you, that I haue not ſo abſolutely ſpoken againſt
pleaſures, that you ſhould therefore inferre that vertues
ſhould be without their pleaſures alſo. For albeit pleaſure
be not vertue, nor yet mans true good, yet doth it follow
vertue, euen as the ſhadow followeth the bodie. And
though vertues haue difficulties and trauels before they
be gotten; yet when they are gotten, pleaſure is the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
companion vnto them; not ſuch as keepeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with laſciuious and wanton affections, and is ſoone
conuerted to griefe and repentance, but a delight that is
permanent and ſtable: inſomuch as ſome of very good
iudgement, haue thought there is no pleaſure worthy the
name of delight, but that which proceedeth from vertue,
and maketh our actions perfect. For this cauſe did <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
ſay, that moſt perfect was that delight which was
comprehended by the moſt perfect part of the ſoule,
which is the vnderſtanding. And this delight is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
perfect in God, that he is far from any annoyance
or moleſtation: for delight is not in God a paſſion, as in
vs our delights are, which neuer come to vs without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation,
it being (as hath bin ſaid) the begining of them.
Therfore the pleaſures of the mind are eſteemed ſo much
the more perfect, as the vnderſtanding is more perfect
then the ſenſe: which vnderſtanding delighteth onely
in that pleaſure that is accompanied with honeſtie, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17081:104"/>
this pleaſure he eſteemed to be ſo excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he wiſhed
ſome new excellent name to be found for the ſame. But
we hauing no other name to giue it, call it by ſimilitude
with that name which is fit for the delightfulleſt thing
that the ſenſes can yeeld vs: and therefore we call as well
the imperfect delight of the ſenſes, as that moſt perfect of
the vnderſtanding, by the name of pleaſure, though the
one of them conſiſt in extremes which is vicious, and
the other in the meane where vertues haue their
place.</p>
            <p>Here Captaine <hi>Norreis</hi> ſpake, ſaying; We haue heard
you ſundrie times ſay that vertues conſiſt in the meane
betweene two extremes, but how that meane is to be
found, you haue not yet declared to vs: therefore (I pray
you) let vs be made acquainted with the way to compas
the ſame, that we may learne to take hold of vertue, and
not be deceiued with the falſe ſemblance thereof to fall
into vice.</p>
            <p>This meane (ſaid I) is found, when a man doth what
he ought to do, when time ſerueth, in maner as he ſhould,
for ſuch as becommeth him to do, and for cauſes honeſt
and conueniet. And whoſoeuer ſetteth this rule to
himſelfe in all his actions, which being ſo conditioned,
ſhall be farre off from the extremes, and neere vnto
vertue.</p>
            <p>Yea (ſaid Captaine <hi>Norreis)</hi> this is ſoone ſaid, but not
ſo ſoone done: for it is not ſo eaſie a matter to hitte vpon
theſe conditions, but that a man may more eaſily miſſe
them. But ſince by your words, neither delight alone, nor
profit onely can worke humane felicitie, it ſhould ſeeme
(the qualitie and trade of the world conſidered) that it
may well be gathered, that they which haue them both
linked together, are worthy to be eſteemed happie: ſince
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:17081:104"/>
plenty of wealth may yeeld them all their deſires, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
their delights. And this haply may be the cauſe why
Kings and Princes are ſo accounted in this life.</p>
            <p>Of the happineſſe or vnhappineſſe of Princes, this is
no place to treate (ſaid I) neither appertaineth it to our
matter: onely thus much I may remember by the way,
that <hi>Antigonus</hi> affirmed it to be but a kind of pleaſing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude
to be a King. And <hi>Phalaris</hi> the cruell tyrant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
wel his eſtate, ſaid likewiſe, that if he had knowne
before he made himſelf tyrant of his country, what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
care and danger followed rule and Segnorie, he wold
rather haue choſen any ſtate of life then to be a King.
Neuertheleſſe no ſort of men place their felicitie more in
pleaſure then Princes do, when they haue not due regard
to their charge: for then they think that whatſoeuer may
nouriſh their delight and pleaſure, is lawfull for them to
do. But miſerable are the people ouer whom God hath
ſet ſuch to raigne, as put their pleaſure or their profit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
before all reſpects, as the end of their gouernement:
though Almightie God who is the King ouer Kings, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
in his iuſtice plagueth them, euen with thoſe
things wherein they placed their greateſt felicitie. <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
the yonger being borne in wealth and plentie, ſetting
all his thoughts vpon his pleaſures, was therefore in the
end driuen out of his kingdome. For he thinking it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for him to take all that he would haue, euen in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
life time began to defloure certain virgins of honeſt
families: which thing his father vnderſtanding ſharpely
reprehended him for the ſame; and among other things
told him, that howſoeuer himſelfe had taken vpon him
by tyrannie the kingdome of Sicilie, yet he neuer had v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
any ſuch violences. But his wanton ſonne made him
this anſwer: It may well be (quoth he) for you were not
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:17081:105"/>
the ſonne of a King. At which word the father grieuing,
replied vnto him; Neither art thou like to leaue thy ſonne
a King, vnles thou change thy conditions. Which prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication
was verified, in that the ſonne following his
lewd courſe of life, ſhortly after his fathers death was cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
out his kingdom by his ſubiects, and driuen to get his
liuing by keeping a ſchoole in Corinth: where on a time
one ſeeing him liue ſo poorely, asked him what he had
learned of his ſchoole-maſter <hi>Plato,</hi> that he could no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
behaue himſelfe in his royaltie; taxing him that for
not applying himſelf to <hi>Plato</hi> his doctrine, he had bin the
cauſe of his owne ruine. But his anſwer was better then
his former cariage, for he ſaid, that he had learned more
then haply he could imagine. And what is that (quoth
the other) I pray you teach it me. I haue (ſaid he) learned
to beare this my aduerſe fortune patiently, &amp; with a frank
courage. And had he learned to obſerue that worthy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> who was wont to ſay, that Kings and
Princes ought to endeuor to exceed other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
&amp; fortitude, and not in wantonnes &amp; pleaſures, he
had neuer brought his high eſtate to ſo baſe a fortune as
to keepe a ſchoole. But omitting to ſpeake of Kings, I wil
tel you that they are greatly deceiued that think that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
ioyned with delight may make men happie: for the
more that profite and delight are knit together, the more
doth wanton luſt and vnruly deſires ſwell and increaſe, if
they be not tempered by the rule of reaſon. Which made
<hi>Ouid</hi> to ſay,
<q>
                  <l>From out the bowels of the earth is fet</l>
                  <l>That curſed pelfe, mens minds on ill to ſet.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Plato</hi> in his books of lawes ſaith, that a very rich man
is ſeldome ſeene very good. Which ſaying you know our
Sauiour Chriſt confirmed when he ſayed, it was harder
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:17081:105"/>
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heauen, then a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to paſſe through a needles eye. And though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
in one place ſayth, that riches are neceſſary to make vp a
perfect humane felicitie: yet in another he calleth them
but a fooliſh happineſſe. Yea <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth, that great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are as harmeful in a citie as great pouertie, by reaſon
of the deliciouſnes &amp; wantonnes which they breed. For
which reaſons it may be very wel concluded, that neither
wealth nor pleaſure, nor yet they both together, ought to
draw any man to propoſe them to himſelfe for his end:
but the more he hath of wealth, and vſeth it but for his
pleaſure, the further he goeth aſtray from his felicitie and
his proper end. And that riches in a wanton laſciuious
mans poſſeſſion, are like a ſword in a mad mans hand.
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſaid, that as a horſe cannot be ruled without a
bit: ſo riches are hardly wel vſed without prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which
wil in no wiſe dwell with them, who aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don themſelues
wholy to vaine delights. If to the vulgar ſort therefore
ſuch men ſeeme happie, yet are they in very truth moſt
miſerable and vnhappie. For theſe diſordinate pleaſures
are inteſtine enemies, which neuer ceaſe working til they
ouerthrow a man, and breed him diſhonour and ſhame:
neither do they faile to bring him to an euill end, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
them to maſter him, and vſeth hs wealth to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of his appetites. As by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> aforeſayd may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere,
and alſo by <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> who being a mightie
Monarke, ſwimming in wealth and pleaſures, and ſparing
nothing that might glut his laſciuious appetites, grew ſo
effeminate thereby, that as ſoone as he was aſſaulted by
contrary fortune, he was driuen to conſume himſelfe, his
treaſure, and all his filthy luſtes at once in the fire. Which
two examples among infinite moe that might be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
ſhall for this time ſuffice to verifie that which hath
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17081:106"/>
bin ſaid, to wit, that Gods iudgements light for the moſt
part vpon ſuch Princes, as, forgetting the great care and
charge which is layd vpon them, giue themſelues to care
for nothing but their owne vaine appetites and delights.
To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> ſpake, when he ſaid, that riches were
no goods if they were not accompanied with vertue that
might inſtruct men how to vſe them well. And <hi>Chilo</hi> the
<hi>Lacedemonian</hi> likewiſe, who was the firſt author of that
graue ſentence, <hi>Magiſtratus virum indicat,</hi> whereunto he
added riches alſo, becauſe they both together draw him
the more eaſily to diſcouer himſelfe. <hi>Socrates</hi> wiſely wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
that he might haue the grace to eſteem no man rich
but him that was giuen to the ſtudie of wiſedome and
knowledge: for ſuch (he ſaid) had the true gold, which is
vertue, a thing much more precious then all the golde in
the whole world, and that which leadeth man the right
way to his felicitie.</p>
            <p>Then, ſaid Captaine <hi>Norreis,</hi> ſince by your diſcourſe,
all they are vnhappie that tread the ſteps which leade to
either of thoſe two ends before mentioned of profite or
pleaſure; or to them both ioined together: it muſt of force
follow, that happy be they that direct their actions to that
end which is proper to man, whereof I hope your next
ſpeech will be.</p>
            <p>So muſt it (ſaid I) for there remaineth nothing elſe to be
treated of. And if mine author miſtruſted his eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (as
he doth) in a matter meete to be ſet forth ſo effectually as
this; what may I ſay of my ſelfe, that am tied to declare to
you in our la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, inferior much to the <hi>Italian,</hi> al that he
hath ſet downe touching the ſame? Sure it is, that if I were
able to ſet before the eyes of your mindes a liuely image
of this excellent end, you wold be ſo delighted therewith
that in regard thereof you would contemne and ſet light
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17081:106"/>
by all other pleaſures in the world. But howſoeuer my
vtterance be, which I will do my beſt to fit as wel as I can
to ſo high a ſubiect, you ſhall heare what he in ſubſtance
ſaith therupon; and I aſſure my ſelf that the quality of the
matter will eaſily ſupply whatſoeuer defect you may find
in my phraſe or maner of ſpeech. You are therefore to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that as they whoſe iudgements are corrupted,
and minds informed with an il habite, to make them liue
after the maner before mentioned, do ſwarue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man ſo much, as they become like brute beaſts or
inſenſible plants voide of reaſon: euen ſo are they among
men, as diuine creatures, who apply themſelues to liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to reaſon. And ſuch haue aunciently bin called
<hi>Heroes,</hi> becauſe they approched in their actions neerer to
God then others that liued not ſo. For they put all their
endeuours to adorne and ſet foorth that part of man
which maketh him like vnto the diuine nature, or rather
partaker of the ſame; teacheth him what is good, comely,
honeſt, and honorable; and inuiteth him continually to
that which may conduct him to the higheſt and ſupreme
good. This part is the minde, with the vſe of reaſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from it, as from a roote. But becauſe two ſpeciall
offices appertaine to the vſe of reaſon (ſo farre foorth as
ſerueth to this purpoſe) the one contemplation, and the
other action. Touching the firſt, it raiſeth vs by the means
of Arts and ſciences (which purge the minde from baſe
and corrupt affections) to the knowledge of thoſe things
that are vnchangeable, and ſtill remaine the ſame, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
the heauens turne, time runne on, or fortune or
any other cauſe rule things ſubiect vnto them. By means
of which ſciences, the minde climbing by degrees vp to
the eternall cauſes, conſidereth the order &amp; maner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
things are knit together, &amp; linked in a perpetual ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17081:107"/>
And thence it comprehendeth the forme of regiment,
which the Creator and mouer of all things vſeth in the
maintaining and keeping them euerlaſtingly in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
offices and duties. And out of the conſideration
hereof we learne, that he that directeth not his courſe of
gouernment by this rule, as neere as he can, to guide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
his family, and the Common-wealth, can ſeldome
or neuer attaine a good and happie end. Wherefore he
draweth the celeſtiall gouernement to the vſe of humane
and ciuill things, ſo farre as mans frailtie will permit. As
<hi>Socrates</hi> did, who was ſaid to haue drawne Philoſophie
from heauen to the earth, to reforme the life and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners
of men. Thus turning himſelfe to the knowledge of his
owne nature, and finding that he is compoſed of three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
natures, whereof ech hath her ſeuerall end, yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
he to draw the ends of the two leſſe perfect, to the
end of that which is moſt perfect and proper to him. But
finding that continuall contemplation of higher things,
would be profitable onely to himſelf and to none other,
in that he ſhould thereby purchaſe no happineſſe to any
but to himſelfe. And becauſe he knoweth that he is not
borne to himſelfe alone, but to ciuill ſocietie and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
and to the good of others as well as of himſelfe, he
therefore doth his endeuour with all care and diligence
ſo to cary himſelfe in words and in deeds, as he might be
a patterne and example to others of ſeemly and vertuous
ſpeeches and honeſt actions, and do them all the good he
could in reducing them to a good and commendable
forme of life. For the performance whereof, he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
how requiſite it is, that honeſtie and vertue be ſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
with profite and pleaſure, that by a iuſt and equall
temper of them, both himſelfe and others may attaine
that end which is the <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> and the thing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17081:107"/>
wherupon all our diſcourſe hath bin grounded. This end
is not to be attained but by the meanes of morall vertues,
which are the perfection of the minde, &amp; ſetled habits in
ruling the appetite which ariſeth out of the vnreaſonable
parts of the ſoule: for vertues are grounded in thoſe parts
which are without reaſon, but yet are apt to be ruled by
reaſon. He therefore ſeeing morall vertues are not gotten
by knowing onely what they be, but through the long
practiſe of many vertuous operations, whereby they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
themſelues ſo to the mind, as being conuerted once
into an habite, it is very hard afterwards to loſe the ſame:
euen as of vicious actions on the other ſide the like enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
therefore with all carefulneſſe and diligence poſſible
he laboreth to embrace the one, and to eſchue the other;
euermore ſtriuing to hold himſelfe in the meane, and to
auoide the approching of the extremes: to which, profite
and delight vnder deceitful maskes of good, would entiſe
and allure him.</p>
            <p>I pray you (ſaid Captain <hi>Norreis)</hi> tel vs (ſince you ſay
that vertue is in the mids betweene two extremes) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that meane you ſpeake of, wherin vertue ſits, be ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
in the midſt, as the extremes which be vicious, be
alike diſtant from the ſame or no?</p>
            <p>No (ſaid I) they are not in that manner equidiſtant,
for oftentimes vertue approcheth neerer to one of the
extremes, then to the other. As for example, Fortitude,
which conſiſteth in a meane betweene fearefulneſſe and
foole-hardineſſe, hath yet a neerer reſemblance to foole-hardineſſe
then to cowardiſe, and conſequently is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
diſtant from them both, and is in this manner to be
vnderſtood, that albeit vertue conſiſt in a meane between
two extremes, whereof the one is a defect, and the other
a ſuperabundance, yet ſhe is neither of them both, as by
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17081:108"/>
our example of Fortitude appeereth, which is neither
foole-hardines, nor yet cowardiſe, but onely a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
meane or temper betweene them both. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid right well that the meane of vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two extremes, was a <hi>Geometricall</hi> meane which
hath a reſpect to proportion, and not an <hi>Arithmeticall</hi>
meane which reſpecteth equall diſtance: ſo as you muſt
vnderſtand that vertue is not called a meane betweene
two extremes, becauſe ſhe participateth of either of them
both, but becauſe ſhe is neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And why (ſaid Captaine <hi>Norreis)</hi> is the <hi>Geometricall</hi>
proportion rather to be obſerued therein, then the <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe (ſaid I) though vertues are in the meane, yet
do they bend oftentimes towards one of the extremes
more then to the other, as hath bin ſaid already: and by
proportion <hi>Geometricall</hi> they are in the middeſt, which
by <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> would not be ſo. For thereby they muſt
be in the iuſt middeſt, and equally diſtant from both the
extremes. As for example, let vs ſuppoſe 6. to be the
meane betweene 4. and 8; for 6. hath two more then 4,
and ſo hath it two leſſe then 8, and in reſpect of it ſelfe
ſtandeth iuſt in the midſt betweene 4. and 8, and equally
diſtant from them both. And this is your <hi>Arithmetical</hi>
meane. But the <hi>Geometrical</hi> proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is after another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
For ſuppoſe 2. and 8. to be the extremes, and 4. to be
the mean: here you ſee that 2. &amp; 4. haue a double propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſo hath 4. and 8. the one to the other, and ſo 4.
participateth of that double proportion as well with 8.
as with 2, and yet is neerer to 2. then to 8; which it doth
likewiſe in another reſpect: for if the two extremes be
multiplied together, as 2. with 8. they make 16: and ſo
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17081:108"/>
much doth 4. likewiſe being multiplied in it ſelf, for foure
times 4. makes 16. And thus you ſee what difference is
betweene <hi>Geometricall</hi> and <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> proportion.
Now though euery vertue haue peculiar extremes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
which it is placed: yet Philoſophers ſay, that they
conſiſt all generally about matter of pleaſure, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>How can that be (ſaid M. <hi>Dormer)</hi> when you haue told
vs already, that vertue is not pleaſure?</p>
            <p>It is (ſaid I) one thing to ſay vertue is pleaſure, and an
other to ſay that it conſiſteth in matter of pleaſure or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance.
And true it is that pleaſure is not the matter of
vertue, neither meant I ſo to ſay; but onely that vertue is
buſied about theſe two paſſions of pleaſure and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
whereof the fitteſt example may be taken from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.
For as the temperate man embraceth the delight
of the mind, ſo taketh he pleaſure to abſtaine from the
vnſeemely delights of the body. And contrariwiſe, the
intemperate man is ſad, becauſe he hath them not.</p>
            <p>Well (ſaid M. <hi>Dormer)</hi> that matter is ſoone anſwered:
but becauſe I haue heard the Stoikes were of opinion,
that vertue was true felicitie, and that <hi>Plotinus</hi> ſaid, that a
man endued with vertue was ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly furniſhed for his
felicitie, as being poſſeſſed of all the good that could be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, I pray you what is your authors opinion in
that point?</p>
            <p>If I well remember (quoth I) it is a good while ſithens
I told you that mans felicitie is attained by vertue; but
that vertue is his felicitie, that ſaith not mine author. And
ſure the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is better in that matter then
that of the Stoikes. For reaſon it ſelfe telleth vs that thoſe
things which are ordained to an end, cannot be the end
it ſelfe to which they be ordained. And ſince vertues are
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17081:109"/>
ordained for the attaining of mans felicitie, which is (as
hath bin ſayd) a perfect action according to vertue in a
perfect life. It is plaine, that vertue cannot be felicitie,
though he that is vertuous approcheth neere to his feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</p>
            <p>You ſay true (ſayd M. <hi>Dormer:)</hi> I remember you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
the clauſe of a perfect life to be intended a long
life, yet the ſame Stoikes held that a yong man might be
happie: alledging felicitie was not to be meaſured by
quantitie, but by qualitie; and that not length of time, but
perfection onely is to be reſpected, which (they ſay) may
be as well in a yong man as in an old. And they giue the
example of hunger and thirſt: for ſuppoſe (ſay they) that
two hungry or thirſtie folke be called to eate or to drink,
and the one to aſſwage his hunger or thirſt be ſatisfied
with a little, and the other require much meate or drink
to be ſatiated, yet is he as well ſatisfied with the little
whoſe nature requireth little, as he that requireth a great
deale: euen ſo (ſay they) in humane felicitie, the length of
time or number of yeeres is not to be reſpected, but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
it ſelfe; and as happie is the young man who in a
few yeeres hath attained his felicitie, as the olde man that
hath bin many yeeres about it. For <hi>Plotinus</hi> ſaith, that the
happie man cannot reckon vpon the yeeres paſt of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie,
but onely on the preſent.</p>
            <p>The Stoikes held ſtrange opinions (ſayd I) in many
things. But if experience be needfull (as hath bin former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſayd) and many actions, to make an habite in vertue,
ſo as a man may by cuſtome be brought to that paſſe as
he ſhall not do any thing but according to vertue, then is
length of life neceſſary for the attaining of vertue, which
muſt firſt be gotten before a man can hope for any felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Moreouer, if Prudence be the very knot and band
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17081:109"/>
of all the morall vertues, and that the young man cannot
be prudent, how can he then haue perfect vertue? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the diffinitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of humane felicitie to be a perfect ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
according to vertue, hath need of this addition in
a perfect life, which muſt be long and haue a happie end.
For though a man haue runne through many yeeres in
continuall proſperitie, and afterwards fall into grieuous
calamitie, though he cannot be thereby made miſerable
(which vice onely and not aduerſitie may bring him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)
yet may he not be rightly intitled happie. Youth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath this defect in it, that albeit man be the ſubiect of
felicitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet a yong man cannot be properly and actually
the ſubiect thereof, and the child much leſſe, becauſe he
is furder off from prudence, and becauſe neither of them
can haue either perfect life or perfect vertue. And as for
the opinion of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> he (as a <hi>Platonike)</hi> conſidered the
ſoule ſimple and pure, freed from the other two powers
that are rebellious to reaſon: and meant him onely to be
happie, who ſeparating the vertues of the mind from the
ſenſes, from worldly delights and concupiſcences, did ſo
interne himſelfe with his thoughts in the contemplation
of his Creator, as he deſpiſeth riches, dignities, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
with all tranſitorie and fraile commodities: ſtill loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to that good which is the higheſt and perfecteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all goods, which is God Omnipotent. And this
he called the chiefe action of the vnderſtanding, and
higheſt felicitie. And becauſe he ſuppoſed that the mind
ſhould neuer depart from that action, he ſayd that the
time paſt was not to be accounted of in mans felicitie. By
which it may appeere, that he ſpake not in that place of
humane or ciuil felicitie, wherof our diſcourſe is now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion, neither doth the authoritie
of <hi>Plotinus</hi> help the Stoikes any whit at al, whoſe opinion
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17081:110"/>
is in that point to be reiected.</p>
            <p>Since we are reſolued (ſaid Capt. <hi>Carleil)</hi> that vertues
are but the meane to purchaſe felicitie, and not felicitie it
ſelfe, we would be glad to heare you declare how many
they are, and of what qualitie, that we may know them,
and make our ſelues happie by the purchaſe of them.</p>
            <p>To anſwer you to this queſtion (ſaid I) according as I
find the matter ſet downe by mine author, wold perhaps
not ſatisfie you ſo fully as you would deſire, or I could
wiſh: for that (in my opinion) he hath treated of
ſome of theſe morall vertues ſomewhat too briefly, and
confuſedly: I haue therefore to helpe mine owne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
had recourſe to <hi>Picolomini</hi> when I came to this
place, in whom hauing found a more plaine and eaſie
method in the deſcription of them, I haue for the more
perſpicuitie of the tranſlation, added ſomewhat taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him, and (as well as I could) interlaced it with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
where mine author ſeemed to me too brief, or too
obſcure. And if it may worke the ſame effect in you, that
it hath done in me, to make you the better vnderſtand
how many and of what qualitie thoſe vertues are, I hope
you will not miſlike my attempt therein, but excuſe me,
though it be not ſo fully accompliſhed as I deſire it were.
There are then by the generall conſent of all men foure
principall vertues appertaining to ciuill life, which are,
Fortitude, Temperance, Iuſtice, and Prudence; from
which foure are alſo deriued (as branches fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their trees)
ſundry others to make vp the number of twelue, and they
are theſe enſuing, Liberalitie, Magnificence, Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,
Manſuetude, Deſire of honor, Veritie, Affability, and
Vrbanitie: of euery of the which vertues, I will ſpeake
particularly, following chiefly mine author; but where
need or occaſion ſhall require, I wil for the cleerer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:17081:110"/>
of the matter, ſupply out of <hi>Picolomini</hi> what I
think is wanting. And to begin firſt with Fortitude. This
vertue ſtandeth in the meane betweene foole-hardineſſe
and cowardiſe; which two paſſions may iuſtly be termed
matter of Fortitude: and this vertue is exerciſed in things
terrible and fearful, which are alſo difficult, cauſing griefe
and paine, which the valiant man is willing to endure for
vertues ſake. For though his life be deere vnto him, as it
ought to be to euery man of vertue, in reſpect of himſelf,
of his friends, and of his countrey; and will not therefore
vpon ſmall occaſions expoſe himſelfe to perill: yet when
time and occaſion require it, and that any honeſt cauſe
call him thereunto, he will vndertake cheerfully whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
dangerous enterpriſe, and with a ſtout courage, and
readily performe the ſame. Neither ſhall labour or trauel,
hazard, nor death it ſelf diſmay him; but eſteeming more
his reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then his life, he wil reſolutely aduenter him
ſelf for honeſties ſake. But among all the actions of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
to fight for our countrey, and (if need be) to die for
defence of the ſame, deſerueth the greateſt praiſe &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:
as on the other ſide, to quarrel, &amp; put a mans
life in danger vpon euery trifling occaſion, is not the part
of a valiant man, but of a foole-hardy. <hi>Cato</hi> the elder ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaid very wel, that to know a valiant man, it imported
much, to vnderſtand whether he made more account of
his life or of his vertue, becauſe not the aptnes to quarrell
for euery occaſion, but the venturing his life for vertue
&amp; honeſtie maketh a man to be accounted valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t among
wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who hold ſuch men to be fools &amp; miſerable that
thruſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues raſhly into quarels, as many do, through
the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our age, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fantaſticall points of honor,
as if they were weary of their liues. Neuertheles there are
ſome kindes of death, which a vertuous man abhorreth,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:17081:111"/>
as to die by tempeſt at ſea, by thunder, by earthquake, and
ſuch other violent deaths where vertue ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue no place.
All which deaths, though they cannot diſmay a vertuous
mind, yet he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but be ſory that he is brought to ſuch
an end, as affoordeth him no meanes to make of his valor.
There be ſundry vices which haue a reſemblance of this
vertue: but becauſe we haue in our firſt dayes diſcourſe
ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, we ſhal not need at this time to
ſay any more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſame. It is alſo to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that this is a vertue as wel of the body as of the mind:
for to the exerciſe of fortitude, a man muſt haue a ſtrong
body, &amp; of a good complexion, his lims wel framed, and
thereto a ſtout and a conſtant mind fitly coupled, that it
may rule and guide the body prudently. For (as <hi>Iſocrates</hi>
ſayd to <hi>Demonicus)</hi> vnleſſe ſtrength of body be matched
with wiſedom, it is doubtles harmfull to him that hath it.
The mind muſt be ſo diſpoſed &amp; armed againſt fortune,
be ſhe froward or fauorable, it may ſtand alwayes inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
againſt all misfortunes and aduerſities, and yet not
raiſe it ſelfe for proſperous ſucceſſes. For it is as true a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of a baſe mind to be proud &amp; inſolent in proſperitie,
as to be daunted and faint-hearted in aduerſitie and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Amid which afflictions, that part of Fortitude
which is called patience hath place, of which <hi>Plato</hi> hath
written largely, and among other things this he ſayth,
that the valiant man hath gotten ſuch a habit in his mind
of Fortitude, that amid pleaſures or amid calamities, he is
alwayes the ſame man; reſiſting the aſſaults of fortune
with the vertue of his minde. But the Chriſtian writers
haue much more extolled this vertue then any other; yet
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> toucheth it, where he ſayth, that the vertue of
Fortitude is cleerly diſcerned by the voluntary enduring
of grieuous accidents, which in effect is that ſame habite
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17081:111"/>
whch we call patience. <hi>Alexander Mamea</hi> (as <hi>Herodian</hi>
reporteth) was wont to ſay, that valiant men, and modeſt
or temperate men, ought to wiſh for proſperous eſtate:
but that if things fall out contrary to their deſire, they are
to beare them with an inuincible courage. And <hi>Plotinus</hi>
defining the ſayd vertue, ſayd that it was a habite of the
mind, which was not ſubiect to paſſions: as in another
place he deſcribeth the valiant man to be he, that is not
moued from the vertuous habit of his mind, neither by
pleaſing or delightfull accidents, nor yet by grieuous or
diſpleaſant; yea he ſo abhorred that a man ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered
by happie or vnhappie accidents, that he ſticked
not to affirme, that from this baſenes of mind proceeded
that opinion which wold take from vs our free election.
For their cowardiſe, who ſuffer themſelues to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by ſuch paſſions, perſwades them that ſuch things
happen of neceſſitie, and through the immutable order
of things: and ſo they make themſelues wittingly ſlaues
where they were free, wanting either will or power to vſe
that libertie of their mind, either in the one fortune or in
the other. For who ſo is armed with true fortitude, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things whatſoeuer they be, neither giue nor take
ought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But they that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not temper themſelues in
proſperitie, nor beare aduerſitie ſtoutly, make it apparant
that fortune maſtreth them. Whereunto S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
ſaith to <hi>Simplician,</hi> that vertuous men become nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greater nor meaner by the change of mortall ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
becauſe by this vertue they ouercome both fortunes.
Such a man was <hi>Socrates,</hi> whoſe wife ſayd of him, that
whatſoeuer had befallen him, he neuer came home but
with one and the ſelfe ſame countenance, neuer altered
or changed. To the ſame effect <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayd, that a wel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
minde holdeth euermore one courſe howſoeuer
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17081:112"/>
the world fare; whether fortune beſtow her gifts plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
vpon him, or frowardly take them away. For the
valiant man neuer grieueth at any thing that happeneth
in this life to other men, Fortitude being a ſure ſhield for
humane weakneſſe, which maketh all the darts of fortune
how ſharpe ſoeuer they be, to turne point againe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
once ſo much as raſing, much leſſe entring thereinto.
There is nothing in the world that ought to be more
deere to a man then his children, who are his true and
liuely images, and after a ſort the miniſters of his immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie:
wherefore the loſſe of them (eſpecially when they
are vertuous) ſhould of all other things be moſt grieuous
vnto him. Neuertheleſſe <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> when newes was
brought him that his onely ſonne was dead, anſwered
the meſſenger, It is no new thing that thou telleſt me, for
I hauing begotten him, know right wel that he was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
So well had Philoſophie taught him to beare the
freakes of fortune, and armed his minde in ſuch ſort, as it
could not be ſurpriſed with any ſudden paſſion. Our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
birth hath death faſtened vnto it: therefore the Poet
ſayd right well:
<q>
                  <l>Whiles borne we are we die, ſo that our ending</l>
                  <l>From our firſt being taketh his beginning.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And to conclude touching this vertue, we muſt
haue ſuch an habit thereof in our mindes, and ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the ſame with Prudence, as Fortune either good or
bad may not preuaile againſt vs; neuer thinking our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie
ouer her aſſured, vntil we haue cleane daunted and
beaten her downe. <hi>Carneades</hi> in this behalfe aduiſed wel,
that in time of proſperitie we ſhould forethinke ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities,
and ſuppoſe them to be already fallen vpon vs,
whereby we might be the better prepared in minde to
beare them if they came indeed. And <hi>Zeno</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17081:112"/>
aduertiſement that a ſhippe wherein he had great
wealth was wracked and caſt away, ſhewed himſelf farre
from being grieued thereat: for he thanked fortune, that
by taking againe thoſe goods which ſhe had giuen him,
he had gotten ſo good an occaſion to forſake the care of
inriching himſelf temporally, &amp; to betake himſelf wholy
to the ſtudy of Philoſophie.</p>
            <p>Next followeth the vertue of Temperance, whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
is that power of the ſoule whence cometh the <hi>concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible</hi>
appetite; and ſhe is exerciſed ſpecially about the
ſenſes of taſting and feeling, but chiefly about the wanton
luſts of the fleſh: for though the taſt ill vſed, be a cauſe of
intemperance, yet is it by the meane of the ſenſe of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
In which reſpect it may be ſaid, that the diſordinate
luſt of the body that maketh men intemperate, is in the
ſenſe of feeling, not ouer all the body, but onely in thoſe
parts which ſerue for thoſe delights. And they being
moſt mightie, are by temperance to be reſtrained with
the bridle of modeſtie, and kept within due termes. For
which cauſe <hi>Plato</hi> called her the gardien or ſafe keeper of
all humane vertues. For ſhe with ſober and aduiſed lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
telleth vs, that nothing is comely that is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
nor nothing honeſt that is not comely: far from the
diſordinate appetites perſwaſion, which ſayth, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
pleaſeth is lawful, and that all is lawful that pleaſeth.
But Temperance with her wholeſome aduertiſements
withdraweth vs from all that is vnfitting or vndecent, if
we giue eare vnto her. Which vndecency or vnfittingnes
cometh neither from the ſenſes of ſeeing, nor yet of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
or ſmelling. For men by delighting beyond meaſure
in the obiects of thoſe ſenſes, are not called Intemperate,
but runne into other leſſer defects, not needful here to be
ſpoken of. But Intemperance groweth principally (as
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17081:113"/>
we haue ſaid) out of the taſt and the feeling, two ſenſes
that make vs moſt like vnto brute beaſts, if we ſuffer our
ſelues to be led by them, following our delights as they
do: for they corrupt mans prudence, put his mind aſtray,
&amp; take away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the light of reaſon, which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other
creatures they cannot take. I remember that among the
Grecians it was reported, how vnder the images of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carſis</hi>
a moſt continent Philoſopher was euer written,
that temperance was to be vſed in the tongue, in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
&amp; in the priuie parts, thereby giuing vs to vnderſtand
in which ſenſes principally Temperance ſhould be vſed.
And though all other creatures haue their exterior ſenſes
as well as man, yet none take delight in them, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally.
For the hound delighteth not in the ſent of
the hare, but inſomuch as he hopeth to feede vpon her:
nor the wolfe delighteth in the bleating of a Lambe, but
as he intendeth to deuoure it: neither doth the ſight of a
bullock pleaſe the Lion for any reſpect, but that he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
to ſlake his hunger on the carcaſſe of it. All their
principall delight is in the taſt and in the feeling: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they haue no light of reaſon, but are guided onely
by naturall inſtinct, therefore they are not called tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
or intemperate, as hauing no free choice, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from reaſon onely. But men who haue the gift
of the mind from God, and are capable by their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to diſcerne and chuſe what is good, and to eſchue
what is euill, vnles they be miſled by their appetite, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue,
when they chuſe that which is iuſt and reaſonable,
to be called temperate. And to ſuch men <hi>Plotinus</hi> was
wont to ſay, that delight of the ſenſes was giuen for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing
and lightning of the heauy burthen of cares and
troubles, which this mortall life bringeth vpon vs. Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby that ſuch delights are not in themſelues euil,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17081:113"/>
but onely when they be ill vſed. Which thing <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
before him ſignified, when he ſayd, that euery man was
not to be called intemperate, that ſought for ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
but that to ſuch only, as hunted after diſhoneſt and
vnlawfull delights, that name was to be applied: for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
delights for recreation of the mind are not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed;
ioyning therein with <hi>Anacarſis,</hi> who ſayd, that
the continuance of trauell, without intermiſſion, was a
thing impoſſible: wherefore it was requiſite for men
ſometime to ſport themſelues, that they might returne
the freſher to their honeſt labours. Whence <hi>Ouid</hi> tooke
his verſes, ſaying,
<q>
                  <l>Long cannot laſt the labour that doth want</l>
                  <l>An interchangeable repoſe ſome-while:</l>
                  <l>For it reſtores the forces languiſhant,</l>
                  <l>And doth refreſh the members ſpent with toile.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Cicero</hi> the father and light of Romane eloquence,
ſayth, that games and ſports were permitted for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing
of the mind, euen as meate and drinke for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
of the body; eſpecially after the attending of
graue and weightie affaires. But ſuch as haue made an ill
habit, and ſuffered their iudgements to be corrupted, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
choice of diſhoneſt delights to follow their ſenſes
onely, are rightly called intemperate, becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
onely the pleaſures of the body, without regard of
the mind. And they are ſo much worſe then incontinent
men: as theſe feele yet ſometimes a remorſe of their
ill actions, and thereby correct themſelues; whereas the
other perſeuere in their ill choiſe (if we may properly cal
that a choiſe which proceedeth from a corrupted iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and care not to amend themſelues; and are like to
a man full of dropſie: for their viciouſneſſe is as hopeleſſe
of recouery, as is the dropſie when it is ful growne within
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17081:114"/>
the body. And therfore they may well be accounted of a
loſt life, who haue contracted ſo ill an habit, that they ſtill
keepe reaſon ſubiect to their paſſions &amp; appetites, which
is called by <hi>Plotinus</hi> the infirmity of the mind. But where
Temperance ruleth &amp; bridleth the inordinate delights, it
is not ſo: for this vertue which is the meane in all actions,
and a ſeemlineſſe in all things appertaining to ciuill life,
doth increaſe mans praiſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations, multiplieth
honor vpon him, lengtheneth his life, and lightneth the
burthen of all his troubles: finally it ſo faſhioneth a man,
as whether he be alone or in company, whether he be in
publike or in priuat, he neuer vndertaketh any thing but
that which carieth withall reputation, dignitie &amp; honor.
For it withholdeth him from all that is vnſeemly, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
him to all that is honeſt and commendable. Neither
is this vertue exerciſed only in things appertaining to the
appetite, but (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) ſhe is the conſeruer of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
and by <hi>Plato</hi> his opinion, ſhe ſtretcheth her power
to thoſe actions that appertaine to Fortitude alſo. For ſhe
teacheth man to know the meane of fearfulnes in caſes of
danger apparant, &amp; in what meaſure paine or trouble is to
be endured. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſaid ſhe was the mean of al things:
and therfore as the beauty of the body is a meet &amp; ſeemly
diſpoſition of the members, breeding grateful ſweetnes,
and being tempered with freſh colours, draweth the eyes
of men to behold it with wonder &amp; delight: euen ſo this
vertue cauſeth al the actions of a temperate man with her
bright ſhining light to be admired and extolled; for ſhe is
called by <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the rule of al decency &amp; comelines.
Of her hath youth more need (according to <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi>
then old age, becauſe young men are much more ſtirred
with concupiſcence and vnruly affections then old men.
And the Philoſophers haue aſſigned her for companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
ſhamefaſtnes (which holdeth men from doing any filthy
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17081:114"/>
act) honeſtie, abſtinence, continency (which bridleth the
concupiſcible paſſions that they ouer-rule not the will)
manſuetude or mildnes (which tempereth the fury of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)
modeſtie (which is the rule of decent motions of the
body) and to be ſhort, al thoſe gifts of the mind which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
ſeemlines and decency, of which we ſhal parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
ſay ſomewhat as briefly as we may. And becauſe
this vertue ſtretcheth her branches ſo far, <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid it was
hard to define her, and more hard to vſe her: the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe is hardly diſcerned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other vertues: the other,
becauſe we bring with vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our mothers wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>b the deſire
of delight, wherby we are noriſhed, grow, &amp; draw out the
line of our life: for which cauſe <hi>Ariſt.</hi> ſaid, that it was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to reſiſt the pleaſures of the body, then pain.</p>
            <p>Next followes the excellent vertue of Liberality, which
is buſied about giuing and receiuing conueniently, and
is placed between two extremes; the one Auarice, which
taketh more or giueth leſſe then is meet: the other Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie,
which giues more then is conuenient: and he that
can cary himſelf euen between theſe two extremes, may
iuſtly be called a liberall man; giuing where, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſuch
perſons, and in ſuch ſort as is fit, for reſpect of honeſtie.
Vnto liberality is ioyned magnificence, which is a vertue
concerning riches alſo; which the magnificall man vſeth
in great things, and ſuch as are to haue long continuance,
&amp; are done in reſpect of vertue, as ſumptuous buildings,
rich furnitures, and the like: therfore a poore man cannot
actually attaine to be either magnificent or liberal. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberall
man is not magnificent, becauſe magnificence is
more then liberalitie: but the magnificent man is liberal.</p>
            <p>Arme in arme with Magnificence goeth Magnanimity,
waited vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Manſuetude, deſire of honor, veritie, affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blity
&amp; vrbanity. Al which vertues appertain to ciuil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
&amp; are very profitable, breeding dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, honeſty,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17081:115"/>
dignitie and honour. And though honor be reckoned in
the number of thoſe things that are called exterior goods
yet is it highly to be priſed among all other, becauſe it is
the certaine token of vertuous life, and is the due reward
of vertue. For vertue hath two ſorts of rewards: the one
that is outward, and that is honour (which cometh from
others that honor vertue, and is not in the vertuous man
himſelfe): the other inward, which is felicitie, the true
and perfecteſt end of all our vertuous actions whiles we
are aliue. And man hauing all theſe vertuous habits in
him, gotten by continuall wel doing, which conſiſteth in
particulars: he hath alſo need of the conuerſation of other
men, leſt the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of doing vertuouſly ſhold faile him.
For though a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue neuer ſo perfect a knowledge of al
the vertues, vnles he put them in action, he can neuer be
happie. And ſpecially therfore is friendſhip neceſſary for
him, which either is a vertue, or faſt linked to vertue, and
groweth out of the loue which men beare, firſt to their
parents and kinſmen, next to their citizens or countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and laſtly to ſtrangers. For as concerning ciuill fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie,
man cannot, nor ought not to be alone: in which
reſpect conuerſation and friendſhip are neceſſary for the
accompliſhment of the ſame. Some therefore haue ſayd,
that it were as hurtfull to take the bright ſhining beames
of the Sunne from the world, as to depriue men of the
benefite of friendſhip: ſince without friends, a man is ſo
farre from being happie, as it may be ſaid, he cannot liue,
or be at all. This friendſhip is a communion and knitting
together of minds, which neither length of time, diſtance
of place, great proſperitie, nor great aduerſitie, ne yet any
other grieuous accident may ſeuer or ſeparate. And <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi>
though all his drift were to raiſe man from all baſe
affects of the mind, and to ſettle him in contemplation,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:17081:115"/>
yet he thought friendſhip neceſſary no leſſe for the mind
then for the body. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayd, that he that liued alone
could be none other then either a God or a brute beaſt.
Solitarineſſe then is euill for all ſorts of men, but moſt
of all for yong men, who wanting experience in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
haue great neede of the good inſtructions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
of others. Therefore <hi>Crates</hi> the Philoſopher
ſeeing a yong man alone, went vnto him, &amp; asked of him
what he was doing ſo all alone: and the young man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering,
that he was diſcourſing with himſelfe: take heed
(ſaid <hi>Crates</hi> then) that thou talk not with an il man. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
wiſely, that a man void of prudence (as yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
commonly are) is like to buſie his head with ill thoughts,
which will prouoke him to ill deeds alſo. Conuerſation
therfore and friendſhip are neceſſary for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ciuill felicitie, which without loue cannot be.
And that friendſhip is firme and durable which groweth
out of vertue, and from ſimilitude of behauiour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
<hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that beauty beareth the greateſt ſway in
friendſhip, but that is the beauty of the mind, which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
brings forth: but if to the beauty of the mind, that of
the body alſo be ioyned, they both do the ſooner and the
faſter tie together the minds of vertuous men. For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
beauty of the body prepareth the way to the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
of the other inward of the mind, which (as hath bin
ſayd) is indeed the true man: but he that loueth but the
body, loueth not the man, but that which nature hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him for an inſtrument. And if this beauty of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
happen to draw any man to loue a foule or diſhoneſt
mind, that loue cannot be termed rightly friendſhip, but
a filthy and loathſome coniunction of two bodies, too
much frequented by yong men with naughtie women,
who are not onely vnworthy any loue, but ought of all
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17081:116"/>
men to be eſchued as abhominable, and driuen out of all
well ordered Common-weales. This friendſhip tieth
(though with diuers reſpects) children to their parents,
kinred to kinred, the husband to the wife, and the minds
of men of valour &amp; vertue faſt together, as a thing agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to all the qualities which our ſoule containeth: but
this friendſhip betweene men of valour and courage,
ſpringeth from that faculty of the mind, whence cometh
reaſonable anger, the heate whereof ſtirreth &amp; inflameth
the mindes of ſuch men to valour and fortitude. And
though this friendſhip be good and commendable, yet is
that more firme &amp; permanent which groweth out of the
that part of the mind which is garniſhed with reaſon and
vertuous habits: for it bindeth mens minds ſo faſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and breedeth ſo firme a conſent in them, that they
become as one; in ſo much as it ſeemeth that one mind
dwelleth in two bodies to guide and rule them. Which
made <hi>Zeno</hi> ſay that his friend was another himſelf. Now
albeit we ſee dayly friendſhips to be broken off vpon
fleight occaſions, yet is that not to be imputed to any
imperfection in the nature of friendſhip.</p>
            <p>It is maruel (ſaid Captain <hi>Carleil)</hi> that friends ſhould
ſo eaſily break the bonds of friendſhip, if they were ſo faſt
knit as you haue ſayd: the cauſe whereof were worth the
knowing.</p>
            <p>That ſhall I declare vnto you (ſaid I:) Many apparan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of friendſhip there are, which be as farre from true
friendſhip, as the painted image of a man is from a man
indeed: for ſome are friends for profit, ſome for pleaſure,
and ſome for other reſpects: which reſpects failing, loue
alſo quaileth; and ſo the foundation of friendſhip being
gone, it muſt needs fall to the ground. Others firſt loue,
and after beginne to iudge of the perſon: and when they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17081:116"/>
find themſelues deceiued in their expectation whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it were, they vntie the knot of friendſhip faſter then
they haſted to knit the ſame before. But if iudgement
leade the daunce, as it ought to do, and that a man chuſe
to loue another, becauſe he eſteemeth him worthy for his
vertues to be beloued; ſuch friendſhip is ſure and firme,
neuer to be diſſolued, nay not ſo much as a miſlike can
grow betweene ſuch friends. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> holdeth, that
diſcord cannot poſſibly dwell together with friendſhip.
All other friendſhips are ſubiect to quarrels &amp; diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
but eſpecially that which is grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profit: wheras
thoſe friends whom vertue coupleth together, as they
haue but one wil, ſo haue they all things common, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the lawes of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> Which lawes <hi>Plato</hi> allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,
and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> likewiſe, though in the communion of
goods he were contrary to <hi>Plato,</hi> affirming that where
all things were common, it was not poſſible that the
commonwealth could ſtand. The ſtedfaſtneſſe of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
therefore conſiſteth in the communion and equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of minds, betweene which neither anger, diſſention,
nor ingratitude can grow; for true friends prouoke not
one another with contention, anger or vnthankfulneſſe.
And in regard hereof, the opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> was, that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantnes
and cheerfulneſſe was fitter among friends then
grauitie or ſeueritie.</p>
            <p>But I pray you (ſayd Captaine <hi>Norreis)</hi> tell vs whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this friendſhip you ſpeake of may be between many
or no?</p>
            <p>Sir (anſwered I) a man cannot in truth be friend to
many at once, in this degree of friendſhip which we are
treating of. For ſince the worker of this faſt friendſhip, is
the likenes of minds and conditions. As there is a variety
of faces infinite, inſomuch as it is a very rare thing
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17081:117"/>
to find two altogether like the one to the other: ſo falleth
it out likewiſe in minds: and the ſaying is, that one mind
ruleth two bodies, and not mo; according to which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
friendſhip cannot be in perfection betweene many.
The reaſon wherof may be, that loue and true affection
being the moſt excellent thing among the effects of
friendſhip, and things excellent being rare, therfore true
friendſhip is ſo rare, as not onely in our age, but alſo in all
ages paſt, we find ſcarce two or three couples of friends
to be recorded. Neither can a man indeed deuide his
loue into many ſhares, without impairing it; nor giue
like helpe, vſe like conuerſation, or do other friendly offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
toward many, which are needfull, and required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two faſt friends, ſuch as we ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell (ſayd ſir <hi>Robert Dillon)</hi> why you make
friendſhip ſo rare a matter, when dayly example ſheweth
vs, that there are many men who haue many friends. Let
vs conſider priuatly or publikely our owne acquaintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and we ſhall ſee ſo many kind offices of friendſhip
ſtirring, as it may be thought, the auncient times brought
forth men more ſauage &amp; vnfit for amity; or elſe that our
times are happier in that point then theirs. I remember
yet that I haue read of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> how he was wont
to ſay, that a man ſhold not come home from the pallace
vntill he had purchaſed ſome friends. The like is written
of <hi>Scipio</hi> the yonger, who affirmed that the firmeſt and
moſt profitable poſſeſſion that a man could haue in this
world, was the hauing of many friends. Alſo the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Traian</hi> was accuſtomed to ſay, that he accounted
that day loſt wherein he had not gotten one friend.</p>
            <p>All this (ſaid I) is true: but many are friends in name,
who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be put to trial proue nothing ſo. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was it ſaid, that there were many apparances &amp; ſorts
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17081:117"/>
of friendſhip, which properly are not to be eſteemed
true friendſhip, but are rather to be termed ciuil beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or publike friendſhip; being a certaine generall
loue, which the nature of man, and the communion of
countries breedeth of it ſelfe. And this loue maketh one
man courteous, gracious, and affable to another, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
not from his owne nature which hath framed
him ſociable; it maketh him apt to help, and ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
and to vſe all the offices of humanitie and beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
that become him towards all men: but ſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſuch as either countrey, neighbourhood, likeneſſe
of exerciſes or delights, or ſuch like things haue vnited
and knit together. All which breed rather an accidentall
then a ſound and true friendſhip. For among many ſuch,
few will be found that will expoſe themſelues to perils
or dangers for their friends, or in reſpect of their friends
ſafetie will ſet light by their goods, yea their owne liues,
as theſe few recorded in auncient writings haue done.
This made <hi>Demetrius Falareus</hi> to ſay, that true friends
went willingly to be partakers of their friends proſperity
if they were called therunto: but that if aduerſitie or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
did befal them, they taried not then to be called,
but ran of themſelues to offer their helpe and comfort.
And <hi>Anacarſis</hi> eſteemed one good friend worth many
common &amp; ordinary, ſuch as we dayly ſee called friends,
either for countries ſake, or becauſe they keepe company
together in trauell by land or ſea, or traffike, or ſerue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the warres, or ſuch like occaſions: all which are
in truth but ſhadowes rather of friendſhip, then friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
indeed. A friend is not ſo eaſily to be diſcerned, but
that a man muſt (as the prouerbe ſaith) eate a buſhell of
ſalt with him before he account him a true friend. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
followeth, that there can be no perfect friendſhip,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:17081:118"/>
but after long experience and conuerſation. <hi>Plato</hi> reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
this, ſaid, that friendſhip was an habit gotten by loue
long time growne: and in another place, that it was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueterate
loue, which is all one; to wit, that it muſt be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed,
and confirmed by long tract of time. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
though loue be the meane to knit friendſhip, yet is it
not friendſhip it ſelfe, but the roote rather of the ſame.
And as without the root nothing can proſper nor grow:
ſo without loue no friendſhip can proſper. Thus then
you may vnderſtand, that true friendſhip is not gotten
by publike meetings, walkings or trading, nor in one day
or two; and that all ſorts of beneuolence or mutuall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of courteſie and ciuilitie, or euery ſhew of loue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not vp a friendſhip. For once againe I will tell you
that friendſhip is ſo excellent a thing as it cannot be in
perfection, but onely betweene two good and vertuous
men of like commendable life and behauiour. That it is
the greateſt externall good that can be purchaſed in this
life, and that it is the ſame which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid was more
needfull then iuſtice, and therefore highly to be priſed
of the man that laboured for ciuill happineſſe. Who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he haue all thoſe exteriour goods which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to ciuil life, as wealth, health, children, and ſuch like,
without which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> holdeth that no man can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
happie in this world, yet if he want friends, he lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a principal inſtrument for his felicitie; not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the many benefits which friends bring with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but chiefly for the delight of his own vertuous operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
and the exerciſe of the like with them, when they ſhall be
induced by him to vertuous actions: which breedeth an
vnſpeakable contentment. Beſides that, ſolitarineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaueth
a man of the ſweeteſt part of his life that is the
conuerſation among friends, increaſing the contentation
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:17081:118"/>
of a happie man, as he is to be a ciuill man: for of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſolitarineſſe which appertaineth to contemplation,
this place ſerueth not to ſpeake. Wee may therefore
right well conclude, that without friendſhip a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
haue his ciuill felicitie accompliſhed. But if I ſhould
ſay all that might be ſaid concerning friendſhip, I ſhould
be too long; neither would I haue ſaid ſo much thereof,
had it not bin to ſhew you, how ſolitarineſſe cannot ſerue
the turne of him that would be happie in this life. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
companie being neceſſary to felicitie, will mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
vnto the happie man occaſions to vſe his liberalitie:
for ſweete and pleaſing conuerſation, and to ſupply the
wants &amp; neceſſities of friends, is the true &amp; comfortable
ſauce to friendſhip. It will make him to ſhew the greatnes
of his courage in great things, guided alwayes by iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and reaſon, and to direct all his actions to the mark
of honour, a thing eſteemed (as we haue ſaid) among all
others the greateſt externall good: not that he ſhal ſet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
for his end (for that he knoweth would be vnfitting)
but honorable and vertuous actions, contenting himſelfe
that honor be the reward of them, and vertue be the hire
for her ſelfe. For to her, others will giue honour as to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
thing, whereſoeuer they ſhall ſee her. But Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
is not a vertue fit for euery man, but for ſuch onely
as are furniſhed with all other vertues, and among ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
men are eſteemed in the higheſt degree. And he
that is not ſuch a man, and will yet make a ſhew of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie,
will be but laughed at and ſcorned, becauſe
vice and Magnanimitie, for the contrarietie that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, cannot dwell together in any wiſe; the one
deſeruing all honour, and the other all reproch &amp; blame.
For Magnanimitie produceth effects agreeable to all the
reſt of the vertues, which is the cauſe that ſo ſingular a gift
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:17081:119"/>
of the mind is not attained but with great difficultie: but
the more trauell is taken in getting it, the greater is the
praiſe to him that hath purchaſed the ſame. He that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with this vertue, ioyeth when great honours
fall vpon him, he little eſteemeth any perill, when hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
inuiteth him thereunto, and not anger, nor fury, nor
deſire of reuenge, nor onely reſpect of honour. In matter
of riches he alwayes obſerueth a due temper as wel as the
liberall man, whom he excelleth in this, that the Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
man exerciſeth his vertue in high matters that
beare with them dignitie and importance; whereas the
liberall man is buſied in things of leſſe moment. He hath
alſo a due regard concerning honours, in the purchaſe
whereof he is not iniurious or threatning, nor puffed vp
with pride or ambition, but knowing right well that
who ſo offereth iniury to another, cannot be rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Magnanimous, he abſtaineth from doing any: and
if any man haue offered him iniurie, he holdeth it for the
greateſt and honorableſt reuenge to forgiue, though he
haue the partie in his power, &amp; may ſatisfie himſelfe; and
thinketh that the greateſt diſpleaſure he can worke to his
enemy, is to ſhew himſelfe euermore garniſhed with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Moreouer, he is alwayes higher then his fortune, be
it neuer ſo great, and be ſhe neuer ſo contrary ſhe cannot
ouerthrow him. He will neuer refuſe to ſpend his life
(though it be deere vnto him, knowing his owne worth)
for the defence of his countrey, of his friends, of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
of his religion, or for Gods cauſe, with whom he is
continually in thought, though he be bodily here below
on earth conuerſant among men, neuer buſied in baſe
conceits or imaginations. His reputation is ſo deere vnto
him, as he wil ſooner looſe his life, then ſpot it by any vile
act: wherefore if he be in the field with his armes for any
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17081:119"/>
the cauſes before ſaid, he neuer turneth his backe to flie,
but fighteth with a firme reſolution, either to ouercome
or die. He is much more ready to beſtow a good turne
or benefite then to receiue it; holding that it is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
for a man to part with his goods, then to take at
any other mans hand: neuertheles if he chance to receiue
any profite or commoditie by any other, he layeth it vp
carefully in his remembrance, and neuer thinketh himſelf
out of debt vntil he hath requited it double at the leaſt. A
propertie well becomming a diuine mind rather then an
humane: for of al others Ingratitude is the vileſt &amp; abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minableſt
vice, which among the Perſians was ſeuerely
puniſhed. A vice that may be accounted not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to honeſtie, but alſo a cruell beaſtlineſſe. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mike
Poet ſaith, that wicked is the man that knoweth
how to receiue a benefit, but not to recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the ſame.
Which ſentence is in effect alſo in <hi>Euripides,</hi> who ſayth,
that he who forgetteth benefits receiued, can neuer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
of an honeſt or generous mind. Our Chriſtian
writers haue ſaid, that it is enemie to grace, enemie to our
ſaluation, to our life, &amp; all ciuill ſocietie. And accordingly
<hi>Seneca</hi> was of opinion, that no vice was more contrary to
humanitie, or did ſooner diſſolue the vnitie of mens
minds then ingratitude, more abhominable before God,
or more odious to al vertuous &amp; honeſt minds. But amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
vngrateful wretches, he that ſheweth ingratitude towards
thoſe that haue inſtructed him in learning and vertue, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
to him the gate by which he muſt enter to attain
to his felicitie, is the moſt beaſtly of all others: for that to
them he ought to haue more regard then to his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from whom though he hath his being, yet from the
other he hath his well being, and is made fit and capable
of dignitie and honour by the meane of vertue. And as
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:17081:120"/>
gratitude or thankfulnes is the ornament of all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
from which proceedeth the loue between the child
and the parent, betweene the ſcholer and his maſter, the
charitie towards our countrey, the honor toward God,
the friendſhip betweene men, and the reuerence towards
our ſuperiours: ſo no doubt ingratitude cannot be but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to all theſe, and therefore the fouleſt of al
other vices; from which all the euils in the world pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
to the perpetuall infamie of him that is vnthankful.
Neither is it to be wondred, that ſuch men (like infernall
furies) caſt behind them Religion, pietie, loue, faith, all
goodnes, iuſtice, and humanitie it ſelfe, ſeeking like raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
wolues to liue and feed vpon the bloud of other
men. Not onely from priuate houſes therefore, but from
Cities and Common-weales, ought this peſtiferous ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to be carefully baniſhed, as an infection among
people, &amp; the ruine of al conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, leſt their contagion
ſpred that ſame euil ouer all the reſt. <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who was
the firſt that euer was called a Philoſopher (which is as
much as to ſay, a louer of wiſedome, and conſequently
of truth) did forbid all men to lodge an vnthankfull man
vnder his roofe. And becauſe the Swallow (as <hi>Plutarke</hi>
ſaith) betokeneth ingratitude, he would not haue them
to be ſuffered to neſtle in a houſe. And to ſay truly, ſuch
men are worſe then the moſt ſauage and cruell beaſts of
the field: for of the gratitude of ſome of them, euen the
fierceſt, many moſt notable examples haue bin recorded;
namely this: One <hi>Elpi</hi> a dweller in the Ile of <hi>Samos,</hi> who
traded into Afrike, comming with his ſhip on that coaſt,
went a ſhore, where he met a Lion, in whoſe teeth a bone
of ſome beaſt ſtucke in ſuch ſort as he could not cloſe his
mouth, or make any ſhift to eate: <hi>Elpi</hi> pittying the beaſt,
who ſeemed to craue at his hands releefe, tooke out the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17081:120"/>
bone, and ſo deliuered him of that miſchiefe. But this
thankfull Lion failed not euery day after ſo long as his
ſhip lay there at rode to bring him duly his ſhare of what
prey ſoeuer he tooke, which was ſufficient to feed him
and all his company. Yea euen among ſerpents we reade
examples of thankfulneſſe: for it is written, that a certaine
child brought vp a young ſerpent, and fed it familiarly a
long time; but when it was growne great, one day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the inſtinct of nature, it left the child and went to
the woods. It happened that ſome while after that child
being become now meete to trauell, paſſing thorough a
wood was aſſaulted by robbers, who hauing taken him
were purpoſed to haue ſlaine him: but he with pittifull
voice intreating and crying to them that they ſhould
ſpare his life, the ſame ſerpent (who by chance was then
neere at hand) heard his crie, and knowing his voice,
came ſuddenly out with ſuch fury vpon the theeues, that
they were glad to take their heeles, and to leaue the yong
man there to ſaue themſelues, who by the thankfulneſſe
of the ſerpent was thus ſaued. But becauſe you may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make doubt of theſe hiſtories, ſuppoſing them to be
old and fabulous, giue me leaue (beſides mine author) to
recite vnto you a ſtrange example of gratitude in a beaſt,
which I haue vnderſtood from a perſon of ſuch credite,
as I dare auouch it for a truth, ſince himſelfe affirmed that
he knew the gentleman in the weſt country of England,
to whom the thing happened euen of late yeeres. This
gentleman had a maſtiffe, which he made much account
of becauſe he was very faire and hardie, and therefore
cheriſhed him ſo as as his neighbours tooke knowledge
of his affection to the dogge: in reſpect whereof, though
they receiued harme from him (for I muſt tel you he had
a qualitie to worry ſheepe by night) yet ſought they no
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17081:121"/>
redreſſe, but by complaint to the maſter, who in no caſe
could be induced to beleeue that his dogge had that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
ſo cunning was he to take his times and to hide his
fault. Howbeit vpon the renewing of complaints he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a muzzle to be made, and euery night to be put on
his dogs head; ſuppoſing thereby to be not onely aſſured
himſelf, but to ſatisfie his neighbours alſo, that it was not
he that committed thoſe outrages. But for all this, neither
the harme nor the complaints were ſtopped; for this dog
had gotten the knack with his feet to pull off his muzzle,
and then going abroade to do his feate, at his returne he
would thruſt his head into the muzzle againe, in ſuch ſort
as any man would haue freed him of any ſuch fact. Yet
no other dogge being neere to do the like but he, and ſtill
the harme being freſhly done, his maſter once reſolued
to watch his dogge a whole night to ſatisfie himſelfe and
his neighbours of the truth: which thing he did ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly,
as he diſcouered his dogs ſubtiltie, and ſaw him
vnmuzzle himſelfe, go abroade, and returne ſo cleaned
as no ſpot of bloud could be diſcerned about him, and
thruſting his head into his muzzle to lie him downe as
if he had bin free from any ſuch offence. The gentleman
thus reſolued of his dogges conditions, went to bed, and
ſlept the reſt of the night; and the next morning coming
downe, he found his dogge lying in the hall, and looking
ſomewhat angerly vpon him, he ſpoke theſe words, Ah
thou ſheepbiter, thou ſheepbiter, thou muſt be hanged;
and ſo indeed had purpoſed with himſelfe to haue had
him executed. But whiles he was buſied in ſome houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
affaires, the dog ſtole out of doores and ran away;
ſo as when his maſter gaue order how he ſhould be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
he was no where to be found. And theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the tale I haue the rather related, that you may
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17081:121"/>
wonder at the vnderſtanding of this beaſt. Now for his
gratitude, thus it fell out: Some two yeeres after or leſſe
that he was thus runne away to eſcape hanging, it was
the gentlemans chance vpon ſome occaſions to trauell
on foote through the countrey, and in a certaine wood
fit for ſuch purpoſes, he met two tinkers that ſet vpon him
ſuddenly to rob him: theſe two tinkers had with them a
maſtiffe that caried their packes, as many in England do;
which dog when in the fight (for the gentleman defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
himſelfe manfully) he had knowne either by his
voice or otherwiſe his old maſter, he ranged himſelfe to
his partie, and ſet vpon his latter maſters ſo fiercely, that
they loſt their courages, and being wounded ran away:
and then the gentleman alſo refigured his old ſeruant, by
whoſe meanes he was deliuered from ſo great a danger;
and ſo tooke home his dog again, who had in the meane
time forgone his naughtie qualitie, and was euer after
much made of by his maſter as he right well deſerued.
How ſhamefull a thing is it therefore to man, that brute
beaſts ſhould giue him examples of gratitude; and he
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, on whom God hath beſtowed ſo great a gift
as reaſon to diſcerne the good from the bad, ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
follow the example of the worſt ſort of beaſts in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ill, then of ſuch as by naturall inſtinct ſhew him the
way to goodneſſe? For the vngratefull man is of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the wolfe, of whom it is written, that being ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
when it was yong by an Ewe; when it grew great, in
recompence of his nouriſhment he deuoured her: decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that the wickednes of the vnthankfull perſon cannot
be ouercome by any benefits, be they neuer ſo great. But
of this abhominable vice we haue ſaid enough, and more
then needed, but that I was willing to giue you to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
how farre it ought to be from him that is vertuous,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17081:122"/>
and would be rayſed to the reputation of a magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
man: of whom returning to ſpeake, thus much
is to be added, that he vſeth himſelfe and all his abilitie
euermore with greatneſſe of courage, ſpending when
occaſion ſerueth magnifically, in workes worthy admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and in helping of others honorably. Towards
all men he is courteous, gentle, and affable, neuer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
occaſion of offence or miſlike in his conuerſation:
ſuch due regard he hath to place, time, perſons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
circumſtances, ſo as he neuer doth anything vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely
or vnworthy himſelfe. And ſo he tempereth
pleaſantneſſe with grauitie, benignitie with dignitie, that
to the humble he neuer ſeemeth proud, nor to the great
ones neuer baſe or demiſſe: but valewing him neither
more nor leſſe then he is worth, inſiſteth ſtill vpon truth,
diſcouering himſelfe modeſtly and decently as he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a man of vertue, and with graue, yet gentle ſpeeches
giuing ſatisfaction to all perſons of what degree ſoeuer.
And finally in all his actions and behauior he taketh great
heed that he commit not any thing whereby he may
haue cauſe to die his cheeke with the purple bluſh; but
euermore deſerue of all men praiſe and commendation.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould not interrupt, or prolong your diſcourſe too
much, I would be glad (ſaid Captaine <hi>Norreis)</hi> to learne
what is the cauſe that ſhamefaſtneſſe maketh the red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
come into a mans face, and that feare doth make him
pale?</p>
            <p>The reaſon is (ſaid I) becauſe ſhamefaſtnes ſpringeth
in vs for ſome thing that we thinke blame-worthy: and
the minde finding that what is to be reprehended in vs,
commeth from abroade, it ſeeketh to hide the fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and to auoide the reproch thereof, by ſetting that
colour on our face as a maske to defend vs withall. And
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:17081:122"/>
albeit that ſhamefaſtneſſe or bluſhing ſeeme to be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſtill confeſſion of the fault, yet it carieth with it
ſuch a grace, as paſſeth not without commendation, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in youth, as hath bin ſaid. But feare which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from imagination of ſome euill to come, and is at
hand, maketh the mind which conceiueth it to ſtartle,
and looking about for meanes of defence, it calleth al the
bloud into the innermoſt parts, ſpecially to the heart, as
the chiefe fort or caſtle; whereby the exterior parts being
abandoned and depriued of heate, and of that colour
which it had from the bloud and the ſpirits, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
nothing but paleneſſe. And hereof it commeth to
paſſe, that we ſee ſuch men as are ſurpriſed with feare, to
be not only pale, but to tremble alſo, as if their members
would ſhake off from their bodies: euen as the leaues fall
from the tree as ſoone as the the cold wether cauſeth the
ſappe to be called from the branches to the roote, for the
preſeruation of the vertue vegetatiue. But ſuch feare is
vnſeemly, and a token of a cowardly mind, and is ſeldom
ſeene in men of valour. For they are neuer ſo ſuddenly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken
by any humane accident, but that they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and know that their vertue is to be made knowne
in fearfull and terrible occaſions, which are the very mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and ſubiect of their glory. Neither doth fortune with
her ſmiling, ſo aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that they look for her frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
countenance to follow: and therefore in proſperity
prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for aduerſity; whereby when others fal
vnder her ſtrokes, they not only feare her not, but coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
fight againſt her, &amp; ouercome her. Yet you muſt
vnderſtand that euery ſort of feare is not reprochfull: for
that feare which withholdeth men from doing euill, or
things that may breed them ſhame, is worthy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
which made <hi>Xenophon</hi> to ſay that he was moſt fearful
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:17081:123"/>
to do any thing that was diſhoneſt. And much more
commendable is that feare which groweth from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
and reſpect we beare to God, to our parents, and
our ſuperiours: for that leades a man to goodnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the other bringeth a man to all euill and wickedneſſe.
And now hauing ſatisfied your demaund, let me briefly
runne through the reſt of the vertues before mentioned
in their order. Next therefore to Magnanimitie cometh
the goodly vertue of Manſuetude, being a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
wrathfulneſſe with deſire of reuenge, ſtirred vp
in the iraſcible appetite in reſpect of ſome iniury done
or ſuppoſed to be done, and coldneſſe or lacke of feeling
of wrongs when they are offered: which coldneſſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibilitie
of wrongs, is by this vertue kindled or ſtirred
vp to feele and miſlike the iniuries which vnruly perſons
do oftentimes offer to men of vertue. For as it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vpon many occaſions to be angry, not with intention
to offend others, but for the defence of a mans ſelfe, and
of thoſe to whom he is tyed, and ſpecially of his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
leſt by being too dull and careleſſe in regarding iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
done vnto him, he become apt to be ridden and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by euery ruffling companion: ſo to be either too
ſudden or outragious in anger, and thereby to be incited
to do any act contrary to reaſon, cannot in any ſort agree
with vertue, or become a gentleman. For to ſpeak of that
bearing which is vndertaken for Chriſtian humilitie, or
feare of offending God, appertaineth not to this place.
This vertue then of Manſuetude, is ſhe that holdeth
the reines in her hand, to bridle the vehemency of anger,
ſhewing when, where, with whom, for what cauſe, how
farre foorth, and how long it is fit and conuenient to be
angry; and likewiſe to let them looſe, and to ſpurre for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the mind that is reſtie or ſlow in apprehending the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17081:123"/>
iuſt cauſes of wrath, with regard of like circumſtances:
directing the particular actions of the vertuous man in
ſuch caſes according to reaſon; to whom ſhe, as all other
the vertues, is to haue a continuall eye and regard in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing.</p>
            <p>Deſire of Honor ſucceedeth next, and is a vertue that
is buſied about the ſame ſubiect with Magnanimitie.
For as the magnanimous man reſpecteth onely great and
exceſſiue honors: ſo doth this vertue teach the meane in
purchaſing of ſmaller honours or dignities, ſuch as ciuill
men of all ſorts are to be employed in. For as there are
ſome that ſeeke by all meanes poſſible to catch at euery
ſhew of honor, at euery office or degree that is to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and ſpare not to vndergo any indignity, or to try any
baſe or vnlawfull meanes to compaſſe the ſame, heauing
and ſhouing like men in a throng to come to be formoſt,
though they deſerue to be far behind: ſo are there others
ſo ſcrupulous and ſo addicted to their eaſe and quiet, that
they cannot endure to take vpon them any paines, or any
place that may bring them either trouble or hazard; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
refuſing in that reſpect, and deſpiſing al dignities
and offices, together with the honor they might purchaſe
by the ſame. The firſt ſort of men are called ambitious:
the other inſenſible and careleſſe of their reputation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
which two extremes this vertue hath her place,
to keepe the firſt from ſeeking, not by vertue, but by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
deceit, or other vnfit meanes to compaſſe honors,
dignities, or authoritie, as many do, ſlandering and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
ſuch as are competitors with them; or elſe moſt
baſely flattering, and with cappe and knee crouching to
thoſe that they thinke may yeeld them helpe, or fauour
them in their purchaſe, which they ſeeke and beg to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their owne vnworthineſſe: and to quicken the other,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:17081:124"/>
whoſe mindes haue no care of their credit &amp; reputation,
but liue in baſe companies, and eſtrange themſelues from
all ciuill conuerſation, like brute and ſauage beaſts. And
in this reſpect is ſhe worthy high eſtimation, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for all them that eſteeme true honour (as they ought)
to be the moſt excellent good among exteriour things:
who neuertheleſſe temper themſelues from ambition, ſo
as they are not drawne to commit any vile or baſe act for
the atchieuing of the ſame, but ſtriue euermore by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to purchaſe their honor &amp; reputation. Neither is this
vertue all one with Magnanimitie, becauſe it requireth
not ſo excellent an habit as doth Magnanimitie, though
they both be buſied about the ſame ſubiect: for between
them is the like difference as is betweene Magnificence
and Liberalitie, whereof we haue already ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Veritie is the vertue which followeth in order, by
which a man in all his conuerſation, in all his actions, and
in al his words ſheweth himſelfe ſincere and ful of truth,
making his words and his deeds alwayes to agree, ſo as
he neuer ſayeth one thing for another, but ſtill affirmeth
thoſe things that are, and denieth thoſe that are not. The
two extremes of this vertue, are on the one ſide diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or ieſting, called in Greeke <hi>Ironia,</hi> and on the other
ſide boaſting. For ſome there are that ſeeke by this vice
to purchaſe reputation and credit, or profit; or elſe euen
for fooliſh delight giue themſelues to vanting and telling
ſuch ſtrange things of themſelues, as though they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
yet wil they needs haue men forſooth to beleeue
them. Others for the ſame reſpects diſſemble the good
parts that haply are in them, &amp; ſeeme willing to make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
beleeue that their good qualities are not ſo great as they
are; with a counterfeit modeſtie faining alwayes to abaſe
themſelues in ſuch ſort as men may eaſily diſcouer them
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17081:124"/>
to be plaine hypocrites, and that vnder pretence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
they labour to ſet pride on horſebacke: yea ſome
euen of meriment, or by long cuſtome of lying, thinke it
ſport ſufficient neuer to tell any thing but exorbitant and
ſtrange lies, inſomuch as in fine, though they wittingly
ſpeak no truth, yet themſelues fal to beleeuing what they
ſay to be moſt true. Betweene theſe two vices ſitteth this
bright-ſhining vertue of Truth (as ſhe is a morall vertue)
by which men vſe the benefit of their ſpeech to that true
vſe for which it is beſtowed vpon them by God, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
to themſelues not onely honour and praiſe, but alſo
truſt and credit with all men, ſo as their words are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
as oracles: whereas of the others, no man maketh
more account then of the ſound of bels, or of old wiues
tales. This is that excellent vertue that is of all others the
beſt fitting a Gentleman, and maketh him reſpected and
welcom in all companies: which made <hi>Pythagoras</hi> to ſay,
that next vnto God, truth in man was moſt to be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced:
whoſe contrary likewiſe is of all other things the
moſt vnfitting, the very deſtroier of humane conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the mother of ſcandals, and the deadly enemy of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
the odiouſneſſe whereof may be diſcerned by this,
that albeit we ſtick not ſometimes to confeſſe our faults,
though they be very great, to our friends, yet we are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to let them know that we haue told a lie.</p>
            <p>The vertue of Affabilitie which ſucceedeth, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
meane, by which men ſeeke to liue and conuerſe
with others, ſo as they may purchaſe the fauor and good
liking of all men, not forgetting their owne grauitie and
reputation. And becauſe there are ſome that thinke with
pleaſing ſpeeches and pleaſant conceits to be welcom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all companies, they giue themſelues to flatter, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
and extoll euery man, to ſooth all that they heare
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17081:125"/>
ſpoken, and ſtill to ſmile or laugh in euery mans face; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
thereby in the end to be eſteemed but as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſycophants or baſe flatterers: and others, holding a
contrary courſe, neuer ſpeake word that may be gratefull
or pleaſing to any man, ſuppoſing thereby to be held
for graue and wiſe men, euermore oppoſing themſelues
to what others ſay, diſpraiſing al mens doings, and finally
with frowning countenance making themſelues odious
in all companies. Therefore is this excellent vertue ſet as
a meane to direct men how to vſe their words and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
in honeſt and ciuill conuerſation, that they may be
gratefull. For thereby they know how to diſtinguiſh the
degrees and qualities of perſons, of times, of places, and
by diſcreete cariage to make themſelues welcome euery
where, without touch of flattery. And Affabilitie reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
very much friendſhip in the particular actions ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
both hauing a purpoſe to pleaſe, &amp; neuer to diſpleaſe.
But betweene them there is this difference, that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
doth all things with a ſpeciall feruent affection inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
borne; whereas Affabilitie reſpecteth not the
mutual affection, but only a deſire to be generally accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and pleaſing to all good men, to euery one in their
ſeuerall degrees and qualities, and without regard of the
conditions before ſpecified. In the exerciſe of which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
among other obſeruations, this is one principall, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to let paſſe a word out of the mouth before it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
and examined whether it may offend any man
or no. For many men through lack of this conſideration
haue let ſlip words that they would afterwards haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
at a high rate, but could not; whence ariſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
great miſchiefes, as dayly experience ſheweth vs.
Laſtly, as the body hath need of reſt after trauell, ſo hath
the mind (ouerwearied with ſtudy or affaires) need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17081:125"/>
that it may return the freſher to be buſied again.
And this recreation is beſt found in certaine paſtimes or
ſports, vſed by gentlemen when they meete to be merry
together, wherein no baſeneſſe or vnſeemlineſſe is ſeene:
and therefore are theſe ſports properly called, recreations
of the mind. But becauſe in ſuch meetings where men
come to paſſe the time together, they faile in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
two wayes by exceſſe, the one contrary to the
other; therefore is the meane which teacheth the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of thoſe exceſſes, called the vertue of Vrbanitie, a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
name, which in Engliſh we cannot better, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
muſt giue it paſſe to be denizened among vs. The
one exceſſe of too much, is, when men ſeeke in ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
or meetings onely to make the company laugh,
and ſo they laugh, care not whether the occaſion be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of any wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeech or ſcurrilitie, or ouerbitter taunting,
without reſpect of perſons, and if they may breake a ieſt
vpon any man, either preſent or abſent, they will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
it to ſhew their wit, though it be neuer ſo much to
the ſhame and ignominie of the partie; yea and they will
laugh thereat themſelues ſo exceedingly, that they will
make others of force to laugh at their laughter, though
they miſlike their ſpeech. And ſuch men may be iuſtly
termed ieſters, or knauiſh fooles, ſpecially if to their words
they adde geſtures and countenances vndecent for ciuill
men, not ſparing alſo ribald ſpeeches euen in the preſence
of ſober and modeſt gentlewomen. A thing that among
honeſt and vertuous men is moſt odious, whoſe conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
ought to be farre from vncleanneſſe or malice. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to theſe are certaine perſons, who in all companies
neuer let fall any wittie ſpeech themſelues, or any merry
conceit; nor yet when they heare them proceed from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
will once affoord to grace them with ſo much as a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17081:126"/>
ſmile: but rather bend the browes thereat, or ſeeme not
to know or to conceiue any delight therein, behauing
themſelues like rude clownes which want capacitie to
comprehend the ſubſtance of a pithy &amp; pleaſant ſpeech.
Theſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth harſh and ruſtike fellowes. Now
betweene this ruſticity and this fooliſh ieſting is this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Vrbanitie the meane, which the Greeks call <hi>Eutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelia,</hi>
and teacheth a man to frame all his ſpeeches in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
and meetings where he chaunceth to be for the
reuiuing or recreating of his ſpirits, ſo as they may be
ſharpe and wittie, and yet not bitter or ouerbiting to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
nor yet to taxe or reproue any man ſo, as he may
haue iuſt cauſe to complaine: though (to ſay truth) a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
or wittie ieſt cannot be much worth, or moue men
to laugh, vnles it haue a certaine deceit or offence inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
towards ſome body, who neuertheleſſe muſt not be
ſo pricked, as he may haue cauſe to be grieued thereat,
but rather be merry at the conceit. For ſince words and
geſtures are the true tokens commonly of the qualitie of
the mind, he, that in his conuerſation cauſeth not the
ſweetnes of his mind and the candor of his nobleſt part
to ſhine through all his actions, words and geſtures, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be eſteemed a man of worth and vertue. He muſt
continually haue great regard to the time, place, perſons,
and other circumſtances, according to which he is ſo to
order his pleaſant conceits and merry ieſts, not onely to
moue meriment and laughter, but that withall he may
keepe his grauitie &amp; dignitie, and eſchue aboue all things
licentious &amp; wanton ſpeeches, which in no wiſe become
a man that is deſirous to beare vp his reputation &amp; credit
as a ciuill man. And thus hauing giuen you a taſt of euery
of the vertues aſſigned to wait vpon Magnanimity ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more amply then mine author, who hath (in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion)
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17081:126"/>
a little too briefly touched them in the deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of a magnanimous man: I will now returne to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
again, by which I am come to treate of Iuſtice; the
efficacie and power wherof is ſuch, that ſome ſages haue
held her only to be vertue, as if ſhe ſhould containe in her
al other vertues: and that the reſt that are ſeuerally named
ſhould be but as parts of her, diuerſly intituled in reſpect
of the diuers obiects, about which they are exerciſed. It is
therefore to be conſidered, that this vertue is to be taken
two waies; the one when ſhe is generally conſidered, and
then is ſhe alone al the vertues: in which reſpect <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>
was wont to ſay, that where Iuſtice was, there needed no
Fortitude. And <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> likewiſe were of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that he that was iuſt needed no lawes, becauſe
this vertue was ſufficient to keep him within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe
of liuing wel and vertuouſly. The other way is, when ſhe
is taken for one of the foure principall vertues, and ſo is
ſhe a habit, whereby is knowne what is iuſt, and the ſame
is accordingly deſired and done. This is that incorrupted
virgin, which the auncients ſo termed, becauſe ſhe is ſuch
a friend to baſhfulnes and modeſty, by which men are
made worthy reuerence, by which they learne the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of diſtributions and commutations, giuing recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to vertue as much as it deſerueth, not by equality
of number, but by equality of meaſure: to much vertue
great reward, to meane vertue meaner recompence: and
this is the Geometrical proportion which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks
of. For where much deſert is, though much be giuen,
and leſſe, where leſſe is deſerued, and the rewards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
together be vnequall; yet as they haue ſeuerally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,
they are equally rewarded. With ſome example
we ſhall make the thing more plaine. Suppoſe here be
two veſſels, the one greater then the other, and that you
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17081:127"/>
fill them both with wine or other liquor, the leſſer ſhall
neuertheles be as well full as the greater: and if they both
had ſpeech and vnderſtanding, neither could the one
complaine for hauing too much, nor the other too little,
both being full according to their capacitie, and ſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his due. In this ſort doth Iuſtice diſtribute to euery
one that which is his due. She produceth lawes, by which
vertue is rewarded, and vice puniſhed. She correcteth
faults and errours according to their qualitie. She ſetteth
vs in the direct way that leadeth to felicitie. She teacheth
rulers and magiſtrates to commaund, and ſubiects to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey:
and therefore ſhe is the true rule which ſheweth the
inferiour powers and faculties of the ſoule how to obey
Reaſon, as their Queene and miſtris. Which commaund
of Reaſon, <hi>Plotinus</hi> eſteemed to be ſo important to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
ouer the paſſions, as he eſteemed them only to be
worthily called wiſe men, who ſubiected their paſſions
in ſuch ſort to reaſon, that they ſhould neuer ariſe to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelues againſt her. She inſtructeth man to rule,
not onely himſelfe, but his wife, his children, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
alſo. She preſerueth and maintaineth States and
Common-weales, by ſetting an euen courſe of cariage
betweene Princes and their ſubiects. She maketh men
vnderſtand, how the doing of iniury is contrary to the
nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who is borne to be mild, benigne &amp; gentle;
and not to be (as wild beaſts are) furious, fierce and cruel:
for ſuch they are that hurt others wittingly. And when
iniuries happen to be done, ſhe diſtinguiſheth them, ſhe
ſeeketh to make them equall, or to diminiſh them, or to
take them cleane away: euermore teaching vs this leſſon,
that it is better to receiue an iniury then to do it. It is ſhe
that maketh thoſe things that are ſeuerally produced for
the good of ſundry nations, common to all, by the meane
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17081:127"/>
of commutation, of buying and ſelling, and hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
coine, hath ſet it to be a law, or rather a iudge in
caſes of inequalitie, to ſee that euery man haue his due
and no more. Finally ſhe tempereth with equitie (which
may be termed a kind of clemency ioyned to iuſtice)
things ſeuerely eſtabliſhed by law, to the end that exact
iuſtice may not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oue to be exact wrong. And where as
lawes not tempered by diſcreet Iudges, are like tyrants o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
men: this equitie was held by <hi>Plato</hi> to be of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
that when the <hi>Arcadians</hi> ſent vnto him, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to ſet them downe lawes to be ruled by, he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
that they were a people not capable of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
refuſed flatly to make them any lawes at all. <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
ſaid, that to be too iuſt, was not onely farre from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie,
but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crueltie it ſelf. And <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperor
wiſhed Princes to link equitie &amp; iuſtice together, ſaying,
that dominions were otherwiſe inhumanely gouerned.
The Aegyptians alſo to ſhew that lawes are to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
with equitie, expreſſed iuſtice in their <hi>Hieroglifikes</hi>
by a left hand ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, meaning, that as the left hand is ſlower
and weaker then the right: ſo that iuſtice ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly
adminiſtred, and not with force or fury. And the
opinion of ſome was, that the axes and rods which were
accuſtomably borne before the Romane Conſuls, were
bound about with bands; to declare, that as there muſt be
a time to vnbind the axes before they could be vſed to
the death of any man: ſo ought there to be a time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
for them that execute the law; wherein they may
conſider whether that which the rigor of law commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
may not without impeachment of Iuſtice be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
and reduced to benignitie and equitie. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
Iuſtice is ſhe that maintaineth common vtilitie,
that giueth the rule, the order, the meaſure and manner
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17081:128"/>
of all things both publike and priuate, the band of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
conuerſation and friendſhip. She it is that maketh
man reſemble God, and ſo farre extendeth her power in
the coniunction of mens minds, that ſhe not onely knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
honeſt men together in ciuill ſocietie, but euen wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men and theeues, whoſe companies could not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
if among their iniuſtices Iuſtice had not ſome place.
She is of ſo rare goodneſſe and ſinceritie, that ſhe maketh
man, not onely to abſtaine from taking anothers goods,
but alſo from coueting the ſame.</p>
            <p>Indeed (ſaid M. <hi>Dormer)</hi> if Iuſtice be ſuch a vertue
as you haue deſcribed, me thinke that we haue ſmal need
of other vertues; for ſhe comprehendeth them all within
herſelfe.</p>
            <p>So doth ſhe (anſwered I) if ſhe be generally conſidered
as before hath bin ſaid. But if we call her to the company
of the other vertues, as here we place her, ſhe hath as
much need of them as they of her, if ſhe ſhall produce
thoſe effects which we haue ſpoken of. For as one vice
draweth another after it, as do the linkes of a chaine
the one the other: euen ſo are the vertues much more
happily linked together in ſuch ſort as they cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.
But though a man be endued with them all, yet is
he called a iuſt man, a valiant, a prudent, or a temperate
man, according as he inclineth more to this then to that,
or in his actions maketh more ſhew of the one then of
the other: for our naturall imperfection wil not ſuffer any
one man to excel in them all; which made me ſay a while
ſithens, that it is ſo hard a thing to be magnanimous, ſince
the vertue of Magnanimity muſt be grounded vpon all
the reſt. But to excell in iuſtice, is a thing moſt glorious;
for it is ſaid of her, that neither the morning ſtarre nor the
euening ſtar ſhineth as ſhe doth. And <hi>Heſiodus</hi> called her
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:17081:128"/>
the daughter of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Wherupon <hi>Plato</hi> ſuppoſing, that
who ſo embraced Iuſtice contracted parentage with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
the King of Gods and men, accounted the iuſt man
had gotten a place very neere vnto God.</p>
            <p>Verily (ſaid M. <hi>Dormer)</hi> and not without cauſe. For it
behoueth him that will be iuſt to be voide of all vice, and
furniſhed with all other vertues. And therefore me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
he that ſaid Iuſtice might wel be without Prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
conſidered ill what belonged to Iuſtice. For Prudence is
moſt neceſſary to diſcerne what is iuſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what is vniuſt;
and a good iudgment therin can no man haue that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Prudence: without which iudgment, Iuſtice can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
rule wel thoſe things that are vnder her gouernment.
And as <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſaid of Fortitude, ſo thinke I of Iuſtice,
that if ſhe be not guided by Prudence (which is aptly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the eie of the mind) ſhe works more harme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good.</p>
            <p>You thinke truly (ſaid I) and of this vertue the courſe
of our author draweth me to treate, &amp; to declare of what
importance ſhe is to humane things, and how beneficial.
But let me firſt put you in mind that hitherto hath bin
ſpoken but of thoſe vertues which haue their foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the vnreaſonable parts of the mind: of which mind
they are the habits, conſiſting in the meane betwixt two
extremes, and buſied about the affects &amp; actions of men.
Likewiſe hath bin declared how the affects come from
the powers or appetites of the ſoule, to wit, the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible
and the iraſcible, and how all commendable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
proceed from election, before which Counſell muſt
go. And albeit we made mention there of Prudence, yet
it was then referred to a fitter place to talke thereof more
largely, when the drift of our diſcourſe ſhould bring vs
thither. Now therefore being come to that place which
is proper to her, I am to ſpeake of therof. But before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17081:129"/>
any further, you muſt vnderſtand that there be two
ſorts of vertues: for ſome are morall, concerning man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
of which we haue diſcourſed hitherto, and ſhewed
how they are grounded in thoſe parts of the mind that
are deuoide of reaſon. Others are of the mind or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
in which reſpect they are called Intellectiue;
and of them henceforth muſt be our ſpeech. But you
muſt remember, that though it was ſaid, that thoſe morall
vertues were founded in thoſe parts of the mind wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
reaſon, yet were they guided by the light of reaſon.
And this light of reaſon (as much as concerneth mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)
is nothing elſe but Prudence, which is a vertue of
the vnderſtanding, and the rule and meaſure of all the
morall vertues concerning our actions and affects: euen
as ſapience or wiſedome is the guide and gouerneſſe of
ſpeculation. And forſomuch as reaſon is capable of two
intellectiue vertues, whereof the one is actiue, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpeculatiue, this latter intendeth alwaies the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of truth: &amp; the firſt is buſied about the knowledge
of what is good. Which good, when it is come to the
height of his perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our actions, is the end of them;
and then haue we attained that furtheſt and abſolute
terme or bound, vnto which we haue directed all our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
actions. Hereupon <hi>Plotinus</hi> ſaid, that there were in vs
two principles or originall cauſes of doing; whereof the
one is the mind, which cals vs to contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the other
is reaſon, guiding vs to ciuill actions; and from her doth
that which is good &amp; faire neuer depart. And though it
may be obiected, that both theſe intellectiue vertues are
exerciſed in or about the knowledge of truth, as indeed
they be; yet is it to be aduertiſed, that it is in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
that they be ſo exerciſed. For that part which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is buſied about truth ſimply; that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17081:129"/>
is to ſay, about thoſe things that neuer change, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the ſame; as God firſt of all; then all the vniuerſall
things which nature hath produced: about which Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hath nothing to do to buſie her ſelfe, becauſe they
are not ſubiect to mans counſell, nor to his election: and
of ſuch things properly is truth the ſubiect: which truth
(as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid) is the guide to lead men to al goodnes. But
Prudence worketh properly about ſuch things as are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to change; and may be &amp; not be; may be done or not
done; and (when al is ſaid) are fortunable: of which there
is no certaine and infallible truth, as is of things eternall.
Neuertheles Prudence in this inconſtancie of things ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
ſeeketh alwayes to apply it ſelf to that which is moſt
likely to happen, and doth ſeeme moſt probable to the
diſcourſe of reaſon. And this alſo is that truth about
which ſhe diſcourſeth, ſeeking ſtill to chuſe that which is
or ſeemeth to her beſt and moſt faire. Without Prudence
can no vertuous operation be brought to paſſe. For ſhe
onely foreſeeth and knoweth what is conuenient and
ſeemely: and withholdeth a man at all times from vice
or any voluntary wicked action: ſo that he that is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
cannot be prudent. It is neither art nor ſcience, but
an habit of the mind, neuer ſeuered from reaſon, in the
diſcourſing of thoſe things about which man is to vſe
reaſon, for priuate or publike benefit. So as it may well be
ſaid, that in reſpect of the ſubiect it is all one with that
ſcience which is called Ciuil: but in reſpect of the reaſon
of the one &amp; of the other, they be differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For Prudence
is in the prudent man principally for his priuat good and
profit, and next for the publike weale: but the ciuil or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike
man conſidereth that which is profitable to the
Common-wealth. And though both be buſied about
the benefit of mankind according to reaſon, yet ſo farre
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17081:130"/>
forth as the prudent man reſpecteth his priuat good, it is
called in him Prudence. But when it is applied to the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweal, it is called the ciuil
facultie or ſcience. Which facultie without prudence wil
be of ſmal effect in gouernment: the rule wherof it fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Temperance, which is called the preſeruer of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Neuertheles the prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t man may at once prouide
both for his priuate affaires &amp; for the publike, though his
office be rather to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand others to execute things then
to do himſelf. And albeit in that point <hi>Socrates</hi> was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
ſaying that Prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was all the vertues together, yet
is ſhe ſo inſeparable a companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them all, as if ſhe be
taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, they remaine oſ ſmal valew or effect. The
office of this vertue, is to conſider what is profitable, and
to apprehend it: and likewiſe to eſchew all that is hurtful.
And to diſcourſe of things ſenſible and vſuall, thereby to
ſhew what is fit to be choſen, and what to be forſaken. In
regard wherof <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid that Prudenee guided vs to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
of life, and imprudence made vs miſerable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie:
affirming that ſhe onely directed vs to do all our
affaires wel, yea &amp; to know our ſelues. Among the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
of vertues, Prudence is commonly ſet with a
looking-glas in her hand: which by all likelihood is done
to giue vs to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that as the glaſſe being cleere ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
a man his face; ſo Prudence wel vſed ſhewes to him
himſelf, making him to know what he is, and to what end
created. The knowledge wherof works in him, that as he
trauels to attain for himſelf profit &amp; goodnes; ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
himſelfe to be borne for the good alſo of others,
endeuoreth to direct the affaires alſo of his pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, friends
and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale to the ſame end of profit &amp; goodnes.
Now although it hath bin ſaid, that Pudence is a ſcience
of good and euil, yet is it to be vnderſtood that ſhe is not
properly termed a ſcience; but is (as was ſaid eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now) ſo
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17081:130"/>
far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, that ſhe is buſied about things caſual which may
happen and not happen, wherof there can be no certaine
ſcience: wheras Science laboreth about things certaine &amp;
eternal. Prudence conſidereth what is profitable &amp; good;
Science ſearcheth out truth ſimply. And as theſe two be
different the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other: ſo is there difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the wiſe man &amp; the prudent. For the wiſe man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtil buſied about the cauſes of things, and the maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
effects which they produce by the meanes of Gods
goodnes, is as it were out of the world, litle reſpecting any
profit, which the prudent hath ſtill regard vnto. For the
wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath his mind alwaies raiſed to the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation
of ſublime things, whereby theſe baſer of the earth ſeeme
to him worthy no eſtimation, the rather becauſe he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
right well that nature hath need of very little to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
her. And although <hi>Plato</hi> ſay that thoſe men are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
wiſe, who by the light of reaſon, know what is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
not onely for themſelues and particular perſons, but
generally for the commonweale, he there vſeth the name
of a wiſe man according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon maner of ſpeech,
and not properly. But that you may the better vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
my authors meaning, you muſt giue me leaue to enlarge
a litle the ground of this his diſtinction. You are therfore
to conſider, that there be three ſeueral things in vs, to wit,
ſenſe and feeling, vnderſtanding and appetite. Of which
the firſt is the beginning of no action properly, becauſe it
is common to vs with brute beaſts, who are not ſaid to do
any action, for that they want iudgement and election.
The appetite, ſo farre forth as it is obedient to reaſon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
followeth or eſchueth things preſented thereunto:
and in this part Counſell hath place and election, as hath
bin formerly ſaid: which election is the inducement to
action, for thereby we worke either good or euil; and it is
prouoked by the appetite, though reaſon brideling the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:17081:131"/>
concupiſcible deſire be the miniſter of good electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But
the vnderſtanding ſtretcheth furder then ſo. For it trauels
about things eternal, neceſſary, and ſo true as they neuer
change, nor can be any other then as by nature they haue
bin framed. But it is buſied about this truth two manner
of wayes; for either it ſeeketh the knowledge of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
from whence true concluſions are drawne; or elſe
of principles that be the orig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne of things. If we conſider
the vnderſtanding according to the firſt manner, it bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ſcience in vs, which commeth from the knowledge
of true principles, which are the grounds of true conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
And in this ſort do we know all things naturall and
corporall, yet eternall and immutable, as cauſes naturall,
nature her ſelfe, time, place, the elements, heauen, the firſt
mouer, ſo farre forth as he is applied to a moueable body
(for ſo far forth as he is a ſimple ſubſtance, vnmoueable,
indiuiſible, free from all change: and as he is alone by him
ſelfe infinite, neither body, nor vertue contained in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
the firſt of all things naturally moued, yea before the
matter it ſelfe, &amp; al other the properties attributed to that
ſimple, pure and diuine nature, it is a thing not appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the naturall Philoſopher to treate of him) and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
all other things natural. But taking the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
according to the ſecond way, it raiſeth vs vp to the
knowledge of that diuine power, from which all things
great and ſmall, mortall and immortall, haue their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
and this knowledge is called wiſedome: which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with vertue, we attaine by the meanes of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie,
the only ſchool-miſtris of humane and diuine lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and the true guide to commendable life and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
actions, being indeed the greateſt gift that God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to man in this tranſitory life. Now as theſe vertues
before ſpecified direct vs to that perfecteſt end that man
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17081:131"/>
in this world can attaine vnto by his vertuous deeds: ſo
doth this habit, called wiſedome, conduct him to a farre
more excellent end then this ciuill or politike end. And
if that which vertue guideth vs vnto, be worthy to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
perfect in this world, this other (which wiſedome
leadeth vs vnto) may well be termed moſt perfect: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this diuine habit addreſſeth vs to the knowledge of
the moſt pure, ſimple, and excellenteſt nature, which is
God eternall and immortall, the fountaine of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and infallible truth, the onely and abſolute reſt and
quiet of our ſoules &amp; minds. For which cauſe <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid,
that humane things, if they were compared to diuine,
were vnworthy the employing any ſtudy in them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of no price or eſtimation at all: for they are rather ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of things then things indeed, euermore fleeting
and ſlippery, as dayly experience teacheth vs. But being
as we are among men, and ſet to liue and conuerſe with
them ciuilly, the ciuill man muſt not giue himſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
to ſtay vpon it as wiſedome would perſwade
him, vntill he haue firſt employed his wit and prudence
to the good and profit as well of others as of himſelfe.
Giuing them to vnderſtand, how man is the perfection
of all creatures vnder heauen, and placed as the center be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
things diuine and mortall: and ſhewing to them
how great is the perfection of mans mind, make them
know how vnworthy &amp; vnfit it is for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuffer thoſe
parts that he hath common with brute beaſts to maſter
and ouer-rule thoſe by which he is made not much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to diuine creatures: and cauſing them to lift vp
their minds to this conſideration, inſtruct them ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and rule through vertuous habits thoſe parts which
of themſelues are rebellious to reaſon, as they may be
forced to obey her no otherwiſe then their Queene and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:17081:132"/>
miſtris: and through Fortitude, Temperance, Iuſtice,
and Prudence, with the reſt of the vertues that ſpring
from them, frame their behauiour, and direct all their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to that end which we haue intituled by the name
of ciuill felicitie, to wit, that perfect action or operation
according to vertue in a perfect life, whereof hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
bin largely diſcourſed. Which felicitie once attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is of that nature, that no man which is poſſeſſed
thereof can become miſerable or vnhappie. For vice only
can reduce man to be miſerable, and that is euermore ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
from felicitie, whoſe conuerſation is onely with
vertue: to whom ſhe is ſo faſt linked and tied in the mind
of man, that he hath no power to diſſolue or ſeuer the
ſame. And this felicitie is not only a degree, but euen the
very foundation of that other, which we may attaine by
the meane of wiſedome. For after we haue once ſetled
and gounded our ſelues in the morall vertues, and done
well in reſpect of our ſelues, and alſo holpen others as
much as we could, we may then raiſe our thoughts to a
higher conſideration, and examining more inwardly
our owne eſtate, find that this moſt excellent gift of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
hath bin giuen vs to a further end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
then this humane felicitie: and therfore bend all our
wits to a better vſe of our ſelues, which is to take the way
of that other felicitie, ſo to place our ſelues, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the ordinary ranke of men, but euen to approch
(as neere as our frailtie will permit) to God himſelfe, the
laſt end of all our thoughts and actions. From this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of our ſelues we aſcend by degrees to
ſuch a height, as leauing all worldly cares, we apply al our
ſtudies to the ſearching of diuine things, to the end that
by attaining the vnderſtanding and knowledge of our
maker, and the Creator of all things, we may plainely
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:17081:132"/>
diſcerne that whatſoeuer is here among vs on earth, is
but ſmoke and duſt: and that to be euen glutted with all
the good that this life can affoord, is but a poſſeſſion of
ſmoke, and a ſhadow of the true good which is aboue.
And ſo knowing that the mind is the true man, giuen
vnto vs of ſpeciall grace to guide the body, we may turne
our ſelues to that happineſſe which maketh vs immortal,
by raiſing the mind to the height of that heauenly felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
the ſweetneſſe and delight whereof, is ſo much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then that of humane felicitie, (though without this
the other cannot be) as the habit of that excellent power
of the vertue intellectiue, is employed about a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
obiect, then that which the vertue actiue doth intend.
For it is euermore buſied about things eternall and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal,
and about the contemplation of the moſt high and
gracious God. Of this excellent degree of felicitie hath
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpoken in his firſt and tenth books of Ethikes,
declaring how it ought to be the finall end of all our ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and hath attributed this excellent kind of faculty
to thoſe men only who are properly called Sages or wiſe
men: becauſe they, by the meanes of actions and of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
finding that theſe mortall things are not able to
bring a man to full and perfect happineſſe, do ſo raiſe
themſelues from theſe baſer cogitations, as they apply
their mind and vnderſtanding wholy to the knowledge
of diuine eſſences. And ſuch men (ſaith he) as haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that degree, are rather to be eſteemed diuine then
humane. For whiles they liue in contemplation, they are
not like men liuing among men, compoſed of body and
ſoule, but as diuine creatures freed from mortall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ariſing from the body, and bent onely to that which
may purchaſe the neuer-ending felicitie of the ſoule;
which according to <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is the true man.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:17081:133"/>
And to this opinion did our Sauiour Chriſt (who is the
infallible veritie) giue authoritie and confirmation, when
he ſaid, that we ought to haue ſuch care of that ſoule
which is in vs according to the image of God, that we
ſhould eſteeme nothing (how great or precious ſoeuer
the world eſteemed it) at ſo high a rate, as for the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thereof we ſhould hurt or looſe the ſame: for his
words are, <hi>What auaileth it a man to gaine all the world and
looſe his owne ſoule?</hi> By this opinion of theſe two Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
we may plainly vnderſtand, that euen in that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of auncient ſuperſtition, God had yet giuen ſuch
light of reaſon to the mindes of men to illumine them
withall, that they ſaw how through ſciences and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
they were to ſeeke the way that ſhould leade them
to their perfect felicitie, that is, to God Almightie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
who is ſuch an end as no other end can be ſuppoſed
beyond him; but to him all other ends are directed, as to
the true and moſt happie terme, bound or limit of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and vertuous actions, and of ciuill felicitie it ſelfe.
But becauſe that diuine part of the Intellectiue ſoule
which is in vs, is to haue conſideration not onely of our
preſent ſtate of life, but alſo to that eternitie, wherein our
immortall mindes, made to the likeneſſe of God, are to
liue with him eternally. Therfore did <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> fitly teach,
that men ought to bend and frame their minds wholy to
that true and abſolute end: for that the minde being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,
it is his proper office to ſeeke to vnite it ſelfe to his
firſt principle or beginning, which is God. Neither hath
his diuine Maieſtie of his aboundant grace beſtowed the
vertue intellectiue vpon man to any other end, then that
he might know it to be his ſpeciall dutie to raiſe himſelfe
to him, as to the author and free giuer of all goodneſſe:
and as he hath beſtowed on him a ſoule made to his own
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:17081:133"/>
likenes, ſo he ſhould therewith bend his endeuour to be
like him in all his actions, as farre as the corruption con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by the communion of the bodie will permit.
Which thing the <hi>Platonikes</hi> conſidering, haue ſpoken
much more largely thereof then <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> following
therein the ſteps of their maſter. But ſome will ſay, that
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpake the leſſe thereof, thinking that the ſoule of
man, euen concerning the vnderſtanding, was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall;
becauſe it ſeemeth to them, that when the ſoule
hath no more the ſenſes of the bodie to ſerue her as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
whereby ſhe vnderſtandeth and knoweth, ſhe
ſhould no longer liue. For ſince nature cannot ſuffer any
thing to be idle in the world, and the ſoule wanting the
bodie can haue no operation, therefore they thinke it is
to be concluded, that with the bodie ſhe muſt needs fall
and die: for that if ſhe ſhould happen to remaine after ſhe
were ſeparated from the bodie, yet ſhe ſhould not haue
any operation, inſomuch as hauing the vnderſtanding
for her proper operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſeeing ſhe cannot vnderſtand
but by the miniſtery of the ſenſes, from which ſhe can
haue no helpe when ſhe is looſed from the bodie, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that ſhe hath no operation, and then muſt ſhe be
idle in nature, which is in no ſort to be allowed. But my
author (as afore is ſaid) doth thinke, that theſe men miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> not conſidering that he, ſpeaking as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philoſopher of the ſoule, was not to treate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
but naturally; and in ſo doing, was to reſtraine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
within the bounds of nature: according to which, he
is not to conſider any forme ſeparate from the matter,
from which we (as all other natural things) haue our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
This <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> conſidering and knowing, that as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philoſopher he was not to ſpeake of the Intellectiue
ſoule, ſaid, that vnderſtanding being ſeparated from the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:17081:134"/>
other powers of the minde, as a thing eternall, ſeuered
from the corruptible part, it appertained not to him to
treate thereof in that place, where he ſpake of the ſoule
as ſhe was the actor of the bodie, and vſed it as her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.
For he ſaw wel inough, that though the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
tooke beginning with the bodie, becauſe it was
the forme thereof; yet was it not the actor of the body, ſo
as it ſhould vſe any member thereof as an inſtrument:
but was onely aforme that was to exerciſe all the other
powers of the other ſoules. For it is likewiſe <hi>Ariſtotles</hi>
opinion, that where the vnderſtanding is in things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
there hath it alſo the faculties of all the other
ſoules within it ſelfe. Which thing he ſhewed more
cleerely in his firſt booke <hi>de Partibus Animalium,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that to ſpeake of the Intellectiue ſoule all that might
be ſayd, was not the office of a naturall Philoſopher.
And this for two reaſons. The one is, that the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiue
ſoule is no actor of the bodie, becauſe ſhe hath
in her no part of motion, either of her ſelfe, or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.
For ſhe neither increaſeth nor diminiſheth the
bodie, ſhe nouriſheth it not, nor maintaineth it;
for theſe are functions appertaining to the vegetatiue
ſoule; ſhee chaungeth it not, nor mooueth it from
place to place; for that is the office of the ſenſitiue ſoule:
and theſe be the motions which the bodie can haue
from the ſoule (ſauing generation and corruption,
which are changes made in an inſtant): therefore inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as ſhe is intellectiue, ſhe is not ſubiect to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the naturall Philoſopher. The other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, for that the naturall Philoſopher conſidereth not
the ſubſtances ſeparated from the matter, and therefore
his office is not to conſider the excellencie of the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiue
ſoule, which is not the actor of the bodie, though
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:17081:134"/>
ſhe be the forme thereof. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> telleth
vs in his ſecond booke of Phyſikes, that the terme or
bound of the naturall Philoſphers conſideration, is the
Intellectiue ſoule. For albeit he may conſider the ſoule
ſo farre as ſhe moueth and is not moued; as he may alſo
the firſt mouer: yet doth he not conſider her eſſence,
nor the eſſence of the firſt mouer: for this appertaineth
to the Metaphyſike, who conſidereth of the ſubſtances
ſeparated and immortall. And hence commeth it
that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> treating in his booke of Phyſikes of nature,
as ſhe is the beginning of all mouings and of reſt; when
he is come to the firſt mouer who is immoueable, yet
moueth all that is moued in the world, proceeded not
any further to ſhew his nature: vnderſtanding right
well, that the naturall Philoſophers office was not, to
conſider any thing that is ſimply immoueable, as well
in reſpect of the whole, as of the parts, as the firſt mouer
is. But let vs (without queſtioning further thereupon)
hold this for certaine, not onely by that which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion teacheth vs, but alſo by that which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
hath held, that our ſoules are immorall. For if it
were otherwiſe, we ſhould be of all other creatures that
nature produceth the moſt vnhappie: and in vaine
ſhould that deſire of immortalitie (which all men haue)
be giuen vnto vs. Beſides that, man, as man, that is to
ſay, as a creature intellectiue, ſhould not haue that end
which is ordained for him, which is contemplatiue fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie.
Neither is it to the purpoſe to ſay, that ſuch fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
is not attained by morall vertues, but by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
only, or that there be but few ſo wiſe as to ſeek this
excellent felicitie, and infinite the number of thoſe
that thinke but little vpon it: for all men are borne
apt vnto it, if they will apply their minds vnto the ſame.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:17081:135"/>
And though among all generations of men there ſhould
be but three or foure that bent their endeuour to attaine
it, they onely were ſufficient to proue our intention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is moſt certaine, that the number of fooliſh men
is infinite, who not knowing themſelues, cannot tell how
to vſe themſelues, &amp; direct their endeuours to that which
is the proper end of man. Of whom it is ſaid, <hi>People on
whom night commeth before Sunne-ſet.</hi> A wicked gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
whoſe whole life-time flieth from them vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,
in ſuch ſort, as they can ſcarce perceiue that they
haue liued. For although there be infinitely more ſuch in
this world then of quicke and eleuated ſpirits, yet ought
not we to endure, that their negligence, who know not
themſelues to be men, ſhould preiudice the mindes of
ſuch as know what they are, and raiſe their thoughts
carefully to diuine things. And therefore leauing their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
that will needs ſay, that <hi>Ariſtole</hi> impiouſly and
madly hath held the contrary, it ſhall be beſt to proceed
in our diſcourſe of the felicitie that is to be attained by
contemplation.</p>
            <p>I pray you (ſaid Captaine <hi>Carleil)</hi> ſince there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie
of opinions amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Philoſophers, concerning the
immortalitie of the ſoule, and that the knowledge therof
appertaineth to the better vnderſtanding of this contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue
felicitie, let vs heare, if your author giue any furder
light thereunto, ſince ſuch good fellowes ſeeke to caſt ſo
darke a miſt before our eyes, vnder the cloke of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi>
opinion. For albeit you ſpake ſomewhat of it yeſterday,
ſo farre as concerned our maner of learning according to
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> yet was it but by the way, and not as it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this felicitie: and if ſuch a matter as this were twiſe
repeated, it could not but be profitable to vs, though it be
ſomewhat troubleſome to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:17081:135"/>
Whereupon I ſaid: that which my author was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to vndertake, you preſſe me vnto, as if you were the
ſame perſons, and had the ſame ſence that thoſe introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by him had: and therefore ſince you alſo will haue it
ſo, I am content to cloſe vp this your feaſt with this laſt
diſh; notwithſtanding that the euening draw on, and that
to ſpeake thereof at large would aske a long time. But
knitting vp, as well as I can, a great volume in a little
roome, I will deliuer vnto you that which the ſhortneſſe
of our time wil permit, and pray with mine author his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Maieſtie, who hath giuen vs an immortall ſoule, that
he wil vouchſafe vs his grace to ſay ſo much and no more
of this matter, as may be to his glory, and to all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.
Know ye then that theſe men, that out of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi>
writings gather our intellectiue ſoule to be mortall, take
for their foundation and ground this; that the ſoule is the
actor of the bodie, and vſeth it but after the maner before
mentioned. And to maintaine this their opinion, they
wreſt diuers places of his vntruly, and contrary to the
mind of this great Philoſopher, as ſhall be declared vnto
you. True it is, that while the intellectiue ſoule is the
forme of the body, ſhe hath ſome need of him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.
For without the fantaſie we can vnderſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this life, ſince from the ſenſes the formes of all
things are repreſented vnto vs, as yeſterday was declared.
And this did <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> meane to teach vs, when contrary
to the opinion of ſome former Philoſophers he ſaid, that
ſenſe and vnderſtanding was not all one, although there
be ſome ſimilitude betweene them. And becauſe the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences
of things are knowne by their operations, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and that the intellectiue ſoule vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
(which is a ſpiritual operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;) it followeth that
ſimply of her owne nature ſhe is all ſpirit, and therefore
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:17081:136"/>
immortall, for elſe to vnderſtand, would not be her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie.
Whereunto alſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> agreeth, in ſaying, that
ſome parts of the ſoule are not conioyned to the bodie,
and therefore are ſeparable: and that the vnderſtanding
and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatiue power was another kind of ſoule,
and not drawne from the power of matter, as the other
two are, whoſe operations were ordained for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectiue
ſoule, inſomuch as ſhe is the forme of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
which ſheweth plainely that ſhe is eternall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.
And in the twelfth of his Metaphyſikes, making
a doubt, whether any forme remaine after the extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
of the matter, he ſayd doubtfully of the other two,
that not euery ſoule, but the Intellectiue onely remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And here is to be noted, that his opinion was not
(though ſome would haue it ſo) that the fantaſie was the
forme of the bodie, for that dieth with the bodie, as ſhall
be ſhewed hereafter: but he conſidered the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it ſelfe, as a ſoule, and as the forme of the bodie; and
not as a ſeparable intelligence, the loweſt of all others,
and common to all men, as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> and <hi>Themiſtius</hi>
(though diuerſly) haue thought. Neither yet that it was
God Almightie, as <hi>Alexander</hi> ſuppoſeth: for God is not
the forme of our bodies, nor hath any man euer doubted
whether God were immortall. So as our vnderſtanding
is neither God, nor yet a ſeparate intelligence, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to
all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like thoſe that gouerne an vniuerſal ſpheare, as they
aboue mentioned haue thought, &amp; as ſome of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
haue dreamed; who being raiſed to Eccleſiaſticall
dignitie, haue choſen rather to follow the Greeks vanity
and the Arabians, then fauour the religious and true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> mind. Whereas they ought rather
to haue rooted ſuch opinions out of mens mindes, as apt
to draw them to perdition, and not to maske them
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:17081:136"/>
with the vizard of naturall Philoſophers: as if things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
that may ſeeme contrary to Chriſtianitie, were to
be ſet before men in writing, to be confirmed by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reaſons apparant at leaſt, though not true, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
their mindes amiſſe. But <hi>Iohannes Gramaticus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Greekes hath declared <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> mind aright;
and ſo hath he that is called the Angelicall Doctour in
ſundry places as a moſt excellent ſpirit and a religious
man, whatſoeuer <hi>Scotus</hi> write againſt him. And what
better teſtimonie neede we haue of the vanitie of theſe
mens interpretations, then <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe? who moſt
effectually ſheweth the ſame, where he ſayth, that the
waxing old of man proceedeth not from the Intellectiue
ſoule, but from the bodie wherein ſhe is (which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
is to be vnderſtood as ſhe is the forme thereof:)
and in ſo ſaying, declareth, that euery man hath his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiue
ſoule: which ſoule is a meane betwixt ſeparated
ſubſtances and corporall; and therefore partly ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth
with the bodie to informe the ſame, and
partly ſhe vſeth (as proper to her) the vertue of the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
ſubſtances (as much as her nature may beare) in the
vſe of vnderſtanding. And ſince it is cleere, that in nature
the moſt perfect things containe the leſſe perfect, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceiue from whence proceedeth the frenſie of
theſe men, that will rather draw the ſoule Intellectiue to
be mortall then immortal; ſeeing that to vnderſtand
is the moſt ſingular operation that the ſoule hath, and
to whom the powers of the other ſoules are referred, as
to the better end, and obey as hand-maides to their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
in ſuch as propoſe to themſelues to liue like men.
Neither doth the reaſon alledged by ſome ſerue, who
ſay, that becauſe there is great imperfection in the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiue
ſoule in compariſon of the ſeparate intelligences,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:17081:137"/>
it ſheweth the ſame to be mortall. For if this reaſon
were true, they might as well by the ſame conclude,
that the ſeparate intelligences were alſo mortall. For
ſince <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, that onely the firſt intelligence
(who in his phraſe is the firſt mouer) is perfect; and
that all the other compared to him are vnperfect, (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
being in theſe mens fancie the cauſe of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talneſſe)
it muſt follow, that as imperfect, they ſhould
be mortall: which is as contrary to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> mind, as
any thing can be. Wherefore we muſt not ſay, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in the intellectiue ſoule (in reſpect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences
ſeparated) cauſeth the ſame to die with the
bodie, ſince her office dependeth not on the bodie: but
it is onely to be ſayd, that ſhe ceaſeth to informe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
through the defect thereof, &amp; not of her ſelf; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
freed from the bodie, remaineth neuertheleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in her being. For albeit ſhe haue ſome reſpect to the
bodie whiles ſhe informeth the ſame, yet hath ſhe not
her abſolute being from it. And therefore ſayd <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
that the vertue of the ſenſe is not equall to the
vertue of the vnderſtanding; for that a mightie or
ſtrong Senſible, weakeneth, and oftentimes corrupteth
the ſenſe; whereas from an excellent Intelligible, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
gathereth greater vertue: which thing
could not be ſayd, if the vnderſtanding were as theſe
people ſuppoſe, a ſeparate intelligence, wherof the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
did participate. Wherefore we muſt needs ſay
he meant of the vnderſtanding of euery particular man,
as of the forme of this man, and that man: for he ſpake
of the vnderſtanding of particular men, and not of
intelligences, as thoſe men haue belike dreamed. And
this ſheweth (howſoeuer any thinke the contrary) that
as well the Agent vnderſtanding and the poſſible alſo
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17081:137"/>
(whereof this is ordained as matter to that, and both
neceſſary to vnderſtand) are eſſentiall parts of the ſoule,
and not two ſeparate intelligences, as <hi>Themiſtius</hi> would
haue them. The reaſon likewiſe which ſome alledge,
is not good, when they argue, that the ſoule being the
forme of the bodie, ſhould euer haue a deſire, after ſhe
were ſeparated from the ſame, to reunite her ſelfe againe
thereunto: but the bodie being rotten and corrupted,
her deſire in that behalfe ſhould be vaine. For I ſay, that
ſince the ſoule hath informed the body, ſhe hath done as
much as to her appertained, neither is ſhe to deſire any
further (to ſpeake naturally) then ſhe hath accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed:
and therefore ſhe remaineth as a ſeparate intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
Which hath made the Peripatetikes to affirme,
that the ſoule ſeparated from the bodie, is not the ſame
that ſhe was, when ſhe was in the bodie; becauſe that
ioyned to the bodie ſhe was the forme thereof, but ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
ſhe can no more be ſo. But this difficultie, which
naturall Philoſophers haue not knowne how to reſolue
as they ought, our bleſſed Sauiour the Sonne of God
hath fully reſolued, by riſing againe the third day (not to
ſay any thing of others raiſed by him) and promiſing to
vs the like reſurrection.</p>
            <p>This (ſaid my Lord Primate) all true Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue:
but ſince we are debating of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinions,
where he ſaith, that the paſſible vnderſtanding dieth, and
ſome of his Interpreters ſay, that it is the poſſible vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
how ſhall we make this to agree with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie
of the ſoule?</p>
            <p>Well inough (ſayd I:) for they that ſo interpret him
deceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: for there is as great difference (as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
himſelfe teacheth) betweene the paſſible ſoule and
the poſſible ſoule, as betweene that which is eternall and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:17081:138"/>
that which is corruptible. The paſſible vnderſtanding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is the fantaſie, or the imaginatiue or
cogitatiue power, call it how you pleaſe, the which <hi>Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi>
ſayd was taken at large, but not properly for the
vnderſtanding; and as an inward ſenſe depending vpon
the bodie, receiueth the ſenſible kindes from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe, and preſenteth them to the poſſible vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
which is the place of the intelligible kindes or
formes, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in ſundrie places declareth. And who
ſo ſhall well conſider <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> where he ſpeaketh of
the multiplication of the vnderſtanding, ſhall finde that
he ſuppoſed it not as our Chriſtian writers doe, but
tooke the vertue fantaſtike for the vnderſtanding, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
in particular perſons. And therefore ſhe being
mingled with the bodie, faileth alſo with the ſame: and
this is that interiour thing which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
whereby the vnderſtanding loſeth his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
(as ſhall be ſhewed) which happeneth not to the
poſſible vnderſtanding, becauſe it is an eſſential part of
the Intellectiue ſoule, not mingled with the bodie, and
free from any paſſion, as a diuine ſubſtance. Of which
bodie ſhe vſeth no part for her inſtrument to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
though ſhe haue neede of the fantaſie to receiue
the Intelligible formes whiles ſhe is the forme of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
And this neceſſitie, which the vnderſtanding hath
of the fantaſie to vnderſtand, ſheweth the contrarie of
that which theſe fellowes inferre, who hold the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to be mortall in that reſpect. For by this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
that the vnderſtanding proceedeth not from the
power of the matter: for if ſo it were, it ſhould haue no
neede of the fantaſie, but ſhould it ſelfe be the fantaſie:
and therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> right well perceiuing that our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
was not fantaſie, nor vſed anie part of the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:17081:138"/>
body for an inſtrument, ſayd, that the vnderſtanding
came from abroad, as ſhall be declared. It is therefore no
good conſequence to ſay, that becauſe the paſſible ſoule
dieth, therefore the poſſible ſoule likewiſe is mortall.</p>
            <p>Yea but (ſaid M. <hi>Spencer)</hi> we haue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that
the poſſible vnderſtanding ſuffreth in the act of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:
and to ſuffer importeth corruption; by which
reaſon it ſhould be mortall as is the paſſible.</p>
            <p>Neither is that reaſon (quoth I) ſufficient: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the name of ſuffering agree with the poſſible
vnderſtanding, and with the paſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (leauing the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in that point)
the reaſon and manner in them is different. For the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of the paſſible vnderſtanding tendeth to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
thereof, whereas the ſuffering of the poſſible
is to the greater perfection of the ſame. And for this
cauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> telleth vs, that the ſuffering of the ſenſes,
and that of the vnderſtanding are not both of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
becauſe the firſt breedes deſtruction, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perfection; and that therefore an excellent Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
giueth perfection to the vnderſtanding, whereas
an excellent Senſible corrupteth the ſenſe. But not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any other word meete to expreſſe this ſuffering of
the vnderſtanding, whiles it is in that act, we vſe the
ſame that agreeth to the paſſible, though the reaſon of
them both be verie diuerſe. The poſſible vnderſtanding
(as hath bene ſayd alreadie) being the place of the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
formes, ſtandeth in reſpect of the Agent vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
as the matter in reſpect of the forme: for the
firſt is but in power (for which reſpect <hi>Auerroes</hi> called it
the materiall vnderſtanding:) and this later is in act.
And this Agent vnderſtanding, by illumining the formes
which are in him as blind (euen as colours are in things
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17081:139"/>
before they be made apparent to the eye by the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of light) vnderſtandeth the kinds of things, and
vnderſtanding them vnderſtandeth it ſelfe. For in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
things, that which vnderſtandeth and that which is
vnderſtood, become all one thing: and turning it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the vniuerſall kinds, vnderſtandeth withall, things
particular. And this is that which the poſſible vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſuffereth from the Agent, receiuing thereby that
perfection which you haue heard.</p>
            <p>Why (ſaid Maiſter <hi>Spenſer)</hi> doth it not ſeeme, that
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> when he ſaith, that after death we haue no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
that he meant that this our vnderſtanding was
mortall? For if it were not ſo, man ſhould not loſe the
remembrance of things done in this life.</p>
            <p>Nay (anſwered I) what a ſillie part had it bene of
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> rather, if he had thought the intellectiue ſoule
to be mortall, to ſay that we remembred nothing after
this life, when nothing of vs ſhould haue remained? And
therefore it may ſerue to proue the immortalitie of the
ſoule, and not the corruption, as you ſurmiſe (onely for
arguments ſake) that truth may be ſifted out. But our not
remembring then, commeth from the corruptible part,
which is the vertue of the fantaſie: which being a power
of the ſenſitiue ſoule, that keepeth in ſtore the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of materiall things, that vertue which ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
them failing in vs, we cannot remember them
after death. For the memorie is no part of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
but of the ſenſitiue ſoule: and therefore <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
ſaid, that memorie came from ſenſe, inſomuch as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
wanting reaſon haue memorie, though they haue
not rememorating as man hath: for thereto is diſcourſe
required; which according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is nothing elſe
but an action of the vnderſtanding in the vertue imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:17081:139"/>
Which thing neither in thoſe creatures deuoid of
reaſon, nor yet in ſeparated intelligences can haue place,
becauſe thoſe want diſcourſe, and theſe are pure acts (as
Philoſophers call them.)</p>
            <p>Doth not <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (ſayd my Lord Primate) in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thikes
ſay, that the contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and the troubles of thoſe
which liue, appertaine vnto the dead, and breede them
griefe or delight? And how is it then that he ſhould ſay,
we haue no memorie after this life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in that place (ſayd I) ſpake in reproofe of
<hi>Solon,</hi> who had ſayd, that no man could be accounted
happie till after his death: and meant there to ſhew, that
although it were graunted that man had memorie after
his death, of things done in this life, yet could he not be
happie when he was dead, by reaſon of the ſtrange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
which this life bringeth foorth: and therefore he
ſaid not ſimply that we remember; but that ſuppoſing we
did, yet could we not be happie when we were dead, ſo
making good his opinion againſt <hi>Solon</hi> by naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Yet (ſayd Maiſter <hi>Spenſer)</hi> let me aske you this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
if the vnderſtanding be immortall, and multiplied
ſtill to the number of all the men, that haue bene, are, and
ſhall be, how can it ſtand with that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs of multiplication, which (ſaith he) proceedeth
from the matter; and things materiall are alwayes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible?</p>
            <p>Marrie (Sir ſaid I) this is to be vnderſtood of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
things, and not of Intelligible and ſpirituall, ſuch
as is the vnderſtanding. And that the vnderſtanding
might remaine after the matter were gone, as the forme
of the bodie, he hath (as before is ſaid) declared in his
Metaphyſikes, affirming the Intellectiue ſoule to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:17081:140"/>
though it be ſeparated from the bodie, whoſe
forme it was.</p>
            <p>But how cometh it to paſſe (replied Maiſter <hi>Spenſer</hi>
that the ſoule being immortall and impaſſible, yet by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
we ſee dayly, that ſhe is troubled with Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
Phrenſies, Melancholie, drunkenneſſe, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
paſſions, by which we ſee her ouercome, and to be
debarred from her office and function.</p>
            <p>Theſe (quoth I) are paſſions of the vertue cogitatiue,
fantaſtike, or imaginatiue, called by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (as I haue
ſaid alreadie) the paſſible vnderſtanding; and not of the
Intellectiue ſoule. Which paſſible vnderſtanding being
an inward ſenſe, and therefore tyed to the bodie, feeleth
the paſſions of the ſame; whereby it is offended, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
performe his office towards the other, but runneth
into ſuch inconueniences by reaſon of his infirmity, and
for want of reaſons direction. And whereas <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
ſaith that they that being ſicke in minde, and touched
with anie corporall diſeaſe, haue little or no feeling of
paine; it ſheweth plainely that it is as I haue ſaid. For if
you marke it well, this word <hi>feele</hi> explaneth the whole,
ſince feeling is a propertie of the Senſitiue ſoule, and the
vnderſtanding feeleth not. And in like manner are the
words of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to be vnderſtood, where he ſaith,
that ſuch whoſe fleſh is ſoft are apt to learne, and they
that are melancholy to be wiſe. For that the Senſitiue
vertue taketh more eaſily the formes or kindes of things
in ſuch ſubiects according to their nature, and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them to the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, from whence knowledge
and vnderſtanding proceedeth, as yeſterday was ſayd.
And this happeneth not onely in theſe paſſions, but alſo
in all other alterations, as of gladneſſe, of ſorow, of hope
and of feare, with ſuch like which appertaine not to the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17081:140"/>
vnderſtanding, to which (ſayd <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> who would
aſcribe ſuch affects, might as well ſay that the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
layed bricke to build, or caſt a loome to
weaue.</p>
            <p>Why, (ſay M. <hi>Spencer)</hi> doth your author meane (as
ſome haue not ſticked euen in our dayes to affirme) that
there are in vs two ſeuerall ſoules, the one ſenſitiue
and mortall, and the other Intellectiue and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine?</p>
            <p>Nothing leſſe (ſaid I) for that I hold were manifeſt
hereſie as well in Philoſophie as in Chriſtianitie. For
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth vs, that the Vegetatiue and Senſitiue
ſoule, or their powers, were in the ſoule Intellectiue, as
the triangle is in the ſquare: which could not be if the
ſenſitiue were ſeparated from the Intellectiue. And ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the varietie of ſoules, and of their powers, he
ſayth, that the Senſitiue could not be without the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getatiue,
but that this latter might well be without the
former: and that all the other vertues of all the three
ſoules are in thoſe creatures that haue reaſon and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
It cannot therefore be ſayd (according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle)</hi>
that the Senſitiue ſoule in man is ſeuered from
the Intellectiue. And becauſe man participateth (as hath
bene ſayd) of all the three faculties of the ſoules, I ſee not
why theſe fellowes that mention two, ſpeake not of all
three as well, ſeeing that in man are the operations of all
three. For if they ſay that it ſufficeth to ſpeake of the
Senſitiue, by which man is a liuing creature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
the Vegetatiue; why ſhould they not as well ſay,
that the Intellectiue alone includeth both the other? and
then is there no need of ſeuering at all. By which it may
appeere, that this frantike opinion gathered from the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirians,
is not onely contrary to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but to reaſon
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:17081:141"/>
it ſelfe. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that all things haue their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from their formes; and that in naturall things, the
more perfect containe the leſſe perfect, when the leſſer
is ordained for the more: and that therefore onely the
Intellectiue ſoule which containeth within it the natures
of both the others, is the onely and true forme of man,
malgre all ſuch dolts as would haue man to be (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of diuers formes) both a brute and a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creature, who ſeeke to ſet men aſtray from the right
way with ſuch fanaticall deuices. Let vs therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that both the paſſible and the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnderſtandings are vertues of the Intellectiue ſoule,
inſomuch as ſhe is the particular and proper forme of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man, and that as a humane ſoule ſhe is euerlaſting,
impaſſible, not mingled with the bodie, but ſeuered
from the ſame, ſimple and diuine, not drawne from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
power of matter, but infuſed into vs from abroade,
not ingendred by ſeede: which being once freed from
the bodie (becauſe nature admitteth nothing that is idle)
is altogether bent and intent to contemplation, being
then (as Philoſophers call it) <hi>actus purus,</hi> a pure vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
not needing the bodie either as an obiect, or
as a ſubiect. In conſideration whereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayd,
that man through contemplation became diuine; and
that the true man (which both he and his diuine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
agreed to be the minde) did enioy thereby (not as
a mortall man liuing in the world, but as a diuine crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
that high felicitie, to which, ciuill felicitie was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained;
and attained to wiſedome &amp; ſcience, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of the morall vertues, as meanes to guide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him to the ſame. And not impertinently haue the
Platonikes (following their maſter in that point) ſayd,
that nature had giuen vs ſenſe, not becauſe we ſhould
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17081:141"/>
ſtay thereupon, but to the end that thereby might
grow in vs imagination, from imagination diſcourſe,
from diſcourſe intelligence, and from intelligence
gladneſſe vnſpeakable, which might raiſe vs (as diuine,
and freed from the bands of the fleſh) to the knowledge
of God, who is the beginning and the end of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
towards whom we ought with all endeuour to
lift vp our minds, as to our chiefe and moſt perfect good:
for he onely is our <hi>ſummum bonum.</hi> For to them it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that the man whom contemplation had raiſed to
ſuch a degree of felicitie, became all wholy vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by that light which God imparteth to the ſpirits
that are ſo purged through the exerciſe of morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
which vertues are termed by <hi>Plato</hi> the purgers of
the mind: ſtirring vp therein a moſt ardent deſire to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
this mortall bodie, and to vnite it ſelfe with him.
And this is that contemplation of death which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie
of <hi>Plato</hi> calleth vs vnto. For he that is come to
this degree of perfection, is as dead to the world and
worldly pleaſures, becauſe he conſidereth that God is the
center of al perfections, &amp; that about him al our thoughts
&amp; deſires are to be turned &amp; employed. Such doth God
draw vnto himſelfe, and afterwards maketh them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of his ioyes euerlaſting: giuing them in the meane
while a moſt ſweet taſt euen in this life of that other life
moſt happie, and thoſe exceeding delights, beyond
which no deſire can extend, nor yet reach vnto the ſame.
So as being full of this excellent felicitie, they thinke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
minute of an houre to be a long time that debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them from iſſuing out of this mortall priſon, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
into their heauenly countrey; where, with that
vertue which is proper to the ſoule alone, they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the bleſſed ſpirits enioy their maker: whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:17081:142"/>
and power all the parts of the world declare, the
heauens, the earth, the ſea, the day, the night: whereat
the infernall ſpirits tremble and ſhake; euen as good men
on earth bow downe and worſhip the ſame with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
himnes and praiſes; and in heauen no leſſe, all
the orders and bleſſed companie of Saints and Angels
do the like world without end.</p>
            <p>This (loe) is as much as mine author hath diſcourſed
vpon this ſubiect, which I haue Engliſhed for my exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
in both languages, and haue at your intreaties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
vnto you: I will not ſay, being betrayed
by M. <hi>Spencer,</hi> but ſurely cunningly thruſt in, to take
vp this taske, whereby he might ſhift himſelfe from
that trouble. But howſoeuer it be, if it haue liked
you as it is, I ſhall thinke my time well ſpent, both
in the tranſlating of it at the firſt, and in the relating
of it vpon this occaſion in this manner. For as I ſayd
before I began, that I would not tye my ſelfe to the
ſtrict lawes of an interpreter: ſo haue I in ſome places
omitted here and there haply ſome ſentences (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which this our Diſcourſe might be complete e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
becauſe they are rather points of ſubtiller in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſtigation
then our ſpeech required, though the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
therein perhaps aymed at the commendation of
a great reader or abſolute Philoſopher:) and in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
of ſome of the morall vertues, added ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
out of others. And what hath beene ſayd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ciuill felicitie by him, and deliuered in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
by me, I thinke you will allow to be ſufficient.
Since therefore my taske is done, and that it groweth
late, with this onely petition, that you will be content
to beare with the roughneſſe of my ſpeech in reporting
that vnto you, which in his language our Author hath
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:17081:142"/>
eloquently ſet downe, I end.</p>
            <p>Here all the companie aroſe, and giuing me great
thankes, ſeemed to reſt very well ſatisfied, as well with
the manner as with the matter, at the leaſt ſo of their
courteſie they proteſted. And taking their leaues
departed towards the Citie.</p>
