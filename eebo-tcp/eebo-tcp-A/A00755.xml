            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thoſe that write greate vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes cannot chooſe many times but hide the troth, for in much matter there entreth both good and bad, &amp; therefore I will write no more then is neceſſary, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what Chirurgerie is, and in what order it ſhould be vſed with all his accidents, ſhewing what woundes are, with Impoſtumes and vlcers, how they ingender, and when they are ingendred, howe to cure them and diſolue them.

<pb facs="tcp:5903:12"/>
that, and ſo continue vntill they haue found one, that is conuenient for the ſore, where-vnto it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and therefore this is a certeine ſigne, that they knowe not by Science there medicines to helpe the ſore, but with experience they ſearche it.

               <p>VLcers are of diuers and ſundrye kindes, and are ingendred of many cauſes, as hereafter I wil ſhew. But firſt I will write of thoſe kinde of Vlcers that are cauſed of woundes. You ſhall vnderſtande that wounds in what part of the bodie ſoeuer they be, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſtumated, or cancrenated, they chaunge their names, and are no more called wounds, although the originall was a wound. For when it is cancrenated, it is called <hi>Vlcera coraſiua,</hi> bicauſe it goeth eating and créeping on the fleſh. But when the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is impoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and full of matter, it is called, <hi>Vlcera putrida,</hi> that is putrified, &amp; it is bicauſe it is filthie &amp; ſtinketh. But when it is neither cancrenated nor yet apoſtuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that through ſome euill diſpoſition the wound is cloſed, and that there commeth in it euill qualyties without alteration, then it is called <hi>Vlcera ſordida,</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therin is euil qualytie, &amp; it appeareth but a litle, but it is euill to heale. There be other ſorts of vlcers alſo, the which are cauſed of diuers &amp; ſundry kindes of tumors, &amp; the moſt euill &amp; miſcheuous, are thoſe that are of tumors cauſed of the pocks, for vnto thoſe there runneth aboundance of euil humors that augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the vlcer, &amp; they be the worſt ſort, for they can not be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by themſelues, except the body be well purged and euacuated of al the humors that are offenſiue. Ther is another kinde of vlcer the which cometh of an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume, as well hot as colde, and thoſe are more gentle and eaſie to be helpt, if ye know the medicines that are apt to helpe and diſſolue thoſe kinde of vlcers.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the thrée kinde of Vlcers that commonlye

But theſe fiſtoloes that come in dyuers parts of the body are troubleſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, but not perillous, alſo al ſuch ſores as tary long before they be incarnated come to fiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, &amp; many times it commeth through long curing, by tenting with their tentes, the which are cauſe that nature maketh a <hi>Callow</hi> &amp; leaueth the ſore ſo hollow, that it will neuer be filled with fleſh, but ſo remaine hollow, as it is ſéene eaſely by experience. There be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorts of fiſtoloes in forme of a ſore, and they bée thoſe ſores that moſt commonly come on the legges, the which do purge a long time, and are alſo very hard to heale, bicauſe if ye heale one of them preſently, there wil riſe another hard by it, and that is a kinde of fiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe. There is another kinde of fiſtoloe that is cauſed of thoſe ſores that are vpon the bone, the which by his continuance do breake and conſume the ſkine and the bone, and theſe many times remaine fiſtolated, but who ſo taketh away the cauſe of the ſore, nature it ſelf will preuaile mightely and heale it, as may be ſéene dayly by experience, in thoſe that be ſo troubled. The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoloes that come in the eyes, are called <hi>Fiſtola Lacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa,</hi> and they haue ſome communication with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward partes, and are euill to be healed.

The ſecond cauſe I find to be of ſores cauſed of the poxe, and to ſhew a troth, yée ſhall cure them of the Poxe, and their fiſtoloes will heale of themſelues without any other helpe, as it is dayly to be ſéene:</p>

There is another kinde of ſcabbe that is alwayes drye with readneſſe, and is ſmal, with great heate and itching, and the ſame in my iudgement is cauſed by much heate of the Lyuer and aduſtion of bloud, and may be healed eaſely.

The which is done only to helpe Nature to worke the quicker, and to conclude, I ſaye that the Chyrurgian ſhould do the ſame in helping of wounds. But as for vlcers of diuers ſorts, it were neceſſary to finde out the cauſe, bicauſe they come of diuers cauſes, for when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe is found, it wil bée more eaſie to bée helpt, bicauſe vlcers cannot come but by great diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraunce of nature in our bodyes, as by great heat or colde, or by replexions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body.

which is offended, &amp; to extinguiſh the ſuperfluous heat or colde that is in the body: That being done y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or helper of Nature hath thrée things to do. The firſt is to mortifie or kil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſore, the ſecond to mundifie, &amp; the third to incarnate, &amp; then nature wil cicatrize it, &amp; theſe thrée operations are to be vſed in vlcers.

The ſecond cauſe is, that the powers are too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed or opened, by the which operation the vrine doth paſſe with-out retention, and theſe are the two cauſes why the vrine can-not ſtays, and this commeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to young children, bicauſe they are very hot of complection, and the order to helpe them, is this.</p>
               <p>Giue them our <hi>Pillole Aguilone</hi> thrée times, the quantitie is from one dram, to one and a halfe: that being done, ye ſhall make them a decoction of Hiſop of the mountaine, and put ther-in ſugar, &amp; this they ſhal vſe .x. or .xij. dayes at the leaſt, for this mundifieth the place offended, and diſpoſeth it to ſolution.

But ſome-time there happeneth a flux of vryne ſome-what lyke this, and it is not of the afore-ſayd cauſes, but of cauſes much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from them, for this is in men and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of age, and this I finde to be cauſed of the Pockes that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the flux, and they voyd certeine threds which ſome call <hi>Gonorea,</hi> and the remedie there-off is onely with great purging and ſweating, and then to annoint them fiue or ſixe nights with our <hi>Vnguento magno,</hi> &amp; kéepe

            <p>THere hath alwayes béene a greate queſtioning among the Philoſophers, whether that one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine might helpe againſt all diſeaſes or noe.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:5903:47"/>
and mixeth with them, and ſo Nature ſendeth them foorth by vomit or by ſege, or both, and ſo the ſtomack ſhall be euacuated of that matter, and the body remain frée from al impediments of infirmities, ſo that by this reaſon I affirme, that our <hi>Petra Philoſophalle</hi> maye helpe againſt all ſorts of infirmities, and to know the troth, I haue proued it by experience, in all manner of infirmities, and alwayes haue founde it to doe much good vnto al men, and hurt none vnto my knowledge, and the order to make this <hi>Petra Philoſophalle,</hi> is thus.</p>

               <p>IT is neceſſary for the Chirurgion in the cure of woundes and ſores, to helpe the body, aſwell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly as outwardly, to take away the euill qualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and corruption of the humours, and to preſerue it from putrifaction, and then the ſore will heale with little helpe, and in ſhort time, and that thou maiſt do with this Water, the which is vncorriptible and of great experience, and the order to make it is thus.</p>

The firſt Water is of ſuch vertue, that it helpeth al putrified vlcers, if yóe dreſſe them therwith. The ſecond is alſo perfect, that if any man drinke eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning <hi>2.</hi> drames, it will ſo preſerue him, that it were vnpoſſible he ſhould haue any infirmitie. For of this Water I haue made great experience in many kinde of diſeaſes, and ſpecially in the plurifie and <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techie.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
