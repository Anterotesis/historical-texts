            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Honourable <hi>Author</hi> of the following Papers, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it probable that the <hi>Proceſſes</hi> deliver'd in them, having hitherto been Publiſh'd by no man, will, as well for <hi>that Reaſon,</hi> as for the <hi>Nobleneſs</hi> of the Subject, prove not unwelcome to the Curious, in divers <hi>Countries,</hi> where <hi>Engliſh</hi> is not underſtood: He was very willing, for their ſakes,
<pb facs="tcp:56680:3"/>
that this <hi>Tract</hi> ſhould be turn'd into <hi>Latin.</hi> And now, to prevent the needleſs Pains of any, that may have a mind to make ſuch a <hi>Verſion,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having the Opportunity to conſult the <hi>Author,</hi> upon any doubt oſ his meaning, I think fit to give notice, that the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> is, by the <hi>Author's</hi> conſent, made already, and, God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, will quickly appear in <hi>Publick.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps 'twill not be improper to add, that the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why the following <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tract is Printed <hi>in Octavo,</hi> (as they ſpeak) is, that it may be convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Bound up,</hi> either with the <hi>Notes,</hi> already Publiſh'd in the ſame form about <hi>divers Particular Qualities,</hi> or with <hi>thoſe other Notes</hi> that yet remain to be Publiſh'd about <hi>other Qualities;</hi> to whoſe Number <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Inflammability</hi> may be referr'd.

            <head>To my very Learned Friend Dr. J. B.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO gratifie your Curioſity about <hi>Phoſphorus</hi>'s, as much as I can without indiſcretion at preſent do, I muſt, in the firſt place, take notice to you, That though <hi>Phoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi>'s may well be diſtinguiſh'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two ſorts; <hi>Thoſe</hi> that may be ſtil'd Natural, as Glow-worms, ſome ſorts of rotten Wood and Fiſhes, and a few others, and <hi>Thoſe</hi> that are properly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial: yet waving, at preſent, further mention of the former ſort of <hi>Bodies, that without manifeſt heat ſhine in the dark,</hi> (which abſence of ſenſible heat diſtinguiſhes <hi>Phoſphorus</hi>'s from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fire and Flame;) I ſhall now
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56680:5"/>
confine my Diſcourſe to the latter ſort, and tell you, That as far as I have hitherto obſerv'd, thoſe factitious ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Bodies that do or may paſs under the name of <hi>Phoſphorus</hi>'s, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to two principal kinds, one of which may be ſubdivided into two or three, ſo that in <hi>all</hi> they will amount to three or four.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> of theſe conſiſts of ſuch Bodies as ſhine only by the help of External Illuſtration, or (if you pleaſe) ſuch Bodies, as being expos'd to the beams of the Sun, or thoſe of a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Flame, will retain a Lucidneſs, and continue to ſhine ſome time in the dark. Of this kind is the <hi>Bolonian Stone,</hi> skilfully prepar'd; and of this ſort alſo is the <hi>Phoſphorus Hermeticus</hi> of <hi>Balduinus,</hi> of whoſe <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> but not the way of making it, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has given the Learned World an account. This <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very welcome to divers of the Curious, becauſe the <hi>Bolonian Stone</hi> was for ſome years before grown very
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56680:5"/>
rare, even in its own Countrey, <hi>Italy,</hi> which ſcarceneſs, an ingenious Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, then lately come out of thoſe Parts, told me he imputed to the death of the Perſon that us'd to prepare the Stone at <hi>Bologna,</hi> without having left a ſufficient account of his way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it lucid. And the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> of <hi>Balduinus,</hi> which, or the like, may be made (as I have tryed) both of Chaulk, and another ſubſtance, ſeem'd to me, when the Preparation ſucceeded beſt, to catch the External Light (if I may ſo ſpeak) far more readily than the <hi>Bolonian Stone:</hi> For I remember I have had <hi>one,</hi> that being freſhly made, would within about half a minute of an hour be manifeſtly excited, and as it were kindled; ſo that being preſently remov'd into a dark place, it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a very ſenſible Light, for ſo many times as long as it had been expos'd to the beams of the external Light; and this (if I much miſremember not) was even when that external Light was but the flame of a Candle.</p>
            <p>But, on the other ſide, whereas I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56680:6"/>
have more than once or twice obſerv'd, with trouble, that theſe <hi>Phoſphorus</hi>'s could very hardly be preſerv'd for any long time, (which I was apt to impute to the action of the inſinuating Air) ſo that ſome of them in not many months, and others even in a few weeks (or perhaps days) would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear crack'd, and loſe their vertue of being excited by the beams of Light; the <hi>Bolonian Stone,</hi> skilfully prepar'd, would retain its vertue of being exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a much longer time: For I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (whatever Learned Men have deliver'd to the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) I had a ſmall piece of it, which, though I kept it negligently enough in an ordinary little wooden Box, retain'd its vertue for ſeveral years after I had it, which was not till a great while after it was firſt prepar'd. What I have further obſerv'd concerning the <hi>Phoſphorus Hermeticus,</hi> I have not now the leiſure to acquaint you with.</p>
            <p>But beſides this <hi>firſt</hi> kind of <hi>Phoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi>'s, that, to be able to ſhine, muſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56680:6"/>
have their Faculty excited by the beams of the Sun, or <hi>thoſe</hi> of ſome other actually ſhining Body: There is <hi>another</hi> ſort, which needs not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly illuſtrated by any external Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, and yet continues to ſhine far lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the <hi>Bolonian Stone,</hi> or the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> of <hi>Balduinus.</hi> This, by ſome Learned Men has been call'd, to diſcriminate it from the former, a <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> which, though in ſtrictneſs I cannot think it as proper a name as could be wiſh'd, ſince the other <hi>Phoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> will ſhine in the Night as well as the Day, if it be excited with the flame of a culinary Fire, or of a large Candle; <hi>yet</hi> ſince the name has been received by ſeveral, and ſince 'tis not eaſie in our Language, to expreſs the thing clearly in one word, I ſhall (though for Brevity, as much as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction-ſake) admit the uſe of this name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet without forbearing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſubſtitute for it that of a <hi>Self-ſhining ſubſtance,</hi> which is more expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of its nature: Of this ſubſtance, Mr. <hi>Daniel Krafft,</hi> a <hi>German Chymiſt</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56680:7"/>
ſhew'd His Majeſty two ſorts or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. To the firſt of which, I took the liberty to give the name of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi> (or <hi>Gummous) Noctiluca,</hi> not in that ſenſe, wherein the word is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to <hi>Soft,</hi> for this ſubſtance was at leaſt as yielding as Bees-Wax in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but as the word <hi>Conſiſtent</hi> is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd as equivalent to <hi>Firm,</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to <hi>Liquid</hi> and <hi>Fluid.</hi> By reaſon alſo of its ſomewhat viſcous Texture, not very unlike that of Gum of Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſome others newly taken from the Tree, it may be call'd, <hi>The Gummous Noctiluca:</hi> And, I am inform'd, that on the ſcore of its uninterrupted action, 'tis call'd by ſome in <hi>Germany, The Conſtant Noctiluca</hi>; which title it does not ill deſerve, ſince this <hi>Phoſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> is much the <hi>nobleſt</hi> we have yet ſeen. For though there were not much of it, and though it were kept by it ſelf in a little Vial, well ſtop'd, it would, without being externally excited, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly ſhine, as he affirmed, both day and night. Yet the Light it afforded ſeem'd but little, if at all, more vivid,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56680:7"/>
than I have ſometimes obſerved in the Liquor of Glow-worms, and ſome other <hi>Phoſphorus</hi>'s of Nature's produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: Nor had the Poſſeſſor enough of this ſubſtance to invite his conſent to any Trial to improve it, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity he had at <hi>London,</hi> ſcarce exceeding in Bulk the Kernel of an Almond.</p>
            <p>Beſides this Gummous <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> Mr. <hi>Krafft</hi> had a Liquid one, that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, was made only by diſſolution of the former in Water, or ſome conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Liquor; but the Lucidneſs of this, was not permanent like that of the other, as I have noted in another Paper: but within no very long time, eſpecially when 'twas divided into ſmaller portions, and left expos'd to the Air, would expire or vaniſh.</p>
            <p>But beſides the Gummous and the Liquid <hi>Noctiluca</hi> hitherto mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know not whether we may not add a <hi>third</hi> kind, that we our ſelves lately prepared, which ſeems to be of a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differing nature, both from the <hi>Conſiſtent,</hi> and the <hi>Liquid Noctiluca</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56680:8"/>
newly deſcrib'd, at leaſt as far as I obſerv'd their <hi>Phoenomena.</hi> For this of ours would not <hi>ſhine of it ſelf,</hi> like the <hi>conſtant Noctiluca,</hi> nor yet in that <hi>manner</hi> that the <hi>liquid Noctiluca</hi> did; but the bare Contact of the Air, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any external Illuſtration or Heat, would immediately produce a Light, (which might eaſily be made to laſt a good while in a well ſtop'd Veſſel:) And, which is conſiderable, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that ſhin'd, was not the <hi>Body of the Liquor</hi> included in the Vial, but an Exhalation or <hi>Effluvium</hi> mingled with the admitted Air: for both which Reaſons, I gave it the name of <hi>Aerial Noctiluca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the ſeveral <hi>Phoſphorus</hi>'s, that I have yet had opportunity to ſee, but, for ought I know, their variety may extend ſomewhat further, becauſe I have heard of a Paper printed in <hi>Germany</hi> by an ingenious man, whoſe name (if I miſtake not) is <hi>Elſholez,</hi> wherein particular mention is made, in an Hiſtorical way, of the <hi>German
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56680:8"/>
Noctiluca:</hi> But this Paper I cannot yet procure, and therefore you would do well to conſult it, if you can get it; and I am not averſe from thinking, that future Induſtry may diſcover ſome new kinds or variations of ſelf-ſhining Subſtances, that will deſerve new names, and among them, perhaps, that of <hi>Solid Noctiluca's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of Artificial <hi>Phoſphorus</hi>'s, I ſhall be very brief in ſpeaking of their Inventers, whereof I have but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect information. For though I find it generally agreed, that the <hi>Phoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus Hermeticus</hi> was firſt found and publiſhed to the World, by the learned and ingenious <hi>Balduinus,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Lawyer; yet as to the <hi>Gummous</hi> and <hi>Liquid Noctiluca's,</hi> I find the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is by ſome aſcrib'd to the abovemention'd Mr. <hi>Krafft,</hi> (though I remember not, that when he was <hi>here,</hi> he plainly aſſerted it to himſelf;) by others, attributed to an ancient Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, dwelling at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> whoſe

name (if I miſtake not) is Mr. <hi>Branc,</hi> and by others again, with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, aſſerted to a famous <hi>German</hi> Chymiſt in the Court of <hi>Saxony,</hi> call'd <hi>Kunckelius.</hi> But to which of theſe ſo Noble an Invention, as that of the two <hi>German Noctiluca's,</hi> is juſtly due, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am qualified nor deſirous to judge; and therefore, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicing any Man's Right, I will proceed to that, which, I preſume, is the chief thing you would know of me, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>An Account of the Occaſion and Steps of my own Attempt to make a Noctiluca.</hi> Concerning <hi>this</hi> I ſhall give you the following Narrative, wherein, though my urgent Avocations will not (I fear) permit me to be other than immethodical, yet I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to mention ſome circumſtances that I know may be omitted, becauſe they will not, perhaps, be found ſo barely Hiſtorical, but that they may prove of ſome uſe to a leſs Sagacity then yours, in an enquiry into a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, wherein I cannot yet plainly tell you <hi>all</hi> you could wiſh to know, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56680:9"/>
which is both <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Abſtruſe,</hi> as well as <hi>Noble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the experienced Chymiſt Mr. <hi>Daniel Krafft</hi> had, in a Viſit that he purpoſely made me, ſhewn me and ſome of my Friends, both his <hi>Liquid</hi> and <hi>Conſiſtent Phoſphorus,</hi> being by the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> I then obſerv'd, (and whereof the Curious have ſince had publick notice<note n="*" rend="inter">This Clauſe refers to one of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd by the ingenious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> who hath therein inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>verbatim</hi> the Paper he received! from Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi>
               </note>) made certain, that there is <hi>really</hi> ſuch a factitious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be made, as would ſhine in the dark, without having been before <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated</hi> by any lucid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and without being <hi>hot</hi> as to ſenſe: After this, I ſay, I took into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by what ways it might be moſt probable, to produce, by Art, ſuch a <hi>ſhining ſubſtance.</hi> To ſeek for which I was both inclin'd, and hopeful to be ſomewhat aſſiſted, becauſe I had lying by me, among my yet unpubliſh'd <hi>Notes of the Mechanical Origine of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56680:10"/>
qualities,</hi> a Collection of ſome <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations</hi> &amp; <hi>Thoughts</hi> concerning <hi>light. Light.</hi> And I was (alſo) the more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd to attempt ſomewhat this way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe having, at Mr. <hi>Kraffts</hi>'s deſire, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to him ſomewhat that I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd about uncommon <hi>Mercuries,</hi> (which I had then communicated but to one Perſon in the World) he, in requital, confeſt to me at parting, that at leaſt the principal matter of his <hi>Phoſphorus's,</hi> was ſomewhat that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Body of Man. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, though but very general, was therefore very welcome to me, becauſe, though I have often thought it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that a <hi>ſhining ſubſtance</hi> may, by Spagyrical Art, be obtain'd from more kinds of Bodies than one: yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, in the firſt place, to try if I could hit upon ſuch a <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> as I ſaw was preparable, the Advertiſement ſav'd me (for ſome time) the labor of ranging among various Bodies, and directed me to exerciſe my induſtry in a narrower compaſs. But there being divers parts of the Humane Body, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56680:10"/>
have been taken to task by Chymiſts; and, perhaps, by me as carefully, as by ſome others, my choice might have been diſtracted between the Blood, the ſolid Excrements, the Bones, the Urine, and the Hair, of the Humane Body; if various former Tryals and Speculations upon more than one of thoſe Subjects, had not directed me to pitch upon <hi>that,</hi> which was fitteſt to be choſen, and of which, as I had formerly ſet down divers Experiments and Obſervations, ſo I had made proviſion of a quantity of it, and ſo far prepar'd it, that it wanted but little of being fit for my preſent purpoſe. But before I had made any great progreſs in my deſign, I was by divers Removes, Indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Body, Law-Suits, and other Avocations, ſo diſtracted, or at leaſt diverted, that I laid aſide the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> for a long time. And when afterwards I reſum'd it, though I wrought upon the right matter, yet I was diverted from the right way, by a Proceſs that I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Beyond Sea, as a great <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56680:11"/>
that would certainly produce the <hi>Noctiluca</hi> aſpired to, for partly upon this account, but more, becauſe I ſaw that the chief Ingredient in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, was <hi>that</hi> which I, with reaſon, took to be the beſt matter, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to purſue the preſcrib'd method for ſome months, but without ſucceſs; the true matter being, as I concluded, too much either alter'd or clog'd by the additional Ingredients that were deſign'd to improve it; beſides, that the degree of Fire, though a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the greateſt moment, was overlook'd, or not rightly preſcrib'd. However, adhering to the firſt choice I had made of a <hi>fit</hi> matter, I did not deſiſt to work upon it by the ways I judg'd the moſt hopeful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ingenious Stranger, (<hi>A. G. M. D.</hi> Countreyman, if I miſtake not, to Mr. <hi>Krafft</hi>) who had newly made an Excurſion into <hi>England,</hi> to ſee the Countrey, having, in a Viſit he was pleas'd to make me, occaſionally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, among other things, about the <hi>German Noctiluca,</hi> whereof he ſoon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56680:11"/>
perceiv'd I knew the true matter, and had wrought much upon it. He ſaid ſomething about the degree of Fire, that made me afterwards think, when I reflected on it, that <hi>that</hi> was the only thing I wanted to ſucceed in my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors. And there was the more reaſon to think ſo, becauſe for want of a due management of the Fire, we had divers times fail'd, of making the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> of <hi>Balduinus,</hi> not only after we had more than once wrought upon the right matter, but after we had actually made the <hi>Phoſphorus.</hi> Wherefore when he left <hi>London,</hi> having yet ſome quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the matter in ſuch readineſs, that it needed but the Fire to let me ſee what I ought to think of the hint the ingenious Traveller had given me, I caus'd the tryal to be renew'd, which, proving unſucceſsful, diminiſh'd much of my ſtock of prepar'd matter, but it did not ſo diſcourage me, as to hinder me from reiterating the Attempt (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much varying it) with a good part of what remain'd. And though at this time alſo, all the care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56680:12"/>
that could be employ'd, did not hinder an unlucky miſcarriage, that kept the tryal from being <hi>fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory</hi>; yet being confident upon the nature of the thing, I would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the skilful <hi>Laborant,</hi> when he told me with trouble, that what I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, was not at all produc'd: But going my ſelf to the <hi>Laboratory,</hi> I quickly found, that by the help of the <hi>Air,</hi> or ſome <hi>Agitation</hi> of what had paſs'd into the <hi>Receiver,</hi> I could, in a dark place (though it was then day) perceive ſome glimmerings of light, which, you will eaſily believe, I was not ill pleas'd to ſee. And now you have the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of my purſuit of the <hi>Liquid Phoſphorus,</hi> that has made ſome noiſe among the Curious: But I freely confeſs, that the ſucceſs, though wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, was not ſo full as I aim'd at, for I obtain'd no ſuch conſiſtent <hi>Phoſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> as <hi>that</hi> whereof Mr. <hi>Krafft</hi> ſhew'd me, as I formerly told you, a ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. But as I was willing to think that this defect may be imputed to the cracking of the <hi>Retort,</hi> before the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56680:12"/>
Operatien was quite finiſh'd, ſo I hope another Diſtillation in a more luckily choſen Veſſel, may make me amends for the newly mentioned Miſcarriage, and thereby enable me to diſcover other, and perhaps nobler <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of our <hi>ſhining ſubſtance,</hi> than hitherto I have been able to obſerve. Eſpecially conſidering, that the ſame misfortune, that I hope was the principal cauſe of my miſſing the Nobleſt thing I aim'd at, the <hi>Conſtant Noctiluca,</hi>

               </gap>r my purpoſe, that I have not dared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for fear of waſting it, to try ſeveral things with it, that I preſume may be of good uſe in an enquiry into the nature of this <hi>light,</hi> and perhaps alſo of <hi>light</hi> in general. And becauſe I fear by what I have obſerv'd, that, though the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel had not crackt, yet the matter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd would have afforded but a ſmall proportion of <hi>lucid ſubſtance,</hi> I am the more unwilling to fall upon this troubleſom work again, till, beſides other requiſites, I be provided of a competent quantity of a matter which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56680:13"/>
I fear contains but very little of the deſired ſubſtance. However, I have endeavoured to make that uſe of our Experiment, ſuch as it was, that though the <hi>Noctiluca</hi> it produc'd, be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſo lucid as that of Mr. <hi>Kraffts,</hi> yet it may prove as luciferous as his hath hitherto been, ſince (as you will ſee hereafter) I have found a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that needs the Air, and nothing but the Air to kindle it, and that in a moment.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Narrative</hi> I have been the more particular, that it may ſhew you, (what I hope may make you amends for the length of it) that an inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Man ſhould not always be deter'd by the difficulties, or even diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he may meet with, in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Noble Experiment, as long as he judges himſelf to proceed upon good and rational grounds.</p>
            <p>The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> that may be made of <hi>Noctiluca's,</hi> eſpecially of the <hi>Conſiſtent,</hi> are not, in probability, all of them to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56680:13"/>
be eaſily foreſeen and declar'd; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by me, who have not <hi>yet</hi> had time and ability to make thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of ſelf-ſhining ſubſtances, that, by the aſſiſtance of the Father of Lights, I hope will, in proceſs of time, be attained. If the lucid vertue of the <hi>Conſtant Noctiluca</hi> could be (as I ſee not, why it may not be) conſiderably invigorated, it may prevent a great deal of danger, to which <hi>Men of War,</hi> and other Ships are expos'd, by the neceſſity Men often have to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Gun-Room</hi> with common flames or fire, to take out <hi>Powder,</hi> which has occaſion'd the blowing up of many a brave Ship. Our Light may, perhaps, be of uſe to thoſe that dive in deep waters; and alſo may very ſafely and conveniently be let down into the Sea, to what depth one pleaſes, and kept there a long time, to draw together the <hi>Fiſhes</hi> that are wont to reſort to the light of a Fire or Candle; as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> is well known to the <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> who get much profit by this reſort. The ſame
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56680:14"/>
               <hi>ſelf-ſhining ſubſtance</hi> which in our <hi>Aerial Noctiluca</hi> affords a light, that, as faint as it yet is, was able, when I wak'd in the night, to ſhew me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly enough the bigneſs and ſhape of ſome joints of my fingers, and to diſcover itſelf in the ſhape of a <hi>Capital Letter</hi> (of the <hi>Alphabet</hi>) that was cut out of a piece of black'd Paper paſted upon the Vial; this light, I ſay, may probably, (at leaſt when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what invigorated) ſuffice to ſhew the hour of the night when one wakes, (with eyes unaccuſtomed to light) if it be plac'd, inſtead of a Lamp or Candle, behind an <hi>Index,</hi> where the Figures employ'd to mark the Hours are cut out. It may alſo ſerve to make a guide knowable at a good diſtance off, in ſpite of tempeſtuous Winds and great Showers, and this in the darkeſt night. Divers ludicrous Experiments, very pleaſant and ſurprizing, may be made with the <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> by him that has enough of it. But theſe Trifles, though very pretty in their kind, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely paſs over: as alſo an uſe that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56680:14"/>
may be of <hi>great,</hi> but I fear of <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous,</hi> conſequence; reſerving what I have further to ſay of the uſefulneſs of theſe <hi>ſelf-ſhining ſubſtances,</hi> till time ſhall give me more information, and leiſure. In the mean while I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate, that probably the utilities that ſo <hi>Subtle</hi> and <hi>Noble</hi> a Subſtance may be brought to afford in <hi>Medicine,</hi> may be more conſiderable than any of its other particular uſes; and that though our <hi>Noctiluca</hi> had none of theſe, yet it may be highly valuable, if it ſhall (as in all likelihood it will) be found conducive to diſcover the nature of ſo Noble a Subject, as <hi>Light,</hi> whoſe <hi>Encomiums</hi> would require more time than I can allow this writing. And perhaps they will ſeem needleſs, when I ſhall have obſerv'd, that Light was the <hi>firſt Corporeal thing</hi> the great <hi>Creator</hi> of the Univerſe was pleaſed to make; and that (as our excellent <hi>Bacon</hi> has well noted, to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) he was pleas'd to alot the whole <hi>firſt</hi> day to the Creation of <hi>Light</hi> alone, without aſſociating with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56680:15"/>
it in that Honour, any other Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real thing.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premis'd, I ſhall proceed to what I chiefly intended in this <hi>Paper,</hi> viz. the mention of the <hi>Obſervations</hi> themſelves; as ſoon as, to facilitate the underſtanding of them, I ſhall have advertiſed you, that though I fear 'twill always be difficult to get out without loſs, the <hi>ſelf-ſhining ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> rais'd by Diſtillation, yet in <hi>our Experiment,</hi> becauſe the Veſſels would not hold out <hi>intire</hi> to the laſt, we had more difficulty, than even <hi>we</hi> expected, to get out the <hi>luciferous</hi> matter, and were fain to ſave, as much as we could of it, by ſmall parcels, in diſtinct Vials. Whereof <hi>that</hi> which was <hi>firſt</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, though it was judg'd to have receiv'd the vigorouſeſt portion of the <hi>ſhining</hi> liquor; yet for a Reaſon I elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where intimated, (and becauſe it was not at hand, when I had firſt the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to uſe it) I thought fit to make my Tryals with the <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> I had ſav'd in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Vial; ſetting aſide
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56680:15"/>
ſome more faint and aqueous liquor, that was afterwards ſav'd in a <hi>third</hi> Vial; and a thicker ſtuff that remain'd upon the Paper, when ſome of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor had been put into it to be filtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Which Paper was kept in a <hi>fourth</hi> Glaſs, which, though (that it might admit the Paper and adhering luciferous ſtuff) it was wide-mouth'd, yet was it kept carefully ſtopt. Of the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> I obſerv'd in the <hi>ſecond</hi> of theſe <hi>four</hi> Glaſſes, I ſhall, <hi>God</hi> permitting, at this time, give you a ſhort account; deſigning, if my haſte will give me leave, to add ſome Particulars, that I may afterwards obſerve in thoſe Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> that were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the <hi>three</hi> other Glaſſes.</p>

                  <hi>FIfthly and laſtly,</hi> It ſeem'd that ſome <hi>Elaſtical</hi> Particles of the included Air, or ſome Subſtance that concur'd to the maintenance of the Flame, was waſted, or depraved and weakned, by being pen't up in the Vial with the <hi>Emanations</hi> of the Liquor; ſince, when the Vial had been kept ſtopt a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent time, and its Cavity appear'd tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in the outward light; if I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly took out the ſtopple, the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air ſeem'd manifeſtly to ruſh in, as if the <hi>ſpringyneſs</hi> of the internal had been notably debilitated by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Flame, upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with which it was kept im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe <hi>Phoenomena</hi> eaſily brought into my mind ſome of <hi>thoſe</hi> of an odd <hi>Experiment,</hi> that I formerly imparted to the Curious. In which Experiment I obſerv'd (among other things) that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with <hi>Copper,</hi> after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56680:20"/>
there preſcrib'd, would continue limpid and colourleſs, as long as the Vial, that contained it, was kept cloſe ſtopt. But when once the Air came to touch the ſurface of it, it would (ſometimes in leſs than a minute of an hour) be ſo affected thereby, that in a very ſhort time (for 'twas often within ſome minutes) the Liquor would become of a <hi>tranſparent Sky-colour</hi>; and afterwards, the Vial being well ſtopt, and kept in a quiet place, would by degrees grow <hi>diaphanous,</hi> and the Air included with it was wont to have its <hi>ſpring</hi> weakned. And as the change of colour was firſt produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the ſurface, where the Liquor and Air touched one another, and was afterwards thence propagated down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; ſo when this <hi>Coeruleous Colour</hi> began to diſappear, the Liquor mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly became limpid firſt <hi>at</hi> and <hi>near</hi> the bottom, that is, the part which is remoteſt from the ſuperior Air.</p>

               <p>BUT to <hi>what,</hi> this concurrence or efficacy of the Air ought to be aſcrib'd, is a Problem that ſeem'd to me ſo difficult, that my thoughts were put upon ſeveral conjectures for ſo much as a tolerable ſolution of it; for a taſte of which, I ſhall venture to offer to you <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of thoſe that leaſt diſpleaſe me.</p>
               <p>I thought it not improbable that the admitted Air, either by ſome ſubtle Salt that it contain'd, or upon ſome ſuch account, excited in the fumes, it mingled with, a kind of <hi>Fermentation,</hi> or (if you pleaſe) a <hi>Commotion,</hi> by which means the matter acquired ſo brisk an agitation, as to propagate the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56680:22"/>
motion to the eye, and <hi>there</hi> make an impreſſion, the ſenſe whereof we call <hi>Light:</hi> though it ſeem'd alſo not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that ſome of the particles of the <hi>ſuperveneing Air</hi> may ſo aſſociate themſelves with thoſe <hi>congruous</hi> ones, they met with in the cavity of the Vial, that, by that Coalition, Corpuſcles were produc'd, fitted to be, by the ſubtle Aetherial matter, that abounds in the pores of the Air, ſo pervaded and briskly agitated, as to produce <hi>light.</hi> And it was not <hi>new</hi> to me, that the Air ſhould aſſociate itſelf with inviſible Exhalations, and concur with them to make new Concretions: ſince I have ſeveral times prepar'd a volatile ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous liquor, red as a <hi>Ruby,</hi> which, when the Vial has been kept cloſe for ſome time, ſuffers the empty cavity of the veſſel to be <hi>tranſparent</hi>; but upon the unſtopping it, and giving acceſs to the outward Air, it appears preſently full of <hi>white fumes,</hi> more <hi>opacous</hi> than a miſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſomething like <hi>this,</hi> though in an inferior degree, may be obſerv'd when we unſtop Glaſſes that are but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56680:22"/>
partly full of <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> provided thoſe liquors be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as much, and no more, then is fit. For the contact of the Air will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently make the <hi>former</hi> manifeſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <hi>white</hi> fumes, and the <hi>latter</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>red</hi> ones, and ſometimes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways coloured. But if I durſt mention, what my love to Mankind has oblig'd me to conceal, even from my neareſt Friends, I could give an inſtance of a ſtrange power of the Air to excite a vehement Motion in fitly diſpos'd Matter, though it be of a conſiſtence far more unlikely to be thus agitated, than the <hi>fluid</hi> ſubſtances of our <hi>Phoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus:</hi> ſince I experimentally know a Body, dry, and ſolid enough to be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable, that barely by the contact of the common Air, will, even when it is actually cold, in very few minutes have its parts brought to ſuch a degree of agitation, that its heat is little leſs intenſe than <hi>that</hi> of ſome actually ignited Bodies, and may, if I pleaſe, by the further action of the Air, be brought to afford ſome <hi>light</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56680:23"/>But againſt this conjecture <hi>about the cauſe of the Air's concurrence to the ſhining of our Noctiluca,</hi> there came into my mind, among other things, a ſtrong Objection, that may be drawn from the <hi>Conſtant Noctiluca</hi> formerly mention'd to have been ſhewn by Mr. <hi>Krafft,</hi> in which the lucidneſs was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, though the Vial that contain'd it, was kept ſtopt. In anſwer to this, I thought it might be ſaid, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>lucid</hi> ſubſtance, being in great numbers crowded together into a little room, theſe concentrated Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles may be ſupposd to have been brought to ſuch a ſtate, that they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the renewed aſſiſtance of the outward Air, to continue ſhining; either becauſe their inteſtine motions were brisk enough to diſcuſs the minute parts of the matter, wherewith they were aſſociated, and ſo from time to time to generate or extricate, &amp; ſupply themſelves with as many ſmall Aerial Particles, as were neceſſary to keep the maſs they belong'd to, <hi>luminous.</hi> Which conjecture may be illuſtrated by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56680:23"/>
that though our common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linary flames are preſently extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, unleſs they be cheriſh'd with freſh Air, yet I elſewhere recite an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, of a Compoſition, which is ſo fitted to generate as much Air, as it needs, that I have ſeveral times found, that it may be kindled, and made to flame away, even <hi>in vacuo Boyleano,</hi> (as they call that made by our <hi>Air-pump.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Other things may be alledg'd both <hi>for</hi> and <hi>againſt</hi> the propos'd conjecture, about the account on which the <hi>Air</hi> concurs to the light of our liquid <hi>Nocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luca</hi>; but, I hope, it will not be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to add, that perhaps the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Air may be <hi>conſiderable</hi> to both the <hi>Phoſphorus's,</hi> the <hi>fluid</hi> and the <hi>conſiſtent,</hi> but the external Air be <hi>neceſſary</hi> only to the former: becauſe in the latter, the <hi>luciferous</hi> Particles may have acquired ſuch a texture, as that of rotten wood, or rather of whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, or the liquor of glow-worms, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out after they are dead. For in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56680:24"/>
that ſtate (whatever others have written) I have kept that Juice <hi>lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi> for very many hours, (not to ſay ſome dayes;) and 'tis conceivable enough, that in the <hi>Conſiſtent Noctiluca,</hi> by reaſon of the great numerouſneſs and extreme minuteneſs of the parts, and the unctuouſneſs or viſcoſity, or in a word, tenacity of them, the maſs they make up, is much leſs diſſipable than <hi>that,</hi> wherein the ſhining vertue of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wood, or the juice of dead glow-worms reſides. This conjecture may be confirm'd, by obſerving as a thing very analogous to our <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> that I have found ſome lights in putrid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to be ſo faint, that they would, like that of our fluid <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> (but far more quickly) diſappear, when they were totally depriv'd of Air, as I ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times found in parcels of rotten wood. And on the contrary, others had ſo vigorous or tenacious a light or flame, that, like the ſplendor of the conſtant <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> it would continue (though perhaps not in its full luſtre) when the outward Air was in our
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56680:24"/>
Pneumatick Engine, diligently drawn off from it. And on this occaſion I call to mind another Experiment, which ſeems yet more analogous, than any hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto alledg'd, to our preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>flame</hi> or <hi>light.</hi> For having purpoſely kept certain Fiſh in a Glaſs, freed from Air, till I concluded it had lay'n longer than was neceſſary to bring it to that degree of Putrefaction, which was wont to make ſuch Fiſh, at that time of the year, to <hi>ſhine,</hi> I could not perceive in the Cavity of the Glaſs the leaſt glimpſe of light: and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after I had let in the outward Air, it did (according to my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) as it were, kindle a <hi>flame,</hi> in the proximately diſpos'd matter, or at leaſt produce in <hi>it</hi> a manifeſt <hi>light.</hi> And it may much conduce to ſhew, that the lately mentioned difference of <hi>ſhining Bodies</hi> may be but <hi>gradual,</hi> if I here obſerve, that I found by tryal, that in Bodies of the ſelf ſame kind, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>Glow</hi> worms, or the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Rotten</hi>-fiſhes; if the light were but faint, the withdrawing of the Air
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56680:25"/>
would after a while make it quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear; and the readmiſſion of the Air would preſently make it reappear, as it happens in our <hi>Aerial Noctiluca.</hi> But in thoſe individuals, wherein the <hi>luciferous</hi> matter was more copious and vigorous, and probably more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious, the abſence of the external Air did ſomewhat leſſen or impair, but not quite deſtroy the <hi>light,</hi> and ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly it might happen in Mr. <hi>Krafft</hi>'s <hi>Conſiſtent Noctiluca:</hi> For though it ſhone without the renew'd acceſſion of external Air, yet, that it would have been more brisk and active, if it had been aſſiſted by ſuch Air, I was induc'd to think, becauſe (if I much miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not) when once, to gratifie my curioſity, he took it out of the Vial, he uſually kept it in, it did manifeſtly ſmoke and waſte by the action of the Air, and produc'd conſiderable effects of actual heat; for this being done in the day-time, in a Room we could not darken, it could not indeed be expected, that we ſhould diſcern any augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of light, but yet that there was
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56680:25"/>
                  <hi>one,</hi> may probably be argued from the newly mentioned things, that us'd to be its concomitants.</p>
               <p>Such Obſervations and Reflections incline me to think, that, to ſpeak in a general way, the light of our <hi>Noctilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's</hi> depends upon a peculiar and very brisk agitation of ſome minute Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>ſhining matter,</hi> in point of Bulk, Shape, and Contexture, peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted to impel the contiguous <hi>Aether</hi> to the bottom of our eyes, and made me think it not improbable, that the contact of freſh external Air, might contribute to this peculiar kind of agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the <hi>Gummous Noctiluca,</hi> as an <hi>helpful</hi> thing, and in the <hi>Aerial Nocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luca</hi> as an <hi>almoſt neceſſary</hi> concurrent. But whether the Air concur to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>as</hi> it does itſelf excite a brisk commotion in the fumid matter, it invades, <hi>or</hi> whether it makes a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar kind of diſſipation of it, <hi>or</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Air, or ſome fine ſubſtance contain'd in it, operates on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as a kind of <hi>vital ſpirit,</hi> ſuch as is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56680:26"/>
found neceſſary, not only to common flame, but to <hi>that</hi> which is ſuppos'd to keep Animals alive; <hi>or</hi> whether the Corpuſcles of the admitted Air ſo combine with <hi>thoſe,</hi> that exhale from the groſſer liquor, as to become fit to be vehemently agitated by ſome aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial pervading ſubſtance? whether or no, I ſay, the <hi>agency</hi> of the Air in our <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> be to be refer'd to <hi>one</hi> or <hi>more</hi> of the newly mentioned things, or to ſome <hi>other</hi> cauſe of a peculiar and very brisk agitation, which, to ſpeak in general, ſeems to have the main ſtroak in the production of light, is left to further inquiry.</p>
               <p>But I forget, that my intention was to ſet down <hi>Obſervations,</hi> not <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis's.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Part, of what I had to ſay of <hi>Phoſphorus's,</hi> is far more uſeful and certain, than the <hi>Conjectures</hi> I can yet make upon it. Becauſe, though I am content to let them paſs, in regard they may afford <hi>you</hi> ſome hints of further ſpeculations; yet the true ſolution of the <hi>Problem,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56680:26"/>
that has occaſioned this <hi>Excurſion,</hi> may depend ſo much upon <hi>further</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Obſervations, that though, it is <hi>not impoſſible,</hi> that future <hi>Phoenomena</hi> may favor the propos'd conjectures, yet, it is <hi>not very unlikely,</hi> that I ſhall hereafter ſee cauſe to change them for ſome <hi>Hypotheſis's,</hi> exceedingly different from <hi>them.</hi> To return therefore now to our <hi>Hiſtorical Obſervations.</hi>

of a true <hi>Noctiluca.</hi> And ſince that time, I have not found the Vial to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford any <hi>light,</hi> barely upon its being unſtopt, ſo that either (in ſpight of my care) ſome Bodies unskilful curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity has, unknown to me, ſpoil'd the liquor; or, (which is more likely) ſo little a quantity, as I had at firſt, by the many and various <hi>Tryals</hi> I made with it, is diſpirited and become, as it were, <hi>effoet</hi>; which, 'twas lucky it did not do, till the forecited <hi>Obſervations</hi> had been made with it.

ſhaking it a little, and unſtopping it in a dark place, I perceived the exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that poſſeſs'd the Cavity of the Vial, to ſhine, as formerly; but their light was ſo momentany, that it ſcarce ſooner appear'd, than vaniſh'd; and though afterwards it ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, it was not vivid, nor laſted a minute of an hour, nor perhaps half ſo long; though it ſeem'd, that when <hi>freſh</hi> Air was then allow'd acceſs to it, its duration was thereby ſomewhat lengthned.

            <p>YOU may remember (Sir) that, to clear the way to the twenty foregoing <hi>Obſervations,</hi> I formerly told you, that we received the <hi>luciferous</hi> matter, obtain'd by our diſtillation, in ſeveral <hi>ſmall Glaſſes,</hi> as we were able to ſave it. The parcel, that was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Vial, afforded us the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> hitherto recited; and <hi>now</hi> it will be fit to add to <hi>thoſe,</hi> ſuch as more lately occur'd, upon our conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the portions of <hi>luciferous</hi> matter, preſerv'd in the <hi>other</hi> Glaſſes, and ſome alſo of the like lucid ſubſtance, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red another way. And though theſe <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:56680:35"/>
be not ſo numerous, as the former, and be, a few of them, near of kin to ſome of the others; yet I ſhall not ſcruple here to ſubjoin <hi>them,</hi> both becauſe moſt of them are <hi>new,</hi> and thoſe that are not, will ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and elucidate ſome of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Obſervations.</hi> Beſides that, 'tis not eaſie to know, what <hi>Phoenomena may</hi>

            <p>A ſmall portion of liquor, (not much exceeding a ſpoonful) that was the <hi>firſt,</hi> and was judg'd the <hi>beſt,</hi> I ſav'd, being put into a long, and ſomewhat ſlender Cylindrical <hi>Vial,</hi> made of white or chryſtalline Glaſs, afforded us the enſuing <hi>Phoenomena.</hi>

               <p>SOon after the muddy liquor (for ſuch it appear'd to the eye) was poured into the Vial, it was ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly luminous, (probably, in great part, from the contact and inſinuation of ſo much Air, as it met with in its transfuſion,) that not only it ſhone vividly, but continued to ſhine ten hours, that I took notice of, before my occaſions made me deſiſt from obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Experiment</hi> minds me of an <hi>Objection,</hi> which I ſhould have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and anſwered at the beginning of the foregoing Paper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I had <hi>then</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to do it. For, whereas it may by ſome be thought improper for me, to call our <hi>luciferous</hi> matter a <hi>ſelf-ſhining ſubſtance,</hi> in regard that it is not <hi>lucid,</hi> without the concurrence or help of the Air: I anſwer, That I do, (and juſtly may) employ the word <hi>ſelf-ſhining,</hi> to ſignifie, that the light our
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56680:36"/>
matter affords, is not a light <hi>borrowed</hi> from any external lucid, as is done by the <hi>Bolonian</hi> Stone, and the <hi>Phoſphorus Balduini,</hi> but proceeds, as it were, from an <hi>inward principle</hi> of light. And Men ſcruple not, upon ſuch an account, to reckon the flame of a Candle, and a glowing Coal, to be <hi>ſelf-ſhining Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> though neither of theſe will be kindled, or continue to ſhine, without the aſſiſtance of renewed Air, no not for a <hi>few minutes:</hi> whereas, the newly recited <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> of our <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> ſhews, that, our prepar'd matter, being for a very ſhort time, (perhaps but few minutes) impregnated by the Air, 'twill continue to ſhine <hi>many hours</hi> in a well ſtop'd Glaſs, that hinders it from being reliev'd by any ſupply of freſh Air.</p>

               <p>WHen I ſet down the <hi>Fifth,</hi> and ſome other of the foregoing <hi>Obſervations,</hi> I was not at leiſure to diſcourſe the Reaſons that induced me to try for an <hi>Aerial Noctiluca</hi>; and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56680:36"/>
now alſo to ſave time, I ſhall forbear launching into ſpeculations upon that Subject, and only tell you <hi>Hiſtorically,</hi> that, preſuming the Matter, that would ſhine in our Cylindrical Glaſs, would not be ſo much the <hi>Liquor itſelf,</hi> as an aggregate of ſuch <hi>Effluviums</hi> of it, as, affected and excited by the Air, would become lucid; I thought fit to take particular notice, how the Air would work upon the Exhalations of this more vigorous Liquor. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, having heedfully open'd the Vial, though I very ſoon after ſtop'd it again, I obſerv'd a great Commotion to be made in the Cavity of the Glaſs, unpoſſeſs'd by the Liquor: For the now <hi>lucid</hi> Exhalations ſeem'd to have a nimble and almoſt circular motion, along the ſides of the Glaſs, and to make, as it were, a little whirlwind, that impetuouſly carried it round; and this renew'd <hi>Rotation</hi> was not only manifeſt, but laſted much longer than one would have expected: ſo great a Commotion did the Air ſeem to have produced in the <hi>Effluviums</hi> of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56680:37"/>
and perhaps in the neighbouring parts of the Liquor itſelf. Upon the ceaſing of this unuſual motion, the light did not ceaſe, but perſevered, though I had not occaſion to obſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how long 'twould have laſted.</p>

               <p>I Will not determine, whether the vertiginous motion, mentioned in the newly recited <hi>Obſervation,</hi> was in part produced by what happen'd in the enſuing <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> which was, That having heedfully taken out the ſtopple of our Vial in a dark place, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had for a long time ceaſed from ſhining, I obſerv'd the external Air to ruſh into the Cavity of the Glaſs with noiſe, and ſo ſwiftly, as did, I confeſs, ſurprize me: as if the preceding flame, though not ſenſibly hot, had, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of culinary flames, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably weakned the <hi>ſpring</hi> of the included Air, and ſo diſabled it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the whole preſſure of the external Air, when, by the removal of the

But I will not, as I was ſaying, determine, whether this irruption of the Air, may not have contributed to the circular motion of the lucid ſteams mention'd in the foregoing obſervation? becauſe, though the affirmative ſeem a <hi>probable</hi> cauſe, yet I was kept from concluding it a <hi>neceſſary</hi> or <hi>onely</hi> cauſe of the turbinous motion, by my having ſome times, when no ſuch irruption of the Air had in a long time preceded, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Rotations of <hi>lucid matter</hi> in the Cavity of the Vial: which motion therefore ſeem'd to proceed from ſome other cauſe, though (to add that by the by) this cauſe, whatever it was, produc'd but ſuch a rotation, as was leſs general, leſs nimble, and leſs laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

continued for a good while to afford the company a very pleaſing ſpectacle; and, (which was remarkable) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the darkneſs of the Room, it was manifeſt, that they emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great ſtore of whitiſh ſmoke, which, or ſome other <hi>Effluviums</hi> from the ſame matter, imbued the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Air with a ranck and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſmell.

to paſs from one part of the wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Paper to the other, did ſometimes appear to have, as it were, a palpitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to afford a very unequal light; and though, when the external Air was let in through the Pump into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted <hi>Receiver,</hi> the flame ſeem'd to be quenched, yet I judge <hi>that</hi> to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a temporary effect of the wateriſh vapors, that the Air had taken along with it in its way through the Pump; and therefore I caus'd the <hi>Receiver</hi> to be taken off the Engine, and <hi>then,</hi> the Spectators were quickly of my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, obſerving, that upon the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of the freſh outward Air, which was not like <hi>that</hi> laſt mentioned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved by moiſt vapors, the matter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the Paper was quickly ſeen to ſhine again, and that more vividly, than it had done in the <hi>Receiver.</hi> But becauſe I ſuſpected, that this Veſſel could not at <hi>that time,</hi> for want of ſome conveniences, be ſo well exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as on <hi>other</hi> occaſions it has often been, <hi>though,</hi> by the <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to recited, it ſeemed to the Spectators

            <head>OF THE <hi>Way</hi> of preparing THE AERIAL NOCTILUCA.</head>
            <p>THE ſeveral <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of our <hi>Aerial Phoſphorus</hi> or <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> wherewith, you have hitherto been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd, have, I doubt not, raiſed in you a preſſing curioſity to know, of what matter this <hi>ſelf-ſhining ſubſtance</hi> was made, and <hi>how</hi> that <hi>matter</hi> was <hi>prepar'd,</hi> to be capable of affording it.</p>
            <p>Though two or three years are now paſt, ſince I caus'd to be made, more than once, in my Furnaces, a <hi>Phoſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, not unlike</hi> that of the learned <hi>Balduinus,</hi> (I ſpeak thus cautiouſly, becauſe I am not ſure, what particular
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56680:52"/>
matter <hi>He</hi> employs, and I have brought more than one ſort of <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Bodies, to ſhine;) yet I forbore to divulge, what I knew, becauſe (as I declar'd to ſome curious Men, that preſs'd me to do it,) I was willing to leave <hi>him</hi> the liberty of publiſhing his invention. But finding he has not <hi>yet</hi> thought fit to impart it to the World, there appear'd the leſs cauſe to expect that the ſecret of the <hi>Noctiluca,</hi> which is a much more valuable thing, would be ſuddenly made publick: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without long waiting any man's leiſure, I reſolv'd to impart to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, (and particularly, Sir, to your ſelf,) the knowledge of the <hi>matter,</hi> I wrought upon, and ſome directions <hi>how</hi> to manage it. And in purſuit of that reſolution, I am willing to gratifie the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> with that very <hi>proceſs</hi> (for ſubſtance) which I ſet down, for my own remembrance, after I had the <hi>firſt</hi> time actually made the Aerial <hi>Noctilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>; and <hi>which</hi> I afterwards depoſited, ſeal'd up, in the hands of the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Secretary</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi>

in the preſence of divers Members of that illuſtrious <hi>Company.</hi> And though ſince that time, ſome other Tryals have enabled me to obſerve ſome <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,</hi> pertinent to that purpoſe; yet I thought fit to leave it it as it was, that others finding themſelves, in ſome ſort, oblig'd to employ their <hi>own</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, <hi>their</hi> trials may, as mine have done, produce an inſtructive diverſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of effects, in an attempt, where experience invites me to think, that various <hi>degrees</hi> of fire and other <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,</hi> (and perhaps <hi>Caſualties</hi> too) may diverſifie the <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> and thereby both inrich the <hi>yet</hi> wanted, and deſigned <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the <hi>Speculative,</hi> to accommodate a good <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to them. Reſerving then for another time my <hi>latter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> upon the Obſervations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, delivered in this Paper, I ſhall <hi>now</hi> only give you a few ſhort Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will not poſitively affirm, that the matter, I employ'd, is the <hi>very</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:56680:53"/>
ſame, that was made uſe of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>German Chymiſts</hi> in their <hi>Nocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luca</hi>; for ſome <hi>inquiſitive</hi> men have very lately told me, that the <hi>Germans</hi> mingle <hi>two</hi> or <hi>more</hi> diſtillable mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials; whereas I employ'd but <hi>one</hi> matter, capable of Diſtillation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though all the <hi>Twenty</hi> foregoing <hi>Obſervations,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Ten</hi> additional ones adnexed to them, were made with <hi>that</hi> ſubſtance, which I gueſs to be at leaſt the <hi>chief,</hi> that is employ'd by the <hi>Germans,</hi> (which was done for a particular reaſon, not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be here expreſs'd,) yet I <hi>firſt</hi> thought, and upon my very <hi>firſt</hi> tryal, found, that 'tis poſſible to make a <hi>Noctiluca</hi> of a <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>pulverable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ought I can gueſs, was never employ'd by Mr. <hi>Krafft,</hi> or <hi>thoſe</hi> he had his ſecret from. And beſides this <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort of <hi>Phoſphorus's,</hi> we made a <hi>third,</hi> that was obtain'd from a <hi>Body,</hi> that never had been either a part, or an excrement, of a Humane Body, nor was mingled with any thing,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56680:53"/>
that had been ſo. But though I found theſe <hi>ſelf-ſhining ſubſtances</hi> ſomewhat differing from thoſe made of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,</hi> hereafter to be nam'd; yet, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtay at preſent to ſay any thing more of <hi>them,</hi> being content to have intimated, That <hi>ſelf-ſhining Phoſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus's</hi> have been actually obtain'd from more <hi>ſingle</hi> Subjects, than <hi>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To name the <hi>matter,</hi> though never ſo explicitely, would not, in my opinion, have ſufficed to inform <hi>thoſe</hi> that would work upon <hi>it.</hi> For <hi>Chymiſts</hi> themſelves would, in all probability, work, (as hitherto, on other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have wrought) upon the <hi>volatile</hi> and <hi>ſaline,</hi> which they preſume to be the only <hi>ſpirituous</hi> and <hi>noble</hi> parts of the Concrete, throwing away the reſt, as <hi>uſeleſs</hi> and <hi>abominable.</hi> And on this occaſion, let me add, that I was the <hi>rather</hi> induc'd to ſet down this <hi>proceſs,</hi> that we may both <hi>obſerve,</hi> and thankfully <hi>acknowledge</hi> the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>bounty</hi> of the great <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> who, for our encouragement to ſtudy
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56680:54"/>
even his meaneſt works, has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in a <hi>Body,</hi> that is commonly thought <hi>one</hi> of the deſpicableſt of the Univerſe, to lodge ſo glorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a thing, as a <hi>ſelf-ſhining ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And I ſcarce doubt, but <hi>this,</hi> though it will be admired <hi>now,</hi> will be much more priz'd <hi>hereafter,</hi> when <hi>it</hi> ſhall be brought to greater perfection; and when men ſhall have diſcover'd more of its uſes, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably will be great in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might add, to ſome purpoſes, that few <hi>Chymiſts</hi> themſelves do yet dream of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> One thing remains, that, to ſave ingenious men ſome labour and charge, I think fit to give early notice of; namely, that having, for tryal ſake, employ'd the <hi>Liquor,</hi> hereafter to be named, without previous fermentation or putrefaction; though, 'twas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with after the ſame manner, with <hi>that</hi> whereby we obtain'd our
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56680:54"/>
               <hi>Noctiluca</hi>; and though, it afforded a ſubſtance for colour and conſiſtence, not unlike our <hi>luciferous matter</hi>; yet I could not find, that, <hi>that</hi> ſubſtance would at all <hi>ſhine.</hi> And indeed, there are ſo many <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> whoſe miſtake may make the <hi>Experiment</hi> miſcarry, (as I have found to my trouble, even ſince the <hi>Phoſphorus,</hi> whoſe <hi>Phoenomena</hi> are firſt ſet down, was made) that, though, I were not now in haſte, I ſhould be content to take time to learn better from <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,</hi> how to inſtruct others, before I venture to do it circumſtantially; and he that ſhall, at the <hi>firſt</hi> attempt, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in preparing this <hi>Liquor,</hi> ſhall be thought by me, either a very <hi>skilful,</hi> or a <hi>lucky</hi> Operator.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly and laſtly,</hi> That it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as well by the very different <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,</hi> as by the differing <hi>Phoenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of the <hi>Phoſphorus Hermeticus,</hi> and of the <hi>Aerial Noctiluca,</hi> that there is a great diſparity between thoſe <hi>lucid Bodies,</hi> I ſhall here briefly add the way
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56680:55"/>
we employ'd to make either the <hi>Phoſphorus Balduini,</hi> or ſome <hi>other</hi> like <hi>it,</hi> (for I am not certain, what is the very way of that Learned Man) as it was practiſed in my <hi>Furnaces</hi>; which, in ſhort, is this.</p>
            <p>A Diſſolution being made of fine white Chaulk in good <hi>Spirit of Nitre,</hi> or clean <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> it is to be filtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thorow <hi>Cap-Paper,</hi> and the clear Solution is to be evaporated, till there remain a <hi>dry Subſtance:</hi> With this white <hi>Calx,</hi> you are to overlay the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of ſome Veſſel, made of good Earth, that will endure the Fire, and that of a <hi>round</hi> figure, which is more convenient, than <hi>that</hi> of ordinary <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibles</hi>; and to the matter, contain'd in this Veſſel, you are to give, for about half an hour or an hour, (according to the largeneſs of it, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances) a due degree of Fire, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis not eaſie to hit, and which ordinarily requires a conveniently ſhap'd Veſſel, whereby the <hi>flame</hi> or <hi>heat</hi> may be <hi>reverberated,</hi> till you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56680:55"/>
the matter to have acquired a diſpoſition, to retain the <hi>light</hi>; and <hi>then</hi> the earthen Veſſel, which uſually ought to be ſomewhat ſhallow, and not to exceed many inches in <hi>Diameter,</hi> is to have a <hi>Cover</hi> of fine Glaſs or Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal carefully cemented on to it, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it from, its great Enemy, the Air.</p>
            <p>What we have <hi>obſerv'd,</hi> in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this preparation, is not ſo <hi>proper</hi> to be delivered at this time, when my haſte, as well as ſome other things, make it more fit, that we ſhould forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with return to our <hi>Aerial Noctiluca,</hi> of which, after the foregoing things have been premis'd, 'tis time that now there ſhould follow</p>

            <head>THE Proceſs.</head>
            <p>THere was taken a conſiderable quantity of <hi>Humane <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Liquor yields but a <hi>ſmall</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>luciferous matter,</hi>] that had been, (a good part of it at leaſt) for a competent while, digeſted or putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, before it was us'd. This <hi>Liquor</hi> was diſtill'd, with a moderate heat, till the <hi>ſpirituous</hi> parts were drawn off; after which, the ſuperfluous <hi>moiſture</hi> alſo was abſtracted, (or evaporated away) till the remaining ſubſtance was brought to the conſiſtence of a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56680:57"/>
               <hi>thick ſyrup,</hi> or a <hi>thin extract.</hi> This was well incorporated with about thrice its weight of <hi>fine white ſand,</hi> and the mixture was put into a ſtrong <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort</hi>; to which was join'd a <hi>large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,</hi> in good part fill'd with water. Then, the <hi>two</hi> Veſſels being carefully luted together, a naked Fire was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually adminiſtred, for <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> hours, that all, that was either <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,</hi> or otherwiſe <hi>Volatile,</hi> might come over <hi>firſt.</hi> When this was done, the Fire was increas'd, and at length, for <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> hours made (NB) which it ſhould be in this Operation) as ſtrong and intenſe, as the <hi>Furnace</hi> (which was not bad) was capable of giving. By this means, there came over good ſtore of <hi>white</hi> fumes, almoſt like <hi>thoſe,</hi> that appear in the Diſtillation of <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi>; and when <hi>thoſe</hi> fumes were paſt, and the <hi>Receiver</hi> grew clear, they were after a while ſucceeded by <hi>another</hi> ſort, that ſeem'd in the <hi>Receiver</hi> to give a faint <hi>blewiſh light,</hi> almoſt like <hi>that</hi> of little burning Matches, dipt in <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:56680:57"/>
And laſt of all, the Fire being very vehement, there paſs'd over <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſubſtance, that was judg'd more ponderous than the former, becauſe (NB) much of it fell through the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to the bottom of the <hi>Receiver:</hi> whence being taken out, (and partly even whil'ſt it ſtaid <hi>there</hi>) it appear'd by ſeveral effects, and other <hi>Phoenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> to be (as we expected) of a <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferous nature.</hi>

            <p>The ways I employ'd to make a <hi>ſelf-ſhining ſubſtance,</hi> out of other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then that expreſs'd in this <hi>Proceſs,</hi> I muſt, for certain Reaſons, forbear to acquaint you with, at this time.</p>
            <p>I might from the foregoing <hi>Proceſs,</hi> take occaſion to inquire, whether the <hi>matter,</hi> wherein the <hi>ſhining</hi> faculty chiefly reſides, do not conſiſt, not (as one would expect) of the <hi>volatile</hi> and <hi>ſpirituous</hi> parts of our Animal Liquor, but of its (not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but) <hi>more</hi> fixt Salt, and ponderous foetid Oil, aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated

in a peculiar manner and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
