            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And foraſmuch as this intention of the King, Our ſaid Grand-Father, could not be effected, by reaſon of his ſudden and precipitated Death; and that the Execution of the foreſaid Edict was interrupted during the Minority of the late King, Our moſt Honored Lord and Father, of glorious Memory, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome new Enterprizes of thoſe of the <hi>Pretended Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> whereby they gave occaſion for their being deprived of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Advantages, which had been granted to them, by the aforeſaid Edict: notwithſtanding, the King, Our ſaid late Lord and Father, according to his wonted Clemency, granted them another Edict at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> 1629 by means of which the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom being now again Re eſtabliſhed, the ſaid late King, being animated with the ſame Spirit and Zeal for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the King Our ſaid Grand-Father was, reſolved to make good Uſe of this Tranquility, by endeavouring to put this Pious Deſign in Execution: but Wars abroad, coming on a few years after, ſo that from the Year 1635. to the Truce which was concluded with the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> in 1684. the Kingdom having been only for ſome ſhort Intervals altogether free from Troubles, it was not poſſible to do any other thing for the Advantage of Religion, ſave only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the number of Places permitted for the Exerciſe of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformed Religion,</hi> as well by the Interdiction of thoſe which were found Erected, in prejudice to the Diſpoſal made in the ſaid Edict, as by ſuppreſſing the Mixt Chambers of Judicature, which were compoſed of an equal number of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> the Erecting of which was only done by Proviſion, and to ſerve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Exigency.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore, at length, it hath pleaſed <hi>God</hi> to grant, that Our Subjects enjoying a perfect Peace, and We Our ſelves being no longer taken up with the Cares of Protecting them againſt our Enemies, are now in a Condition to make good Uſe of the ſaid Truce, which we have on purpoſe facilitated, in order to the applying our ſelves entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſearching out of Means, which might ſucceſsfully effect and accompliſh the Deſign of the Kings, Our ſaid Grand-father and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,  and which alſo hath been <note place="margin">☞</note>* Our Intention ever ſince we came to the Crown; We ſee at preſent, (not without a juſt Acknowledgment of what We owe to <hi>God</hi> on that Account) that Our Endeavours have attained the End We propos'd to Our ſelves for aſ much as the greater and better part of Our Subjects of the ſaid <hi>Pretended Reformed Religion,</hi> have already embraced the <hi>Catholick;</hi> and ſince by means thereof the Execution of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and of all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in favour of the ſaid <hi>Pretended Reformed Religion,</hi> is become uſeleſs, We judge that We can do nothing better towards the entire effacing of the Memory of thoſe Troubles Confuſions, and Miſchief, which the Progreſs of that falſe Religion have been the cauſe of in Our Kingdom, and which have given occaſion to the ſaid Edict, and

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. We make known, that We, for theſe and other Reaſons Usthereto moving, and of Our certain Knowledge, full Power and Authority Royal, have by the preſent Perpetual and Irrevocable Edict, Suppreſſed and Annulled, do Suppreſs and Annul the Edict of the King, Our ſaid Grand-Father, given at <hi>Nantes,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 1598. in its whole extent, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the particular Articles ratified <hi>May</hi> 2. next following, and Letters Patent granted thereupon; as likewiſe the Edict given at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1629. declaring them null and void, as if they had never been Enacted; together with all the Conceſſions granted in them, as well as other Declarations, Edicts and Arreſts, to thoſe of the <hi>Pretended Reformed Religion,</hi> of what Nature ſoever they may be, which ſhall all continue as if they never had been. And in purſuance hereof, We Will, and it is Our Pleaſure, That all the Churches of thoſe of the <hi>Pretended Reformed Religion,</hi> ſcituate in Our Kingdom, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Lands, and Dominions belonging to Us, be forth with demoliſh'd.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We forbid our Subjects of the <hi>Pretended Reformed Religion,</hi> to Aſſemble themſelves, for time to come, in order to the Exerciſe of their Religion in any Place or Houſe, under what pretext ſoever, whether the ſaid Places have been granted by the Crown, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Judges of particular places; any Arreſts of Our Council, for Authorizing and Eſtabliſhing of the ſaid places for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, notwithſtanding.</p>

To this Reſolution ſome anſwer'd, <hi>That there was no need of their Aſſembling themſelves upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for a ſmuch as every one of them in particular, were to Try and Examine themſelves, and be alwaies in a readineſs to give a reaſon of the Faith which was in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Day the <hi>Intendant</hi> again commanded them to Meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Town Houſe, which, he ordered, ſhould be left free for them from Noon till Six of the Clock in the Evening: Where meeting accordingly, they Unanimouſly reſolved as they had Lived, ſo to perſiſt till Death in their Religion: Which Reſolution of theirs there were ſome Deputed by them to declare to the <hi>Intendant;</hi> who preſenting themſelves before him, he who was appointed Spokeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, began to Addreſs himſelf to the <hi>Intendant</hi> in theſe Words: <hi>My Lord, We are not unacquainted, how we are menaced with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Violence.—Hold there,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Intendant</hi> (interrupting him) <hi>No Violence.</hi> After this the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> continued; <hi>But whatever Force or Violence may be put upon us,</hi>—Here the <hi>Intendant</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him again, ſaid, <hi>I forbid you to uſe any ſuch Words:</hi> Upon which Second Interruption, he contented himſelf to aſſure him in few Words, <hi>That they were all reſolved to Live and Die in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Day after, the Battalion of <hi>La Ferre,</hi> conſiſting of 16 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies entred the City, and were followed by many more. The
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101092:6"/>
               <hi>teſtants</hi> all this while dreaming of no other Deſign they had againſt them, but that of ruining their Eſtates, and Impoveriſhing them, had already taken ſome Meaſures how to bear the ſaid Tryal; they had made a Common Purſe, for the Relief of ſuch who ſhould be moſt burthen'd with Quartering; and were come to a Reſolution to poſſeſs what they had in Common: But, Alas! how far theſe poor Souls were miſtaken in their Accounts, and how different the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they received from the <hi>Dragoons</hi> was, from what they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, I ſhall now Relate to you.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, in order to their Executing the Deſign and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject they had formed againſt them, they made the Souldiers take up their Quarters in one certain place of the City; but withal, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral <hi>Corp de Guards</hi> to cut off the Communication which One part of the City might have with the Other, and poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Gates, that none might make their Eſcape. Things being thus ordered, the Troopers Souldiers and Dragoons began to practiſe all manner of Hoſtilities, and Cruelties, wherewith the Devil can Inſpire the moſt In human and Reprobate Minds: They mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d and defac'd their Houſhold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtuff, broke their Looking-Glaſſes, and other like Utenſils and Ornaments; they let their Wine run about their Cellars, caſt abroad and ſpoil'd their Corn, and other Alimentary Proviſions: And as for thoſe things which they could not break and daſh to pieces, as the Furniture of Beds, Hangings, Tapiſtry, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, Wearing Apparel, Plate, and Things of the like Nature; theſe they carried to the Market-place, where the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> bought them of the Souldiers, and encouraged <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to do the like. They did not ſtick to Sell the very Houſes of ſuch, who were moſt reſolute and conſtant in their Profeſſion. It is ſuppoſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a Moderate Calculation, that in the time of four or five daies, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of that City were the poorer by a Million of Money, than they were before the entring of theſe Miſſionaries. There were Souldiers, who demanded Four hundred Crowns apiece of their Hoſts for ſpending-Money; and many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were forced to pay down Ten Piſtols to each Souldier, upon the ſome Account.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the outrages they committed upon their Perſons were moſt deteſtable and Barbarous; I ſhall only here ſet down ſome few, of which I have been particularly inform'd. A certain Taylor called <hi>Bearnois,</hi> was bound and drag'd by the Souldiers to the <hi>Corp de Guard,</hi> where they Boxed and Buffetted him all Night, all which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101092:6"/>
blows and Indignities he ſuffered with the greateſt conſtancy Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. The Troopers who Quartered with Monſieur <hi>Solignac</hi> made his Dining Room a Stable for their Horſes, tho the Furniture of it was Valued at 10000 Livres, and forc'd him to turn the Broach till his Arm was near burnt, by their continual caſting of Wood upon the Fire. A Paſſenger as he went through the ſaid City ſaw ſome Souldiers beating a poor Man even to Death, for to force him to go to Maſs, whilſt the conſtant Martyr to his laſt Breath, cryed, <hi>He would never do it,</hi> and only requeſted they would <hi>Diſpatch and make an end of him.</hi> The Barons of <hi>Cauſſade</hi> and <hi>De la Motte,</hi> whoſe Conſtancy and Piety might have inſpired Courage and Reſolution to the reſt of the Citizens, were ſent away to <hi>Cahors.</hi> Monſieur <hi>D' Alliez,</hi> one of the prime Gentlemen of <hi>Montanban,</hi> being a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Old Man, found ſo ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Treatment at their hands, as it's thought he will ſcarcely eſcape with Life. Monſieur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>De Garriſon,</hi> who was one of the moſt conſiderable Men of that City, and an intimate Friend of the <hi>Intendant,</hi> went and caſt himſelf at his Feet, imploring his Protection, and conjuring him to rid him of his Souldiers, that he might have no force put upon his Conſcience; adding, That in Recompence of the Favour he beg'd of him, <hi>He would willingly give him all he had,</hi> which was to the Value of about a Million of Livres; but by all his Entreaties and Proffers, he could not in the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the <hi>Intendant;</hi> who gave order, that for a Terror to the meaner ſort, he ſhould be worſe uſed than the reſt, by dragging him along the Streets.</p>
            <p>The Method they moſt commonly made uſe of, for to make them Abjure their Religion, and which could not be the product of any thing but Hell, was this; Some of the moſt ſtrong and vigorous Souldiers, took their Hoſts, or other perſons of the Houſe, and walk'd them up and down in ſome Chamber, continually tickling them and toſſing them like a Ball from one to another, without giving them the leaſt Intermiſſion, and keeping them in this condition for three daies and nights together, without Meat, Drink, or Sleep: When they were ſo wearied and fainting, that they could no longer ſtand upon their Legs, they laid them on a Bed, continuing as before to Tickle and Torment them; after ſome time, when they thought them ſomewhat recovered, they made them riſe, and walked them up and down as before, ſometimes Tickling, and other times Laſhing them with Rods, to keep them from Sleeping. As ſoon as one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101092:7"/>
of theſe Barbarous Tormenters were tyred and wearied out, they were Relieved by others of their Companions, who coming freſh to the Work, with greater Vigour and Violence reiterated the ſame Courſe. By this Infernal Invention (which they had formerly made uſe of, with ſucceſs; in <hi>Bearn</hi> and other places many went Dictracted, and others became Mopiſh and Stupid, and remain ſo.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who made their Eſcape, were fain to abandon their Eſtates, yea, their Wives, Children, and Aged Relations, to the Mercy of theſe Barbarous, and more than Savage Troops. The ſame Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were acted at <hi>Negrepliſſe,</hi> a City near to <hi>Montauban;</hi> where theſe Bloody Emiſſaries committed unparallel'd Outrages. <hi>Iſaac Favin,</hi> a Citizen of that Place, was hung up by his Arm-pits, and tormented a whole Night, by pinching and tearing off his Fleſh with Pincers; though by all this they were not able to ſhake his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the leaſt. The Wife of one <hi>Rouffion,</hi> a Joyner, being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently dragg'd by the Souldiers along the Streets, for to force her to hear Maſs, dyed of this cruel and inhumane Treatment, as ſoon as ſhe reach'd the Church Porch.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other their Deviliſh Inventions, this was one: They made a great Fire round about a Boy of about Ten Years of Age; who continually, with Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven, cryed, <hi>My God, help me;</hi> and when they ſaw the Lad reſolved to Dye ſo, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than renounce his Religion, they ſnatch'd him from the Fire, when he was at the very point of being Burnt. The Cities of <hi>Cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade, Realville,</hi> St. <hi>Anthonin,</hi> and other Towns and Places in the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Guinne,</hi> met with the ſame Entertainment, as well as <hi>Bergerac,</hi> and many other Places of <hi>Perigord,</hi> and of the Lower <hi>Guinne;</hi> which had a like ſhare of theſe cruel and inhumane Uſages.</p>
            <p>The forementioned Troops marched at laſt to <hi>Caſtres,</hi> to commit the ſame Inſolencies and Barbarities there alſo: And it is not to be doubted, but that they will continue, and carry on the ſame courſe of Cruelties, where ever they go; if <hi>God,</hi> in Pity and Compaſſion to his People, do not reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>It is to be feared, (for it ſeems but too probable) that this dreadful Perſecution in conjunction with thoſe Artifices the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make uſe of to diſguiſe their Religion, and to perſwade <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that they ſhall be ſuffered to Worſhip God as formerly, will make many to comply with them, or at leaſt make their Mouths give their Hearts the Lye, in hopes of being by this means put into a condition to make
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101092:7"/>
their eſcapes, and returning to that Profeſſion, which their weakneſs hath made them deny.</p>
            <p>But, Alas! this is not all; for thoſe poor Wretches, whom by theſe Deviliſh ways of theirs, they have made to Blaſpheme and Abjure their Religion, as if this were not enough, muſt now become the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors and Tormentors of their own Wives and Children, for to oblige and force them to Renounce alſo; for they are threatned, that if within three days time they do not make their whole Family Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in like manner, thoſe rough Apoſtles (the <hi>Dragoons)</hi> ſhall be fain to take further pains with them, in order to the perfecting of their Converſion. And who after all this can have the leaſt doubt, but that theſe unhappy <hi>Dragoons</hi> are the very Emiſſaries of Hell, whoſe very laſt Efforts and Death ſtruglings theſe ſeem to be?</p>
            <p>This Relation hath given a ſhort view of ſome of thoſe Sufferings, the <hi>Reformed</hi> have undergone, but not of all: It is certain, that in divers places they have tryed to wear out their Patience, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Conſtancy by applying Red-hot Irons to the Hands and Feet of Men, and to the Breaſts of Women. At <hi>Nantes</hi> they hung up ſeveral Women and Maids by their Feet, and others by their Arm-pits, and that ſtark Naked, thus expoſing them to publick View, which aſſuredly is the moſt cruel and exquiſite Suffering can befall that Sex; becauſe in this caſe their Shamefac'dneſs and Modeſty is moſt ſenſibly touched, which is the moſt tender part of their Soul. They have bound Mothers that gave Suck unto Poſts, and let their little Infants lye Languiſhing in their ſight, without being ſuffered to Suckle them for ſeveral days, and all this while left them crying, moaning, and gaſping for Life, and even Dying for Hunger &amp; Thirſt, that by this means they might Vanquiſh the Conſtancy of their Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted Mothers, Swearing to them they would never permit they ſhould give them Suck till they promiſed to Renounce their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel. They have taken Children of Four or Five Years of Age, and kept them from Meat and Drink for ſome time, and when they have heen ready to faint away and give up the Ghoſt, they have brought them before their Parents, and horribly Aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, that except they would Turn, they muſt prepare themſelves to ſee their Children Languiſh and Dye in their preſence. Some they have bound before a great Fire, and being half Roaſted, have after let them go: They beat Men and Women outragiouſly; they drag them along the Streets, and Torment them day and night.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101092:8"/>
The ordinary way they took, was to give them no reſt; for the Souldiers do continually Relieve one another for to Drag, Beat, Torment and Toſs up and down theſe Miſerable Wretches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Intermiſſion. If it happen that any by their Patience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy do ſtand it out, and Triumph over all the Rage and Fury of thoſe <hi>Dragoons,</hi> they go to their Commander and acquaint him, they have done all they could, but yet without the deſired ſucceſs; who in a Barbarous and Surly Tone, anſwers them; <hi>You muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon them, and do worſe than you have done; the King Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it; either they muſt Turn, or I muſt Burſt and Periſh in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</hi> Theſe are the pleaſant Flowry Paths, by which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> allure <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to return to the Boſome of their Church.</p>
            <p>But ſome it may be will object; You make a great noiſe about a
ſmall matter, all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have not been expoſed to theſe Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but only ſome few obſtinate Perſons: Well, I will ſuppoſe ſo, but yet the Horror of thoſe Torments Inflicted on ſome, hath ſo fill'd the Imagination of theſe Miſerable Wretches, that the very thoughts of them hath made them comply; it is indeed a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which we are aſhamed for their ſakes, and from whence we hope God will raiſe them again, in his due time; yet thus much we may alledge for their excuſe, that never was any Perſecution, upon pretence of Religion, carried on to that pitch, and with that Politick Malice and Cruelty that this hath been; and therefore, of all thoſe which ever the Church of Chriſt groan'd under, none can can be compar'd with it. True indeed it is, that in former Ages it hath been common to Burn the Faithful under the Name of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> but how few were there expoſed to that cruel kind of Death, in compariſon of thoſe who eſcaped the Executioners hands? But, behold here a great People at once Oppreſs'd, Deſtroy'd, and Ruin'd by a vaſt Army of prodigious Butchers, and few or none eſcaping. Former, yea late times have given us ſome Inſtances of Maſſacres; but theſe were only violent Tempeſts, and ſudden Hurricanes, which laſted but a Night, or, at the moſt, a few daies, and they who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in them were ſoon out of their pains, and the far greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber eſcaped the dint of them: but how much more dreadful is the preſent condition of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>France?</hi> And to the end we may take a true view and right meaſures of it, let us conſider, that nothing can be conceived more terrible, than a State of War; but what War to be compared with This? They ſee a whole Army of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101092:8"/>
Butcherly Cannibals entring their Houſes, Bateering, Breaking, Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Deſtroying whatever comes to hand; Swearing, Curſing and Blaſpheming like Devils; beating to exceſs, offering all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Indignities and Violence; diverting themſelves, and ſtriving to out-vy each other in inventing New Methods of Pain and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not to be appeaſed with Money, or good Chear; foaming and roaring like Ravenous raging Lyons; and preſenting Death, at every moment; and that which is worſe than all this, driving People to Diſtraction, and ſenſeleſs Stupidity, by thoſe Deviliſh Inventions we have given you an Inſtance of in the Relation of <hi>Mentauban.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, This Perſecution hath one Characteriſtical Note more; which, without any Exaggeration, will give it the Precedence in Hiſtory for Cruelty, above all thoſe which the Church of <hi>God</hi> ever ſuffered under <hi>Nero, Maximinus,</hi> or <hi>Diecleſian;</hi> which is, The ſevere Prohibition of departing the Kingdom, upon pain of Confiſcation of Goods, of the Gally, of the Laſh, and perpetual Impriſonment. All the Sea-Ports are kept with that Exactneſs, as if it were to hinder the Eſcape of Traytors, and common Enemies: All the Priſons of Sea-Port-Towns are cramm'd with theſe miſerable Fugitives, Men Women, Boys, and Girls; who there are Condemned to the worſt of Puniſhments, for having had a deſire to ſave themſelves from this dreadful Perſecution, and deluging Calamity. This is the Thing which is unparallel'd; and of which we find no Inſtance: This is that Superlative Exceſs of Cruelty, which we ſhall not find in the Liſt of all the Violent and Bloody Proceedings of the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va:</hi> He Maſſacred, he Beheaded, he Butchered; but at leaſt, he did not Prohibit thoſe that could, to make their Eſcape. In the laſt <hi>Hungarian</hi> Perſecution, nothing was required of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but only that their Miniſters ſhould Baniſh themſelves, and Aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Renounce the Conduct of their Flocks; and becauſe they were unwilling to obey theſe Orders, therefore it is they have Groan'd under ſo long, and ſo Terrible a Perſecution, as they have done, But this <hi>Hungarian</hi> Perſecution is not to be compared with that we are ſpeaking of; for the Fury of that Tempeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged it ſelf upon the Miniſters only; no Armies were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, to force the People to change their Religion, by a thouſand ſeveral waies of Torment; much leſs did it ever enter the Thoughts of the Emperors Councel, to ſhut up all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> in order to the deſtroying of all thoſe who would not abjure their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101092:9"/>
               <hi>Religion;</hi> which yet is the very condition of ſo many wretched Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in <hi>France,</hi> who beg it as the higheſt Favour at the Hands of their Mercileſs Enemies, to have Leave to go and beg their Bread in a Foreign Country; being willing to leave their Goods, and all other outward Conveniencies, behind them, for to lead a poor, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, languiſhing Life in any Place, where only they may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Dye in their Religion.

Glorious</hi> God, <hi>for whoſe Names ſake we ſuffer all theſe things, who knoweſt our Innocence and Weakneſs, as well as the Fury and Rage of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the ſmall Support and Help we find in the World: Behold, we periſh, if thy Pity doth not rouze Thee up for our Relief. It is Thou art our Rock, our</hi> God, <hi>our Father, our Deliverer: We do not place our Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in any, but Thee alone: Let us not be confounded, becauſe we put our Truſt in Thee. Haſte Thee to our Help; make no long tarrying, O</hi> Lord, <hi>our</hi> God, <hi>and our Redeemer!</hi>

            <head>A Letter ſent from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> giving an Account of the Perſecution of thoſe of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHat you have heard concerning the Perſecution of thoſe that are of our <hi>Religion,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Bearne, Guinne,</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigord,</hi> is but too true; and I can aſſure you, that they who have given you that Account, have been ſo far from amplifying the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they have only acquainted you with ſome few particulars; yet am I not ſo much ſurprized at the difficulty you find to perſwade your ſelf, that the things of which your Friends Inform you, are true: In caſes of this Nature, ſo amazingly unexpected, we are apt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101092:9"/>
to diſtruſt our own Eyes; and I profeſs to you, that though all places round about us Echo the Report of our Ruine and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet I can ſcarcely perſwade my ſelf it is ſo indeed, becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend it. It is no matter of ſurprize, or amazement, to ſee the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> afflicted upon Earth, foraſmuch as ſhe is a ſtranger here, as well as her Captain, Lord and Husband, the Holy and Everlaſting bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> was; and muſt, like Him, by the ſame way of Croſs and Suffering, return to her own Country, which is above. It is no matter of aſtoniſhment, to find her from time to time ſuffering the worſt of uſage, and moſt cruel Perſecutions; all Ages have ſeen her expoſed to ſuch Tryals as theſe, which are ſo neceſſary for the Teſting of her Faith, and ſo fit a matter of her Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Glory. Neither is it any great wonder, if, amidſt theſe ſore Tryals, vaſt numbers of thoſe who made Profeſſion of the Goſpel, do now Renounce and forſake it: We know that all have not Faith; and it is more than probable, that they who do not follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but becauſe they Thrive by it, and for the Loaves, will ceaſe to be of his Retinue, when he is about to oblige them to bear his Croſs, and deny themſelves. But that which ſeems Inconceivable to me, is, that our Enemies ſhould pitch upon ſuch ſtrange ways and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to deſtroy us, as they have done, and that, in ſo doing, they ſhould meet with a ſucceſs ſo prodigious and doleful. I ſhall as brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can endeavour to give you an account of ſo much as I have underſtood of it.</p>
            <p>All thoſe thundring Declarations, and deſtructive Arreſts, which continually were Sued for, and obtain'd againſt us, and which were Executed with the Extremity of Rigour, were ſcarce able to move any one of us. The forbidding of our Publick Exerciſes, the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of our Churches, and the ſevere Injunction that not ſo much as Two or Three of us ſhould dare to Aſſemble, in order to any thing of Divine worſhip, had no other effect upon the far greater part of us, than to Inflame our Zeal, inſtead of abating it; obliging us to Pray to <hi>God</hi> with greater Fervor and Devotion in our Cloſets, and to Meditate of his Word with greater Application and Attention. And neither the great wants, to which we were reduced by being depriv'd of our Offices and Imploys, and all other means of Living, and by thoſe inſupportable charges with which they ſtrove to over-whelm us, as well by Taxes, as the Quartering of Souldiers (both which were as heavy as could be laid upon us) nor the continual trouble
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101092:10"/>
we were put to by Criminal or other matters of Law, which at the Suit of one or other were ſtill laid to our charge, tho upon the moſt frivolous and unjuſt pretences imaginable; I ſay, all theſe were not able to wear out our Patience, which was hardned againſt all Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ties: inſomuch as the deſign of forcing us to abandon the Truth of the Goſpel, would Infallibly have been Ship-wrack'd, if no other means had been taken in hand for this purpoſe. But, Alas! Our Enemies were too Ingenious, to be bank'd ſo; and had taken out Ruine too much to Heart, not to ſtudy for means effectual and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to bring-about their deſires: They call'd to mind what Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſucceſs a new kind of Perſecution had had of late Years in <hi>Pocton, Aunix,</hi> and <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> which the <hi>Intendants</hi> of thoſe places had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought themſelves of; and they made no difficulty to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the ſame, as to a means Infallible, and not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</p>
            <p>I muſt tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> That we had not the leaſt thought that ever ſuch violent Methods as theſe, would have been pitched upon, as the means of our Converſion: We were always of Opinion, that none but <hi>Dennuieux's,</hi> and <hi>Marillacs,</hi> could be fit Inſtruments for ſuch like Enterprizes; neither could we ever have Imagin'd, that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of Armies, who account it a Shame and Reproach to Attack and take ſome paultry Town or Village, ſhould ever debaſe themſelves to Beſiege Old Men, Women, and Children in their own Houſes; or that ever Souldiers, who think themſelves ennobled by their Swords, ſhould degrade themſelves ſo far, as to take up the Trade of Butchers and Hangmen, by tormenting poor Innocents, and inflicting all ſorts of Puniſhments upon them.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we were the leſs in expectation of any ſuch thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at the ſelf-ſame time they Treated us in this manner. they would needs perſwade us, <hi>That the King's Councel had diſapproved the Deſign:</hi> And indeed, it ſeem'd very probably to us, that all Reaſons, whether taken from Humanity, Piety, or Intereſt, would have made them diſavow and condemn a Project ſo Inhumane and Barbarous: Yet now, by Experience, we find it but too true, that our Enemies are ſo far from rejecting the ſaid Deſign, that they carry it on with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell'd Zeal and Application, without giving themſelves any further trouble to effectuate their Deſires, than that of doing theſe two things.</p>
            <p>The Firſt of which was, to Lull us aſleep, and to take away from us all matter of Suſpition of the miſchief they were hatching againſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101092:10"/>
us; which they did by permitting ſome of our Publick Exerciſes of Religion, by giving way to our Building of ſome Churches, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling Miniſters in divers places to Baptize our Children, and by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing ſeveral Arreſts and Declarations, which did intimate to us, that we had reaſon to hope we ſhould yet Subſiſt for ſome Years: Such was that Declaration, by which all Miniſters were ordered to change their Churches every three years.</p>
            <p>The other was, to ſecure all the Sea-Ports of the Kingdom, ſo as none might make their eſcape, which was done by renewing the Antient Prohibitions of departing the Kingdom without leave, but with the addition of far more ſevere Penalties.</p>
            <p>After theſe precautions thus taken, they thought themſelves no longer oblig'd to keep any meaſures, but immediately lift up the hand, to give the laſt blow for our Ruine. The <hi>Intendents</hi> had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to repreſent to us, <hi>That the King was reſolved to ſuffer no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in his Kingdom beſides his own, and to Command us all in his Name, readily to Embrace the ſame, without allowing us any longer reſpite to conſider what we had to do, than a few days, nay, hours;</hi> threatning us, <hi>That if we continued obſtinate, they would force us to it by the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Rigour; and preſently Executing theſe their Menaces, by filling our Houſes with Souldiers, to whom we were to be left for a Prey; and who, not content with entirely Ruining of us, ſhould beſides exerciſe upon our Perſons all the Violence and Cruelty they could poſſibly deviſe:</hi> And all this to overcome our Conſtancy and Perſeverance.</p>
            <p>Four Months are now paſt and gone, ſince they began to make uſe of this ſtrange and horrible way of Converting People, worthy of, and well becoming its Inventors. The Country of <hi>Bearne</hi> was firſt ſet upon, as being one of the moſt conſiderable Out-parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to the end that this miſchievous enterprize gaining ſtrength in its paſſage, might ſoon after over-whelm, and as it were deluge all the other Provinces in the ſame Sea of the uttermoſt calamity. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Foucaut</hi> the Intendant, went himſelf in Perſon to all the places where we were in any numbers, and commanded all the Inhabitants that were of the Proteſtant Religion, under the Penalty of great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercements, to Aſſemble themſelves in thoſe places he appointed to them; where being accordingly met together, he charged them in the Kings Name to change their Religion, allowing them only a day or two to diſpoſe themſelves for it: He told them, <hi>The great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Souldiers were at hand, to compel thoſe that ſhould refuſe to yield
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101092:11"/>
a ready obedience;</hi> and this threatning of his being immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Effect, as Lightning is by Thunder, he fill'd the Houſes of all thoſe who abode conſtant in their reſolution to Live and Die Faithful to their Lord and Maſter, <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> with Souldiers; and Commands thoſe inſolent Troops (fleſh'd with Blood and Slaughter) to give them the worſt Treatment they could poſſibly deviſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not undertake, <hi>Sir,</hi> to give you a particular Account of thoſe Exceſſes and Out-rages, theſe enraged Brutals committed in Executing the Orders they were charged with; the Relation would prove too tedious and doleful: It ſhall ſuffice me to tell you, That they did not forget any thing that was Inhuman, Barbarous, or Cruel, without having regard to any Condition, Sex or Age; they pull'd down and, demoliſhed their Houſes; they ſpoil'd, daſh'd to pieces, and burnt their beſt Moveables and Houſhold-ſtuff; they bruiſed and beat to Death Venerable Old Men; they dragg'd Honourable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons to Maſs, without the leaſt pity or reſpect; they bound and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Innocent Perſons, as if they had been the moſt Infamous and Profligate Villains; they hung them up by their Feet, till they ſaw them ready to give up the Ghoſt; they took Red-hot Fire-ſhovels, and held them cloſe to their bare heads, and actually applied them to other parts of their Bodies; they Immur'd them within four Walls, where they let them periſh for Hunger and Thirſt: And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy wherewith they ſuffer'd all theſe Torments, having had no other effect, but that of augmenting the Rage of theſe Furies, they never ceaſed inventing new waies of Pain and Torture, till their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity at length had got the Victory, and Triumphed over the patience and Faith of theſe miſerable Wretches. Inſomuch, that of all thoſe many numerous Aſſemblies, we had in that Province, as that of <hi>Pan, d'Arthes, d'Novarre, &amp;c.</hi> there are ſcarcely left a ſmall number, who either continue conſtant in deſpite of all theſe Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or elſe have made their eſcape into <hi>Spain, Holland, England,</hi> or elſewhere, leaving their Goods and Families for the prey to theſe mercileſs and cruel Men.</p>
            <p>Succeſs having thus far anſwered their Expectation, they reſolved to loſe no time; but vigorouſly proſecuting their work, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately turned their Thoughts and Arms towards <hi>Montaubam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> where the <hi>Intendant</hi> having Summoned the Citizens to appear before him, beſpeaks them much of the ſame Language, as was uſed to thoſe of <hi>Bearne;</hi> whereunto they having returned about the ſame Anſwer, he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101092:11"/>
orders 4000. Men to enter the City, and makes them take up their Quarters, as at <hi>Bearne,</hi> only in the Houſes of <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command to Treat them in like manner, as they had done thoſe of <hi>Bearne:</hi> And theſe inhuman Wretches were ſo diligent and active in Executing theſe pitileſs Orders, that of 12 or 15000. Soul, of which that Church did conſiſt, not above 20 or 30 Families are eſcaped; who, in a doleful and forlorn Condition, wander up and down the Woods, and hide themſelves in Thickets. The ruin of this Important Place, drew after it the Deſolation of all the Churches about it; which were all Enveloped in the ſame common Calamity, as thoſe of <hi>Realmont, Bourniquel, Negrepliſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet was not the condition of the Churches in the Upper <hi>Guienne</hi> more ſad and calamitous, than that of thoſe of the Lower <hi>Guienne,</hi> and of <hi>Perigord;</hi> which this horrible Deluge hath likewiſe over-whelm'd. Monſieur <hi>Bouſlers,</hi> and the <hi>Intendant,</hi> having ſhared the Country between them; Monſieur <hi>de Bouſters</hi> taking for his part <hi>Agenois, Tonnein, Clerac,</hi> with the adjoyning places; and the <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> having taken upon him to reduce <hi>Fleis, Monravel, Genſſac, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon, Coutras, Libourne,</hi> &amp;c. The Troops which they commanded, in the mean time, carrying Deſolation to all the Places they paſſed through, filling them with Mourning and Deſpair, and ſcattering Terror and Amazement amongſt all thoſe to whom they approached.</p>
            <p>There were at the ſame time 17 Companies at St. <hi>Foy,</hi> 15 at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac,</hi> and as many in proportion in all other parts: So that all Places being fill'd ith theſe Troops, accuſtom'd to Licentiouſneſs and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, there is not any one of the ſaid places, where they have not left moſt dreadful marks of their Rage and Cruelty; having at laſt, by means of their exquiſite Tortures, made all thoſe of our <hi>Religion</hi> ſubmit themſelves to the Communion of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as <hi>Bergerat</hi> was moſt ſignally famous for the long Trials it had moſt gloriouſly endured, and that our Enemies were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible of what advantage it would be, to the carrying on of their Deſign, to make themſelves Maſters there alſo, at any price whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; they accordingly fail'd not to attempt the ſame with more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and Obſtinacy, than any of the forementioned Places.</p>
            <p>This little Town had already, for three years together, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable patience and conſtancy, endured a thouſand ill Treatments, and Exactions from Souldiers, who had pick'd them to the very Bones: for beſides that, it was almoſt a continual paſſage for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101092:12"/>
there were no leſs than Eighteen Troops of Horſe had their Winter Quarters there; who yet in all that time had only gain'd three Converts, and they ſuch too as were maintain'd by the Alms of the Church.</p>
            <p>But to return: The deſign being form'd to reduce this City, two Troops of Horſe are immediately ordered thither, to obſerve the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and ſoon after 32 Companies of Foot enter the Town: Monſieur <hi>Bouflers</hi> and the <hi>Intendant</hi> of the Province, with the Biſhops of <hi>Agen</hi> and <hi>Perigueux,</hi> and ſome other Perſons of Quality, tender themſelves there at the ſame time, and ſend for 200 of the chiefeſt Citizens to appear before them; telling them, <hi>That the Kings Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Will and Pleaſure was, they ſhould all go to Maſs; and that in caſe of Diſobedience, they had order to compel them to it:</hi> To which the Citizens Unanimoſly anſwered, <hi>That their Eſtates were at the diſpoſe of his Majeſty, but that God alone was Lord of their Conſciences; and that they were reſolved to ſuffer to the utmoſt, rather than do any thing contrary to the motions of it.</hi> Whereupon they were told, <hi>That if they were ſo reſolved, they had nought elſe to do but to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to receive the Puniſhment their Obſtinacy and Diſobedience did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;</hi> and immediately 32 Companies more of Infantry and Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enter the City (which, together with the 34 Companies before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, were all Quartered with <hi>Proteſtants)</hi> with Expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand not to ſpare any thing they had, and to exerciſe all manner of Violence upon the Perſons of thoſe that entertain'd them, until they ſhould have extorted a Promiſe from them, to do whatſoever was Commanded them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Orders then being thus Executed, according to the deſires of thoſe who had given them, and theſe miſerable Victims of a Barbarous Military Fury, being reduc'd to the moſt deplorable and deſolate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; they are again ſent for to the Town-houſe, and once more preſſed to change their Religion; and they anſwering with Tears in their eyes, and with all the Reſpect, Humility, and Submiſſion imgina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>That the Matter required of them, was the only thing they could not do,</hi> the extreameſt Rigor and Severity is denounc'd againſt them; and they preſently made good their Words, by ſending 34 more Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies into the City, which made up the full number of an hundred; who encouraging themſelves from their numbers, and flying like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Wolves upon theſe innocent Sheep, did rend and worry them in ſuch a manner, as the ſole Relation cannot but ſtrike with Horror
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101092:12"/>
and Amazement. Whole Companies were ordered to Quarter with one Citizen; and Perſons whoſe whole Eſtate did not amount to 10000. Livres, were taxed at the rate of 150. Livres a day: When their Money is gone, they ſell their Houſhold-ſtuff, and ſell that for two pence, which hath coſt 60. Livres; they bind and fetter Father, Mother, Wife and Children: Four Souldiers continually ſtand at the door, to hinder any from coming in to ſuccour or comfort them: they keep them in this condition, two, three, four, five, and ſix days, without either Meat, Drink, or Sleep: On one hand the Child cries, with the Languiſhing accent of one ready to Dye, <hi>Ah my Father! Ah my Mother! What ſhall I do? I muſt Dye, I can endure no longer:</hi> The Wife on the other hand cries; <hi>Alas! my Heart fails me, I Faint, I Dye!</hi> Whilſt their cruel Tormentors are ſo far from being touch'd with Compaſſion, that from thence they take occaſion to preſs them afreſh, and to renew their Torments, frighting them with their Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Menaces, accompanied with moſt execrable Oaths and Curſes; crying, <hi>Dog, Bougre, What, will not thou be Converted? Wilt not thou be Obedient? Dog, Bougre, Thou muſt be Converted, we are ſent on purpoſe to Convert thee:</hi> And the Clergy, who are witneſſes of all theſe Cruelties, (with which they feaſt their Eyes) and of all their Infamous and abominable words, (which ought to cover them with horror and confuſion) make only a matter of ſport and laughter of it.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe miſerable Wretches, being neither ſuffered to Live nor to Dye, (for when they ſee them fainting away, they force them to take ſo much as to keep Body and Soul together) and ſeeing no other way for them to be delivered out of this Hell, in which they are continually Tormented, are fain at laſt to ſtoop under the unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Burthen of theſe extremities: So that excepting only a few who ſaved themſelves by a timely Flight, preferring their Religion before all Temporal Poſſeſſions, all the reſt have been conſtrained to go to Maſs.</p>
            <p>Neither is the Country any more exempt from theſe Calamities, than Towns and Cities; nor thoſe of the Nobility and Gentry, than Citizens. They ſend whole Companies of Souldiers into Gentlemens Houſes, who Treat them in the moſt outragious and violent manner conceivable; inſomuch that not a Soul can hope to eſcape, except it may be ſome few, who like the Believers of old, wander in Deſarts, and lodge in Dens, and Caves of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Futhermore, I can aſſure you, that never was any greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101092:13"/>
than that which we are in here at preſent; the Army, we hear, is come very near us, and the <hi>Intendant</hi> is juſt now Arrived in this City; the greater part of the moſt conſiderable Merchants are either already gone, or caſting about how beſt to make their eſcape, abandoning their Houſes and Eſtates to their Enemies; and there are not wanting ſome Cowardly Spirits, who, to avoid the miſchief they are preparing for us, have already promiſed to do whatſoever is required of them. In a word, nothing is ſeen or heard in theſe parts but Conſternation, Weeping and Lamentation; there being ſcarce a Perſon of our Religion, who hath not his Heart pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the bittereſt Sorrows, and whoſe Countenance hath not the Lively Picture of Death Imprinted on it: and ſurely, if our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Triumph in all this, their Triumph cannot likely be of any long continuance.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I cannot perſwade my ſelf to entertain ſo good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them, as to think that ever they will be aſhamed of theſe their doings, ſo Diametrically oppoſite to the Spirit of the Goſpel; for I know the Goſpel, in their accounts, paſſeth for a Fable: but this I dare averr, that this Method of theirs will Infallibly lay waſte the Kingdom, which according to all appearance, is never like to recover of it; and ſo in time, they themſelves will be made as ſenſible of theſe miſeries, as others now are. Commerce is already in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wholly extinct, and there will need little leſs than a Miracle to recover it to its former State. What <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Merchants will henceforward be willing to engage themſelves in Trade, either with Perſons without Faith; and who have ſo cowardly betray'd their Religion and Conſcience, or with the Outragious and Barbarous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuters of the Religion, which they profeſs? and who by theſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes declare openly and frankly, that it is their Principle, not to think themſelves oblig'd to keep their word with Hereticks. And who are thoſe, of what Religion ſoever, that will Negotiate with a State ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by Taxes and Subſidies, by Perſecutions, by Barrenneſs and Dearth of ſeveral years continuance; full of a deſpairing People, and which Infallibly will e're long be full of thoſe that are proſcrib'd, and be bathing in its own Blood.</p>
            <p>And theſe miſerable Wretches, who have been deceived by thoſe who have told them, That it would never be impos'd upon them to abjure their Religion, and who are ſtupified by the extremity of their Sufferings, and the terror of their bloody and cruel Enemies, are wrapt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101092:13"/>
up in ſo deep an Aſtoniſhment, as doth not permit them to be fully ſenſible of their Fall: But as ſoon as they ſhall recover themſelves, and remember, that they could not Embrace the Communion of <hi>Rome,</hi> without abſolutely Renouncing the Holy <hi>Religion</hi> they Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and when they ſhall make a full Reflection upon the unhappy Change they have been forced to make; then their Conſciences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awakened, and continually reproaching their Faint-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will rend them with Sorrow and Remorſe, and inflict Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them, equal to thoſe the Damned endure in Hell; and will make them endavour to be delivered from this Anguiſh, and to find Reſt in the conſtant Profeſſion of that Truth, which they have unhappily betray'd.</p>
            <p>And on the other-ſide; Their Enemies will be loath to take the Lye at this time of the Day; and therefore will endeavor, through fear of Puniſhments, to oblige them to ſtay in that Abyſs of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, into which they have precipitated them: But becauſe all the Sufferings they can poſſibly threaten them with, will be no ways conſiderable, when compared with thoſe Tortures their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have already inflicted upon them, and where with they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them in caſe of a Relapſe, they will be conſtrained to drag them to the Place of Execution, or elſe ſeek to rid themſelves of them all at once, by a general Maſſacre, which many good Souls have ſo ſo long deſired.</p>
            <p>I hope, <hi>Sir,</hi> You will not be wanting in your moſt earneſt Prayers to beg of <hi>God,</hi> that He would be pleaſed to take pity of theſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wretches; and make the Heart of our Sovereign to relent towards us; That he would Convert thoſe, who in their Blindneſs think they do Him Service, by putting us to Death; That He would cauſe his Voice to be heard by them from Heaven, as to St. <hi>Paul; Saul, Saul, Why Perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> And make the reſt the Examples of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Juſtice: Finally, That He would grant, That all thoſe who have denied Him, being touched with a True Repentance, may, with St. <hi>Peter, Go out, and Weep bitterly.</hi> I am,</p>

            <p>BUt this, <hi>Sir,</hi> is not the thing which troubles me moſt, at this time; there's another cauſe of my Grief, which is but too juſt, and even pierceth my Heart with Sorrow; and that is, The Cruel Perſecution, which the Poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> do ſuffer, amongſt whom I have ſo many near and dear Relations: The Torments they are put to, are almoſt Incredible; and the Heavenly Courage, wherewith ſome of them are ſtrengthned by their Great Captain and Leader, to undergo them, is no leſs amazing and wonderful: I ſhall give for Inſtance one or two of theſe Champions, that by them you may judge of the reſt.</p>
            <p>A Young Woman was brought before the Council, in order to oblige her to abjure the Truth of the Goſpel; which ſhe boldly and manfully refuſing, was commanded back again to Priſon; where they ſhaved her Head, and ſing'd off the Hair of her Privities; and having ſtript her Stark-Naked, in this manner led her through the Streets of the City; where many a blow was given her, and Stones flung at her. After this, they ſet her up to the Neck in a Tub full of Water; where after ſhe had been for a while, they took her out, and put upon her a Shift dipt in Wine, which as it dry'd, and fluck to her Sore and Bruiſed Body, they ſnatch'd off again; and then had another ready, dipt in Wine to clap upon her: This they repeated ſix ſeveral times; and when by this Inhumane uſage, her Body was become very Raw and Tender, they demanded of her, <hi>Whether ſhe did not now find her ſelf diſpoſed to Embrace the Catholick Faith?</hi> for ſo they are pleaſed to term their Religion: But ſhe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrengthned by the Spirit and Love of Him, for whoſe Names ſake ſhe ſuffered all theſe Extremities, undauntedly anſwer'd; <hi>That ſhe had before declared her Reſolution to them, which ſhe would never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that, though they had her Body in their Power, ſhe was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to yield her Soul to them; but keep it pure and undefiled for her Heavenly Lover; as knowing, that a little while would put an end to all her Sufferings, and give a Beginning to her Enjoyment of Everlaſting Bliſs:</hi> Which Words of hers, adding Fuel of their Rage, who now deſpaired of making her a Convert, they took and faſtned her by her
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101092:14"/>
Feet, to ſomething that ſerved the turn of a Gibbet, and there let her hang in that Ignominious Poſture, with her head downwards till ſhe expired.</p>
            <p>The other Perſon I would inſtance in, and whom I pity the more, becauſe (for ought I know) he may yet ſurvive, and ſtill continue under the Tormentor's Hands, is an Old Man; who having, for a great while, been kept cloſe Priſoner (upon the ſame account as the former) in a deep Dungeon, where his Companions were Darkneſs and Horror, and filthy Creeping things, was brought before his Judges, with Vermin and Snails crawling upon his Mouldred Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; who ſeeing him in that loathſom condition, ſaid to him: <hi>How now Old Man, does not your Heart begin to Relent? and are not you willing to Abjure your Hereſie?</hi> To which he anſwer'd: <hi>As for Hereſie, I profeſs none; but if by that Word you mean my Religion, you may aſſure your ſelves, that as I have thus long Lived, ſo, I hope, and am reſolved by the Grace of God, to Die in it:</hi> With which anſwer they being little pleaſed, but furiouſly incenſed, beſpoke him in a rougher Tone: <hi>Doſt thou not ſee, that the Worms are about to devour thee? Well, ſince thou art ſo reſolved, we will ſend thee back again, to the loathſom Place from whence thou camest, that they may make an end of thee, and conſume thy obdurate Heart:</hi> To which he reply'd, with the words of the holy patient <hi>Job; Novi poſtquam vermes confoderint (Corpus) iſtud, in carne mea me viſſurum eſſe Deum. I know that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Worms have eaten this Body, that in my Fleſh I ſhall ſee God.</hi> And having ſo ſaid, he was ſent back to his loathſom dark Abode; where if he be ſtill, I pray <hi>God</hi> to give him patience and ſtrength to hold out to the End, that ſo he may obtain the Crown of Life.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be too tedious, in giving you all the particulars of their Cruelty, and of the Sufferings of the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> yet I cannot well forbear acquainting you with what lately I am moſt credibly inform'd of; which take as follows: Some <hi>Dragoons,</hi> who were Quartered with a Perſon, who they could by no means oblige to Renounce his Religion; upon a time, when they had well fill'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Wine, and broke their Glaſſes at every Health they drank; and ſo fill'd the Floor, where they were, with the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and by often walking over, and treading upon them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to leſſer Pieces and Fractions: And being now in a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Humour, they muſt needs go to Dance; and told their Hoſt, That he muſt be One of the Company; but withal, that he muſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101092:15"/>
firſt pull off his Stockins and Shooes, that the might move the more nimbly: In a word, they forc'd him to Dance with them bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed, upon the ſharp Points of Glaſs; which when they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long as they were able to keep him on his Legs, they laid him down on a Bed; and a while after ſtript him ſtark naked, and rolled his Body from one end of the Room to the other, upon the ſharp Glaſs, as beforementioned; which having done, till his Skin was ſtuck full of the ſaid little Fragments, they returned him again to his Bed, and ſent for a Chyturgeon, to take out all the ſaid pieces of Glaſs out of his Body; which you may eaſily conceive, could not be done without frequent Inciſions, and horrible and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream pain. Another Perſon being likewiſe troubled with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcom Company of theſe <hi>Dragoons,</hi> and having ſuffered extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their hands, without the expected ſucceſs of his Converſion; one of them on a time looking earneſtly upon him, told him, <hi>That he disfigured himſelf, with letting his Beard grow ſo long:</hi> But he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, <hi>That they were the cauſe of it, who would not let him ſtir out of door, for to go to the Barber:</hi> The <hi>Dragoon</hi> reply'd, <hi>I can do that for you as well as the Barber;</hi> And with that told him, <hi>He muſt needs try his Skill upon him:</hi> And ſo fell to work; but inſtead of ſhaving him, flea'd all the Skin off his Face. One of his Companions coming in at the Cry of this poor Sufferer, and ſeeing what he had done, ſeemingly blam'd him for it, and ſaid, <hi>He was a Bungler;</hi> and then to his Hoſt, <hi>Come, your Hair wants Cutting too, and you ſhall ſee, I will do it much better than he hath ſhav'd you:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon begins, in a moſt cruel manner, to pluck the Hair, Skin, and all, off his Head, and flea'd that as the other had done his Chin. Thus making a Sport and Merriment of the extream <hi>Suffering</hi> of theſe miſerable Wretches.</p>
            <p>By theſe inhuman, and more than Barbarous means it is, that they endeavour to overcome the moſt reſolved patience, and to drive People to Deſpair and Faint-heartedneſs, by their Deviliſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. They refuſe to give them Death, which they deſire; and only keep them alive to torment them, ſo long till they have vanquiſh'd their Perſeverance; for the Names of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> are equally odious to their Enemies, who tell them, <hi>The King will have Obedient Subjects, but neither Martyrs nor Rebels; and that they have received Orders to Convert them, but not to Kill them.</hi>

Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, Confirmation, <hi>the</hi> Euchariſt, Penance, Extream Unction, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>and</hi> Marriage; <hi>and that they do confer Grace; and that</hi> Baptiſm <hi>and</hi> Orders <hi>may not be reiterated, without Sacriledge: I receive and admit alſo the Ceremonies received &amp; approved by the Catholick Church, in the ſolemn Adminiſtration of the forementioned Sacraments.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>I receive and embrace all and every thing, and things, which have been determined concerning Original Sin and Juſtification by the Holy Council of</hi> Trent.</p>

               <hi>I likewiſe profeſs, that in the</hi> Maſs <hi>there is offered up to</hi> God, <hi>a true, proper, and Propitiatory Sacrifice for the Living and Dead; and that in the Holy Sacrament of the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>there is</hi> truly, really, and Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, the Body and Blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>and that in it there is made a change of the whole Subſtance of the Bread into his Body, and of the whole Subſtance of the Wine into his Blood; which change the Catholick Church calls</hi> Tranſubſtantiation. <hi>I confeſs alſo, That under one only of theſe two Elements, whole</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and the true Sacrament is received.</hi>

            <p>THat whereas the Perſecutions and Rigorous Proceedings which have been carried on for ſome time in <hi>France,</hi> againſt thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> have forced many Families to leave that Kingdom, and to ſeek for a Settlement elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in ſtrange and Foreign Countries; We have been willing, being touched with that juſt Compaſſion, We are bound to have for thoſe who ſuffer for the Goſpel, and the Purity of that Faith We profeſs, together with them, by this preſent Declaration, Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our own Hand, to offer, to the ſaid <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> a ſure and free Retreat in all the Countries and Provinces under our Dominion; and withal, to declare the ſeveral Rights, Immunities, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which We are willing they ſhall enjoy there, in order to the Relieving and eaſing them, in ſome meaſure, of the burthen of thoſe Calamities, wherewith it hath pleaſed the Divine Providence to afflict ſo conſiderable a part of his Church.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To the end, that all thoſe who ſhall reſolve to Settle themſelves in any of our Dominions, may with the more Eaſe and Convenience Tranſport themſelves thither, We have given Order to our Envoy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary with the States-General of the <hi>

Furthermore, Our will is, That they be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Timber, Quick Lime, Stones, Bricks, and other Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als they may ſtand in need of, for the repairing of whatſoever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd or ruinous in any of the ſaid Houſes; which ſhall, for ſix Years, be exempt from all ſorts of Impoſitions, Free-Quarter, and all other Charges whatſoever: Neither ſhall the ſaid <hi>French,</hi> during the time of ſix Years, be lyable to any Payments whatſoever, but what are chatgeable upon things of daily Conſumption.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. In Cities or elſewhere, where convenient places ſhall be found for to build Houſes, thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> who ſhall make their Retreat into our Dominions, ſhall be fully Authorized and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to take poſſeſſion of the ſame, for themſelves and their Heirs after them, together with all the Gardens, Fields, and Paſture-Grounds belonging to the ſame, without being oblig'd to pay any of the dues and charges, with which the ſaid places, or their dependances may be Incumbred. Moreover, for the facilitating their Building in any of the ſaid places, We will cauſe them to be furniſhed with all the materials they ſhall ſtand in need of; and will over and above allow them Ten Years of Exemption, during which they ſhall not be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any other charges or payments, beſides the dues charged upon things of daily ſpending. And furthermore, foraſmuch as Our intent is, to make their Settlement in our Dominions the moſt eaſie and commodious for them that may be; We have given command to our Magiſtrates and other Officers in the ſaid Provinces, to make enquiry, in every City, for Houſes that are to be Lett, into which it ſhall be free for the ſaid <hi>French</hi> to enter, and take up their Lodging as ſoon as they ſhall Arrive; and do promiſe to pay for them and their Families for Four Years, the Rent of the ſaid Houſes, provided that they engage themſelves, within the ſaid Term, to Build in ſuch places as ſhall be Aſſigned for them, in manner, and upon condition as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. As ſoon as they ſhall have taken up their Habitation in any
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101092:18"/>
City or Town of our Dominions, they ſhall immediately be made Free of the place, as alſo of that particular Corporation, which by their Trade of Profeſſion they belong to; and ſhall enjoy the ſelf-ſame Rights and Priviledges, which the Citizens, Burgeſſes, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the ſaid places or Corporations do enjoy, and that without being obliged to pay any thing for the ſaid Freedom, and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lyable to the Law of Eſcheatage, or any other of what Nature ſoever they may be, which in other Countries are in force againſt Strangers; but ſhall be look'd upon, and Treated upon all accounts, in the ſame manner, as Our own Natural Subjects.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Moſt Reverend Father,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen I compare the Method of the <hi>French</hi> Court (which declares againſt all Hereſies) with the Policy of other Princes, who had the ſame Deſign in former Ages; I find ſo great a difference that all that paſſes now adaies in the King's Council is an impenetrable Miſtery: and the eyes of all <hi>Europe</hi> are opened, to ſee what happens; but cannot diſcover the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Francis</hi> I. and <hi>Henry</hi> II. his Son undertook to Ruin the Reformation, they had to ſtruggle with a Party which was but beginning and weak, and deſtitute of Help; and conſequently eaſier to be overcome.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Francis</hi> II. and <hi>Charles</hi> IX. a Family was ſeen advanc'd to the Throne by the Ruin of the Proteſtants, who were for the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this laſt Reign many Maſſacres hapned, and ſeveral Millions of Hereticks have been Sacrificed, but it anſwer'd otherwaies: and his Majeſty has ſhow'd (by the peace and mild waies he uſes) that he abhors ſhedding of Blood; from which you muſt perſwade his <hi>Britannie</hi> Majeſty, who naturally is inclin'd to Roughneſs, and a kind of boldneſs, which will make him hazard all, if he does not politickly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it; as I hinted in my laſt, when I mentioned my Lord Chancellor.</p>
            <p>Moſt Reverend Father, to ſatisfie the deſire I have to ſhew you by my Letters the Choice you ought to make of ſuch Perſons fit to ſtir up, I will in few words (ſince you deſire it) inform you of the Genius of the People of our Court, of their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and which of them we make uſe of; that by a Parallel which you will make, between them and your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords, you may learn to know them.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall begin with the Chief: I mean our great Monarch. It is certain that he is naturally good, and loves not to do Evil, unleſs deſir'd to do it. This being ſo, I may ſay, he never would have undertaken the Converſion of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, without the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> and without our Societies Correſpondence abroad. He is a Prince enlightned; who very well obſerves, that what we put him upon, is contrary to his Intereſt, and that nothing is more oppoſite to his Great Deſigns, and his Glory; he aiming to be the Terror of all <hi>Europe.</hi> The vaſt number of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents he has cauſed in his Kingdom, forces him in time of Peace to keep three times more Forces, than his Anceſtors did in the greateſt Domeſtick and Foreign Wars: which cannot be done, without a prodigious Expence.</p>
            <p>The Peoples fears alſo begin to leſſen, as to his Aſpiring to an Univerſal Monarchy: and they may aſſure themſelves he has left thoſe thoughts! nothing being more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to his Deſigns, than the Method we enjoyn him. His Candor, Bounty, and Toleration, to the Hereticks, would undoubtedly have open'd the doors of the Low Countries, <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and all other States on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and even of <hi>Switzerland:</hi> whereas things are at preſent ſo alter'd, that we ſee the <hi>Hollanders</hi> free from any fear of danger; the <hi>Switzers</hi> and City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> reſolv'd to loſe the laſt drop of their Blood in their defence; beſides ſome diverſion we may expect from the Empire, in caſe we cannot hinder a Peace with the <hi>Turks;</hi> which ought to haſten his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty, while he can be aſſured of Succors from the moſt Chriſtian King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:101092:20"/>
Sir, his Majeſties Brother is alwaies the ſame, I mean, takes no notice of what paſſes at Court. It has ſometimes happen'd, the King's Brothers have acted ſo, as to be noted in the State; but this we may be aſſur'd will never do any thing to ſtain the glory of his Submiſſion and Obedience: and is willing to lend a helping hand for the Deſtruction of the Hereticks; which appears by the inſtances he makes to his Majeſty, who now has promiſed him to cauſe his Troops to enter into the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate</hi> the next Month.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dauphin</hi> is paſſionately given up to Hunting, and little regards the Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Souls; and it does not ſeem eaſie to make him penetrate into buſineſs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore we do not care to conſult him which way, and how, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks ought to be Treated. He openly laughs at us, and ſlights all the Deſigns, of which the King his Father makes great account. The Dauphineſs is extreamly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and is without doubt uneaſie to ſhew it in other matters beſides Complements of Converſation. She has given me a Letter for the Queen of <hi>England;</hi> wherein after her expreſſion of the part ſhe bears on the News of her Majeſties being with Child, ſhe gives her ſeveral advices about the Converſion of her Subjects.</p>
            <p>Moſt Reverend Father, She is undoubtedly born a great enemy to the Proteſtants; and has promoted all ſhe could with his Majeſty, in all that has been done, to haſten their Ruin; eſpecially having been bred in a Court of our Society, and of a Houſe whoſe hatred againſt the Proteſtant Religion is Heraditary; becauſe ſhe has been raiſed up by the Ruine of the <hi>German</hi> Proteſtant Princes, eſpecially that of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate.</hi> But the King having cauſed her to come to make Heirs to the Crown, ſhe anſwers expectation to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Louvois</hi> is a Man who very much obſerves his duty, which he performs to admiration; and to whom we muſt acknowledge <hi>France</hi> owes part of the glory it has hitherto gained, both in regard of its Conqueſts, as alſo the Converſion of Hereticks; to which latter I may ſay, he has contributed as much as the King: he has already ſhewed himſelf Fierce, Wrathful, and Hardhearted, in his Actions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; though he is not naturally inclin'd to Cruelty, nor to harraſs the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. His Brother the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheins,</hi> has ways which do not much differ from thoſe of his Soul; and all the difference I find between is, That the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop loves his own glory, as much os Monſieur <hi>de Louvois</hi> loves that of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. He is his own Idol; and give him but Incenſe, and you may obtain any thing. Honour is welcome to him, let it come which way it will. The leaſt thing provokes this Prelate; and he will not yield any thing deregetary to his Paternity. He will ſeem Learned; he will ſeem a great <hi>Theologian,</hi> and will ſeem to be a good Biſhop, and to have a great care of his Dioceſs; and would heretofore ſeem a great Preacher. I have hinted in my laſt; the Reaſons why I cannot altogether like him; which are needleſs to repeat.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> is always the ſame; I mean, a gallant man; whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Converſation is charming, and loves his pleaſures; but cannot bear any thing that grieves or gives trouble; though he is always a great enemy of the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> which he lately intimated to Cardinal <hi>Camus.</hi> He is always with me in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Conſcience, and agrees very well with our Society; laying moſtly to Heart the Converſion of the Proteſtants of the three Kingdoms. He alſo makes very good Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and deſigns to give ſome Advice to your Reverence, which I ſhall convey to you. I do ſometimes impart to him, what you write to me,</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> has embrac'd our good Party: I was preſent when he Abjur'd in the Church of St. <hi>Denys;</hi> I will give you the Circumſtances ſome other time.</p>
            <p>You promiſed to ſend me the Names of all heretick Officers who are in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101092:20"/>
Troops; that much imports me; and you ſhall not want good Catholick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to fill up their places. I have drawn a Liſt of them who are to paſs into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty approves thereof: Pray obſerve what I hinted to you in my laſt, on the Subject of the Viſits, which our Fathers muſt give to the Chief Lords, Members of the next Parliament; thoſe Reverend Fathers, who are to perform that duty, muſt be middle-aged, with a lively Countenance, and fit to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade. I alſo adviſed you in ſome of my other Letters, how the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> ought to behave himſelf, by Writing inceſſantly, and to inſinuate into the people the putting down the Teſt; and at the ſame time cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ſtorm, which the Letter of Penſionary <hi>Fagel</hi> has raiſed. And his Majeſty muſt continue to make vigorous Prohibitions to all Bookſellers in <hi>London,</hi> not to print any Anſwers: as well to put a ſtop to the Inſolency of Heretick Authors; as alſo to hinder the people from Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, you intimate to me, That his Majeſty will follow our Advice: It's the quickeſt way, and I cannot find a better, or fitter, to diſpoſſeſs his Subjects from ſuch Impreſſions as they have received. His Majeſty muſt alſo, by the ſame Declaration, profeſs in Conſcience, that (if complyed with) he will not only keep his Word, to maintain and protect the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but will alſo confirm his Promiſes by ſuch Laws, as the Proteſtants ſhall be contented with. This is the true Politick way; for by his granting all, they cannot but Conſent to ſomething.</p>
            <p>His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty has with great ſucceſs experienced this Maxim: and though he had not to ſtruggle with Penal Laws and Teſts, yet he found it convenient to make large Promiſes, by many Declarations; for, ſince we muſt diſſemble, you muſt endeavour all you can to perſwade the King, it is the only method to effect his Deſigns.</p>
            <p>I did alſo in my laſt, give you a hint of its importance, as well as the ways you muſt take to inſinuate your ſelves dextrouſly with the King, to gain his good will. I know not whether you have obſerved what paſſed in <hi>England</hi> ſome years ſince, I will recite it, becauſe examples inſtruct much.</p>
            <p>One of our Aſſiſting Fathers of that Kingdom (which was Father <hi>Parſons)</hi> having written a Book againſt the Succeſſion of the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> to the Realm of <hi>England:</hi> Father <hi>Creighton,</hi> who was alſo of our Society, and upheld by many of our Party, defended the Cauſe of that King, in a Book Intituled, <hi>The Reaſons of the King of Scots, againſt the Book of Father Parſons:</hi> and though they ſeem'd divided, yet they underſtood one another very well; this being prcticed by order of our General, to the end, that if the Houſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> were Excluded, they might ſhew him who had the Government, the Book of Father <hi>Parſons;</hi> and on the other hand, if the King hapned to be reſtored to the Throne, they might obtain the good will, by ſhewing him the Works of Father <hi>Creighton:</hi> So that which way ſoever the Medal turn'd, it ſtill prov'd to the advantage of our Society. Not to digreſs from our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I muſt deſire you to read the Engliſh Book of Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> Intituled, <hi>The Reform of England;</hi> where, after his blaming of Cardinal <hi>Pole,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ade ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of Faults in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> he finally concludes, That ſuppoſe <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould return (as we hope) to the Catholick Faith in this Reign, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to the State of the Primitive Church: and to that end all the Eccleſiaſtical Revenue ought to be uſed in common, and the Management thereof committed to the care of Seven Wiſe Men, drawn out of our Society, to be diſpoſed of by them as they ſhould think fit. Moreover, he would have all the Religious Orders forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on Religious Penalties, not to return into the Three Kingdoms, without leave
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101092:21"/>
of thoſe Seven Wiſe Men: to the end, it might be granted only to ſuch as live on Alms. Theſe Reflections ſeem to me very Judicious, and very ſuitable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Father <hi>Parſons</hi> adds, That when <hi>England</hi> is reduced to the True Faith, the Pope muſt not expect, at leaſt for five years, to reap any benefit of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Revenue; but muſt leave the whole in the hands of thoſe ſeven Wiſe Men; who will manage the ſame to the benefit and advancement of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Court goes this day for <hi>Marli,</hi> to take the Divertiſements which are there prepared: I hope to accompany the King, and will entertain him about all buſineſs; and accordingly as he likes what you hint to me in your Letter, I ſhall give you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. I have acquainted him with his <hi>Britannic</hi> Majeſties Deſign, of Building a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel near <hi>White-Hall;</hi> Monſieur <hi>Vauban,</hi> our Engineer was preſent: after ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the importance of the Subject, his Majeſty told Monſieur <hi>Vauban,</hi> that he thought it convenient he ſhould make a Model of the Deſign, and that he ſhould on purpoſe go over into <hi>England,</hi> to ſee the Ground. I have done all I could to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Deſigns of our Great Monarch, who is alwaies angry againſt the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: both Parties are ſtubborn: the Kings natural Inclination is, to have all yield to him; and the Popes Reſolution is unalterable.</p>
            <p>All our Fathers moſt humbly ſalute your Reverence. Father <hi>Reine Ville</hi> acts wonderfully about <hi>Niſmes</hi> amongſt the New Converts; who ſtill meet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Danger they expoſe themſelves to. I daily expect News from the Frontiers of the Empire, which I ſhall impart to your Reverence, and am with the greateſt Reſpect,</p>
