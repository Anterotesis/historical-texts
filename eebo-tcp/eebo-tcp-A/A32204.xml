            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The First Paper.</head>
                  <p>THE Discourse we had the other Day, I hope,
satisfied you in the main, that Christ can have
but one Church here upon Earth, and I believe
that it is as visible as that the Scripture is in
Print: That none can be that Church, but
that, which is called the <hi>Roman Catholick Church.</hi> I think you
need not trouble your self with entring into that Ocean of
particular Disputes, when the main, and, in truth, the only
Question is; Where that Church is, which we profess to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in the two Creeds (We declare to believe <hi>one Catholick
and Apostolick Church,</hi> and it is not left to every phantastical
mans head to believe as he pleases, but to the Church, to whom
Christ left the Power upon Earth to govern us in matters of
Faith. who made these Creeds for our directions. It were a
very irrational thing to make Laws for a Country, and leave
it to the Inhabitants, to be the Interpreters and Judges of those
Laws; For then every man will be his own Judge, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
no such thing as either right or wrong. Can we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suppose that God Almighty would leave us at those uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
as to give us a Rule to go by, &amp; leave every man to be
his own Judge? I do ask any ingenuous man, whether it he
not the same thing to follow our own Phancy, or to interpret
the Scripture by it? I would have any man shew me, where
the Power of deciding matters of Faith is given to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
man. Christ left his Power to his Church even <hi>to forgive
Sins in Heaven,</hi> and left his Spirit with them, which they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
after his Resurrexion: First by his Apostles in these
Creeds, and many years after by the Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> where
that Creed was made that is called by that name, and by the
Power which they had received from Christ, they were the
Judges even of the Scripture it self many years after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
which Books were Canonical and which were not. And
if they had this Power then, I desire to know how they came
to lose it, and by what Authority men separate themselves
from that Church? The only pretence I ever heard of, was,
was, because the Church has failed in wresting and interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture contrary to the true sense and meaning of it,
and that they have imposed Articles of Faith upon us, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46932:4"/>
are not to be warranted by Gods Word? I do desire to know
who is to be Judge of that, whether the whole Church, the
Succession whereof has continued to this day without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
or particular men who have raised Schisms for their
own advantage?</p>
                  <p>This is a true Copy of a Paper I found in the late King my
Brothers <hi>Strong Box,</hi> written in his own Hand.</p>

                  <head>The Second Paper.</head>
                  <p>IT is a sad thing to consider what a world of Heresies are
crept into this Nation; Every man thinks himself as
competent a Judge of the Scriptures as the very Apostles
themselves; and 'tis no wonder that it should be so, since that
part of the Nation, which looks most like a Church, dares not
bring the true Arguments against the other Sects, for fear they
should be turned against themselves, and confuted by their own
Arguments. The Church of <hi>England</hi> (as 'tis call'd) would
fain have it thought, that they are the Judges in matters Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l,
and yet dare not say positively that there is no Appeal
from them; for either they must say, that they are Infallible
(which they cannot pretend to) or confess that what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
in matters of Conscience, is no further to be followed,
then it agrees with every mans private Judgment. If Christ
did leave a Church here upon Earth, and we were all once of
that Church, how, and by what Authority, did we separate
from that Church? If the Power of Interpreting of Scripture
be in every mans brain, what need have we of a Church or
Church-men? To what purpose did our Saviour, after he had
given his Apostles Power to <hi>bind and loose in Heaven and Earth,</hi>
add to it, <hi>that he would be with them even to the End of the World?</hi>
These words were not spoken parabolically, or by way of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
Christ was then ascending into his Glory, and left his
Power with his Church even <hi>to the end of the World.</hi> We have
had these hundred years past, the sad effect of denying to the
Church that Power in matters Spiritual, without an Appeal.
What Country can subsist in peace or quiet, where there is not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46932:4"/>
a Supream Judge from whence there can be no Appeal? Can
there be any Justice done where the Offenders are their own
Judges, and equal Interpreters of the Law, with those that are
appointed to administer Justice? This is our Case here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
in matters Spiritual; for the Protestants are not of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as 'tis the true Church from whence there
can be no Appeal; but because the Discipline of that Church
is conformable at that present to their fancies, which as soon
as it shall contradict or vary from, they are ready to embrace
or joyn with the next Congregation of People, whose Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Worship agrees with their opinion at that time; so
that according to this Doctrine there is no other Church, nor
Interpreter of Scripture but that which lies in every mans gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
brain. I desire to know therefore of every serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of these things, whether the great work of our Salvation
ought to depend upon such a Sandy Foundation as this? Did
Christ ever say to the Civil Magistrate (much less to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
<hi>that he would be with them to the end of the World?</hi> Or, did
he give them the Power <hi>to forgive Sins?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
Ye are Gods Husbandry, ye are Gods Building; we are
Labourers with God.</hi> This shews who are the <hi>Labourers,</hi> and
who are the <hi>Husbandry</hi> and <hi>Building;</hi> And in this whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in the preceding one, S. <hi>Paul</hi> takes great pains to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

forth that they, the Clergy, <hi>have the Spirit of God, without which
no man searcheth the deep things of God;</hi> and he concludeth the
Chapter with this Verse, <hi>For who hath known the Mind of the
Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the Mind of Christ.</hi>
Now if we do but consider in humane probability and reaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Powers Christ leaves to his Church in the Gospel, and St.
<hi>Paul</hi> explains so distinctly afterwards, we cannot think that
our Saviour said all these things to no purpose; And pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
on the other side, that those, who resist the Truth, and
will not submit to his Church, draw their Arguments from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
and far fetch'd Interpretations, at the same time
that they deny plain and positive words; which is so great a
Disingenuity, that 'tis not almost to be thought that they can
believe themselves. Is there any other Foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Church, but that if the Civil Magistrate please, he may
call such of the Clergy as he thinks fit for his turn at that time;
and turn the Church either to <hi>Presbytery, Independency,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
what he pleases? This was the way of our pretended

                  <p>IT is so Reasonable to expect, that a person always bred up
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and as well instructed in the
the Doctrine of it, as the best Divines, and her capacity
could make her, should be liable to many censures, for leaving
That, and making her self a Member of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>
Church, to which, I confess, I was one of the greatest Enemies it
ever had; That I choose rather to endeavour to satisfie my
Friends, by reading this Paper, then to have the trouble, to
answer all the Questions that may daily be asked me: And
first, I do protest in the presence of Almighty God; That no
Person, Man or Woman, directly, nor indirectly, ever said any
thing to me (since I came into <hi>England</hi>) or used the least en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make me change my Religion: It is a Blessing I
wholly owe to Almighty God, and I hope the hearing of a
Prayer I daily made him, ever since I was in <hi>France,</hi> and
<hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> Where seeing much of the Devotion of the Catholicks
(tho I had very little my self) I made it my continual request
to Almighty God; That, if I were not; I might, before I died,
be in the true Religion: I did not in the least doubt, but that I
was so, and never had any manner of scruple till <hi>November</hi>

a thing to be done by one of Her Children. I confess I
cannot think the Holy Ghost could ever be in such Counsels;
and it is very strange, that if the Bishops had no design, but (as
they say) the restoring us to the Doctrine of the Primitive
Church; they should never think upon it, till <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth

being raised, I begun to consider of the difference between the
Catholicks and Us; and Examin'd them as well as I could by
the Holy Scripture, which, I do not pretend to be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,

weighed, which I could best part with, my share in this world,

would but give me Patience to bear them, and then, send me
any afflictions in this World, so I may enjoy a Blessed Eternity
hereafter.</p>

into many hands, who without some assistance may not readily
resolve some difficulties started by them, He thought it not
unbecoming his duty to God and the King, to give a clearer
light to the Things contained in them. And it can be no

                  <head>AN
ANSWER
TO THE
FIRST PAPER.</head>
                  <p>IF all men could <hi>believe as they pleased,</hi> I should not have fail'd of satisfaction
in this <hi>First Paper,</hi> the Design of it being to put an end <hi>to Particular Disputes;</hi>
to which I am so little a Friend, that I could have been glad to have found,
as much reason in it to convince, as I saw there was a fair appearance to deceive.
But there is a <hi>Law in our Minds</hi> distinct from that of our <hi>Inclinations;</hi> and out of a
just and due regard to That, we must examine the most plausible Writings, thô
back'd with the greatest Authority, before we yield our Assent unto them.</p>
                  <p>If particular Controversies about <hi>Matters of Faith</hi> could be ended by a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>as visible as that the Scripture is in Print,</hi> all men of sence would soon give
over Disputing; for none who dare believe what they see, can call that in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
But what if <hi>the Church,</hi> whose <hi>Authority,</hi> it is said, <hi>they must submit to,</hi>
will not allow them to believe what they see? How then can this be a sufficient
reason to perswade them to believe the Church, <hi>because it is as visible as that the
Scripture is in Print?</hi> Unless we must only use our senses to find out the Church,
and renounce them assoon as we have done it. Which is a very bad requital of
them, and no great Honour to the Church which requires it.</p>
                  <p>But with all due submission, it is no more <hi>visible</hi> that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is
the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> than it is, that <hi>a part</hi> is the <hi>whole,</hi> and the most corrupt
part, that <hi>one Church, which Christ hath here upon Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:46932:9"/>It is agreed among all Christians. That Christ can <hi>have but one Church upon
Earth,</hi> as there is <hi>but one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism.</hi> And this is that Church
<hi>we profess to believe in the two Creeds.</hi> But if those, <hi>who made those Creeds for
our direction,</hi> had intended the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> why was it not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed?
How came it to pass that such a limitation of the sense of Christs <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church</hi> to the <hi>Roman,</hi> should never be put to Persons to be Baptized in any
Age of the Church? For I do not find in the Office of Baptism, even in the
<hi>Roman Church,</hi> that it is required that they believe the <hi>Roman Catholick Church.</hi>
or that they deny the validity of Baptism out of the Communion of the <hi>Roman
Church.</hi> From whence it is to me as <hi>visible as that the Scripture is in Print,</hi> that
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self doth not believe that it is, <hi>the one Catholick Church
mentioned in the two Creeds.</hi> For then it must void all Baptism out of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
which it hath never yet done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as long as Baptism doth enter

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ck Church; it is impossible, that all who have the true
form of Baptis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, though out of the Communion of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> should
be Members of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and yet the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi>
and <hi>Catholick</hi> be all one; as it must be if the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> be the <hi>Catholick
and Apostolick Church professed in the Creeds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we had been so happy to have lived in those Blessed Times, <hi>when the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of them that believed were of one heart, and of one soul,</hi> it had been no
difficulty to have shewed that <hi>one visible Church, which Christ had here upon Earth.</hi>
But they must be great strangers to the History of the Church, who have not
heard of the early and great Divisions in the Communion of it. And there was
a remarkable difference in the Nature of those Schisms, which happened in the
Church; which being not considered hath been the occasion of great misapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the sayings of the Ancients about the <hi>One Catholick Church.</hi> Some did
so break off Communion with other parts of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as to challenge
that Title wholly to themselves; as was evident in the case of the <hi>Novatians</hi> and
<hi>Donatists;</hi> for they rebaptiz'd all that embraced their Communion. Others were
cast out of Communion upon particular differences; which were not supposed to
be of such a nature, as to make them no members of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> So
the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> excommunicated the Bishops of <hi>Asia</hi> for not keeping <hi>Easter</hi>
when They did; and the Bishops both of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> for not allowing the
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ptism of Hereticks. But is it reasonable to suppose, that upon these Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they shut out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll those Holy Bishops and Martyrs from the possiblility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by excluding them from their Communion? If not, then there may be
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fferent Communions among Christians, which may still continue <hi>Parts</hi> of the
<hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and consequently no one Member of such a Division ought to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46932:9"/>
assume to it self the <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>One Catholick Church.</hi> But if any
<hi>One Port</hi> doth so, though never so great and conspicuous, it is guilty of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ame
Presumption with the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi> and is as much cause of the Schisms,
which happen thereupon in the Church, as they were.</p>
                  <p>For a long time before the Reformation, there had been great and considerable
breaches, between the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western Churches;</hi> insomuch that they did
renounce each others Communion. And in these Differences four <hi>Patriarchal
Churches</hi> joined together against the fifth, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
But the Eastern Patriarchs siking in their Power, by the horrible Invasio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the
Enemies of the Christian Faith; and the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> advancing themselves
to so much Authority, by the advantages they took from the kindness of some
Princes, and the <hi>Weakness</hi> of others, They would hear of no other terms of
accommodation with the Eastern Churches, but by an intire submission to the
<hi>Pope as Head of the Catholick Church.</hi> Which all the Churches of the East refused,
however different among themselves; and to this day lock on the Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
as an Innovation in the Church, and Usurpation on the Rights of the other
Patriarchs and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shops. In all those Churches the <hi>Two Creeds are professed,</hi> true
Baptism administred, and an undoubted Succession of Bishops from the Apostles;
How then come They to be excluded from being <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>One Catholick and
Apostolick Church?</hi> And if they be not excluded, how can the <hi>Roman Church</hi>
assume to it self that glorious Title: So that it seems to me <hi>as visible as that the
Scripture is in Print,</hi> that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> neither is, nor can be that <hi>One Church,</hi>
which Christ left upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>And this Principle being removed (which ought to be taken for granted; since
it can never be proved) we must unavoidably <hi>enter into the Ocean of Particular
Disputes.</hi> And I know no reason any can have to be so afraid of it, since we have
so sure a Compass, as the Holy Scripture to direct our passage. But the reason
of avoiding <hi>particular Disputes</hi> is, because the evidence is too clear in them, that
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath notoriously deviated from this infal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ible Rule. And it
is as impossible for a Church, which hath erred, to be Infallible, as for a Church
really Infallible, to err. But if a Church pretend to prove her Infallibility by
Texts, which are not so clear, as those which prove her to have actually erred;
then we have greater reason to recede from her Errors, than to be deceived with
such a fallible pretence to Infallibili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Well!</hi> But it is not left to every phantastical mans head to believe as be pleases, but to the Church.</p>
                  <p>And is it indeed le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t to the Church to <hi>believe as it pleases?</hi> But the meaning I
suppose is, that those, who reject the Authority of the Roman Catholick Church,
do leave every man to believe according to his own fancy. Certainly those of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> cannot be liable to any imputation of this Nature.
For <hi>our Church</hi> receives the three Creeds, and embraces the four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and professes to hold nothing contrary to any Universal Tradition of
the Church from the Apostles times. And we have often offered to put the
Controversies between <hi>Us,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> upon that issue. And do
not those rather <hi>believe as they please,</hi> who believe the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to be the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> without any colour from Scriptures, Antiquity or Reason?
Do not <hi>those believe as they please,</hi> who can believe against the most convincing

the lawfulness of the Worship of Images, with Gods forbidding it, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

Church</hi> in a General and free Council, declaring the sense of Scripture in Articles
of Faith, generally received in the Christian Church from the Apostles Times,
as was done when the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> was made; and a Faction in the Church
assuming to it self the Title of <hi>Catholick,</hi> and proceeding by other rules, than the
first Councils did, and imposing new Opinions and Practices, as things necessary
to the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> And this is the true Point in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between us, and those of the Roman Church about the <hi>Churches Authority</hi>
in matters of Faith, since the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi> For we think we have very
great reason to complain, when a Party in the Church, the most corrupt and
obnoxious, takes upon it self to define many new Doctrines, as necessary
Points of Faith, which have neither Scripture, nor Universal Tradition for
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:46932:10"/>It were a very irrational thing, <hi>we are told,</hi> to make Laws for a
Countrey, and leave it to the Inhabitants to be Interpreters and Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of those Laws; for then every Man will be his own Iudge, and by
consequence no such thing, as either Right or Wrong.</p>
                  <p>But is it not as <hi>irrational</hi> to allow an <hi>Usurper</hi> to interpret the <hi>Laws</hi> to his own
advantage, against the just Title of the Prince, and the true Interest of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
And if it be not Reasonable for any private Person to be <hi>his own Iudg,</hi> why
should a publick Invader be so? But we hope it will be allowed to the Loyal
Inhabitants of a Country, so far <hi>to interpret the Laws,</hi> as to be able to understand
the Duty they owe to their King, and to justifie his Right against all the Pretences
of Usurpers. And this is as much as we plead for in this case.</p>
                  <p>Can we therefore suppose, That God Almighty would leave us at
those uncertainties, as to give us a Rule to go by, and leave every
Man to be his own Iudge?</p>
                  <p>And can we reasonably suppose, <hi>That God Almighty should give us a Rule</hi> not
capable of being understood by those <hi>to whom it was given,</hi> in order to the great
End of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the saving of their Souls? For this was the main end of the Rule,
to direct us in the way to Heaven, and not meerly to determine Controversies.
The Staff, which a Man uses, may serve to measure things by, but the principal
design is to walk with it. So it is with the Holy Scripture, if Controversies arise:
It is fit to examine and compare them with this Infallible Rule; but when that is
done, to help us in our way to Heaven is that which it was chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not to be damned. In matters of Good and Evil, every mans Conscience is his
immediate judge, and why not in matters of Truth and Falshood? Unless we

                  <p>But after all, <hi>We do not leave every Man to be his own Iudge,</hi> any further than
it concerns his own Salvation, which depends upon his particular Care and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
For to prevent any dangerous Mistakes by the Artifice of Seducers, we do
allow the Assistance of those Spiritual Guides, which God hath appointed in his
Church, for the better instructing and governing private Persons: We embrace
the Ancient Creeds, as a summary comprehension of the Articles of Faith; and
think no Man ought to follow his own particular Fancy against Doctrines so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
received in the Christian Church, from the Apostles Times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:46932:11"/>I do ask any Ingenuous Man, whether it be not the same thing to
follow our own Fancy, or to interpret Scripture by it.</p>
                  <p>If we allowed no Creeds, no Fathers, no Councils, there might have been
some colour for such a Question. But do we permit Men to interpret Scripture
according to their own Fancy, who live in a Church, which owns the Doctrine
of the Primitive Church more frankly and ingenuously, than any Church in the
World besides, without setting up any private Spirit against it, or the present <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

to ask some Questions of any ingenuous Man; as, whether it be not the same

Power of giving the sense of it? For what can a Rule signify without the sense?
And if this were the intention of Almighty God, had it not been as necessary to
have told us, to whom he had given the Power of Interpreting the Rule, as
to have given the Rule it self? Whether it be reasonable for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
to interpret those Texts, wherein this Power of Interpreting, is to be containes?
For this is to make it <hi>Iudge in its own Cause,</hi> which was thought an Absurdity
before. And whether it be not as mischievous to allow a Prosperous Usurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Church, when the Person principally accused is Supream Judge? Whether
those can be indifferent Judges in Councils, who beforehand take an Oath, to

Fancy?</p>
                  <p>I would have any Man shew me, where the Power of deciding mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees

                  <p>Christ left his Power to his Church, even to forgive Sins in Heaven,
and left his Spirit with them, which they exercised after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p>But where then was the <hi>Roman Catholick Church?</hi> And how can it be hence

unless it be made appear that it was <hi>Heir-General</hi> to <hi>all the Apostles?</hi> I
suppose it will be granted, that the Apostles had some gifts of the Spirit, which
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not in Modesty pretend to; such as the Gift of Tongues,
the Spirit of Discerning, Prophesie, Miraculous Cures and Punishments. Now,
here lies the difficulty, to shew what part of the Promise of the Infallible Spirit
(for the ordinary <hi>Power of the Keys</hi> relates not to this matter) was to expire with
the Apostles, and what was to be continued to the Church in all Ages. A Promise
of Divine Assistance is denied by none but <hi>Pelagians:</hi> But how far that extends, is
the Question. In the Souls of good Men it is so as to keep them in the way to
Heaven, but not to prevent any lapse into sin; and it were worth our knowing,
where God hath ever promised to keep any Men more from Error, than from Sin.
Doth he hate one more than the other? Is one more disagreeing to the Christian
Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine than the other? How came then so much to be said for the keeping
Men from Error, when at the same time, they confess they may not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit great sins, but err very dangerously in the most Solemn manner, in what
relates to the Doctrine of Manners. Would any have believed the Apostles Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
if they had known them to be Persons of ill Lives; or that they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
erred in some Rules of great Consequence to the Welfare of Mankind?
Now, all this is freely yielded, as to the Pretence of Infallibility in the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is granted, that the Guides of that Church have been very bad Men;
and that in Councils they have frequently erred about the Dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sing Power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only a <hi>Matter of Practice,</hi> and not of Faith. Whether it be so or not, I now
dispute not; but it is granted, that notwithstanding this Infallible Spirit, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church</hi> may grosly err in a matter of mighty Consequence to the Peace of
Christendom; and yet it cannot err in decreeing the least Matters of Faith. As
for Instance, it can by no means err about the <hi>seven Sacraments,</hi> or the <hi>Intention
of the Priest about them;</hi> but it may err about <hi>Deposing Princes,</hi> and <hi>Absolving Sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46932:12"/>
from their Allegiance:</hi> Which in easier terms is, They can never err a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their own Interest, but they may about any other whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>I pass over the next Paragraph, the sense being in perfect, and what is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
about the Creeds, hath been spoken to already.</p>
                  <p>That which next deserves Consideration, is,</p>
                  <p>That the Church was the Iudge even of the Scripture it self, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years after the Apostles, which Books were Canonical, and which
were not.</p>
                  <p>We have a distinction among us of <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi> of the <hi>Fact:</hi>
The One declares what the <hi>Law</hi> is, the <hi>Fact</hi> being supposed; the Other gives
judgment upon the <hi>Fact,</hi> as it appears before them. Now in this Case about the
<hi>Canonical Books,</hi> the Church is not judge of the Law. For they are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
whether a Book appearing to be <hi>Canonical</hi> ought by it to be received for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical;</hi>
(which is taken for granted among all Christians) but all they have to do,
is to give judgment upon the Matter of Fact, <hi>i.e.</hi> whether it appear upon sufficient
Evidence to have been a Book written by Divine Inspiration. And the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> hath no particular Priviledge in this matter, but gives its Judgment as other
parts of the Christian World do: And if it takes upon it to judge contrary to the
general sense of the Christian Church, we are not to be concluded by it; but an
Appeal lyes to a greater Tribunal of the Universal Church.</p>
                  <p>And if they had this Power, then I desire to know, how they came
to lose it?</p>
                  <p>Who are meant by <hi>They?</hi> And what is understood by <hi>this Power?</hi> It is one
thing for a Part of the Church to give Testimony to a matter of Fact, and another
to assume the Power of making Books <hi>Canonical,</hi> which were not so. This latter
no Church in the World hath, and therefore can never lose it. The former is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Matter of Testimony, and all parts of the Church are concerned in it, and
it dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nds as other Matters of Fact do, on the Skill and Fidelity of the Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>And by what Authority Men separate themselves from that Church?</p>
                  <p>What Church? The Catholick and Apostolick? We own no Separation from
that; but we are d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may keep up the stricter Union with the truly <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolick Church.</hi>
And this is no <hi>Separating our selves,</hi> but being cast out by an Usurping F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
Communion imposed by it; the chief whereof is owning all the Usurpation, which
hath by degrees been brought into it. To make this plain by an Example: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a prosperous Usurper in this Kingdom had gained a considerable Interest in
it, and challenged a Title to the whole, and therefore required of all the Kings
Subjects, within his Power, to own him to be Rightful King: Upon this, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them are forced to withdraw, because they will not own his Title: Is this
an act of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and not rather of true Loyalty? Schism in the Church is like
Rebellion in the State. The Pope d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other parts of the Christian World declare against it, as an Usurpation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he goes on, and makes the owning his Power a necessary Condition of
being of his Communion. This many of the Western Parts, as well as Eastern,
disown and reject, and therefore are excluded Communion with that Church,
whereof he is owned to be the <hi>Head.</hi> The Question now is, Who gives the
Occasion to this Separation? whether the Pope, by requiring the owning his
Usurpation, or We, by declaring against it? Now, if the Cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be unjust and unreasonable; if his Authority, he challenges, over the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> be a meer Usurpation (for which we have not only the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the other Parts of the Christian World, but of Scripture and the Ancient
Church) then we are not to be condemned, for such a Separation, which was
unavoidable, if we would not comply with the Pope's Usurpation. And upon
this Foot the Controversie about Schism stands between Us and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The only Pretence I ever heard of, was, because the Church hath
fail'd in wresting and interpreting the Scripture contrary to the true
sense and meaning of it; and that they have imposed Articles of Faith
upon us, which are not to be warranted by Gods Word. I do desire
to know who is to be Judge of that, whether the whole Church,
the Succession whereof hath continued to this day without inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or particular Men, who have raised Schisms for their own
advantage.</p>
                  <p>The whole force of this Paragraph depends upon a Supposition, which is
taken for granted, but will never be yielded by Us, and we are sure c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

never be proved by those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> That in the new impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Articles, the <hi>whole Church</hi> in a continued Succession hath been of the same
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46932:13"/>
judgment with them, and only some <hi>few Particular Men</hi> in these last Ages have
opposed them. Whereas the great thing we insist upon next to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is, that they can never prove the Points in difference, by an Universal
Tradition from the Apostles Times, either as to the <hi>Papal Supremacy,</hi> or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Articles defined by the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi> We do not take upon our selves
to contradict the Universal sense of the Christian Church from the Apostles Times
in any one Point. But the true Reason of the proceeding of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was this. While the Popes Authority was here received and obeyed, there
was no liberty of searching into abuses, or the ways of Reforming them. But
when Men were encouraged to look into the Scripture, and Fathers, and Councils,
they soon found the state of things in the Church extreamly altered from what
they ought to have been, or had been in the Primitive Church: But they saw no
possibility of Redress, as long as the Popes Authority was so absolute and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
This therefore in the first place they set themselves to the accurate Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of, and the Result was, that they could find it neither in the Scriptures,
nor Fathers, nor Councils, nor owned by the Eastern Churches: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they concluded it ought to be laid aside, as an Usurpation. Our Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by this means set free (even with the consent of Those, who joined with
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in other things) a greater liberty was then used in examining
particular Doctrines and Practices, which had crept into the Church by degrees,
when Ignorance and Barbarism prevail'd; and having finish'd this enquiry, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Religion were drawn up, wherein the sense of our Church was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
agreeable to Scripture and Antiquity, though different from the Modern
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and these Articles are not the private sense of particular Men,
but the Publick Standard whereby the World may judge, what we believe and
practise; and therefore these are the sense of our Church, and not the opinions or
fancies of particular Men. And those who call the retrenching the Popes exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
Power by the name of Schism, must by parity of reason call the casting off
an Usurper Rebellion. But certainly those who consider the mighty advantages
and priv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at this day is, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> should be <hi>against,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi>

of such an overflowing of <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi> among us? And it is indeed a sad
thing to consider how many Ways and Means have been used by all Parties to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
and keep up <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> amongst us, and then how the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> is blamed for not being able to suppress them. But if all Doctrines
opposite to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> be accounted <hi>Heresies,</hi> then we desire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
how the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> came to have this Power of defining Heretical
Doctrines; or how any Doctrine comes to be <hi>Heresie</hi> by being contrary to its
definitions. For <hi>Heresie is an obstinate opposing some necessary Article of Faith.</hi>
It must therefore be proved, that what the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of <hi>Heresie</hi> upon us. And this can never be maintained, without proving
that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a Power to make Doctrines not nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to become necessary by her Definition: which is the same thing with making
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46932:14"/>
                     <hi>New Articles of Faith.</hi> But these can never be proved to be such by Universal
Tradition; which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends for all her Articles of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Every Man thinks himself as competent a Iudge of Scripture, as the very Apostles themselves.</p>
                  <p>Doth <hi>Every Man</hi> among us pretend to an infallible Spirit? and yet <hi>Every Man</hi>
owns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Apostles had it. But what is meant by <hi>being a Iudge of Scripture?</hi>
If no more be understood, than that <hi>every Man</hi> must use his understanding about
it, I hope this is no Crime nor <hi>Heresie.</hi> The Scripture must be believed in order
to Salvation, and therefore it must be understood; for how can a Man believe,
what he understands not the sense or meaning of? If he must understand the
sense he must be <hi>Iudge of the sense;</hi> so that every Man, who is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Scripture in order to his Salvation, must be Judge of the sense of the
Scripture, so far as concerns his Salvation. But if by being a <hi>Iudge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
be meant giving such a judgment, as obliges others to submit to it, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us no particular Man doth pretend to be a <hi>competent Iudge of Scripture,</hi> so
as to bind others to rely upon his Authority in expounding Scripture. We own
the Authority of Guides in the Church, and a due submission to them, but we do
not allow them to be as <hi>competent Iudges of Scripture as the very Apostles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 'tis no wonder it should be so, since that part of the Nation,
which looks most like a Church, dares not bring the true Arguments
against the other Sects, for fear they should be turned against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and confuted by their own Arguments.</p>
                  <p>This is directly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

with Insincerity or Weakness in dealing with the Diss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nters. But we must consider
the meaning of this Charge, <hi>It is no wonder it should be so,</hi> i. e. <hi>That every Man
should think himself as competent a Iudge of Scripture, as the very Apostles, because
the Church of</hi> England <hi>dares not use the true Arguments against the Sects.</hi> Whence
it appears that this true Argment is the Churches <hi>infallible Authority,</hi> and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of all Members of the Church to submit their judgments intirely thereto.
I confess that if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> did pretend to this against the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> they
might justly turn it against her; because in our Articles, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be asserted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet <hi>Infallibility</hi> is denyed. If there can be no Authority in a <hi>Church,</hi>
without Inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llibility; or there can be no obligation to submit to Authority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
it, then the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth not use the best Arguments against Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries,
But if there be no ground for Infallibility, if the Church which hath most
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46932:14"/>
pretended to it, hath been most grosly deceived, if the Heads of that Church
have been not barely suspected of <hi>Heresie,</hi> but one of them stands condemned
for it in Three General Councils, own'd by that Church; then for all that I can
see, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath wisely disowned the pretence of Infallibility, and
made use of the best Arguments against Sectaries from a just Authority, and the
sinfulness and folly of the Sectaries refusing to submit to it.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> (as 'tis called) would fain have it thought,
That they are Iudges in matters Spiritual, yet dare not say positively,
there is no Appeal from them.</p>
                  <p>Is not the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> really what <hi>it is called?</hi> I would fain know what
it wants to make it as good a <hi>Church,</hi> as any in the Christian World? It wants nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Faith</hi> (if the Creed contain it) nor <hi>Sacraments,</hi> (and those entire) nor <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi>
of <hi>Bishops,</hi> (as certain as <hi>Rome</hi> it self) nor a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> (more agreeing to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Worship, than is any where else to be found.) Why then <hi>the Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as 'tis called?</hi> Well! But what is this <hi>Church</hi> now blamed for: <hi>They pretend
to be Iudges in matters Spiritual, and yet dare not say there is no appeal from them.</hi>
How then? Are there no true Judges, but such as there lies no Appeal from?
There lies an Appeal from any Judges in the Kings Courts to the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
are They not therefore true Judges in <hi>Westminster-Hall?</hi> There lay an

therefore no true Judges, but General Councils?</p>
                  <p>What follows relating to the <hi>Churches Authority, and every Mans following
his own judgment,</hi> hath been answered already. I proceed therefore, to what
further concerns this matter of Appeal.</p>
                  <p>What Countrey can subsist in Quiet, where there is not a Supream
Iudge, from whence there can be no Appeal?</p>
                  <p>The natural consequence from hence appears to be, That every <hi>National

                  <p>And is there any likelihood, Justice should be better done in another Country,

but the Arbitrary will of a Stranger. And must such a one, pretending to a Power
he hath no right to, <hi>be Iudge in his own Cause,</hi> when he is the greatest <hi>Offender</hi>
himself (But how is this applied to the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>England?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is our Case, here in <hi>England,</hi> in matters Spiritual; for the
Protestants are not of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as 'tis the true Church,
from whence there can be no Appeal; but because the Discipline of
that Church is conformable at present to their fancies; which, as soon
as it shall contradict or vary from, they are ready to embrace or join
with the next Congregation of People, whose Discipline or Worship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with the Opinion of that Time.</p>
                  <p>The sense of this Period is not so clear, but that one may easily mistake about it.
That which is aimed at, is, that we of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> have no tie upon us,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46932:15"/>
but that of our own judgments; and when that changes, we may join with <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi>
or <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as we do now with the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And what
security can be greater, than that of our Judgments? If it be said <hi>to be nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
fancy and no true Iudgment,</hi> we must beg leave to say, that we dare Appeal to the
World, whether we have not made it appear, that it is not <hi>Fancy,</hi> but <hi>Iudgment</hi>
which hath made us firm to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Might it not as well have been
said, that <hi>the Protestants</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England, adhered to the Crown in the Times
of Rebellion out of Fancy, and not out of Iudgment? And that if their Fancy changed,
they might as well have joined with the Rebels?</hi> Will not this way of Reasoning hold
as strongly against those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> For why do any adhere to that,
but because it is agreeable to their Judgment so to do? What evidence can they
give, that it is <hi>Iudgment</hi> in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and only <hi>Fancy</hi> in us? If Reason must be that
which puts the difference, we do not question, but to make ours appear to be <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and theirs <hi>Fancy?</hi> For what is an <hi>infallible Iudge,</hi> which Christ never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, but <hi>Fancy?</hi> What is their <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> as a Rule of Faith to be equally
received with the Scriptures, but <hi>Fancy?</hi> What is giving honour to God by the
<hi>Worship of Images,</hi> but <hi>Fancy?</hi> What is making <hi>Mediators</hi> of <hi>Intercession,</hi> besides
the <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> but <hi>Fancy?</hi> What is the Doctrine of <hi>Concomitancy,</hi>
to make amends for half the Sacrament, but <hi>Fancy?</hi> What is the <hi>substantial

Reason are against it. What is the <hi>deliverance of Souls out of Purgatory, by Masses

                  <p>So that according to this Doctrine, there is no other Church nor In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpreter

the best faculties they can make use of, for the understanding of Scripture, or any

Is it not, because their Understandings tell them they ought so to do? So that by this
consequence, there is no <hi>Infallible Church,</hi> but <hi>what lies in every Mans giddy Brain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I desire to know therefore of every serious Considerer of these things,
whether the great Work of our Salvation ought to depend on such a
Sandy Foundation as this?</p>
                  <p>I thank God I have seriously considered this matter, and must declare that I find

Interpretations</hi> commend me to the <hi>Pope's Bulls,</hi> especially when they have a mind

to the end of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> But that which seems to be aimed at here, is, <hi>This is
my Body;</hi> wherein the words seem to be <hi>plain and positive</hi> on their side, and our
sense to be <hi>from Implications, or far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That there are Expressions in Scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

themselves bound to understand in their literal sense. For then we must all believe;
that God hath <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears,</hi> a <hi>Face, Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet,</hi> as firmly, as that the Bread was
then turned into Christ's Body, when he spake those words. And I would know,
whether the Christian Church rejecting the Doctrine of Those <hi>who made God to
be like to Man,</hi> was not chargeable with the same <hi>resisting the Truth,</hi> and <hi>denying
plain &amp; positive Words of Scripture,</hi> as we are? And yet I hope the Christian <hi>Church
did then believe it self.</hi> Suppose any should assert, <hi>That the Rock in the Wilderness,
was really changed into Christ's Body;</hi> would not he have the very same Things
to say against those who denied it? For are not the Words <hi>as plain and as positive,</hi>
That Rock was Christ? But <hi>Sacramental Expressions,</hi> by the consent of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church,</hi> and the very Nature of the Thing, are of a different sense from
Logical Propositions. And if this had been intended in the plain and literal sense,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have as plainly and positively called it <hi>Bread</hi> after Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
nor the <hi>Cup</hi> be said to be the New Testament in his Blood.</p>

TO THE

                  <p>THE Third Paper is said to be written by a Great Lady, <hi>for the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of her Friends,</hi> as to the Reasons of <hi>Her leaving the Communion of
the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and making her self a Member of the Roman
Catholick Church.</hi> If she had written nothing concerning it, none
could have been a competent Judge of those Reasons or Motives she had for it,
but her self: but since she was pleased <hi>to write this Paper to satisfy her Friends;</hi>
and it is thought fit to be publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shed for general Satisfaction, all Readers have a
right to judge of the strength of them; and those of the <hi>Churh</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> an Obligation to vindica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e the Honour of it, so far as it may be thought to suffer by them.</p>
                  <p>I am sensible how nice and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nder a thing it is, to meddle in a Matter wherein
the Memory of so <hi>Great a Lady</hi> is so nearly concern'd; and wherein such Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
are mentioned, which cannot fully be cleared, the Parties themselves
having been many Years dead: But I shall endeavour to keep within due bounds,
and consider this Paper with respect to the main Design of it, and take notice of
other Particulars so far as they are subservient to it.</p>
                  <p>The way of her <hi>Satisfaction</hi> must needs appear very extraordinary; for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Conclusion confesses, <hi>She was not able, nor would she enter into
Disputes with any Body.</hi> Now where the Difference between the two Churches
lies wholly in Matters of Dispute, how any one cou'd be truly satisfied, as to the
Grounds of leaving one Church, and going to the other, without <hi>entring int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
matters of Dispute with any body,</hi> is hard to understand. If Persons be resolved
before-hand what to do, and therefore will hear nothing said against it, there is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46932:17"/>
no such way, as to declare they will <hi>enter into no Dispute about it.</hi> But what <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi>
is to be had in this manner of proceeding? How could <hi>one bred up in the
Church of</hi> England, <hi>and so well instructed in the Doctrines of it,</hi> ever satisfy her
self in forsaking the Communion of it, without enquiring into, and comparing
the Doctrines and Practices of both Churches? It is possible for Persons of Learning, who will take the pains of examining things themselves, to do that,
without <hi>entring into Disputes with any Body;</hi> but this was not to be presumed of
a Person other Condition. For many things must fall in her way, which she
could neither have the leisure to examine, nor the Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>city to judg of, without
the Assistance of such who made it their business to search into them. Had she
no Divines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> about her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have proposed her Scruples
to? None able and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ling to give her their utmost Assistance in a Matter of such
Importance, before she took up a Resolution of forsaking our Church? This
cannot be imagined; considering not only her great Quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that just esteem
they had for her whilst she continued so zealous and devout in the Communion of
our Church.</p>
                  <p>But we have more than this to say. One of the Bishops who had nearest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to her for many Years, and who owns in Print, <hi>That he

respect to our Church, if she would have been pleased to have
communicated them to him. And however she endeavoured to conceal her
Scruples; he tells her, in his Letter to her (which he since prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Bishops who had known her longest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But she saith,</hi> That she spoke severally to two of the best Bishops
we have in <hi>England,</hi> who both told her, there were many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pressing one of them very much upon the other Points; he
told her, That if he had been bred a Catholick, he would not change
his Religion; but that being of another Church, wherein he was
sure were all things necessary to Salvation, he thought it very ill to give that Scandal,
as to leave that Church wherein he received his Baptism. Which Discourses, <hi>she
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aid,</hi> did but add more to the desire she had to be a Catholick.</p>
                  <p>This, I confess, seems to be to the purpose; if there were not some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
and Expressions very much mistaken in the Representation of it: But
yet suppose the utmost to be allow'd, there could be no Argument from hence
drawn for leaving the Communion of our Church, if this Bishop's <hi>Authority</hi> or
<hi>Example</hi> did signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y any thing with her. For supposing he did say, <hi>That if he
had been bred in the Communio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>he would not change his
Religion:</hi> Yet he added, <hi>That being of another Church, wherein were all things
necessary to Salvation, he thought it very ill to give that Scandal, as to leave that
Church wherein he had received his Baptism.</hi> Now why should not the last words
have greater force to have kept her in the Communion of our Church, than the
former to have drawn her from it? For why should any Person forsake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of our Church, unless it appears necessary to Salvation so to do? And yet
this yielding Bishop did affirm, <hi>that all things necessary to Salvation were certainly
in our Church; and that it was an ill thing to leave it.</hi> How could this <hi>add to her
desire of leaving our Church?</hi> unless there were some other Motive to draw her
thither, and then such small Inducements would serve to inflame such a Desire.
But it is evident from her own words afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that these Concessions of the
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shop could have no Influence upon her: for she declares, <hi>and calls God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that she would never have changed her Religion, if she had thought it possible to
save her Soul otherwise.</hi> Now what could the Bishop's words signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y towards her
Turning, when he declares just contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> not only that it was possible for
her to be saved without turning, <hi>but that he was sure we had all things necessary to
Salvation; and that it was a very ill thing to leave our Church?</hi> There must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have been some more secret Reason, which <hi>encreased her Desire to be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
after these Discourses:</hi> unless the Advantage were taken from the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

calling <hi>the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Catholick Religion; If he had been bred a Catholick,
he would not have chang'd his Religion.</hi> But if we take these words so strictly, he
must have contradicted himself; for how could he <hi>be sure we had all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:46932:18"/>But again; there is an inconsistency in his saying, <hi>

                  <p>The utmost then that can be made of all this, is, That there was a certain Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of this <hi>Church,</hi> who held <hi>both Churches</hi> to be so far <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> that there was no necessity of going from one <hi>Church</hi> to another. But

of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the late Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> hath made a shorter Answer to all this; For
he first doubts, <hi>Whether there ever were any such Bishops who made such Answers;</hi>
And afterwards he affirms, <hi>That he believes there never was,</hi> in

                     <hi>and two of the most Learned Bishops of</hi>
England. But, God be thanked, the Cause of our Church doth
not depend upon the singular Opinion of one or two Bishops in it, wherein they
apparently recede from the establish'd Doctrine of it. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am sure those of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> take it ill from us, to be charged with the Opinion of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Divines, against the known Sentiments of their Church. Therefore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Matter of Fact true, it ought not to have moved her to any Inclination
to leave the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But after all, <hi>She protests, in the Presence of Almighty God, that no Person,
Man or Woman, directly or indirectly, ever said any thing to her (since she came into</hi>
England) <hi>or used the least Endeavour to make her change her Religion; and that
it is a Blessing she wholly owes to Almighty God.</hi> So that the Bishops are acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from having any hand in it, by her own words; and as far as we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

We had thought the pretence to a <hi>private Spirit</hi> had not been at this time
allowed in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I observe, that many things are allowed to
bring Persons to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they will not permit in those who go
from it. As the use of Reason in the Choice of a Church; the Judgment of
Sense; and here, that which they would severely condemn in others as a Private
Spirit, or <hi>Enthusiasm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> will pass well enough if it doth but lead one to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
Any Motive or Method is good enough which tends to that end; and
none can be sufficient against it. But why may not others set up for the Change
as to other Opinions upon the same Grounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as this Great Person does, as
to the Change from our <hi>Church</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> And we have no Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> among us, but do as solemnly ascribe <hi>the Blessing wholly to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God;</hi> and look on it as the Effect of such <hi>Prayers</hi> as she made to him in
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi>

                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:46932:19"/>But I wonder a Person, <hi>who owed her Change so wholly to Almighty God,</hi>
should need the Direction of an Infallible Church; since the utmost they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, is no more than to have such an Immediate Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it must be Immediate Impulse, or some concealed Motive which determin'd

                  <p>The <hi>Conclusion</hi> was, That <hi>she would never have changed, if she could have

they began upon reading Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s History of the Reformation; which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to her as a Book to settle her; and there she found such abominable Sacriledg
upon <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's Divorce, King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Minority, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s
Succession, that she could not believe the Holy Ghost could ever be in such Counsels.</p>
                  <p>This was none of the best Advices given to such a Person, to real Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s
History for her Satisfaction. For there are two distinct Parts in the <hi>History</hi> of our

it, we cannot now be better informed: But we are sure this could be no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for her to have the Communion of out Church, because she was told by
these Bishops they did it, and continued in the Communion of it.</p>
                  <p>(4.) Lastly; As to <hi>the Infallibility of the Church.</hi> If this, as applied to the
<hi>Roman Church,</hi> could be any where found in Scripture, we should then indeed be
to blame not to submit to all the Definitions of it. But where is this to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with his <hi>Church</hi> but with his <hi>Apostles:</hi> And if it be restrained to them, then <hi>the

                     </gap>; were there none but at <hi>Rome?</hi> How comes this Promise
to be limited to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>Antio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi>
and all the other Eastern Churches (where the Bishops as certainly succeeded the
Apostles, as at <hi>Rome</hi> it self) not to enjoy the equal Benefit of this Promise? But
they who can find the <hi>Infallibility of the Church of Rome</hi> in Scripture, need not

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>spair of finding whatever they have a Mind to there.</p>
                  <p>But from this Promise she concludes, <hi>That our saviour would not permi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Church togive the Laity the Communion in One kind, if it were not lawfull so to do.</hi>
Now in my Opinion, the Argument is stronger the other way; The Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> forbids the doing of that, which Christ enjoyned; therefore it cannot be
Infallible, since the Command of Christ is so much plainer than the Promise of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
to the Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>But, from all these things laid together, I can see no imaginable Reason of any
