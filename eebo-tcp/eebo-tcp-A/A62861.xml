            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Presume to present to your Honors a Continuation of the full Review of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of which the first part was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to his Highness more than a year ago. To which Writing I take my self many ways obliged, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because of my own engagements, but also, and that chiefly, by reason of the important concernment that the truth be preserved. I am sensible that the increase of Books is thought a grievance by many, and that none
<pb facs="tcp:100457:3"/>
are more unwelcome, than such as are about Controversies, specially when they tend to unsettle men in what they have received, and in no point more than in this. Few have abilitie to discern in Disputes which part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderates: Few are willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow pains in such unpleasant studies: Few can digest a truth which expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to reproach and loss. These and other considerations had kept me from this adventure, if my allegiance to Christ had not bound me to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his truth, and charity to men tied me to endeavour their undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Wisdom must be justified by her children: nor can he give a good account to Christ at his appearing, who shall, out of undue respects, leave to spoil the truth with which he is intrusted. Polemick Writing are
<pb facs="tcp:100457:3"/>
to few delightfull, yet necessary; it being unlikely that practice of piey should flourish when Doctrines of Faith and Worship are corrupted. They that decline studying and meddling with Controversies, if they be not sluggish, yet are likely unwary, not heeding that thereby the wall is unrepaired, which should keep out Seducers from perverting the Churches. Peace is indeed very desirable, but Truth is put first, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8. 19. Were men better temper'd than commonly they are, dissenters might ventilate things in question with less offence; I mention it with rejoycing, as a sign of Gods presence with us, in hope that the same Spirit of unanimity will diffuse it self among our Christian brethren throughout the Nation. That Dissenters and Contenders in writing, and otherwise, in this and other points, for their several judgments, have acted hitherto in the business of approving publick Preachers with much harmony of minde, and agreement of votes; Surely the work of Christ would be much advanced by a firm consociation in order to the work of Christ so far as we agree, though there should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, as no doubt there will, diversities of
<pb facs="tcp:100457:4"/>
opinions in things disputable. Nor do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair that Disputes will be mannaged with more sweetness of spirit, candour, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards dissenters than formerly they have been.</p>
            <p>In this hope my intention is (with Gods assistence) to prosecute the Dispute begun, a part whereof I now tender to your Honours, being desirous that my self, and the cause I mannage should stand right in your eys, who are the eys of the Common-wealth. For whom I beg light from Heaven toguide you in your way, and help from him, who hath been hitherto your strength, and who will be with you, while you be with him, and remain,</p>

But this motion which would have quickly brought the matter to an issue, and made a shorter dispatch of the dispute than is now likely to be, being so far from meeting with a ready accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that thereby an occasion was taken to misrepresent me as a braving challenger, and one that minds self-ost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <argument>
               <p> That no good argument can be drawn from the positive Rites of the old Testament, to prove a divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in positive Rites of the new; nor is it true as Mr <hi>B.</hi> saith, that Infants admission into the Church is fully determined in the old Testament.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MAster <hi>B.</hi> begins the dispute, pag. 1. with a preface tending to move affections, otherwise than pleaders before the <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagites</hi> were to do, and was desired of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that Logick might be used, and Rhetorick for born; but however the preface is framed, and takes with many, yet so many mistakes in it are shewed in my <hi>Praecursor,</hi> as might deterre readers from blinding their eyes by the dust raised in it. He then tells us <hi>he must needs lay down several positions that must necessarily be well understood before they could understand the point in hand,</hi> and these are no fewer than ten, which if they had been all omitted, I see not but that the point might have been as well understood as now it is. I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where master <hi>B.</hi> makes any use of them for clearing the point, and therefore I judge them, with his three propositions, chap. 2. to serve onely to forestall mens minds, if they be not used to dull the Readers attention ere he come to the point, as the Turks use their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sapi</hi> to blunt the Christians swords by killing them afore their Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries fall on. But what ever the intent was, there are sundry pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages that require animadversions; His first position is, <hi>That the holy Ghost speaks of somethings in scripture more fully, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more sparingly,</hi> which I grant to be true; but I like not his instance when he saith, <hi>that the scripture speaks little concerning the heathen that never heard the Gospell, whether any of them be saved? or upon what terms he dealeth with them for life or death? Far is it</hi> [saith he,] <hi>from my reach, to discover the Holy Ghosts mind in this:</hi> whereas me thinks the Scripture speaketh much of this, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. Chapters. And to be doubtfull, <hi>whether they that never heard the</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100457:7"/>
               <hi>Gospel were saved, and upon what terms God dealt with them for life or death,</hi> is in my apprehension to be unresolved whether there be not another way of salvation than by Christ; whether a man living and dying a professed Idolater without repentance, may not be saved by his moral dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anour; and whether Pelagianism be not true, that by nature without grace men may be saved. <hi>Vedelius</hi> in his book <hi>de deo synagogae</hi> charged <hi>Barlet</hi> the <hi>Arminian</hi> with a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous position in writing in verses before a book of <hi>Manasseh Ben Israel the Jew, that the God of Iews and Christians was one,</hi> and intimating that <hi>Iews remaining in denial of Christ might have God for their God,</hi> contrary to <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 24. and 14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a conceit must this be, much lessening the grace of God in Christ, tending to Pelagianism, and to make Idolatrie a venial sin, to imagine that men that never had the Gospel nor the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but were such, even the best of them, as are described <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. &amp;c. that they should be saved, when the Scripture so plainly tels us, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 8. 27. &amp; 22. 15. that all Idolaters shall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? But I leave master <hi>B.</hi> to Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> his lecture <hi>de salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Ethnicorum</hi> to resolve him in this point.</p>
            <p>And whereas he saith <hi>the Scripture speaketh sparingly of Infants,</hi> it seems then some at least of his texts he brings for Infants disciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and visible Church-membership are impertinent, sith they are so many; and whereas he instanceth in <hi>the case of Insant-Baptism among such things as are not plainly determined in Scripture,</hi> he doth thereby gainsay the title of his book, which he cals <hi>plain Scripture proof of Infants baptism;</hi> nor is he relieved by what he replies in his <hi>praefestinant is morator,</hi> where nothing is brought out of his words, before or after, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> shews I have not rightly alleged his words in my <hi>Praecursor, Sect.</hi> 2. And his words pag. 9. [<hi>the grounds of it are very easie and plain, though to many it be difficult to discern how it is from those grounds inferred</hi>] do confirm my observation, that he contradicted his title, sith the inference which is the proof, is in them confessed to be difficult. But what he saith in the words following, pag. 3, 4. is more exactly to be scanned, as touching the main <hi>Basis</hi> of Paedo-Baptism. <hi>The new Testament</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi>) <hi>speaks more sparingly of that which is more fully discovered in the old, what need the same thing be so done twice,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100457:8"/>
               <hi>except men had questioned the authority of the old? the whole Scripture is the perfect word and law of God; &amp; if he should reveal all his mind in one part, what use should we make of the other? How silent is the N. T. concerning Christian magistracy? which made the Anabaptists of old deny it; Where find you a Christian in the new Testament that exercised the place of a King, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-man, or Justice of Peace, or the like? so of an oath before a Magistrate, of war, of the Sabbath, &amp;c. how sparing is the new Testament? and why? but because there was enough said of them before in the old; This also is the very case in the question in hand. The main question is not, by what sign members are to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church? or whether by a sign or without? But at what age they are to be admitted members? now this is as fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the old Testament, as most things in the Bible, and therefore what need any more?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> here asserts <hi>in the question about Infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, that it is as fully determined in the old Testament as most things in the Bible, at what age persons should be admitted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into the Church, and therefore what need any more?</hi> which if true, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had done well to have spared the allegation of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 42. 48. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 5. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 41. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17, 19, 20, 24, 25, 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37, 38, 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 36, 37. and 10. 13, 14, 15, 16. and others the allegation of <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38 39. and 16. 15. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 1, 2. for Infant-baptism, not troubling the Reader with more, when, if he speak true, the proof might have been made by fewer texts; <hi>Frustra fit per plura, quod fieri potest per pauciora.</hi> And indeed when Paedo-baptists speak not like wranglers, but ingenuously confesse the naked truth, they acknowledge there is no expresse precept or example for Infantbaptism in the new Testament, but they must flye to the old, Master <hi>Marshal in his sermon of baptizing Infants,</hi> pag. 34. Doctor <hi>Young</hi> in the passage cited in my <hi>Praecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, Sect.</hi> 22. <hi>Eaton</hi> and <hi>Taylor, defence,</hi> pag. 57. <hi>Do not you conclude Infants must be baptized, not because the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expresly saith so, but because you find it in the old; the Jews children were circumcised, therefore Christians children must be baptized. The assembly at Westminster answer to the dissenting Brethren touching Ordination,</hi> pag. 186. <hi>If par ratio will not serve turn to prove an ordinance of Christ, or at least to</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100457:8"/>
               <hi>warrant a practice, how will our brethren prove baptizing of infants?</hi> Which confessions me thinks should deterre Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists fom alleging precept and practice of it out of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or at least readers and hearers should learn more wit than to be cheated thereby, when their own confessions do shew that they are brought onely to fill up books, and to deceive the poor sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple readers. But let us view Mr. <hi>B.</hi> words better.</p>
            <p>He saith, <hi>the main question is not by what sign members are to be admitted into the Church, or whether by a sign or without, but at what age they are to be admitted members? now this is as fully determined in the old Testament as most things in the Bible. Mr. M. in his defence,</hi> pag. 195. saith thus; <hi>First, for the point of will worship I shall desire you to prove this Conclusion, That all things belonging to Christian worship, even in the circumstances of it, even the ages and sexes of the persons to whom the ordinances are to be applyed, must expresly be set down in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if you prove not this, you say nothing to the purpose, for this is our very case,</hi> pag. 205. <hi>This about Infantbaptism touches but a circumstance of age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Tis true, the main question is, whether infants are to be baptized? But they that deny it, do so, not meerly because of their age, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">

               <hi>are much mistaken.</hi> If the question about Infantbaptism touch but a circumstance of age, then the question about Infant-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion toucheth but a circumstance of age, and if men may without precept or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100457:9"/>
example in the new Testament of Infant baptism be acquitted from willworship, because it toucheth but a circumstance of age, by the same reason they may be acquitted from willworship, who give Infants the Communion, because it toucheth but a circumstance of age. Our Lord Christ and his Apostles having determined who are to be baptized, it is manifest willworship or humane Invention to baptize others than he and they have appointed; and it is so much the worse, because it is not onely about the proper subject of so great an ordinance, but also the main end and use of baptism, by altering of which the ordinance is quite changed into another thing, and the Church of God exceedingly corrupted. But letting that passe, <hi>admission of Infants into the Church</hi> (Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith) <hi>is fully determined in the old Testament;</hi> if he mean not the Christian visible Church, he speaks ambiguously, and if his words be meant of the Christion visible Churah (of which onely is the question) then it is as fully determined in the old Testament, that Infants should be admitted into the visible Church Christian as most things in the Bible, as that God made heaven and earth, idols are vanities, fornication a sin, &amp;c. But surely none will believe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in this, but he that is so simple as to believe every word. Me thinks he should not have said such a word at <hi>Bewdly,</hi> where he saith in his <hi>History, were many antient stayd Christians, that would not as children be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st up and down, and carried too and fro with every wind of doctrine,</hi> except he presumed they would take what he said, as true, without trial. Formerly this was the received doctrine, that Baptism was the sacrament of admission into the Christian Church, that Baptism and the Lords supper were the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the new Testament, instituted by Christ himself, that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision. and the Passeover, and the whole Jewish Church policy are abrogated, which if true, it is very bold to say, that <hi>Infants are to be admitted into the visible Church Christian, is as fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the old Testament, as most things in the Bible,</hi> when there is not a word in all the old Testament about the age, or way of admission into the visible Church Christian. But where doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> find this admission so fully determined in the old Testament? In the dispute at <hi>Bewdly</hi> he denied the precept of Circumcision to be the ordinance of visible church-membership, And in my <hi>Praecursor, Sect.</hi> 6 I say, as yet I can fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet dare you boast so confidently of your prepared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation? yet can you find no law that made women Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? nor the uncircumcised males in the wilderness? O the power of prejudice!</hi> Whereto I say, though I boast not of my prepared confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but speak of it modestly, yet I find no cause to be lesse confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of my prepared confutation, because of these frivolous interoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> It is not the power of prejudice which is the reason why I find not a law or ordinance for Infants visible Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, but because I do not see or read of law or ordinance for Infants visible Church-membership besides that of Circumcision, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon my own search, or Mr. <hi>Bs</hi>. or others shewing; I asked once a Preacher at <hi>Bewdley</hi> where it was? he told me it was <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12, 13. I told him I find a relation of a fact, of a thing that was done, but not a word of any law, ordinance precept or command, determining thus it shall be, this shall be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. or any other form of speech that imports a law, ordinance, precept, statute or command to make female infants visible Churchmembers; much lesse do I find an appointment, law, ordinance, that <hi>some infants were once to be admitted members of the visible Church</hi> (which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should have proved to be unrepealed, according to his assertion, cap. 5. 26.) except the law of Circumcising infants. And therefore my confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. <hi>Bs</hi>. argument, cap. 5. might be sufficient, if I only denied such an ordinance or appointment, till it be shewed. I do confess my weakness in my answering at <hi>Bewdley,</hi> in that I permitted Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to run on in the proof of an ordinance unrepealed, afore he had shewed me where that ordinance is, but I perceived therein what I feared still, that I should not in a verball dispute observe what was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be heeded. But I may say with truth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands not what is meant by a law, ordinance, appointment liable to repeal, or still binding, or loves to pervert words from the genuine sense, as he did the word [<hi>accuse;</hi>] or else he is unwilling to speak plainly, who being provoked to shew in what text of Scripture that pretended law, ordinance, appointment is, doth not yet shew it. And for his assertion here, it exceeds all faith, that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant admission into the Church</hi> (meaning the visible Church Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian) <hi>should be as fully determined in the old Testament, at most things in the Bible.,</hi>

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100457:10"/>But wherever, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> imagines it is fully determined in the old Testament, the <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi> in their <hi>Confession of faith,</hi> chap. 25. Art. 4. allege but one text out of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz. Gen.</hi> 17. 7. 9. for admission of Infants by Baptism into the visible Church, and if Mr. <hi>M.</hi> their Champion in this Point expresse their minds, they deduce Infant-baptism from this principle, <hi>All Gods Commands and Institutions about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Jews bind us as much as they did them in all things which belong to the substance of the Covenant, and were not accidental to them.</hi> Which how false it is, how contrary to the Tenet of Divines former and later, is shewed in my <hi>Examen,</hi> part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.

But Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in his <hi>Defence</hi> pag. 195. conceives his argument from the analogy of the Ceremonial law of Circumcision, which he calls his <hi>Analogical argument,</hi> pag. 201. good; on the contrary I deny any argument from analogy of the Ceremonial law good in meer positive ceremonies to prove thus it was in the old Testament, therefore it must be so in the new. And thus I argue,</p>

The reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then of Baptism and Circumcision is meerly Institution; if then there be not the like Institution, there is not the like reason.

            <p>2. I thus argue, If all the Laws and Commands about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, positive Rites and Ceremonies of the Jews, be now abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then no argument upon supposed analogy or parity of reason from the institution of those abrogated Rites can prove a binding rule to us about a meer positive Rite of the new Testament. For how can that make a binding rule to us about another meer posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Rite without any other Institution, which it self is abrogated? that which binds not at all, binds not about another thing, <hi>v. g.</hi> Baptism. But all the Laws and Commands about the Sacraments, positive Rites and Ceremonies of the Jews, are now abrogated, as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100457:11"/>
is proved in my <hi>Examen,</hi> part. 3. sect. 12. and confessed by the <hi>Assembly Conf. of faith,</hi> chap. 19. art. 3. <hi>ergo</hi> none of them bind, This argument is confirmed by the words of Mr <hi>Cawdrey Sabbat. Rediv.</hi> part. 2. chap. 7. sect. 7. pag. 263. <hi>No ceremonial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement can infer a moral commandement. The reason of our assertion is this, because partial commandments given to some Nation or persons (as the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al precepts were) cannot infer a general to oblige others, even all the world.</hi> Again, <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 276. <hi>First it is so in all other like special and ceremonial Commandements concerning dayes, whensoever the particular day was abrogated, the whole Commandement concerning that day was utterly abolished, the Law of Circumcision and of the Passeover is expired as well as the sacramental and ceremonial actions commanded by that law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>M.</hi> conceived he had prevented by supposing <hi>that in some commands about the Sacraments of the Iews, are some things that belong to the substance of the Covenant, and limiting his assertion to those.</hi> And when in my <hi>Examen</hi> pag. 115. I argued, that in no good sense it can be true <hi>that some of the commands of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sacraments of the Jews contained things belonging to the substance of the Covenant,</hi> he tels us pag. 198, 199. of his <hi>Defence, that our Sacraments have the same substance with theirs, the same general nature, end, and use; which he makes in these things, theirs were seals of the Covenant, so ours,</hi> &amp;c. But none of all these are to the purpose, his allegations tending onely to prove that our Sacraments and the Jews have the same general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he calls <hi>substance,</hi> but not a word to shew that any command about them belonged to the substance of the Covenant, but as if he were angry, or did disdain a man should question his dictates, onely recites his meaning, and a passage or two of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Authors, and never answers a word to my objection, <hi>Exam.</hi> pag. 115. that in no good sense could it be true that some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God about the Sacraments of the Jews did contain things belonging to the substance of the Covenant. Yea when I animadverted on that saying in his <hi>Sermon, the manner of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of this Covenant was first by types, shadows and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> &amp;c. It had been convenient to have named Circumcision, that it might not be conceived to belong to the substance of the Covenant: <hi>I reply,</hi> saith he, <hi>in his Defence,</hi> pag. 99. <hi>this is a very small quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100457:11"/>
               <hi>I added, &amp;c. which supplies both Circumcision and other things.</hi> Which words in the plain construction of them do note, that Circumcision is comprehended in his &amp;c. as belonging to the manner of administration, not to the substance of the Covenant. And yet pag. 187. he hath these words, <hi>I have already proved</hi> (that is no where, no not so much as in attempt) <hi>that Circumcision though a part of their administration did yet belong to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> (meaning of the Covenant of grace) <hi>belong to it, I say, not as a part of it, but as a means of applying it.</hi> So uncertain and enterferring one another are his speeches about this thing. And yet this salve he adds is not true in any sense in which the word [<hi>substance</hi>] may be taken. For if he mean by [<hi>applying the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>] the signifying Christ to come, or the spiritual part promised, so Circumcision was a Type or shadow, and therefore according to his doctrine belonging to the administration that then was, not to the substance of the Covenant; if he mean by [<hi>applying the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>] sealing or assuring the righteousnesse of faith to mens consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, neither doth this make it of the substance of the Covenant, the Covenant being made before, and though Circumcision had never thus applyed it, the substance of the Covenant had been the same, yea the Covenant was the same in substance, according to his own doctrine, 2000. years before Circumcision did apply it to any; now I do not conceive any thing is to be said of the substance of a thing, when the thing may be entire without it; so that in this point I deprehend in Mr. <hi>M.</hi> speeches nothing but dictates; and those very uncertain and confused.</p>
            <p>Secondly, saith he, pag. 198. <hi>When I say that Gods Commands about their Sacraments bind us, my meaning never was to assert, that the ritual part of their Sacraments do remain in the leas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> particle, or that we are tyed to practise any of those things, but onely that there is a general and analogical nature, wherein the Sacraments of the Old and New Testament do agree,</hi> which he thus a little before expresseth, <hi>my meaning being plainly this, that all Gods Commands and Institutions about the Sacraments of the Jews as touching their general nature of being Sacraments and Seals of the Covenant, and as touching their use and end, do bind us in our Sacraments, because they are the same;</hi> whereto I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that Mr. <hi>M.</hi> supposeth <hi>the Commands of God are about the</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100457:12"/>
               <hi>general nature of being Sacraments and Seals of the Covenant:</hi> which is a most vain conceit, there being no such Command or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, there's no such Command that Sacraments should have the general nature of Sacraments, or be Seals of the Covenant, or that they should signifie Christ and seal spiritual grace: these things they have <hi>from their nature,</hi> as he saith, which is the same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Institution. The natures, essences and quiddities of things are eternal, invariable, and so come not under Command, which reacheth onely to things contingent, that may be done, or not be done. Did ever any wise man command to men that man should be a reasonable living body, or whitenesse a visible quality, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood a relation? And to say that <hi>God commands Sacraments to seal the Covenant,</hi> what is this but to say that God commands himself? For he alone by the Sacraments seals to us the Covenant or Promise of Christ, or grace by him. All Commands of God are concerning what the persons commanded should do, and they must needs be of particulars, not of generals, for <hi>actio est singularium, action is of singular persons and things.</hi> Though God may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand man to think or acknowledge Sacraments to be Seals of the Covenant, yet it were a most vain thing for God to command that Sacraments should be Seals of the Covenant, or to have this general end or use, to seal or signifie Christ, and spititual grace, to us, which belongs onely to himself to do by his declaration of his meaning in them. Such Commands as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> imagines, are a meer <hi>Chimaera,</hi> or dream of his brain. Secondly, the like is to be sayd concerning his conceit, that such <hi>Commands bind us in our Sacraments;</hi> For to bind us is to determine what is to be done, or not to be done by us; But such imagined Commands do not determine what is to be done or not to be done by us, and therefore cannot bind at all. Thirdly, when Mr. <hi>M.</hi> confesseth we <hi>are not tyed to the least particle of the ritual part or any practise of those things,</hi> he doth thereby acknowledge that all the Commands of God about the Sacraments of the Jews, which were all about rituals, are quite abrogated. For all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are Rites or Ceremonies, and to imagine a Command about a Sacrament, and not about a ritual part or Ceremony, is to imagine a Command about a Sacrament, which is not a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Chamier.

arguing against <hi>Suarez</hi> the Jesuit, <hi>that dreamed of a Sacrament appointed in the law of nature for remedy of original sin, yet had no determined Ceremony,</hi> speaks thus; <hi>Sacramentum aliquod insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum à Deo, Ceremonia nulla determinata à Deo, quis capiat? Sacramentum institui et Ceremoniam non determinari? Aequè dixerit loquutum esse deum, et tamen vocem nullam protulisse, nam aequè Sacramenti genus est Ceremonia et Vox loqisutionis.</hi> Fourthly, were it supposed that there were some Commands about the general nature of Sacraments, binding us, though every particle and practice of the ritual part be abrogated, yet this would not reach Mr. <hi>M.</hi> intent, which is to prove the Command of sealing Infants with the initial seal in force, binds. But to seal Infants with the initial seal in force is not of the general nature of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (for then it should belong to the after seal as well as the initiating) but after his own dictates of the special nature of the initial seal, and so Mr. <hi>M.</hi> principle serves not for his purpose.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I argued thus, <hi>Examen.</hi> part. 2. sect. 8. If we may frame an addition to Gods worship from analogy or resemblance concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us between two ordinances, whereof one is quite taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, without any Institution gathered by precept or Apostolical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, then a certain rule may be set down from Gods word how far a man may go in his conceived parity of reason equity or ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and where he must stay; For to use the words of the Author, whose book is intituled <hi>Grall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, if Christians must measure their worship according to the Institution and Ceremonies of the Jews, it is needfull that either they imitate them in all things, or else that some O Edipus resolve this riddle hitherto not resolved, to wit, what is moral and imitable in those Ceremonies, and what not.</hi> But out of Gods word no rule can be framed to resolve us how far we must or may not go in this conceived parity of reason, equity, or analogy, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The major is evinced from the perfection of Gods word, and the providence of God to have the consciences of his people rightly guided. The minor is proved by provoking those analogists that determine from the Commands about the Mosaical Rites and usages what must be done or may not be done about the meer positive worship and Church-order of the New Testament, to set down this rule out of Gods word. This argument is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by experience in the controversie between <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> jarring about the extent of Infant-baptism, the <hi>Elders</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in his <hi>Desence,</hi> pag. 83. Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> pag. 74, 75. of his <hi>answer to my letter,</hi> seem to deny, that Paedobaptists do frame an addition to Gods worship from such analogy, the contrary whereof is manifest from the passages cited before. But Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> over and above, pag. 75. sets down three cautions, which being observed, then this kind of arguing from analogy and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is without any such pretended danger. The insufficieny of which cautions being shewed in my <hi>Postscript</hi> to the <hi>Apology,</hi> Sect 17 pag. 143. I conceive it unnecessary to repeat my words, which the Reader may here find, and the vindication of them from what Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> opposeth in his <hi>vindiciae foederis,</hi> chap 42. fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the nex: Section.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100457:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. I argued, that if this way of making rules binding men consciences in meer positive worship from analogy of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or rites of the Old Testament, without institution in the New, be valid, then our Christian liberty from the Ceremonial Law is made void. For by this way of determining things as of Gods appointment, by our conceived analogy, al or a great part of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law may be put on our necks under pretence of analogy, and so the fruit of Christs purchase of Christian liberty lost, and we in vain exhorted to stand fast in the liberty, wherewith Christ hath made us free. For as <hi>Chillingworth</hi> once told <hi>Knot</hi> the Jesuit, if the Pope be made sole Judge of Centroversies, &amp; infallible Expositor of Scripture, it will be in effect all one, as if he were allowed to make a new Scripture and Articles of faith; and tyranny may be introduced as well by arbitrary expounding, as well as by arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary making of laws: so in this case the bondage of <hi>Moses</hi> his law may be put on our necks, not onely by those that say, it binds in the letter, but also by those that say, Gods commands about the Sacraments of the Jews bind us in the analogy and proportion.</p>
            <p>5. This argument hath strength from the sad experience the Church hath formerly and of late had in yielding to these reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from analogy, in the many Canons of Popes and Prelates, heavily loading Gods Church with rites and decrees about them, imposed from analogy of the Ceremonial Laws of <hi>Moses.</hi> The Constitutions of Popes, and Canons of Prelates, and the books of the maintainers of them expounding and defending their rituals, and liturgies, are full of them, to wit, rites about Priests, their Orders, Garments, Dues, Festivals, Sacraments, Votaries, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious houses, and such like, drawn from Mosaical Laws. It is a common complaint of Protestants and Antiprelatists, that in imitation of the Jews, under pretence of analogy, a new named Iudaism hath been brought into the Christian Church, and the reforming of them like <hi>Hercules</hi> his labour in clensing <hi>Augias</hi> his stable Some I have named in my <hi>Examen,</hi> part. 3. s. 9. more I might. In the <hi>Augustan Confession</hi> among the <hi>Articles of abuses, in the chapter of the Ecclesiastick power,</hi> its the <hi>general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that Popish writers made a worship in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like the Levitical.</hi> I may use Mr. <hi>Bs</hi> words in his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to plain Scripture-proof,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 302. <hi>And indeed if</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100457:14"/>
               <hi>all that is not contrary to Scripture customs, and that mans vain wit can find reasonable from Scripture, must be admitted, and that upon equal authority with Scripture, if they do but take it for a tradition Apostolical, Then</hi> 1. <hi>it will set mans wit a work to make God a worship, or judge of the currantness of it, according to his reason; and one man will think it reasonable and another not.</hi> 2. <hi>And what a multitude of Ceremonies will this admit into the Church, to the burthening of mens consciences, and the polluting of Gods worship? Is not this the door that the body of Popish trash came in at? and the Argument that hardneth them in it, and hindereth their reformation to this day? And if you open this Gap, what a multitude of fopperies will rush in?</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by this means the Gospel hath been shadow'd and repressed; no stint either hath been or could be put to the inundation of such impositions, as long as liberty hath been given under pretence of analogy with Jewish rites to add to the worship and discipline of the new Testament: but it hath happened according to <hi>Austins</hi> Complaint, <hi>Epist.</hi> 119. to <hi>Ianuarius,</hi> that the state of the Jewish Church under Divine precepts hath been more tolerable, than the Christian burdened with humane presumptions. <hi>Ames Bell. enerv. tom.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>th.</hi> 15. <hi>Romanenses in suis cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniis partim imitati sunt Gentes, partim Iudaeos. th.</hi> 17. <hi>Ceremoniae hujusmodi tollunt discrimen illud quod Deus voluit esse inter Iudaeos &amp; Christianos, quia paedagogiam Iudaicae si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milem habent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. If such Arguments from Analogy of Jewish rites abrogated may be valid to impose on mens consciences things about the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, then Popes and Prelates are not only unblamable and justifiable in so doing, but also Protestants and Non-conformists will be unjustifiable in no yielding to them, but opposing them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Church Divine warrant of Infant-bapt.</hi> pag. 49. in answer to these three latter reasons, speaks thus. <hi>Arguing from the Jewish types for the Substance of those shadowes, tends neither to an introducement of Judaism, nor yet to a justification of the Quisquilian toyes of the Papists: for it is neither arguing for the Ceremonies of the Jewish Church, nor for the fooleries of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Synagogue, but for privileges which the faithful may expect by Christ, of which those ceremoni's were prenunciative,</hi>

Which answer is either meerly impertinent, or else he conceives arguing from Circumcision for Baptism of infants to be arguing from the Jewish type for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the shadow.

Nor doth Mr. <hi>Church</hi> prove any thing that he saith, but vainly dictate, when he makes arguing for infant Baptism from Circumcision to be arguing for privileges which the faithful may expect by Christ, and makes Circumcision a ceremony prenunciative of infant Baptism; against which, and the whole way of arguing from the use of Jewish rites to Christian from analogy without other institution, I further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>

In the use of every Metaphor there is arguing. 2. Were it arguing, yet it is not to the purpose, sith it is not any arguing from the use of one rite to another by analogy, but from a rite to a moral duty, to wit, devotion and thanksgiving. And when he adds, <hi>And from sealing the promise by the initial Sacrament to infants of Gods people aforetime, may the sealing of the promise by the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Sacrament to infants of Christians in this Dispensation be rightly argued; sealing the promise, being the substance of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and benefit intended by it: and such arguing hath no colour of setting up Iudaism, for arguing for the thing signified tends not to the introducement of antiquated Ceremonies,</hi> he doth but write at random. For if the reason of his assertion be pettinent, then he must hold, that sealing the promise by the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Sacrament to infants of Christians in this Dispensation is the substance of circumcision and benefit intended by it. But it is either unintelligible to me in what sense the sealing of the promise by baptism to infants of Christians can be the substance of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, and the benefit intended by it, or else it is very absurd.</p>
            <p>For then it will plainly follow, 1. That till infantbaptism of Christians, Circumcision was without its substance, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit intended by it. 2. He makes infant baptism the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by circumcision, and the substance of circumcision, and so one ceremony signifies, and is the substance of another. But however we judge of his unintelligible or absurd arguing, it appears not by his answer but that the way of arguing by analogy from circumcision to baptism, that is from the regulating our practice in a rite of the New Testament by a rite of the Old, as obliging our consciences, may and doth introduce Judaism, and other evils, as was objected.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake answer to my Letter,</hi> pag. 97. seems to put by this arguing of mine, by <hi>advising me to read over</hi> Bellermine, <hi>and tell him then whether his arguments to lay the Sacraments of the Iews as low as types, and to extol the Sacraments of Christians as their antitypes, be not the self same that I and my party make use of to make so large a difference between circumcision and baptism. Protestants deny them indeed to be types, because they assirm they are in substance the same, our doctrine keeps us at a distance from</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>when you are in this reconciled to him,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100457:15"/>
               <hi>making the same differences as he doth between Circumcision and Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Had M. <hi>Blake</hi> directed me to the place in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he would have me seriously read over, I should have done it. But now not well knowing what place in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> he would have me read, and the reading him all over, and that seriously, being a very tedious task, I do not gratifie M. <hi>Blake</hi> in his request: But to what he saith, I reply, I put sundry differences between Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Baptism in my <hi>Examen, part</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 9. which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> his <hi>Defence</hi> doth not shew to be false. If they, or any other I make, be the same with <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> and yet true, Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly except against me for agreeing with <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> sure it is no matter of blame to agree with the Devil himself in the truth, it is no evill to believe <hi>there is one God,</hi> because <hi>the Devils do so, James</hi> 2. 19. But how this should reconcile me to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in that which I except against him, that he makes the Jews Sacraments Types of ours, is to me unintelligible. 2. Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> his words shew, that therefore he denied that Circumcision was the figure or type of Baptism, because <hi>a Sacrament is not a sign of a visible Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but of invisible grace, and that God hath not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed figures of figures, or types of types, but types of some body or substance.</hi> The reason M. <hi>Blake</hi> gives why they are not types, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are in substance the same,</hi> I know not what Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants do give, whoever they be that do say so, in my apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either they speak non-sense, or false. Sacraments being nothing but actions used to some ends, according to appointment, what substance they should have, but the actions and the use, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not. Now that the actions are not the same, it is manifest, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off a little skin, killing, roasting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eating a lamb, being not the same with washing the body with water, and breaking and eating bread, and drinking wine; and for their end and use it is certain, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may agree in some things, yet those being generals, and accompanied with more differences in their end and use both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular, it may be with greater reason denied, that they are the same in substance, than averred that they are: And argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the one to the other concerning their use, are from things unlike, as much as like, yea denied by the users to be types, figures or signs, the one of the other, and therefore cannot infer a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the thing questioned, without institution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100457:16"/>8. The ceremonies of the Jews are now not only mortal, but dead, buried, and deadly, according to the received Doctrine; yea, some condemn not only the use of them formally, but also materally; <hi>Rutherford Divine right of Church-Government, Introd. sect.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 8. saith, <hi>It is a false ground of the Prelates, that Circumcision, a Passeover Lamb, and all the Jewish ceremonies, though with another endand intention than to shadow forth Christ to come in the flesh, are indifferent.

            <p>9.

I do dispute against all such ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, not as brought to illustrate or confirm a thing otherwise proved from institution, but when they are brought to infer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institutions and commands obligatory of mens conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100457:17"/>
I had said <hi>Exam.</hi> part. 2. s. 8. pag. 29. To me it is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous principle upon which they go that so argue, to wit, that in meer positive things (such as Circumcision and Baptism are) we may frame an addition to Gods worship from analogy or resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance conceived by us between two ordinances, whereof one is quite taken away, without institution gathered by precept or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical example. Mr. <hi>Blake answer to my letter</hi> pag. 74 <hi>asks who those be?</hi> I told him that he did <hi>Birth-privilege</hi> pag. 15. (I should have said 14) and I mean those words, <hi>upon this ground (the Covenant) Infants under the Law were Circumcised, and upon the same ground Infants are now to be Baptized: by the grounds of both Circumcision and Baptism we inforce the Baptism of Infants: what is objected against one concludes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst both: Circumcision and Baptism are therefore by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle promiscuously taken; there being the same principal and main end of both.</hi> But he saith now <hi>Vindic. foederis</hi> pag. 373. <hi>In my whole discourse I did studiously avoid arguments drawn barely from analogy, so that we may see how willing Mr. T. is to quarrel, and how loath to speak truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There was nothing but truth and fair arguing in my <hi>Apology</hi> pag. 142. For though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> denies his argument to be barely from the analogy between Circumcision and Baptism, by which he hid inforce the Baptism of Infants, yet his arguing from the grounds of both, without institution gathered by precept, or Apostolical example, is barely from analogy. Analogy or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion I neither did imagine nor conceive Mr. <hi>B.</hi> made in the likeness, resemblance, or evenness in the ritual part of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision and Baptism, that is the cutting off the skin, or the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body, as if he did argue, Infants had a skin cut off, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Infants are to be washed with water: But the analogy I conceive made by him between them, is in the supposed parity of reason, taken from (as he calls them) the grounds of both, secluding institution, as my words shew, Examen pag. 29. and postscript pag. 142. now this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doth in the words cited, arguing from the Covenant, the same principal and main end of both, and thence dictating what is objected against one concludes against both, and asserting (though falsely) that Circumcision and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism are therefore by the Apostle promiscuously taken, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100457:17"/>
mentions not the distinct institution of Infant-baptism from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantcircumcision, but as if he counted them the same, yea as if he meant them all one, imposeth on the Apostle as if he took Baptism and Circumcision promiscuously: wherein he argues from bare analogy (if not identity) between them without institution. And therefore I do still charge him with arguing according to that principle, which he saith, <hi>is as dangerous to him as to me.</hi> But he hath yet another shift.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In case,</hi> saith he, <hi>I had by analogy with Circumcision made proof of Infants title to Baptism, it would not have freed him from calumny, seeing it is no addition to worship, Baptism is worship as Circumcision was, this is but a demonstration of the latitude and extent of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no calumny in it. For he adds to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship who doth make something worship of God, which he hath not appointed, as Non-Conformists did argue in their Negative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the Bishops Ceremonies from <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. and though the Conformists did allow some addition to Gods worship in indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ceremonies, yet they agreed that to make any such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as necessary binding the conscience, or part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, specially when it is in things determined by institution, was unlawful. Now God hath appointed expresly disciples or belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Christ to be baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. and no other, and this is his instituted worship; he then who baptizeth Infants who are not disciples or believers, and doth this as Gods worship, doth add to the worship having no institution gathered by precept or Apostolical example: nor doth he demonstrate, but devise a latitude and extent of the worship of his own head, or worships God after the precepts of men. As for the words, <hi>it is no addition to worship, Baptism i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> worship as Circumcision was,</hi> they seems to intimate, if there be any reason in them, than Infantbaptism is no addition to worship, because Baptism is worship as Circmcision was, which imports, that there could be no addition to worship in adding to Baptism, because it is worship as Circumcision was, whereas the reason is better to the contrary, that it being not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Infant baptism is addition to worship, because Baptism is worship as circumcision was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:100457:18"/>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> goes on. <hi>It runs in Mr.</hi> T. <hi>his head that we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to find not a Baptism-institution, but an Infant-baptism<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>institution, and that barely by analogy from Circumcision. This I confess were a wild undertaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Tis true, I did think Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in his <hi>Sermon</hi> pag. 44. when he said, <hi>Baptism was instituted long before</hi> (that command <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.) <hi>to be the seal of the Covenant,</hi> had sought its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17: and in his <hi>Defence</hi> I find not that which might take me off from that conceit. And it still runs in my head that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> must either find not onely a Baptism-institution, but also an Infant-baptism-institution, or else we must yield In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism a corruption of that ordinance, whether it be called will-worship, or profaning it, or what other sin that corruption be termed. As he that will acquit prayer to Saints, or for the dead, from corruption, must find not onely an institution of prayer, but also of prayer to Saints and for the dead; he that will acquit Infant-communion, Bell-baptism, &amp;c. from corruption, must find not onely an institution of the Communion and Baptism, but also of Infant-communion and Bell-baptism. I agree, that it were a wild undertaking to go about to find an institution of Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism, especially <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. because it is not to be found there, or in any other part of holy Scripture, and yet I think Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists do go about to find an institution of Infant-baptism, and that barely by analogy from Circumcision, as I shew before, and therefore by Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> own censure their attempt is <hi>a wild un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He addes. <hi>Neither I nor Mr.</hi> T. <hi>to help me, can find an Infant-circumcision-institution. If he instances</hi> Gen. 17. 12. <hi>He that is eight dayes old shall be circumcised among you, every man-child in your generations; I say that is no institution of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, but a subsequent directory for the particular day (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Paedagogy of those times) when the person was to be circumcised. The institution we find not with restriction to infancy, but in that latitude as to comprize males of any age, v.</hi> 10. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100457:18"/>
               <hi>and</hi> Tremellius, <hi>every male, as</hi> Anisworth <hi>reads it; If that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter directory had not followed, they might have circumcised (as we baptize) infants upon any day at our best conveniences. This is plain in the text, and may be further cleared; if the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self be with that limit of time to the eighth day, then it had been their sin (according to Mr.</hi> Tombs, <hi>the sin of will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship) in case that time through negligence had slipt, to have cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised them another day, as it was for a man unclean, or in a journey on the 14th day of the first moneth (the time appointed for the passeover) to observe it any other day, till God appointed the 14th day of the second moneth for such occasions,</hi> Num. 9. 6, 7, 8. <hi>But that they had their liberty by vertue of the institution to circumcise any other day, when that was over, is clear in the text, and may be farther made plain, that</hi> Abraham <hi>so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it by his circumcising of</hi> Ishmael <hi>at</hi> 13 <hi>years, which had been without warrant, had there been an institution only for children of eight dayes; when God was displeased at</hi> Moses <hi>his neglect of the Circumcision of his Son,</hi> Exod. 4. 24. <hi>yet he was pleased that he was after circumcised v.</hi> 26. <hi>So that as there was an institution in Old-Testament-times, for all males in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant without difference of age; so there is in New-Testament times an institution of Baptism for all in Covenant without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of age or sex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith, <hi>neither he nor I to help him can find an Infant-circumcision-institution,</hi> and yet he himself finds, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>an institution in that latitude, as to comprize males of any age:</hi> if there be an institution to circumcise males of any age, then there is an institution to circumcise male infants, who are of some age. And therefore it seems to me a wild speech of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to deny the finding of an institution of Infant-circumcision, when he himself sets down the institution of it within a few lines of those words. But he conceives <hi>it no institution of circumcision</hi> Gen. 12. 10. To which I say, Be it subsequent directory, or what ever else he will call it, Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> might easily perceive by my words, <hi>Examen</hi> pag. 28, 29. and elsewhere, I take the word institution for any appointment by precept, command or example approved, either express, or gathered by good consequence; if any of these wayes an institution of Infant-baptism can be shewed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100457:19"/>
out of the New Testament without the analogy of Circumcision, I should not make any doubt of it, and therefore it is but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary wrangling which he useth about the word [institution]. Let him shew any subsequent directory for Infant-baptism, as is for Infant-circumcision without the analogy of Circumcision<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I am satisfied. Yet to shew the vanity of his speeches and arguings I shall a little scanne them, <hi>He denies an institution of Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision,</hi> Gent. 17. 10. <hi>he saith, it is but asubsequent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory for the particular day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>Ausonius Popma de differ. verborum l.</hi> 3. <hi>Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes sunt praecepia, quibus docentur homines atque instituuntur.</hi> In this general acception a directory is an institution.

               </gap>ite, surely v. 12. not onely the particular day was appointed, but the person also, to wit, the Infant of eight dayes old among <hi>Abrahams</hi> people, and all the verses 10 11, 12, 13, 14. together are termed <hi>sanctio circumcisionis,</hi> by <hi>Pareus</hi> in his <hi>Commentary. But we find not the institution with restriction to Infancy,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi> Ans. True, nor did I ever say the institution was restrained to Infancy, or that there was an institution only for children of eight dayes, nor do I deny that the precept <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. was more general than that it should be restrained to the eighth day: yet v. 12. the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising of infants was limited to the eighth day. Mr. <hi>Cawdrey Sabb. rediv. part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 135. <hi>For some particular occasions of worship, God was pleased of old to determine some time exclusively, as the eighth day from the birth of a child for Circumcision, and the eighth day for the sacrificing of the firstling males of cattel, neither sooner nor later.</hi> Nor do there want those among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Divines, who make it unlawful to do it before or after but will-worship, except in cases of necessity, as in the wilderness, &amp;c. in which case the rule holds, <hi>God will have mercy and not sacrifice,</hi> and the thing might be done afterwards, as in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of those who were born in time of their travel in the wilderness. But to have altered the time of a mans own motion, without such necessity, had been will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as it was charged on <hi>Jeroboam</hi> 1 Kings 12. 33. <hi>that he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed in the moneth he had devised of his own heart.</hi> What Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith, <hi>there is in the New-Testament-times an insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of baptism for all in Covenant, without difference of age or sex,</hi> is false, except by being in Covenant he understand, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100457:19"/>

Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> adds. <hi>I instanced in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles argument from analogy for Ministers maintenance,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 9. 1 Tim. 5. 18. <hi>Mr.</hi> Tombs <hi>answers, The Apostle doth not by bare analogy conclude Ministers maintenance, but from the Lords ordinance; He does conlude it then (by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession) from analogy, though not barely from analogy. Neither have any one of Mr.</hi> Ts <hi>Antagonists concluded Infant baptism barely from analogy of Circumcision. There are other arguments which wait for his answer, so that this instance stands.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> My Confession was not, that the Apostle argued from any such analogy as Paedobaptists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Infants-baptism from, to wit, the<note place="margin">To Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10. for an equity of the Geremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law to prove Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Mr. <hi>Collings</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat p. 77. saith. The Apostle indeed 1 Cor. 9. 10. urgeth the equity of that piece of the Law, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I never took that for a piece of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, but for a piece of the Judicial Law.</note> rule of Circumcision, thus, <hi>Circumcision was appointed to Infants in Covenant, therefore Baptism is appointed to Infants in Covenant, they having the same main and principle end to seal the Covenant of grace</hi> (which is Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> own arguing) which is from a ceremonial rite of the Old Testament to a ceremonial rite of the New, without precept or example of Christ or his Apostles. For 1. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles argument 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9. seems not to me to be from analogy, but a testimony ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. So Mr. <hi>Dicson</hi> in his <hi>Com. Arg.</hi> 3. <hi>a testimonto legis de pabulo bovi trituranti dando: quod ostendit dictum esse in gratiam omnium laborantium in aliorum usum, potissimum in ministerio.

If it be from any analogy, it is in things that have a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of equity, and so it is in moral things, which are perpetual,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100457:20"/>
not in meer positive rites. 3. It is an analogy which the Apostle delivered to us, not analogy made by men not guided by an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spirit, as is the inference of Paedobaptism from Circumcision, and therefore is not of force to oblige mens consciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have shewed before that the Paedobaptists main argument is barely from such analogy, and for <hi>other arguments waiting for mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> either they are answered before sufficiently, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> God assisting, will have answer in this <hi>Review.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> arguments <hi>vindic. foede.</hi> ch. 43. sect. 1. require no longer answer. The first is the same with Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> second. And the Major is to be denied, if by [<hi>unless order be given to the contrary</hi>] be meant of order given to the contrary in formal positive terms, such as this, Thou shalt nor baptize Infants. If it be meant of order given to the contrary, either in express formal prohibitive terms, or equipollent, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is to be denied.</p>
            <p>In the second the Major is to be denyed, and in like manner the third, distinguishing the term [<hi>holy</hi>] In the fourth both the Major and the Minor, and so likewise the fifth, explaining the term [<hi>church privileges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>] In the sixth the Major is to be denyed if under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the invisible Kingdom of God only, if of the visible, the Minor is to be denyed: In the other two additionals, the Major if universal is to be denyed, and the Minor is true of infants of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers as well as believers.</p>
            <p>And for the last Argument the matter is as easily answered as the form. For the Major, <hi>Those that are to be saved are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Church by baptism,</hi> Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 47. is to be limited by the text v. 41. thus [<hi>when they willingly receive the word</hi>] If no lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger answer be given Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to these arguments, yet this will be enough to shew they are without much difficulty answerable. Mr. <hi>B</hi>s. proofs likewise, God assisting, shall have fuller answer than they deserve, though were it not for his own and others conceits of his writings for infant-baptism, I should think it lost time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it in an exact examination of his inconsiderable dictates.</p>
            <p>As for the present instance of M. <hi>B.</hi> of the Apostles arguing from analogy, he may see it now fallen, and so likewise the next, of which he speaks thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I instanced in the Apostles arguing</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17. <hi>he makes it good that partaking together of the Sacrament of the</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:100457:20"/>
               <hi>Lords Supper, we are made one Ecclesiastical body, by way of Analogy with the like in the sacrifices of the Jews, yea in the sacrifices of the Gentiles; to which Mr.</hi> T. <hi>saies, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to prove, that they which profess Christ may not partake of the things of Idols. From this general truth, that they which join in the service of any God, they hold Communion with that God, and are one with those that worship that God; this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle proves by instances in the Christian and Jewish services. So that this argument is from a genoral truth proved by induction of instances. Mr.</hi> T. <hi>mistakes, the Apostle takes no such general truth for granted, but affirms that we are one body at the Lords table, which he first proves by analogy in the instances mentioned, and then concludes thence against communion with Idols; That which the Apostle disputes he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies down, but we have not these words in the text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no mistake in my Analysis of the Apostles words. He had v. 14. warned them of Idolatry, to wit in going with the Infidels to their Idol feasts, and to make them more heedful of what he said he prefaceth, v. 19. And then argues: not thus, <hi>they that partake of the Lords Supper are made one Ecclesiastical body by way of analogy with the like in the sacrifices of the Jews, yea in the sacrifices of the Gentiles;</hi> For then the conclusion to be proved should be, we are one body Ecclesiastical at the Lords table, and the sacrifices of the Gentiles should be the <hi>medium</hi> to prove it, which had been ursi for such a proof, nor in any passage of the Apostle is used to that end. For how inept an Argument had this been, the Gentiles in their sacrifices had communion with the Idol, therefore they that partake of the Lords Supper are made one body Ecclesiastical? Nor would the proof be much otherwise if it were thus (as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> makes it) <hi>we are one body Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal who partake of the Lords Supper, therefore in Gentile sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices we communicate with Idols.</hi> And me thinks there is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in this proof, by the Gentiles sacrifices to prove we are one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Ecclesiastical in the Lords Supper, and thence to prove we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with Idols in Gentile sacrifices. But the scope of the Apostle appears by the words, v. 14. and v. 19, 20, 21. evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the disswading them from the Idol-feasts on their sacrifices, because they had therein fellowship with the Idol, did partake of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100457:21"/>
its cup and table, and so with Devils v. 20, 21. which had been an argument in concludent, were it not thus made, To have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the Idol is evil to be avoided by Christians, as being Communion with Devils. But to partake of the thing offered to Idols is to have fellowship with the Idol. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Minor, which alone is proved, rests on this general maxim, They have fellowship with a true or supposed Deity, who partake of his service, and this the Apostle proves to be true by the instances of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and the Israelites, v. 16, 17, 18. I know sundry Protestant Expositors make the argument to be thus, Ye may not partake of the Idol banquets, because ye are partakers of the Lords supper. But I conceive this not right: For v. 16, 17. the Apostles <hi>medium</hi> is not from the matter of fact what they did, or duty what they were to do, but from the tendence of their action in common constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and interpretation of the end and use of such actions, which did shew they had Communion in the body of Christ. Which is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved from v. 18. where the Apostle allegeth the Israelites par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of their altar to the same purpose to which he had used the former, v. 16, 17. now the Christians neither did nor were to partake then of the Jewish altar, and it is not a reason from their fact or duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but onely from that wherein Christians breaking bread, Jews and Gentiles eating of their sacrifices did agree, that these actions testified their fellowship with that Lord for whom these services were performed. And therefore by <hi>Piscator, Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and others, the argument is thus framed, <hi>Israelites by eating of the sacrifices testified they were professors and partakers of the Jewish religion, therefore they that eat of Idol sacrifices, they testify that they Communicate with Idolaters in their idolatry:</hi> Yea Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself in his <hi>answer to my Letter</hi> pag. 74. doth plainly acknowledge the Apostles argument to be from a general maxim common to all religious service, when he saith, <hi>yea he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes it good</hi> (that which he concluded before) <hi>in the words following, even from the Heathen, it is of the nature of religious worship, whether true or false, to make those of one body (as I may say) religious that partake of them.</hi> Whence it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that it is not an argument to prove any duty in a Christian rite of the New Testament from the ceremonial law, sith it is by his own confession even from the Gentiles sactifices, which sure by analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100457:21"/>
or resemblance being altogether forbidden, cannot make us a rule in Christian meer positive worship, and therefore there is no such argument in the Apostles speech from analogy, as I opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gn.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> yet adds. <hi>I instanced in Christs defence of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from the charge of the Pharisees,</hi> Mat. 12. 3, 4. <hi>by analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and proportion of the like in</hi> David. <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>answers, that is only an instance to prove that sacrifice must give place to mercy, a ceremonial to a moral duty, not an argument from meer ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy or resemblance of things different. He proves that truth then by analogy, if not by meer analogy, and he tells us of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that is joined to help it out, and make it an argument compleat. To these, abundance more might be added.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is enough to shew this instance impertinent, in that it is not from such analogy as is used to prove Infant-baptism by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-circumcision; Thus it was in a rite in the old Testament upon this ground, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it must be so in a rite of the New Testament, because the same pretended ground remains other than Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or institution: which I called meer analogy in meer posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives without a distinct command about each rite. As for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position it was right, that Christ allegeth <hi>Davids</hi> fact as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that ceremonials give place to morals, and sacrifice to mercy, as appears by v. 7. And hence in giving rules about ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Decalogue usually from this passage a rule is drawn, that ceremonials give place to morals, sacrifice to mercy. Sure I am, neither here, nor any where else in Scripture is there found such an argument as this, Thus it was in a ceremony of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, therfore thus is must be in a rite or ceremony of the New Testament.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> proceeds thus. <hi>Vpon Mr.</hi> T. <hi>his desire of rules how farre we may go in this parity of reason, and himself allowing this way of reasoning in morals, which in many cases might be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly usefull and very helpful in this particular; he is yet silent, we may then keep our way of reasoning without rules, as well as he his; I yet gave in mine, which he epitomizes, and gives in to the Reader by the halves. To whom in the first place I might apply that of the Poet,</hi> Carpere vel noli nostra, vel ede tua.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There was no reason I should set down rules about rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning from analogy in morals, how usefull soever they might be. For 1. though I said in my <hi>Examen</hi> pag. 28. for that which is natural or moral in worship an institution or command in the old
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100457:22"/>
Testament is allowed as obligatory to Christians, yet I did not say, that in morals a man may reason as Paedobaptists reason in cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials, This was a duty or sin in the Old Testament, therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing is a duty or sin in the New Testament (which was not in the old also) by imagined parity of reason, as my words <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script</hi> sect. 17. import. 2 Neither is it necessary to set down any other rules than what either Logicians set down in the Topicks about arguments <hi>à comparatis,</hi> or Divines give in the expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Decalogue. 3. If any more were requisite, yet it would have been to draw me into a dispute on the by, to fall on that point in that place. 4. If it had been fit for me to do it, yet at that time I had no leisure, the <hi>Postscript</hi> being written when my <hi>Apology</hi> was almost printed, as I say in the <hi>Postscript</hi> sect. 1. which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a reason why I did not set down all his words about his rules in my <hi>Postscript</hi> sect. 17. which he calls <hi>epitomizing of them, and giving in to the Reader by halves,</hi> when the rules were as fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by me as himself, and only the applications and amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions omitted, nor doth he shew wherein I have omitted any thing of the strength of them. But whereas Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith, <hi>he may keep up his way of reasoning without rules, as well as I mine,</hi> he doth untruly suggest that I keep up any way of reasoning without rules; my way of reasoning is such as the Apostle used 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. and best Divines court certain, to take that onely as of Gods appointment in meer positive ceremonies of the New Testament, which is gathered by Christ or the Apostles, precept or example, in the New Testament. <hi>Pareus Comment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

this conceived reason, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it must be in like sort in another ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of the new Testament, which is conceived to have in part the same use, if he kept it up, it will condemn the reformation of many Popish and Prelatical ceremonies, and justifie the retaining of them.</p>
            <p>The thing I required in my <hi>Examen</hi> pag. 29. was this, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire any learned man to set me down a rule from Gods Word, how far I may go in my conceived parity of reason, equity or analogy (to wit, in meer positive things to frame an addition to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship from analogy or resemblance conceived by us between two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, whereof one is taken away, without any institution ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by precept or Apostolical example) and where I must stay; when it will be superstition and wil-worship, when not, when my conscience may be satisfied, when not.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake, Vindic. foed.</hi> pag. 375. saies of me. <hi>Take them as he layes them down Apolog. pag.</hi> 142. 1. <hi>When parity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or analogy doth not institute any piece of worship, or the least part of the service of God, but onely help to a right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the nature, use and extent of that which is instituted.</hi> 2. <hi>When in our reasoning from analogy for the right understanding of any institution or ordinance, we do not rest solely on the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy with other commands, but have our further reason for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> 3. <hi>When the analogy holds full proportion in that for which it is brought, so that nothing can fairly be brought against the one, but may be also concluded against the other. Against these rules he takes three exceptions,</hi> 1. <hi>That never a one of these rules is brought out of Gods Word, for there is neither declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such rule, nor example to prove it. The first rule I thus illustrated,</hi> Ainsw. pag. 76. <hi>You find nothing in Scripture for excommunication of women, yet we find in the old Testament</hi> Miriam <hi>shut out of the Camp,</hi> Num. 12. 14. <hi>and in all penalties for transgression, in Scriptures we find no regard had of distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sex, and by consequence it is not to be denied, that women of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending are within this censure. Mr.</hi> T. <hi>magisterially answers, The proving of excommunicating of women from</hi> Miriams <hi>shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the Camp,</hi> Num. 12. 14. <hi>is not a Scripture Collection, but a meer device of men. If there be no such thing as excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in the New Testament (as Mr.</hi> T. <hi>saies</hi> pag. 92. <hi>and</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100457:23"/>
               <hi>unsaies</hi> pag. 93.) <hi>then I confess what he saies, but if there be such an institution (which here is not a time to examine, as I am sure there is of Baptism) then it may be evinced from that place that it reacheth to both sexes. Mr.</hi> T. <hi>would have us to proceed by alterable rules of prudence. This prudence as may be inferred, is to reach to both sexes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> My answer notwithstanding this reply stands good. For 1. He brings not any declaration or example where the Holy Ghost argues thus, Excommunication extends to women, because <hi>Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> was shut out of the Camp, <hi>Num.</hi> 12. 14. It is true, the Anti-Erastians, as <hi>Rutherfurd Divine right of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> c. 7. q. 3. attempt to prove that separating from the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation for leprosie typified Christian excommunication, and thence Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> would prove Excommunication of women. But neither is any other than an humane device, it cannot be proved, that onely scandalous sin answers to leprosie; original sin or sins of thoughts may as well be conceived to be signified by it, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from the congregation may as well typifie exclusion from heaven, as removal from the visible Church, yea more agreeable to the end, sith putting out of the Camp was not for amendment as excommunication was. That excommunication which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the New Testament mentions as belonging to Christians, I grant is to be of women as well as men, but we need not run to the Old Testament to prove it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 6. 14. 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3. 5. prove it. If that <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 20, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to excommunication, a woman is in express terms made lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it. I agree with Mr. <hi>Blake, In all penalties for transgression in Scripture we find no regard had of distinction of sexe, and by consequence it is not to be denied, that women offending are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this censure:</hi> so that by his own grant we need not run to ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy from ejecting the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dical Excommunication of superious from social, granting this latter, though demurring about the former. I have shewed my meaning plainly in the <hi>Addition of my Apology</hi> sect. 17. 19. in my letter to Mr. <hi>Robert Baillee of Scotland;</hi> what Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> holds in this point I cannot well tell. Some conference I had with him in <hi>London</hi> made me doubtful whether he were not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100457:23"/>
of <hi>Erastus</hi> his judgement in this point; here he doth not say there is an institution of Excommunication as he is sure there is of Baptism. But I deny <hi>if there be an institution of excommunition that it may be evinced from</hi> Num. 12. 14. <hi>that it reacheth both sexes,</hi> much less that any precept may be thence gathered as oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christians in the use of excommunication: If there were a rule thence obliging, it would follow that excommunication is to be but seven dayes, and then the excommunicate to be received in again. What I said of ordering things by alterable rules of prudence is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely meant of things concerning which we have not precise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from Gods Word, which I suppose Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be true, though he is pleased to mention it, as if it were mine and not his tenent.</p>
            <p>He saith further. <hi>I brought an instance not for a proof of it self, but illustration of another proof from Divines arguing against non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>residence from</hi> Ezek. 44. 8. <hi>This (he saies) is good after other arguments, but of it self is not convincing. Such arguments then are of validity when aright placed and marshalled orderly, I hope this of mine then is of force, it is not in the van but brings up the rear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What I acknowledged, that the argument was good after other arguments, I mean to illustrate, not to prove, nor would I deny an argument from Circumcision of infants good to illustrate Baptism of infants, if it were before proved from precept or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical example, manifested in express assertion, or deduced by good consequences. But the most of Paedobaptists make the argument from Circumcision their <hi>Achilles,</hi> and by their texts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a <hi>Committee</hi> of them, it was the main, if not the onely argument in the <hi>Assembly.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bs</hi> arguments he puts in the van are no better, as is briefly shewed, <hi>Postscript,</hi> sect. 2. &amp;c. Yet for the text <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 8. upon better consideration it seems not fit to illustrate a proof against nonresidence, sith the sin there charged was not leaving the Temple themselves, but admitting at the will of the Prince o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> to be in Gods sanctuary, <hi>Num.</hi> 18. 4. yea even the uncircumcised, and thereby Gods holy things were profaned, and idolatry brought in. And therefore the observation of the <hi>New Annot.</hi> of the second edition is, <hi>that unlawful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, false in doctrine, soul in life, are not to be admitted but ejected.</hi> But for Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> rule, there is no one text brought out
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100457:24"/>
of Gods Word to prove it, that we may argue from analogy, so as to infer a duty from an use in meer positive worship of the Old Testament now abolished in the use of a rite of the New, without any other precept in the New Testament, <hi>when we do not institute thence any piece of worship, or the least part of the service of God, but onely make it a help to a right understanding of the nature, use and extent of that which is instituted.</hi> Yea this rule seems to me to speak inconsistencies, For he supposeth that <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy may not institute any piece of worship, or the least part of the service of God,</hi> yet allows direction from analogy in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, extent and use of that which is instituted; whereas the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, use and extent being the chief part, or the very service it self, and are determined in the institution <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. if we may take direction from our conceived analogy in them, we may not onely institute a piece of worship, or the least part of the service of God (which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> denies) but also the main part, yea the very service itself, which hath no greater parts than the nature, use and extent. So that Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> first rule, denying the use of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy in the least part of Gods service, yet allowing it in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, use and extent of that which is instituted, is but a rule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying in one part, what is built up in the other.</p>
            <p>He adds further. <hi>The second and third rules he saies are not set down from any declaration or example in the Scripture. I desire him at his leisure to look again, and he may see the second rule confirmed from the Apostles way of thus arguing,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. <hi>and the Lord Christs</hi> Mat. 12. <hi>The third is confirmed by that reasoning of Christ with the Pharisees before mentioned, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with our reasoning with Antipaedobaptists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I have looked again, and I say still these are imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently alleged by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as being not one of them from such ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> maintaines and I deny, as I have before shewed, and for Antipaedobaptists reasonings, they are the fairest that can be, keeping close to the confessed institution of Christ, and practice of the Apostles, and there is this objection which is fairly brought against Infant-baptism, that there is no command or example for it in Scripture, which cannot be brought against Infant circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, and for the hypotheses of Paedobaptists from the Covenant, seal, succession to circumcision, &amp;c. there is not one of them true,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100457:24"/>
as God willing shall be shewed in the process of this <hi>Review.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> goes on, <hi>His second exception is, These are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. For no reason is given, why they may not make a new worship, who may by their analogy extend it beyond the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the New Testament. This very well answers Mr.</hi> T. <hi>his ingenuity, to which I may reply by way of retortion, why may not Mr.</hi> T. <hi>as well deny an institution and destroy it, as well as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail that which is instituted? we shall be able to make it good, that he curtails Christs institution in the New Testament, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off many Churchmembers in Covenant; he shall never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prove that we extend it by analogy or otherwise beyond the institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That exception of mine did very well agree with inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and it might have stood better with Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> ingenuity, to have taken the exception as sufficient to invalidate his rule, than to have made this taunting reply. The answer had no fault, but that it was a little more modest than might have stood with truth. For 1. I might have said truly, not onely that no reason is given, but also that no reason can be given, why they may not make a new worship, who may by their analogy extend it beyond the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the New Testament. For their analogy being a meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention, if they have authority to enlarge the ordinance, they have authority to make a new worship; the Papists if they have authority to appoint Baptizing of bells, they have authority to appoint the Sign of the Cross, for the same end for which baptism was; the same authority which serves for the one, serves for the other. Yea, if the analogy direct in the nature, use and extent of an instituted worship, what doth it else but make a new worship? And that it may be seen how dangerous it is to follow Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> rule, I would have it considered how we shall avoid justifying the Popish mass, if we stick to it. He allows analogy in the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the nature or use of an instituted worship, the Lords Supper is an instituted worship, and it is conceived it succeeds the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as Baptism Circumcision; if then by the analogy of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision we may gather the use of Baptism, we may in like manner from the analogy of the Passeover, gather the use of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. It is certain from he Apostles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>For Christ our Passeover is sacrificed for us,</hi> that the Passeover was a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100457:25"/>
and such a sacrifice as resembled Christ, and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then by analogy the use of the Lords Supper is so too, which is the chief point whereby the popish mass is established. The very self same rule will prove the Ministers of the Gospel, who succeed the Priests of the Law, and by analogy from whom, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> the Apostle reasoneth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13, 14, will be proved sacrificing Priests, if as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith, analogy may direct us in the use of an instituted ordinance. 2. I say Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth by his analogy according to his first rule, allow the making a new worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the worship is not the same, but a new wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, when though the same element be used, yet the nature, use and extent of is otherwise than the institution, as though the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees used water according to the tradition of the Elders, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. which is the element used in Baptism, yet their washing their hands was another worship than Christian Baptism, because the nature, use and extent of it, was other than the institution of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism: So likewise though water be retained in their so called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism, yet it being neither used in the manner appointed by Christ, to wit, by dipping, but by sprinkling or powring, nor on the subject appointed by Christ to be baptized, to wit, disciples or believers in him, but on Infants, who are not such, nor to the end Christ appointed, that is, to testifie by that act their owning Christ for their Lord, their dying to sin, and rising to newness of life, but onely to seal the Covenant of Grace, I say a new worship is made in their Infant-watering, as there was of old a new worship made in Infant-communion, and is at this day in the Popish mass, and Baptizing of bells. As for Mr. <hi>Blaks</hi> retortion, I do grant Mr. <hi>T.</hi> may as well deny an institution, and destroy as well as curtail that which is instituted. But that by denying Infants visible Churchmembership in the Christian Church of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their being in Covenant, and right thereby to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, I curtail Christs institution, I do then expect he will be able to make good, when he proves the snow black and the crow white. And whether I prove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by analogy or some other way Baptism is extended beyond the institution in Infant-baptism, I leave it to the Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> goes on thus. <hi>The second rule</hi> (he saies) <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws all, for if we may not rest solely on the analogy, why at all?</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:100457:25"/>
               <hi>How then is that collection from</hi> Ezek. 44. 8. <hi>good, after other arguments against non-residence? neither do I say, that it may not go alone, but it will hardly go alone, but other arguments will be found to second it, in which I also gave instances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The collection from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 8. is good to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, not to rest on as a proof, yet with the correction of my speech as above. 2. I did not charge him that he said <hi>it may not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> nor is it to the purpose which he tells us that he said <hi>analogy will hardly go alone.</hi> But this I say, His second rule is <hi>that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning from analogy holds when we do not rest solely on the analogy with other commands, but have our further reason for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which doth plainly intimate that we may not rest solely on it. Now I argue, if it be a good proof, we may rest solely on it; For one good proof is enough for a man to rest upon, though more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments make it clearer. If then we may not rest solely on ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with other commands (as Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> words intimate) then it is not a sufficient proof. To which in Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> words there is no reply, nor hath he avoided my objection that his second rule overthrows what he contends for, the validity of his analogical ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments impugned by me.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> of me. <hi>He adds, this is enough to shew that ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy hath no strength, that indeed it doth not onely illustrate, connot prove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is an argument by analogy, but an argument</hi> à simili? <hi>I had thought there had been much difference between these two kinds of arguments</hi> à pari &amp; à simili; pari à similibus omninò differunt, <hi>saith</hi> Scheibler <hi>in his Topicks. I may send him to his Dictionary to see whether one be not Englished equal or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the other like or semblable. I may send him to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments whether one be not in Quantity, the other in Quality, and demand of him whether there be</hi> magis &amp; minus par &amp; aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, <hi>as there is</hi> magis &amp; minus simile? <hi>And to con ult with the Topicks whether that be not one head from which they draw ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which in their judgement are valid: Hath Mr.</hi> T. <hi>never read</hi> de paribus idem est judicium? quod valet in re pari valet etiam in compari. <hi>I think he never read</hi> de similibus idem est judicium: quod valet in simili valet etiam in re assimilata. <hi>If Mr.</hi> T. <hi>be agreed we will referre it to the Common Law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this way of reasoning will hold or no; if it fail, we shall need</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:100457:26"/>
               <hi>no other Levellers to take down that art, it will fall of it self, they have scarce any other way of arguing. But if these onely illustrate (which I think no Logician will say) yet it is here sufficient, There was an institution of Circumcision and there is of Baptism; neither of these needs proof being not in controversie between us and our adversaries. The right subject of Baptism onely is enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after; the institution hath Infants we say within the verge, and are not excluded from it; For this we have our arguments which from the initiating sacrament of the Iews we onely illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It seems Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> thought he had me here at a lift, and therefore after a message from him by words of mouth some years since, intimating he took my speech to be absurd, that an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from analogy is but an argument <hi>à simili,</hi> he bestirs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in this manner in this his book. But to stop him in his carreer. He tells me <hi>he had thought there had been much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two kinds of arguments</hi> à pari &amp; simili: which may be true, and yet my speech true also, what is an argument by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy (I did not say <hi>à pari</hi>) but an argument <hi>à simili?</hi> He tells me, <hi>paria à similibus omninò differunt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> saith <hi>Scheibler</hi> in his To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, <hi>Scheibler Top.</hi> c. 23. q. 2. saith so, But withal he tells us, that <hi>Titelman</hi> comprehends <hi>paria sub si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milibus, &amp; Hunuaeus, similium &amp; parium aut nullum aut per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenue discrimen esse ait, id<expan>

And me thinks his words she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> there is no

strength in it, when he saith. <hi>The institution of Baptism hath infants within the verge, and are not excluded from it; For this we have our arguments, which from the initiating sacrament of the Jews we onely illustrate.</hi> If other Paedobaptists would stand to this, we should be less cumbred with the argument from the Covenant and seal, which was Mr. <hi>Marshals</hi> and the <hi>Assemblies</hi> main if not onely argument. However the Reader may here take notice that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> confesses <hi>that he with others do onely illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate their arguments for Paedobaptism by the argument from the initiating sacrament of the Jews:</hi> which may move the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate Reader to regard little that argument, and to look for other arguments from the institution comprehending infants, which have and will appear frivolous, as his exception here against me hath been.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> yet adds. <hi>The third likewise saith he, is uncertain and vain; For how shall we know when the analogy holds full proportion? when nothing can be fairly brought against the one, but may be also concluded on the other? when is the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion full? if onely when</hi> omnia sunt paria. <hi>When Mr.</hi> T. <hi>will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy our old Logick to set up his own Divinity, it were to be wisht that he would furnish us with a new piece of Logick as he hath done of Divinity, that all learning humane and divine may stoop to his reformation. I have learnt these for maximes.</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium exacta est convenientia. Quod de uno parium affirmatur id affirmatur etiam de altero &amp; e contra. <hi>But these with Mr.</hi> T. <hi>are vain and uncertain, and all arguments that dance not after his pipe, though our Saviors, St.</hi> Pauls, <hi>or any others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There is nothing here but flirts and flams. Neither do I destroy old Logick, nor set up any other than what I have from the Scripture, yea and the best approved writers: nor need I any new Logick to help me in the reformation of Infant baptism, but such as Protestant Divines have used in reformation of Popish and Prelatical ceremonies. I do not say the maximes of Logick Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> here sets down are vain and uncertain, and all arguments that dance not after my pipe. But this I say, Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> rule about arguing from analogy conceived between Circumcision and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, or any other Old and New Testament rites, so as without precept or Apostolical example in the New Testament to frame an
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100457:27"/>
obligation on our consciences is vain, and uncertain, nor doth our Savior, or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other sacred writer argue so, as in my answer above may be seen.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake, This can never happen</hi> (<hi>saith Mr.</hi> T.) <hi>in analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies between the rites of</hi> Moses <hi>and the rites of Christ. How did</hi> Paul <hi>then reason from a parity in the Jewish altar and the Lords table,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17. <hi>Yea from</hi> manna <hi>and the rock to the Lords Table? as</hi> Pareus <hi>and other interpreters observe, that spiritual meat was eaten in the one and in the other, and a like danger of prophaning the one and the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I said true, it can never happen in analogies between the rites of <hi>Moses</hi> and the rites of Christ that all things should be even, or that there should be an exact agreement between them, so, as that which is affirmed of the one should be affirmed of the other, or that there should be the same reason in the use of the one as in the other, and thence inferred, what ought to be done in the one ought to be done in the other, they who are to partake of the one are to partake of the other. This is enough to overthrow the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed parity between Circumcision and Baptism as inferring Infant baptism, that they agree not in this, that the institution of Baptism extendeth it to all those to whom the institution of Circumcision extends it. It is not true that <hi>Paul</hi> did reason 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 16, 17. from such a parity in the Jewish altar and the Lords table, as if what was done at the one, must be done at the other by reason of an answerableness in the one rite to the other. But he argues from that which is common to both, and to all other Religions whether true or false, that they which did partake either of them did thereby profess the same Religion, to prove that they which should eat of the Idol meats had communion with the Idol, and so with the Devil. It is not true that the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3, 4. argues from <hi>manna</hi> and the rock to the Lords Table, as if he would prove that spiritual meat was eaten in the one, therefore in the other, or that it was dangerous to profane the one (for what danger was there in profaning the cloud, Sea, <hi>manna,</hi> or water out of the rock?) therefore there is the like danger of profaning the other, much less what was done in the one was to be done in the other by reason of analogy between them: But the Apostles argument is manifestly this, the Israelites being under
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100457:28"/>
the cloud, and passing through the Sea, was to them as Baptism to us, their eating <hi>manna</hi> and drinking water from the rock noted Christ as well as the Lords supper to us, and yet this could not save them from Gods displeasure when they sinned, therefore our sacraments will not shelter us from Gods wrath if we sin, which v. 6. 11. 12. of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. manifestly shew to be the force of the Apostles reasoning.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> adds. <hi>If when there is a parity in many things, it will be (saith he) uncertain how many parities will serve turn to make the proportion full. Here is an excellent dexterity to ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate so many Scripture arguments, that the weakness of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (in spight of all Logick) might appear; I have told him, and may tell him still, The</hi> Corinthians <hi>and the Pharisees wanted his head-piece, otherwise Christ and</hi> Paul <hi>had not gone so away with arguments of this nature. To satisfie him therefore fully, one parity will serve the turn. The exact proportion, say Logicians, is</hi> in quantum paria respectu tertii in quo paria com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantur. <hi>There are many imparities between the Lords supper and</hi> manna, <hi>yet they agree in this that both were spiritual meat; so between the Jewish altar and the Lords Table, but they agree, in this, that there is Ecclesiastical communion in both of them, to make the partakers of one body Ecclesiastical: many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between Circumcision and Baptism, but so farre they agree (by Mr.</hi> T. <hi>his confession) that both are initiating sacraments; he hath multiplied many differences, but stands not to any as in application to this particular in difference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There is in my answer nothing tending to enervate any Scripture argument, though what I say is enough to shew the vanity of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> arguments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there being no certain rule to shew how many or what sort of parities, general or special, essential or accidental will serve turn. Neither <hi>Paul</hi> nor Christ did argue thus, this was appointed in a rite of the Old Testament, therefore thus it is to be observed in a rite of the New. In Logick it is usuall to deny an argument valid <hi>à comparatis,</hi> though there be some parities, <hi>caeteris non paribus.</hi> It is true one parity will serve turn to make things compared even in the thing in which they agree. But there must be so many parities, or such a parity in things compared as make them equall in the reason of the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100457:28"/>
otherwise one disparity proper to the matter is enough to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervate the argument. Which is very manifest in the argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Infant baptism. For the formal reason of Circumcising In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being the command, there is no parity to infer thence Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants without the parity of command. Which is the difference I have often stood to in application to this particular in difference; which is not whether Baptism and Circumcision be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiating sacraments, but whether an argument can be drawn to bind conscience in the use of the one from a command, in the use of the other without a precept in the New Testament.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> concludes this section thus: <hi>The third exception is, It is uncertain whether these rules be sufficient, whether there be no need of any more. It is certain then that Mr.</hi> T. <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it appear that they are insufficient, in case he could he would not have left them at any uncertainty: I shall judge them sufficient till I hear from Mr.</hi> T. <hi>the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I have made it appear that these rules are not sufficient to make good the proof from analogy disproved by me: nor was it formerly uncertain to me they are not sufficient; yet I might say truly, it is uncertain, whether these rules be sufficient, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be no need of any more to satisfie others, who may think them too few as well as otherwise imperfect. I for my part do judge them notwithstanding Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> plea to be insufficient, and all arguments inferring duty as of Gods appointment in the use of a rite of the New Testament from some likeness or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a rite of the Old Testament now abolished, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the New, as frivolous and serving onely to make wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, fill people with superstitions, and to weary Scholars, as I say in the <hi>Addition</hi> to my <hi>Apology</hi> in answer to Mr. <hi>Baillee</hi> sect. 15. Mr. <hi>Cawdrey Sabb. rediv. part.</hi> 4. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. against Dr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson,</hi> saying <hi>Divine right or institution is that First which is properly and primarily such; as what is (first) enjoined by express ordinance of God, or (secondly) what may be deduced therefrom by evident illation. Secondly that which is secondarily and consequently such. To which four things (say they) are required,</hi> 1. <hi>equity,</hi> 2. <hi>analogy,</hi> 3. <hi>insinuations in the new Testament,</hi> 4. <hi>continued practice of the Church,</hi> speaks thus. <hi>But this proceeding seems not sufficient.</hi> 3. <hi>There are things now in common use which have all the four conditions, and yet he will</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:100457:29"/>
               <hi>not say they are Divine institutions; as the observation of Easter &amp;c: which yet are confessedly but Ecclesiasticall.</hi> And will Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> make a Divine institution of Infant baprism which in the next page he saith <hi>we have no express command (nor express example of it) in Scripture,</hi> from grounds which at most can make but analogy without equity (for in meer positive rites there is no equity but the appointers will) insinuations in the New Testament or any truly wel proved continued practice of the Church? However Mr. <hi>Cawdreys</hi> words are sufficient to shew (though they oppose himself) that he counted analogy not sufficient, no not though accompanied with equity, insinuations in the New Testament and continued practice of the Church to make a thing of Divine institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but only Ecclesiastical. Which being granted, Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals analogical argument</hi> (as he calls it) which with him the words of the <hi>Assembly</hi> intimate to be the chief prop of the Divine institution of Infant baptism, falls to the ground. But lets hear what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What need</hi> (saith Mr <hi>B.</hi>) <hi>the same thing to be done twice, except men had questioned the authority of the old?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Holy Ghost hath delivered many things twice in the Old and New Testament, yet sure it was needful, else it is not likely it would have been done. Will Mr. <hi>B.</hi> charge the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God with needless committing so many histories, sayings of Christ &amp;c. to writing, because they were written before? And to his question I say, If there were no other need, yet there was this, that the agreement of the Old and New Testament might appear, whereby the authority of both is greatly confirmed.</p>
            <p>The whole <hi>Scripture</hi> saith he, <hi>is the perfect Word and Law of God: and if he should reveal all his mind in one part, what use should we make of the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Gospels of the four Evangelists are the perfect Word and Law of God, they need no unwritten tradition for a supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in them those things are written by which we may have life, <hi>John</hi> 20. 31. yet there is use of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles. Suppose all Gods mind revealed in one part, so as no more doctrine or truth were in the rest than in one, yet there is use to confirm, explain, inforce that which is elsewhere written in that one part. And indeed this reasoning of his would prove that book or part of Scripture to be of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100457:29"/>
no use, as suppose <hi>Marks</hi> Gospel, which is counted an a bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another, or so much of that Gospel as reveals no more of Gods mind than another doth: which me thinks Mr. <hi>B.</hi> on bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consideration should disclaim.</p>
            <p>He goes on. <hi>How silent is the New Testament concerning a Christian Magistracy? which made the Anabaptists of old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it. Where find you a Christian in the New Testament that exercised the place of a king, a Parliament man, or Justice of Peace, or the like? so of an oath before a Magistrate, of war, of the Sabbath, &amp;c. how sparing is the new Testament? and why? but because there was enough said of them in the old? This also is the very case in the question in hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Anabaptists (as they are called) of former times, or some of them, as it is reported (for their own books I never saw) of them, denied it lawful for Christians to be Magistrates, to war, to swear, not onely because of the silence thereof in the New Testament, but also because they mistook the meaning of the texts, as forbidding them <hi>Is.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 36. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34, 35. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25, 26. &amp;c. And so either did or seemed to do some of the Antient Christians, even those who are called the Fathers, of which may be seen <hi>Sixtus Senensis Biblioth. sanct. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>annot.</hi> 25, 26. And yet learned men do not think the New Testament silent of a Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, of an oath, or war, but that there are texts for them in the New Testament, of which some are brought by <hi>Grot. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Iure Belli. ac Pacis c.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. &amp;c. And though there be no example of a Christian King, Parliament man, or Justice of Peace, yet we find a Christian Centurion <hi>Act.</hi> 10. a Christian Deputy <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 12. Christian parents, husbands, masters, whose government is allowed, and rules given about the managing of it. Wherefore I conceive Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doth too much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray Christian Magistracy, souldiery, civil judicature, &amp;c. who suggests to his Reader, as if the New Testament were silent of Christian Magistracy, and sparing about war, or oaths before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. I confess the determination of the Old Testament is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, because these things are moral, not peculiar to the Jews: but it doth not follow therefore that an argument is valid from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy conceived between rites of the old Testament and the new,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100457:30"/>
or the Jewish policy and the Christian to conclude an obligation to us in a rite of the New Testament, the rites of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being meerly positive, not from the beginning proper to the Jews, and together with the policy of the Jewish Church now abrogated.</p>
            <p>But there seems to be more difficulty about the Sabbath. Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> had said in his <hi>Sermon, that all that reject the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants do and must upon the same grounds reject the religious observation of the Lords day.</hi> In my <hi>Examen</hi> part. 2. sect. 8. I denied it, there being something moral from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Sabbath, not so in Circumcision, and there being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the new Testament to prove an institution of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> nothing about infant baptism, To this Mr. <hi>M.</hi> replies, <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the determinate day doth depend wholly upon institution, therefore they who reject that which depends upon positive insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, unless its institution can be expresly found in the New Testament, are as much at a loss for the Lords day as for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of infants.</hi> 2. <hi>And the advantage is here for infant baptism above the Lords day, because in the proof of infant baptism there is only need to shew the subject to whom baptism is to be applyed, in the Lords day the institution of the day it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That which he saies first confirms my exception; for therein he acknowledgeth there is something natural or moral by institution about a Sabbath, but shews nothing natural or moral in Circumcision.</p>
            <p>2. I never rejected infant baptism because its institution cannot be expresly in so many words or syllables without consequence found in the New Testament, but because it is not there either in express words, or by good consequence.</p>
            <p>3. If the determinate day require positive institution, there is institution brought out of the New Testament, if not express, yet by good consequence, which I count sufficient.</p>
            <p>4. Yet I do not count Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> consequence good by analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in his <hi>Defence</hi> pag. 208. <hi>The Jews keep the Sabbath on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth or last day of the week,</hi> ergo <hi>the Christians keep the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath on the first day of the week.</hi> Of my judgement herein with other Antipaedo baptists more may be seen in my <hi>Praecursor,</hi> S. 15. And for the other thing Mr. <hi>M.</hi> adds, it is nothing to the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100457:30"/>
business in hand, which is not about the greater or lesser necessity of clearing the institution of the Lords day or infant baptism, but about the principle by which infant baptism is rejected, whether it necessitate us to reject the Lords day: which I denyed, because this principle, That use of a meer ceremony or positive rite which hath neither precept nor example in the New Testament is to be rejected, will not reach the Lords day, which is not meerly positive, but in part moral, and hath precept and example for it in the New Testament, neither of which can be said of infant baptism.</p>
            <p>That which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> adds next about <hi>the desperate highest sort of Antinomians, who wipe out all the Old Testament with a stroke, and that they may as well do so by the New Testament too if they please, and telling us the question whether infants should be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized is turned into a higher, whether the Scriptures be the word of God or not?</hi> I might well let pass as being nothing to the point in hand, the denying of infant baptism to be in the Old or New Testament, neither being upon the higher or lower sort of Antinomians (if there be such difference of them) principle, they that deny infant baptism, being not necessitated to it, nor so far as I find in their writings (except what I have met with in Mr. <hi>Dens</hi> Books) denying the obligation of moral precepts of the Old Testament. All that they are necessitated to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is, that Ceremonial precepts of the Old Testament and imagined ANALOGIE between Baptism and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, the Jewish Church state and the Christian, are of no force to conclude a divine appointment concerning any Sacrament or meerly positive worship of the New Testament. And therefore his Pathetick Rhetorick, though elsewhere of use, yet in a dispute as this his writing should have been, hath the face either of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy towards his Antagonists, or of an indirect trick to prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess people with horrour of that opinion, which he would refuse afore he comes to his Arguments, which is the chief part of his skill. And for what he saith further that <hi>incestuous marriages are not forbidden in the New Testament,</hi> and tells the men of <hi>Bewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, That some of eminency that deny Infant baptism deny either incestuous marriages, or any thing else not forbidden in the New Testament to be sin,</hi> It is like the former, sith he might know that Antipaedo baptists are not necessitated to deny the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100457:31"/>
of the moral Law, in which the Laws about incestuous marriages appear to be in that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were punished for their incests <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 25. And Mr. <hi>B.</hi> if he had any mind to deal candidly with me, might have told them, that I was none of those men, sith he might (if he did read my books with any heed, of which I much doubt) have told them, that to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection I answered in my <hi>Examen</hi> pag 111. 1. That the instance of the Lawes about forbidden marriages brought by Mr. <hi>M.</hi> is not to the point of the obligation of meer positive ceremonial worship, sith the command about prohibited degrees in marriage is moral 2. That yet there is for one branch of Incest an express censure in the New Testament, proving the unlawfulness of it. To which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> page 196. of his <hi>Defence</hi> saith, <hi>But how would you laugh at such a consequence in another, a man may not marry his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife, a thing which by the light of nature was abhorred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens, ergo all the degrees of forbidden marriages in</hi> Moses <hi>Laws stand firm?</hi> whereto I reply, I made no consequence but this, one branch of Incest is expresly censured in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, therefore it is unlawful. And this I only brought to shew the impertinency of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> allegation to prove the matter in question, it being granted by me that a morall precept of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> is in force, thought not a ceremonial, and yet Mr. <hi>M.</hi> brings instances only of morals standing in force, none of ceremonials, and instead of cleering the pertinency of his own instances, makes a consequence as mine, which, saith he, <hi>I would laugh at in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which dealing is cavilling not answering. The like to which is that which follows in him. <hi>The like say you against Polygamy, there is proof against it,</hi> Mat. 19. 5. 9. <hi>But is this an express prohibition of it? Must you not be compelled to go by a consequence to bring it in, which is ab I contend for?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I reply. Though Mr. <hi>M.</hi> page 3. of his <hi>Defence</hi> charged me unjustly <hi>with a Socinian plot in my writings to question all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions deduced by consequence from Scripture,</hi> yet page 205. he saith of me, <hi>That I neither there nor here deny this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a consequence to be sufficient for practice of some things in the worship of God, which are not expresly laid down in the New Testament,</hi> and therefore he might easily have seen, if he would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that to prove we may go by a consequence is not all he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100457:31"/>
contends for, it being known to him that I grant it. But this he is to prove, or else he still is besides the business, that a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is good from analogy of an abrogated rite of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament to prove a Divine appointment concerning a meer positive rite of the New Testament, till this be done, his, and Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> arguings are quite besides the business in hand and carry an apparent shew of Sophistry, not of just disputing.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ:</hi> My confidence is upon good reason, M: <hi>Bs.</hi> marvelling is from ignorance; what he means <hi>by taking the words [since the solemn institution of Baptism,</hi> Matth. 28.] <hi>inclusively</hi> I know not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except he mean that time when that institution was given, as well as the time after, or that institution to be a warrant as well as after precepts or examples. Either way the <hi>medium</hi> of M. <hi>B.</hi> serves my purpose. For it plainly asserts, that <hi>what we have no warrant, in all the New Testament, for, we are not to do ordinarily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what we have precept and example for, we are to do.</hi> Which if he will stand to, then his warrant out of the Old Testament is not sufficient for infant-baptism, and so <hi>it is not fully determined in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at what age persons are to be admitted into the Church,</hi> as he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100457:33"/>
sayd before, and what we do we have warrant for by his own grant, sith he cannot deny we have precept and example for baptizing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of faith. And then his including here <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. in his Texts (though not brought <hi>Plain Scripture proof, &amp;c. pag.</hi> 342. to prove his antecedent) is an intimation that in all the rest of the Texts, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. 12, 13, 16, 36, 38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 47<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 48. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 15, 33. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he findes not precept or example for baptizing of infants, and so if he finde not warrant <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. for baptizing infants, all his other proofs are by his own reasoning made invalid. For sure the Texts alleged do as evidently prove this antecedent [<hi>we have no warrant</hi> by word or example in all the New Testament (since the solemn institution of Baptism, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.) to admit any member into the Church by Baptism, but believers by profession, but both precept and constant example of admitting them by it] as Mr: <hi>Bs.

But I proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:100457:34"/>Because, as he sayth, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. <hi>An answer cannot be always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently given, which may make the case plain to some men,</hi> therefore Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should have given his arguments in writing to those that came to him, which had been an easier and fairer way than to tell them as he doth, <hi>pag.</hi> 6. <hi>If any of you have taken up the opinion of Antepaedobaptism, and have not read and studied Mr.</hi> Cobbet, <hi>M.</hi> Church, <hi>and other the chief books, and been able (at least to himself) to confute them, you have but discovered a feared consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> (a most heavy, though vain censure, shewing what rashness and distemper was in Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in this writing) <hi>which either taketh error for no sin, or else dare venture on sin without fear, and have betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your own souls by your laziness,</hi> as if a man might not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by reading of the Scripture, and conference with the able of the opposite party, without reading so many Books. Sure Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who had read those Books shewed little charity to those of <hi>Bewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> that came to him for arguments for infant-baptism, when he would neither set down his own arguments in writing, nor direct them in what part of those books they might have satisfaction; but fly upon them with so deep a charge, without any moderation of spirit. And when he saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. <hi>He dare say by my books, that it is my case not to have received the doctrine of infant-baptism on the best grounds and arguments.</hi> I reply, 1. that there are many pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages which make me think he never read my books with exact di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and heed, but (if I may use his own words) <hi>He betrays his own soul by his laziness</hi> or prejudice. 2. It shews a fond conceit in him of his own arguments, which another perhaps will think weaker than those of <hi>Calvin, Ursin, Piscator, the Assembly, Mr.</hi> M. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he might perceive by my <hi>Exercit.</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that I had considered. I said in my <hi>Apology, pag.</hi> 6. that I rested wholly on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. for many years, and that Text Mr. <hi>B.</hi> cals <hi>a full plain Text,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in effect builds all his proof for infant-baptism upon it, and therefore Mr. <hi>B.</hi> might have perceived his mistake concerning me, if he had heeded my books. <hi>If some Divines have argued weakly for infant-baptism, used some unfit phrases, and brought some misapplied Scriptures,</hi> as he saith, I am sure Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had reason to number himself among them, if he be not the man who hath in all these outstripped them. I wish he had held his resolution <hi>of not heaping up many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> it would have saved me much labor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:100457:34"/>To his words, <hi>Whatsoever Mr.</hi> T. <hi>may pretend among the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I shall easily prove, that infant-baptism was used in the Church as high to the Apostles days as there is any sufficient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story extant to inform us: and that the deferring of Baptism came in with the rest of Popery, upon Popish or heretical grounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, 1. That my pretences about the innovation of infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism are not among the simple, as he would insinuate, but among the most learned, for whose examination my allegations are obvious in print. 2. That his assertion concerning the antiquity of infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism is most inconsiderate, there being nothing in <hi>Ignatius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Eusebius, Epiphanius,</hi> and other the most approved Histories and Authors, for his assertion. And for those be brings, the highest is Pope <hi>Hyginus,</hi> whose words he alleged out of his Decree, which I conceived had been in his Epistle decretal, judged to be counterfeit, but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his <hi>Praefestinant is morator</hi> lets fly at me <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. for my mistake.

makes it probable not to be meant of a Gossip to an infant bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. And lest it be thought <hi>Osiander</hi> is alone, I will adjoyn the words of Mr. <hi>Fox, Acts and Monuments first book at the year</hi> 175. <hi>The like</hi> (that <hi>Telesphorus</hi> made them not) <hi>is to be thought also of the rest, not onely his Constitutions; but also of the other ancient Biships and Martyrs, which followed after him, as of</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus anno 142. <hi>who succeeding him, and dying also a Martyr, as</hi> Volateranus lib. 22. <hi>declareth, is said or rather feigned to bring in the cream, one Godfather and Godmother in Baptism, to ordain the dedication of Churches: when as in his time so far it was off, that any solemn Churches were standing in</hi> Rome, <hi>that unneth the Christians could safely convent in their own houses. Likewise the distincting the orders of Metropolitans, Bishops, and other degrees, savour nothing less than of that time.</hi> Doctor <hi>Prideaux,</hi> one of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> own Authors for this Decree of Pope <hi>Hyginus</hi> about Gossips, though he make mention of it where he speaks of that Pope, <hi>Compend. of History, cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>interr.</hi> 7. yet after, among many of his inquiries, this is the third, <hi>Whether it be likely that these religious Popes in such extreme persecutions had liberty or list to think on making Cardinals or Gossips, and introduce a rabble of beggarly Ceremonies.</hi> And though I were mistaken in calling that decree of <hi>Hyginus</hi> the Decree in the Epistle, yet I think the Authors which censured the decretal Epistles did comprehend the Decrees ascribed to those first Popes among those forged Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings under that name. However, what I have produced is enough to justifie my speeches in my <hi>Praecursor,</hi> that the Decree ascribed to Pope <hi>Hyginus</hi> about Gossips, is so manifest a forgery, that I could hardly have imagined any learned Protestant would ever have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged so notoriously forged a writing: so that I need not answer Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> allegation of this testimony, <hi>as by currant consent of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians assuring us that</hi> Hyginus <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>did first ordain Godfathers and Godmothers at the baptizing of infants, and his questions thereon, but by telling him he hath reason to be ashamed of abusing men with this forgery after so much eviction of it by learned men, being more like a brazen faced allegation, than that he so censures me for without cause.</hi> The next of his allegations is <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> from whom besides the bastard writing of <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and Answers ad orthodoxos,</hi> all the rest alleged, <hi>pag.</hi> 156.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100457:35"/>
by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is manifestly impertinent, and his genuine writing yields a good evidence against the use of infant-baptism, as unknown to him, as may appear by what is said before. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his <hi>Praefesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantis morator,</hi> says <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Seeing you deny nothing in</hi> Justin Martyrs <hi>words, you must yield that it was known to Mothers that their infants were of Gods kingdom, and then certainly they were Church-members, and known Disciples or Christians.</hi> To which I reply, that I have not <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> now by me, and do doubt whether in that passage of the <hi>Epistle ad Zenam &amp; Serenum,</hi> he did mean infants, sith the term is [children] which may be meant of persons who are come to some age capable of understanding; and if the words be meant of infants, yet it may be very well conceived that the meaning is, that <hi>of such is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that is the Kingdom of Glory, and that not in respect of their present, but future estate, as when it is said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, they shall <hi>have a great reward in Heaven, vers.</hi> 12. And then it neither proves their present being of Gods visible Kingdom, nor that they were Church-members, and known Disciples or Christians, and to be baptized. This testimony for the antiquity of infant-baptism I remember not alleged by any before Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and therefore besides the impertinency of the words, as he himself allegeth them, I see no need to search any further into it. His allegation, <hi>pag.</hi> 154. out of <hi>Iraeneus</hi> is impertinent, wherein besides other frivolous inferences out of his words he tels us, <hi>that</hi> Irenaeus <hi>cannot mean by sanctifying, internal real sanctifying onely, for then according to their exposition of</hi> Renascuntur, <hi>it should be but Tautology,</hi> q. d. [<hi>He sanctifieth all that are sanctified or new born</hi>] whereas had he heeded these words set down by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, this imagined Tautology had been seen to be his meer mistake; for his words are, <hi>Omnes venit per semet ipsum salvare, He came to save men of all ages,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> renders it, not as Mr. <hi>B. He sanctifieth all that are sanctified.</hi> And yet if they had been thus, he sanctifieth by himself all that are born again or sanctified by him, it had not been a Tautology, sith it is manifest that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> by [<hi>per semetipsum</hi>] meant by the patern or example of his own age, and then it is no Tautology, but hath this plain sense, that all that are sanctified by Christ, he came to sanctifie them by the patern

As for Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> assertion, that <hi>he should easily prove that the deferring of Baptism came in with the rest of Popery upon popish or heretical grounds,</hi> if he mean the deferring it till a person were catechized and of years sufficient to answer by himself to the three questions, about Repentance, Faith, and Obedience, which were still put to the baptized, it is not onely vain and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate, but notoriously false, it being the constant order of the Church to baptize after catechising, and the baptizing of infants onely an exception from the common rule and order, in case of danger of death, till after <hi>Angustines</hi> days, who flourished in the fifth Century.

innumerable company of humane Ceremonies, insomuch as that the pure worship and truth of the Gospel was shadowed so much, as that for the abundance of such leavs, the fruit of the Gospel-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and doctrine was very little or scarce discernible, and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion was almost wholly placed in those Ceremonies. And therefore however there <hi>were weight in that argument of the Apostle, we have no such custome, nor the Churches of God</hi> of those times, yet especially in matters of Ceremonies and positive worship the former after the Apostles days, much less the present customes of the holiest Saints and Churches should not be of any great weight in cases controverted, except when they serve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound some passages of the Scripture that are cleared by them. Yet this will no whit infringe the validity of the testimony of the Ancients about the canonical books, or right readings of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, no more than the discrediting of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Rabbins rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about their Traditions doth infringe their testimony about the books of the Old Testament, though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his <hi>Praefestinantis morator, Sect.</hi> 3. would insinuate, as if denying the certainty of <hi>Austins</hi> rule about Apostolical Traditions must infer an uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about the canonical Scripture, which shews his proness to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lnmniate me, and his inconsiderateness in not observing how this may be objected against his own speeches, <hi>pag.</hi> 303, as well as mine. As for Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Bs.</hi> tenth <hi>Position,</hi> though I grant it as it is set down, yet in his amplyfying of it there are sundry things that need animadversions. 1. That whereas he speaks of some, that <hi>disclaim Reason because they require express words of Scripture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not themselves with his supposed evident consequences;</hi> he may know that I have often acknowledged consequences good proof from Scripture, and if others do deny consequences, I do imagine that if they were rightly understood, it would appear that they deny onely such far-fetcht consequences as are used about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism, resting upon such <hi>hypotheses</hi> as are taken for granted, when they have need of proof, or such consequences as are drawn from the rites of the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Sacraments of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which if it be their meaning, Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> censure of them <hi>as sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less ignorant wretches</hi> is too harsh and magisterial. 2. To what he saith, <hi>Will you allow of such an argument for infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism as Christ brings for the Resurrection?</hi> I answer for my
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100457:37"/>
self and the people of <hi>Bewdley,</hi> to whom that speech was intended, we will: but withall I say, that in viewing of his book I discern nothing but Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> vanity, in imagining his arguments to be like Christs, when upon trial they have little in them but superficial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings urged with much confidence and importunity upon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, and stuffed with impertinent Texts, frivolous questions, and childish wonderings, fitted like things set in fields and gardens to fright birds, to deter the shallow heads of this age from the truth, who either have no minde, or no ability to examine it scholastically. This is my judgment of it. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. After all his ten Positions, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath three more Propositions, the first about the difficulty of it, in amplifying of which he confesseth <hi>the point of infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism to be such, as the most godly learned impartial Divines cannot agree in, after all their writings, disputing, studying, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> which being true, it is most unjust in <hi>Maresius</hi> that in his <hi>sixth question he makes the error of Anabaptists intolerable,</hi> in Ministers, that they will not permit such as deny infant-baptism to preach, nor will either themselves hear them, or pray with them, or suffer their hearers, but renounce communion with them, and make separations from them, and so shew themselves Schismaticks, yea, and in their Pulpits and Writings endeavour to make them odious, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing Magistrates to imprison, expell, and destroy them; on the otherside the Parlament is justified in that speech of theirs in the <hi>Declaration</hi> Ordered <hi>March</hi> 4. 1647. to be published <hi>in answer to the</hi> Scots <hi>Commissioners Paper, that the opinion against the baptism of Infants is such, as wherein in former ages as well as this, learned men have differed both in opinion and practice, and that therein they held it fit that men should be convinced by the Word of God, with gentleness and reason, and not beaten out of it by force and violence.</hi> But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath another fling at my speech, that it is an easie point, and that the reason why so many Divines did not discern it, was their wilfulness or negligence, and this he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes <hi>to want of humility, modesty, conscientiousness, and that he should tremble to pass so high a censure,</hi> forgetting what a heavy cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure he had past before on others <hi>of discovering a seared conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either taking error for no sin, or else daring to venture on sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, and betraying their own souls by their laziness, p.</hi> 6. <hi>Who should be Antipaedobaptists without reading, and studying first</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:100457:38"/>
               <hi>some books there named,</hi> calling others <hi>ignorant sensless wretches,</hi> with much more of this kinde over all his book, in which it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with him to censure me, my answers and speeches, as if they shewed some fearfull spiritual judgment fallen on me, when his own mistakes through heedlesness, or uncharitableness, are all the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of such a censure. But for my speech here, I say still, that I know not how to say otherwise, and yet deprehend not any such pride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> immodesty, or want of conscientiousness in my speech, nor any such high censure as he should tremble to pass, but as humble and fair an answer as is to be given to the question. Godly, learned, and humble men have differed in the points of Prelacy, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Ordinances, even in things that in themselves were easie to be discerned. What censure is easier than this, when some of them have continued in an error easily discernible, to say it hath been through wilfulness or negligence? which things are incident to the best and ablest, when they have a conceit of the point as of small moment, specially in comparison of peace and unity, when prejudice by education, determinations of Councils, Schools, leading Writers, Magistrates censures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prepossessing them, draw them from exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining it, or if they do examine it, makes them willing to satisfie themselves with imperfect and raw answers to their scruples, and most of all, when the loss of Preferment, Friends, Estate, Liberty comes to be in question, and pre-engagements make it grievous to retract. What I said of this is manifest by the instance I gave about <hi>Lutheran</hi> Consubstantiation, which M. <hi>B.</hi> should have shewed not to be appositely brought, and not carp and cavil at my words so often as he doth (though they were but in a speech in private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference) that he may paint me out in as ugly shape as he can, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to those of <hi>Bewdley,</hi> my dear Auditors heretofore, but now causlesly by his affrightments estranged from me; which if it be not a fruit of malevolence in him I know not what to call it. As for his talk of his <hi>own doubts and pains to resolve himself, and the easiness and plainness of the grounds of it,</hi> it satisfies not me, but still I am suspitious of his negligence in not considering better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those things he hath taken up. In which I am confirmed from his own confessions of prejudice, unwillingness to be put on this business, in that it diverted him from other enjoyments and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and from his hasty printing, his indistinct handling specially of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100457:38"/>
his second argument, never clearly opening his terms, nor shewing the <hi>hypotheses</hi> on which he builds his <hi>second main argument,</hi> his disorderly placing his proofs, his heaping up impertinent Texts, his mistakes of my answers, his overly reading my writings out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them, his frivolous questions, and expostulations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for his inference about my wilfulness or negligence, it is but a further piece of petulancy to insinuate that of me, in which my <hi>Apology, Sect.</hi> 4. might have undeceived him, though it were not then so easie to discern that error as now, after so much debating of it, did not pride, prejudice, fear, or some other partial affection hinder. And for Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> conceit of his grounds, though I neither finde <hi>them easie nor plain,</hi> yet it is no marvel others discern not how infant-baptism can be inferred from them, which can at most prove <hi>a reasonableness of the thing,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Bedford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and others speak, but not an institution of God, which must be gathered from precept or example in the N. T. and can onely warrant our practice as the minde of God in meer posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives about worship in the New Testament. In the explication of his second Proposition, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. he again objects my speech, that Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> Principle on which he establisheth his Proof from Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision for infant-baptism is one of the first condemned Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, by which I meant that Proposition which he hath in his <hi>Sermon, pag.</hi> 35. that <hi>all Gods commands and institutions about the Sacraments of the</hi> Jews <hi>binde us as much as they did them, in all things which belong to the substance of the Covenant, and were not accidental to them,</hi> in which thus much is maintained, that some part of the command of Circumcision, and the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the <hi>Jews,</hi> binde us as much as they did the <hi>Jews,</hi> which is expresly condemned, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24. as <hi>subverting the souls of the Gentiles,</hi> and is called, <hi>the heresie of the false Apostles,</hi> by the <hi>Century-writers, Cent.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. and others condemn it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of <hi>Judaism.</hi> But then saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>M. is an Heretick with me, and all the Divines in the world that go his way.</hi> To which I answer, This inference hath too much shew of Sycophancy, being urged so often, and to the People of <hi>Bewdly,</hi> my <hi>quondam</hi> Auditors. For, 1. though I say that Doctrine is such an Heresie, yet I do not say Mr. <hi>M.</hi> still holds it as his words did import; yea, I did acknowledg in my <hi>Apology, pag.</hi> 99. and in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100457:39"/>
this writing <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. that Mr. <hi>M.</hi> doth deny that <hi>we are tied to any practise of the ritual part,</hi> which is indeed to retract his former speech in his <hi>Sermon.</hi> 2. But were it tru that he did still hold it, yet it would not follow, that he were an Heretick with me. For, 1. I should not take him to be an Heretick that holds that Doctrine which is Heresie, if it were not so directly, but onely by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not heeded, as this of his is. 2. Nor do I take him to be an Heretick that doth hold that which is Heresie directly, except he hold it in or with a party made to maintain it. And therefore I do once more protest against Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> calumniatory inference, and deny that I account Mr. <hi>M.</hi> an Heretick, and yet I account still his Principle mentioned, if it were held as the words in the <hi>Sermon</hi> did import, to contain one of the first condemned Heresies, to wit, <hi>Judaism.</hi> To this calumny Mr. <hi>B.</hi> adds another. Because I used the words of the Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 26, 27. in a Sermon, he from the report of his Notary, and a multitude of my Auditors, likely his tale tellers, without sending to me about the truth of it, prints what he received from them, and thence infers, <hi>that the baptizing of persons of years, notwithstanding their infant-baptism, is taken by me for a fundamental point, which the salvation or damnation of men doth necessarily depend on. Or what I meant to say [their bloud be on their own heads] he knows not. And yet he conceives me to contradict my self when I blame the Papists for making baptism of necessity to salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, that herein Mr. <hi>B.</hi> shews his inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or his minde to calumniate, or both. For, 1. he might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted my words, as I think when I spake them they were meant, in reference to other duties which I had taught them, with that of Baptism. 2. If it were meant particularly of Baptism, yet the threatning I conceive was not to the bare omission, but to the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion joyned with opposition. 3. I am sure, if I did threaten, their bloud should be on their head for omission of Baptism, it was not simply or barely for the omission, but for the omission after teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and upon supposition of conviction, by it of their duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this I think Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doth not stick to do to his hearers, in case after teaching and supposed conviction by it, they practise not a duty, though non-fundamental, as suppose reproving of their neighbours. For then they live presumptuously in sin, and such sinning consists not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100457:39"/>
with sincerity and truth of Regeneration. And yet this doth not suppose the point in it self fundamental, that is, such as the meer ignorance of it, or the bare omission of it doth damn a person, or exclude out of the kingdom of God: in which sense I blame the Papists for maintaining a necessity of an infants being baptized to its entering into the kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>B. doth not think God lays so great a stress on this point, as I and others do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That which I hold is this, 1. that Baptism with Water is an Ordinance of Christ that bindes Christians now as well as in the Apostles days, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. &amp; 10. 47, 48. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 5. And I detest the audacious impiety of <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and those in our days, who count themselves above Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that is as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> well interprets it, <hi>Plain Scripture Proof, &amp;c. pag.</hi> 24. <hi>above obedience to God, and so Gods,</hi> as being one of the most palpable delusions of unsound men in our days, who place their perfection in a manifest disobedience to Christs appointment, and some of them in an Antichristian presumption, as if they sate in the Temple of God, and shewed themselves as God, do most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogantly of their own heads, without any allowance of God, make void the express prime Ordinance of the Lord Jesus Christ, calling it a low dispensation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I hope I shall have liberty hereafter to shew the frivolous allegations and pretences of these men. In the mean time they may see what Mr. <hi>Laurence,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bartlet,</hi> M. <hi>B. pag.</hi> 341. of this his Book, have written for these Ordinances. 2. I hold that every Minister of the Gospel is bound, as to preach the Gospel, so to baptize those that are made Disciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. 3. That every believing Christian is by necessity of precept tied to be baptized, that is, dipped in water, in testimony of his profession of Christ his Lord,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Blake, Vind. foed. cap.</hi> 6. That is the Covenant draught, terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant we finde, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not shall be damned,</hi> Mark 16. 16</note> upon his being made a Disciple of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. &amp; 22. 16. 4. That this is ordinarily where and when it may be had without unmercifulness, defect of water, or some other like reason, a necessary means of salvation, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4, 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5. 5. That infant-baptism is not the performance of the duty of being
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100457:40"/>
baptized according to Christs appointment. 6. That in a regular and orderly way, persons, notwithstanding their pretended infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism, are not to be admitted to the Lords Supper till they be baptized upon profession of their faith in Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41, 42 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2, 3, 4. &amp; 12. 13. These things I may hereafter have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to debate more fully. As for that which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 10, 11. It doth no whit overthrow this necessity which I assert, but rather confirm it: For <hi>Gods freeing us from the great burden of Jewishrites</hi> makes it the rather necessary for us to obey Christs appointment in those few Sacraments he hath ordained, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> truly saith, <hi>As they are duties they are great, and so in themselves considered, and not onely in respect of the consequences of them.</hi> And he saith truly, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. <hi>All Christs commands must be obeyed, both great and small, so far as we know them.</hi> Yea, Mr. <hi>B. Scripture proof, pag.</hi> 342. saith, <hi>Baptism with Water is Heb.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>reckoned among the foundations or principles which are of standing use, and therefore it is so it self.</hi> Nor is his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation right, <hi>that the things ascribed to Baptism are ascribed to it without the external washing.</hi> In all these places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 26, 27. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 21. the outward use of Water is expressed, though the things ascribed to it do presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose something more, as he himself allegeth them, <hi>pag.</hi> 342. which is the meaning of that speech, 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Not the putting away of the filthiness of the flesh,</hi> that is, not it onely, but <hi>the answer of a good conscience towards God</hi> joyned with it. And whereas Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tell us, <hi>that we shall never be able to justifie it, if we lay out the hundredth part, or perhaps the thousand part of our time, study, talk or zeal upon this question,</hi> I confess this may be true at some times, in some persons: but if other tenets be clear, and other duties not neglected, and this becomes a doubt of conscience, and fals into frequent practice, so as that it concerns them much for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, people, and little ones to be resolved in it, else they shall sin either by omitting a duty, or by doing a thing with gain-saying or doubting conscience, it is justifiable, though they bestow more than a hundredth part of their time and study upon it. And especially if the person be a Minister called to be a Guide to the People, and by special providence and solemn covenant led forth to vindicate the truth in such a time, when otherwise it is likely to be suppressed, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100457:40"/>
the Assertors of it oppressed. In these and such like cases it may be unjustifiable, if a person do not spend more than the hundredth part of his time about this question; else neither the <hi>Hussites</hi> will be justified in spending so much time in opposing the half-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, nor the Protestants in opposing Transubstantiation, nor the Non-Conformists in opposing the Ceremonies of Bishops. Mr. <hi>Tho. Goodwin preface to Mr.</hi> Cottons <hi>Dialogue for infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> saith truly, <hi>The due application of baptism to all those persons Christ would have it administred unto, cannot but be apprehended by all that have any insight into the Controversies of these times, to be of very high importance.</hi> Not that I like their Carriage that neglect other necessary things, and spend all their time, study, talk, and zeal about this, such hypocrisy I should declaim against with him, remembring what our Saviour said in a like case, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. <hi>These things ought ye to have done, and not to have left the other undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for M. <hi>Bs.</hi> third Proposition concerning the grounds on which the point of infant baptism stands, <hi>that they are of great moment,</hi> because what he saith, rests on the heap of consequences he infers from the denial of infant baptism (of which there is scarse any one true) and the shewing them to be but vain surmises, depends on the dispute it self, I shall therefore respite the vindicating the truth, from them, till I come to examine in this <hi>Review</hi> the arguments from Scripture urged on both sides, after which shall come in those from humane testimony and reason, unto which I now apply my self.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>MR. <hi>B.</hi> saith pag. 8. he will prove, 1. <hi>That it is the will of God that some infants should be baptized.</hi> 2. <hi>that it is the will of God that all infants of believers ordinarily should be baptized.</hi>

Yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and M. <hi>Baillee</hi> for some advantage chuse to undertake the proof of the former, whereas the true state of it is, as in my <hi>Examen</hi> s. 2. and Mr. <hi>Ms. Sermon, Whether the infants of believers are to be baptized with Christs baptism of Water by the lawful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster according to ordinary rule?</hi> I hold the Negative, Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall,</hi> Dr. <hi>Homes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Geree,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baillee,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> &amp;c. hold the Affirmative. My dispute is to this purpose.</p>
            <p>The ordinary rule for baptizing is Christs institution, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptists,</hi> and the Apostles appointment and practice: But neither according Christs institution, nor according to <hi>John Baptists,</hi> or the Apostles command or practice, or any other approved exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Scripture, is the baptizing of infants of believers; Therefore the baptizing of infants of believers by a lawfull Minister is not according to ordinary rule.

But sure Christ did not appoint to preach the Gospel to infants, therefore he did not appoint to baptize them. For Christ appointed his Disciples to baptize none but they who were first preached to, and consequently they do it without Commission from Christ, who baptize infants ordinarily without preaching the Gospel to them. I suppose no man will conceive Christ appointed infants of a day old to have the Gospel preached to them, it had been a ridiculous injunction; therefore neither did he appoint them to be baptized.

            </p>
            <p>I reply. My words are perverted by him: I said baptizing is to be with the party baptized his invocation of the name of the Lord, not that baptism and prayer are all one, but that they should be concomitants, and together in the use of baptism after Christs appointment.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> in his <hi>Just Vindic. pag.</hi> 182. cals this <hi>New Light,</hi> which if he mean Ironically, (as it is likely he doth) he may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by perceive, that he is mistaken, and for what he excepts against this Exposition, that <hi>neither in the baptizing of the</hi> Samaritans, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. was that Rule observed, <hi>nor was it possible that the three thousand baptized in one day, Acts</hi> 2. <hi>should arise each of them, and call upon the Name of the Lord, as they were baptized;</hi> it proceeds upon a mistake, as if no calling on the Name of the Lord were sufficient, but that which was set and solemn before the publick Assembly, whereas neither is Baptism necessary to be administred before the publick Assembly: <hi>Grotius</hi> proves out of <hi>Justin Martyrs</hi> words, and otherwise, that it was administred not as they now do infant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sprinkling in the publick meeting place, but in some place without, aside from the publick Assembly, and the calling on the Name of the Lord was or might be ejaculatory, whether in the heart onely, or by words, praying to the Father by Christ for the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> makes this inference from my words; <hi>Then it seems if the party baptized call on the Name of the Lord by prayer, that's all that is intended by baptizing into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is but another of his pervertings of my words: for in the same place I joyned with it, devoting themselves to the service of, and adherence to the Father, Son, and Spirit, which I proved out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13, 15. which proves plainly that to be baptized into the Name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, notes not a Ministers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100457:45"/>
from the Father, Son, and Spirit, nor a Form of words to be used by him at Baptism, whether the party baptized understand it or no, but in baptizing, engaging the party baptized to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Father, Son, and Spirit, as Lord and Teacher, <hi>Diod. Annot. in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>In mine own Name] as to binde them unto me to acknowledg me for their Head.</hi> Hence <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism is the Doctrine he preached, and the baptized by him professed, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. 3. and the Pharisees therefore were not baptized of <hi>John, Luke</hi> 7. 30. because they should have professed <hi>Johns</hi> Doctrine, which they were against, if they had been baptized of him, as their Disciples did their Doctrine, and <hi>Johns</hi> Disciples did his. Clear therefore it is, that [baptizing into the Name] doth note not onely the act of the Ministers of Baptism, but also the party baptized his act of invocating, addicting, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Service and Doctrine, and obediently testifying it by that sign: for that is plain from the command, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Let every one of you be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is the requiring of a duty from them conjoyned with repentance, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>herefore to be baptized is not meerly passive, but implies a voluntary yielding of a person to it. And it is further proved from the words to <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 22. 16. where he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Arise, baptise, and wash,</hi> which all require voluntary action on his part, as well as ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on <hi>Ananias</hi> his part, out of which this argument is formed: They are not baptized into Christs Name, or his Fathers, and Spirits Name, who do not perform the acts required in that expression; But infants of believers do not perform the acts required in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; therefore they are not baptized into Christs Name, or his Fathers, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Spirits, according to the meaning of it in the institution. So that this argument is not a petty reasoning, but a solid reason, to prove infants baptism not such as Christ appointed. As for Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> frivolous question, <hi>Were not the infants of the</hi> Jews <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to God by Circumcision, though they could not actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themselves?</hi> Though I am not bound to answer his imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent questions, yet I will tell him they were; yet this is nothing to the business in hand, about the meaning of the Phrase [<hi>to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit</hi>] which manifestly implies the party baptized his act, which infants cannot
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100457:46"/>
do. Whereas no where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is such a command [Be ye circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Name of Jesus Christ] nor is it all one to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimcised, as to be baptized; which is still supposed but never proved.</p>
            <p>4. I further urged, Christ bids the Apostles presently after Baptism, <hi>Teach them to observe what ever he commanded;</hi> But this direction could not pertain to infants, they could not be taught to observe Christs commands; therefore neither were they appointed to be baptized: Mr. <hi>M.</hi> denies that <hi>they were enjoyned presently to teach them to observe what Christ commanded.</hi> But the Text knits these together, Baptizing and Teaching, so as that they that were baptized should be taught, &amp; that by them that baptized them; which the Apostles could not do, being to go up and down from place to place, to plant the Churches in all Nations, if they had been to baptize infants; for then they must have staid many years till they came to understanding to be taught to observe what Christ commanded. No man me thinks should imagine Christs appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be thus, Make infants disciples, and baptize them, and then after five, six, or ten years, when they are grown to some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, come again and teach them to observe what I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but that Christ did appoint them to teach them presently after Baptism, that is, in so many hours or days after that Ordinance was administred, as it could be well done. Nor doth Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> avoid this objection by saying, <hi>pag.</hi> 179. <hi>then they must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently taught the whole minde of Christ, which is impossible.</hi> For [presently] is not restained to an instant, but comprehends a just latitude of time for the doing of the thing, onely it notes that the beginning of it is to be not long after Baptism, but sooner by much than it could be done to infants. Mr. <hi>Baxter Plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Proof, pag.</hi> 341. argues thus, <hi>What Christ hath conjoyned, man must not separate; but Christ hath conjoyned Discipling and Baptizing,</hi> (I add, <hi>and Teaching</hi>) <hi>therefore we must not separate them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The institution of Christ is best understood by the command of the Apostles, the resolution of <hi>Philip,</hi> the practice of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> the Apostles, and other men sent by God to baptize; but the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> commanded first Repentance and then Baptism, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Philip</hi> resolved the Eunuch demanding, <hi>What hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth</hi>

                  </gap>, thou maist,</hi> it is lawfull or allowed thee, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36, 37. <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, the Apostles, and other holy men sent by God to baptize, baptized none but Professors of Repentance, Faith, and being Disciples of Christ, as may appear by the Texts mentioning their baptizing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. 12, 13, 38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Therefore Christs institution is of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing onely Professors of Repentance, Faith, and being Disciples of Christ, and therefore not infants of believers. The <hi>major</hi> cannot be denied by those that confess that Scripture best expounds Scripture, and that the Apostles knew Christs minde, and did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it. The <hi>minor</hi> is manifest from the Texts alleged. And Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> words are express to that purpose, <hi>Divine Right of Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> government, cap.</hi> 5. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 257. <hi>We reade that</hi> John Baptist <hi>and the Apostles baptized none but such as confessed their sins, and professed faith in Christ Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>M. Defence, pag.</hi> 227. says, <hi>that it would be a hard task for me to prove that</hi> John <hi>baptized none but upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I reply, 1. It is proved already and confessed by Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> 2. I did think Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> own words, <hi>Sermon pag</hi> 44. <hi>that</hi> John <hi>did teach before he baptized, because then no other were capable of Baptism,</hi> did amount to as much, till Mr. <hi>M.</hi> to help himself, referred [then] to the time untill Parents were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted not to the time of <hi>Johns</hi> and the Apostles ministry, of which the objection was, to which in those words he answered.

Mr. <hi>M.</hi> hath not yet shewed any other, but such baptized by them, and therefore it is probable in the highest degree of probability that no other were baptized by them. 4. I think an argument in this matter from the Evangelists relation negatively is good proof, unless we will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>John Baptist</hi> and the Apostles were defective in their duty, or
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100457:47"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I think not, 1. what they did, sure was required of them, else it had not been an acceptable thing, and by <hi>John,</hi> else he had failed in his duty, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 17. But they confessed sin afore Baptism<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Ergo.</hi> 2.

He that preached to them <hi>to prepare the way of the Lord,</hi> required confession of sins afore Baptism, for that was the preparing the way of the Lord by bringing persons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess sins, and then to baptise them; But <hi>John</hi> did preach <hi>to prepare the way of the Lord, Mat.</hi> 3. 3. 4. He that preached the Baptism of repentance, required confession of sin to Baptism; But <hi>John</hi> did preach the Baptism of repentance, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. 4.</p>
            <p>To prevent this, saith Mr. <hi>M. It is said, he baptized them eis</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But dare Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in good earnest say that <hi>John Baptist</hi> did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit persons to Baptism that were not in a state of repentance? If he should, I doubt not but to be able to prove the contrary from that which is said of those he baptized, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>They were baptized of him in Iordan, confessing their sins;</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 5. <hi>They were all baptized of him in the River of Iordan, confessing their sins;</hi> [<hi>all</hi>] must not be understood simply, for so it were not true, but, as the matter requires, with this limitation, all that were baptized were baptized confessing of sins, which was a state of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 32. the different state of those that believed <hi>Iohn,</hi> and those that believed not, is expressed thus, <hi>the one repented that they might believe,</hi> and the other not. And by comparing it with <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29, 30. it appears they onely were baptized that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved <hi>Iohn,</hi> and others not. But were it not Mr. <hi>M.</hi> had been minded to wrangle, there had been no need to have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100457:47"/>
this, His own words, <hi>That there was a new Church to be constituted of those that should receive Christ, Sermon page</hi> 44. shews none were to be baptized but penitents, unless they were to be Church members who were not in a state of repentance. Would <hi>Iohn</hi> admit manifest impenitents? Then the new Church should consist of impenitents, and so no difference between the Church and the world, them that receive Christ and them that receive him not, all should be Church-members. <hi>Iohns</hi> baptism and Christs is by Protestants asserted to be all one, saving that the one pointed at Christ to come after, <hi>Acts</hi> 19 4. the other as already manifested by name, neither did admit any but penitents, and believers in shew.

            </p>
            <p>Its true that he baptized them unto future repentance, that is so as that they were required and professed to repent and change their lives. Therefore he required that they should bring forth fruits meet for repentance, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 8. and directed particularly wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in verse 11, 13, 14. Initial repentance is prerequired to baptism, and continued repentance is to follow after, and therefore <hi>Iohn</hi>

               <hi>Baptists</hi> calling for repentance and preaching the baptism of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance shew not only that this was the lesson they were all to learn, but that also as <hi>Pareus</hi> proves, that they must all manifest that they repented afore he baptized them, and that all did and were tied to make confession of sins, notwithstanding Mr: <hi>Ms.</hi> saying.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>M.</hi> sets down the <hi>judgement of very learned men who conceive their confession of sins was not because it is a necessary medium to all who should receive baptism, but to cleer his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism from misconstruction, to thwart the opinion of justification by the works of the Law.</hi> To which I say.</p>
            <p>1. That were this granted, yet it avoids not my argument, who bring the matter of fact onely, it is enough for me at present if it appear that <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized none but penitents.</p>
            <p>2. Yet the judgement of those very learned men is but their own saying, nor can it be right. For if <hi>the end of Iohns requiring repentance was only to clear his baptism from miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, because the men who came to be baptized of Iohn, were such as had been educated in an opinion of justification by works of the Law, &amp; so more was required of them than of others, as it is usual to require more of an heretick for his admission in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bosome of the Church,</hi> then he had required such confession of sins and repentance only of Pharisees and their Scholars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he required it also of Publicans, Harlots, Souldiers, as may be seen <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. And indeed he required it of all for both ends, that he might contradict the Pharisees doctrine, and because it was a necessary prerequisite to his baptism, because his baptism was contrary to the baptism that initiated proselytes into <hi>Iudaism,</hi> in the nature of it, that is the doctrine taught by the Baptist, and professed by the baptized, the Pharisees baptism requiring observance of the Law for righteousness, and <hi>Iohns</hi> baptism requiring repentance for remission of sins, and therefore the Pharisees rejected it, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29, 30. so that in truth this judgement of those learned men about the reason of <hi>Iohns</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism proves against Mr. <hi>M.</hi> that repentance is to antecede baptism, and his allegation thereof may be retorted upon him.</p>
            <p>6. To strengthen this argument from the institution of Christ and practise Apostolical, there are many passages in the Epistles, which

do prove that baptism was and ought to be with such profession and acts of the baptized, as do not nor can ordinarily be ascribed to infants of believers, and therefore they are not rightly baptized according to ordinary rule. <hi>Ro.</hi> 6. 3, 4 <hi>Know ye not,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>that so many of us as were baptized into Iesus Christ, were baptizd into his death; therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life,</hi> now <hi>to be baptized into death &amp; Christs death</hi> is by baptism to engage our selves to dy with Christ to sin, with profession of purpose of newness of life and hope of resurrection. <hi>Becman.

            <p>1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>For even by or in one Spirit have we been baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into one body, whether</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Greeks, <hi>whether bond or free, and have been all made drink into one Spirit,</hi> or as some copies have it, <hi>have been all made to drink or drench into one drink into one Spirit.</hi> That here baptism with water and the drinking the cup in the Lords Supper are meant, is manifest, the Apostle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from the end of those two rites for the union and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation between all Christians, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. he had done in the Lords Supper, and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. he doth from baptism. And without that allusion the phrase is not intelligible. And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Antibaptists is vain, that it is Spirit-baptism not water-baptism, For it is indeed both, Spirit-baptism from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as the cause, and water-baptism together as the outward element. Now hence three Arguments arise against infant baptism.</p>
            <p>1. All that were baptized into the body were baptized by one Spirit as <hi>the Concurrent cause</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith rightly in his <hi>plain Scripture proof, &amp;c.</hi> page 342. that is together <hi>with the word,</hi> as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 26: is declared, by <hi>preaching of which the Spirit was given,</hi> Gal. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. and this was presumed of all, as 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 2. 4. and elsewhere. And Mr. <hi>B.</hi> truly saith in the same place, <hi>That it was all that were thus baptized into the body.</hi> But I subsume, infants were not thus baptized, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no infants were then baptized, and consequently ought not to be now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:100457:49"/>2. All that were thus baptized were also made to drink, or did drink themselves, or were drencht by their own act in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the cup in the Lords Supper unto one Spirit in communion and testification of one Spirit, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. But infants did not thus drink, <hi>Ergo</hi> infants were not then baptized.</p>
            <p>3. All that were counted members of the body of Christ, or the Church, were thus baptized, and made to drink. But infants were not thus baptized, and made to drink, for if so, they received the Lords Supper, therefore were not then visible Church members, and consequently ought not to be so counted now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</hi> 27. <hi>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</hi> Where the Apostle proving that they were all the children of God by faith in Christ, because they had put on Christ, must needs intimate that it was by faith in Christ Jesus that they had put on Christ, and then the Apostles speech is this, As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have by faith in Christ Jesus put on Christ, and consequently so many as were baptized were believers, and therefore no infants were baptized for want of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>There is one body and one spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi> Whence I argue,</p>
            <p>1. They that have one baptism, have also one faith; But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants had not one faith; <hi>Ergo</hi> they had not one baptism, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently are not to have it now.</p>
            <p>2. One faith is placed before one baptism, therefore faith went before baptism in the Apostles daies, and consequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were not baptized.</p>
            <p>3. They that were counted of one body had one faith; But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants had not one faith, therefore they were not counted of one body, that is Church-members, Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> words p. 342. confirm this <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>As the whole Church is one body, and hath one Lord, and one faith, so hath it one common baptism,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eph. 5. 26. <hi>That he might sanctify it, cleansing it with the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water by the word,</hi> whence Mr. <hi>B Plain Script. proof, p.</hi> 342. inferres, <hi>the whole Church of Christ must in duty be washed with water.</hi> Now I argue, 1. They who were washed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100457:49"/>
were cleansed with the washing of water by the word, which word is the word preached, as where mention is made of baptism, there mention is made of preaching of the word going before it, and [<hi>the word</hi>] doth no where signifie the covenant or promise of God taken precisely or abstractively from the narration of Christs comming and invitation to repentance, but altogether as it was preached, as may be seen in <hi>Peters</hi> speech, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 36, 37, 38, &amp;c. But infants were not cleansed by the word; therefore they were not cleansed by the washing of water.</p>
            <p>2. The whole Church was cleansed with the washing of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the word; But so were not infants; therefore they were not parts of the Church, and consequently are not now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Buried with him in baptism, wherein ye have also been raised together through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead.</hi> Whence I argue. They who were buried with Christ in baptism were also therein raised together through faith, and consequently were believers; But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were not in baptism raised together through faith; therefore they were not buried with Christ in baptism, that is, they were not baptized, and by consequence ought not to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. is usually expounded of baptism, as by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> pag. 342, so by many others. But if the <hi>washing</hi> there be meant of baptism, it is such as was with <hi>regeneration and receiving of the Holy Ghost;</hi> therfore not of infants whose regeneration and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving was unknown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. Where the foundation is mentioned, this order is observed, first repentance, then faith, then baptism, then lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands, then resurrection of the dead, and lastly eternal judgement, now if the Apostle kept a right order here used in teaching, and according to the event of things (as he seems to have done) then repentance and faith went before baptism: and so no infants baptized.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>The baptism that saves</hi> is accompanyed with <hi>the answer of a good conscience towards God.</hi> This saith <hi>Beza</hi> in his <hi>annot.</hi> on that text <hi>alludes to the Custome of stipulating or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing at baptism by the baptised:</hi> which if right (as is probable) then it is manifest that the baptized did answer at baptism, which infants could not, and therefore were not baptized.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> exception against the Major, that such instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or example as I require for infant-baptism is unnecessary, is refelled.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AGainst these arguments (chiefly the two first) brought to prove that infants are not to be baptized, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. and the practise of the Apostles (besides what is alleged and refuted already) many things are alleged. Mr. <hi>Blake Vindic. foederis</hi> page 411. construes the objection, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism wants an institution, as if the meaning were that it wants an institution with limit to infant age, and then talks thus at randum, <hi>This Objection, if it have force in it, followed home, will overthrow all baptism at any age, and every other new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordinance whatsoever: For according to this rule a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must bring a precept for one of his age to be baptized.</hi> But this is M. <hi>Blakes</hi> mistake of the objection; For in it an institution is not required with limit to infant age, but such an institution as comprehends by any description ordinarily infant age. <hi>But then,</hi> saith he, <hi>upon the same account church-members in covenant of any age ought to be baptized, and so the institution is not in question (about that there is an agreement) but whether infants be in covenant, whether they be any church-members, is to be disputed, which already is satisfied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is false which he faith that <hi>there is an agreement about the institution,</hi> I deny that the institution is, Baptize per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in covenant, except he mean persons in covenant by their own profession and promise, or that it is all one to baptize disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and to baptize persons to whom God hath promised, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted Christ: For then the Jews yet uncalled should be baptized, to whom Gods covenant is, <hi>Romans</hi> 11. 27. It is false also that <hi>upon the same account upon which the institution of baptism with limit to infancy is waved, church-members in covenant of any age</hi> (in Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> sense) <hi>ought to be baptized, and that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is only whether infants be in covenant, whether they be any</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:100457:50"/>
               <hi>members.</hi> He knows well that I yield that infants are in the covenant of grace, in respect of Gods promise to as many of them as are elect, whether believers children or not, and that I grant that many of them are members of the invisible Church; yea he himself in his 43. <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Vindic. foederis sect.</hi> 3. had disputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my tenet, denying a connexion between the covenant and initial seal, and therefore this speech of his shews either his osci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, or his willingness to mislead.</p>
            <p>He then repeats his arguments in his <hi>Birth privilege</hi> in the same words he then used to prove the institution to comprize in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, which were answered in my <hi>Examen sect.</hi> 13. and my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer there vindicated in my <hi>Postscript sect.</hi> 14, 15, 18. in answer to the 11 chapter of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> answer to my Letter. I will not here repeat what I then answered, but reply to what he excepts in his <hi>Vindic. Foederis</hi> pag. 413. where he doth not shew insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in what I say <hi>Apol. page</hi> 147. to answer his allegation of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 49. 22. But saies <hi>he doubts not I abuse my memory.</hi> Concerning which I yield it not unlikely my memory did fail me in that thing, of his alleging <hi>Isaiah</hi> 49. 22. as an argument by it self. I hope this may satisfy Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and the Reader, if he read the places in my writings here mentioned, may be satisfyed that it proves not any thing for Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> purpose. Likewise for what I answered in my <hi>Postscript sect:</hi> 18. to his allegation of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 5. &amp; 10. 42. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 41. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 47, 48. he refers to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> book page 22. I shall refer the Reader to my answer to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> here.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Blake only adds, that the denyal that infants are within the verge of the Commission,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. <hi>involves the Apostles and all that are imployed in their work in succession, in a contradiction. The nations are to be discipled: Infants bear a part of the nation: and yet infants are in an incapacity wholly of it. See Mr.</hi> Cooks <hi>answer to the Challenges of the Anabaptists of</hi> Stafford, <hi>pag.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>I reply, Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> words are so obscure (as many of his speeches are) that I understand not his meaning when he saith, <hi>The denyal that infants are within the verge of that commission</hi> Matthew 28. 19. <hi>involves the Apostles, and all that are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their work in succession, in a contradiction,</hi> whether he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100457:51"/>
mean thus, my denial involves the Apostles in a contiadiction to their own sayings, or to Christs words: either way understood, I discern not any truth or shew of truth in Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> words. Christs words are a command, and not an enunciation, and therefore there can be according to exact expression no contradiction to them; and for any sayings of the Apostles which should be involved in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction by my denial, it is beyond any art of divination of mine to ghesse which and where they should be. And for his syllogism it is false, consisting of four terms, 1. <hi>The nations,</hi> 2. <hi>to be disciples,</hi> 3. <hi>infants,</hi> 4. <hi>bear a part of the Nation.</hi> If it were good I might from the parallel place <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. argue in the same manner, Every creature is to have the Gospel preached to it; Infants bear a part of every creature, therefore to infants the Apostles were to preach the Gospel. Nor is there any contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in these two Propositions, <hi>The nations are to be discipled,</hi> and yet <hi>infants are in an incapacity of it,</hi> no more than in these, <hi>God hath granted repentance to the Nations,</hi> Acts 11. 18. yet not to infants, <hi>All nations and all people are exhorted to praise God,</hi> Rom. 15. 11. <hi>in him shall the nations trust,</hi> verse 12. yet not an infant meant. The speeches are so plain <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 3. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the conversion of the nations,</hi> verse 7. <hi>God made choice among us, that the nations by my mouth should hear the word of the Gospel and believe,</hi> verse 14. <hi>Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Nations to take out of them a people for his name,</hi> verse 17. <hi>That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Nations upon whom my name is called,</hi> verse 19. <hi>Wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the Nations are turned to God.</hi> Acts 20. 25. <hi>As touching the Nations</hi> (for the word translated Gentiles and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is the same in all these places) <hi>which believe, we have wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> and yet in no one of these places are infants meant under the term [<hi>Nations</hi>] And when our Lord Christ expresseth what he said Matthew 28. 19. <hi>Disciple all nations,</hi> by the words <hi>preach the Gospel to every creature,</hi> Mark. 16. 15. as the comparing the texts shews, and interpreters confess; I know not how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with what Spirit Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is moved, who doth so often seek to impose his stale all egations so often and so plainly refuted. Will any man conceive that Christ bid them preach to infants, and yet
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100457:51"/>
his bidding them to disciple all nations is as much as to bid them go preach to all nations? If men do swallow down such fancies, I can hardly judge but that they are willing to be deceived. In <hi>Mr. Cookes</hi> book in the place to which he refers me, I find no more then in Mr. <hi>Blakes,</hi> and therefore need give no other answer than what is given to him.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> addes. <q>For that part of the objection, that there is no example in the New Testament scripture of infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, I answer, First, for an example of baptism with limit to any one precise number of years or daies, we have but one that I know (if that) in Scripture, and that is of Christ, who was (as is computed) about the age of thirty when he was baptized, if this be prest and followed all must at that alone be for baptism, and no other of any age may be baptized. Mr. T. had many years above thirty over his head, when I heard him say, that he was satisfyed, that though an infant ought not to be baptized, yet being baptized in infancy, when in years he did make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Gospel this was valid, which he spake in justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own baptism; though now (as errour is creeping) of an Antipaedobaptist he is grown up to an Anabaptist, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, and in his Praecursor glories in his shame of rebaptizing others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Objection as by me framed doth not intimate a pleading the necessity of an example with limit to any one precise number of years or daies, as a rule to be followed in baptism, but rests in the institution and examples in the new Testament as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to direct whom to baptize, to wit disciples, repenting believers in Christ by profession, whatever be their age, nor did Mr. Bl. ever hear me press Christs age as the exact rule for the time in which Christians should be baptized; and therefore did not Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> take occasion to vent his jerks and quips (in which he is frequent) he had forborn to recite my speech in that manner he doth. Concerning which I do not think I did then expresse my self, to wit in the year 1643. (for sure it was in that year that I spake with M. <hi>Blake</hi> now above nine years since) in the very words he sets down; I do rather conceive by the words in my <hi>Exercit.</hi> pag. 22. composed about that time, that I spake more cautelously. But had I said it, it only shews I received light by degrees, as in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100457:52"/>
all reformations it hath been. Neither am I an Anabaptist, nor do I rebaptize, and though I glory not in any thing of mine, yet count it not my shame, but my honour, that God hath used me as an instrument to reform the superstitious opinion and prophane practice of infant-baptism, or rather (as now it is used) sprinkling or perfusion, and do bless God with rejoicing, that amidst so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptations, reproaches and other sufferings, my heart hath been obedient to Christs command of being baptized, and baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though to his own shame, he makes it my shame that I have done my duty in this particular.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> adds. <hi>There are many things of which we make no question, and yet we have no example of them. I instanced in the tryal of the suspected wife by the water of jealousie, there is no example for it in all the old Testament Scripture; and for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens receiving the Lords Supper, there is not a particular insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or any particular precedent for it in the New Testament: See further instances in Mr.</hi> Cooks <hi>Treatise before mentioned, page</hi> 21. <hi>They cannot give us any instance of any one trayned up by believing parents for baptism, and assoon as he could give an account baptized, not one child of a believer brought up for cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and not in covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I may say also there are many things of which we make no question, and yet we have no example of them: It is enough if either precept or example approved could be brought of infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism. Of the tryal by the water of jealousie there was no need of example to direct, when the rule was so plain. Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> instances are to no more purpose than Mr. <hi>Blakes,</hi> being brought against them who deny proof by consequence, which I do not. Their need be no example brought according to my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of a believers child catechized first and baptized after, it is enough to us that such a one is comprehended in the institution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a disciple, Christ never requiring us to enquire whose children they are, but what is their faith and profession, and to baptize disciples and believers in him. If Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> mean [<hi>by being brought up for covenant</hi>] to be taught the knowledge of the true God, <hi>Ishmael</hi> the child of a believer was brought up for covenant and not in covenant. Of womens, who are Christian believers or disciples, receiving the Lords Supper, my speech <hi>Examen pag.</hi> 112.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100457:52"/>
was right, there is institution and example of it in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and this is justified in my <hi>Postscript</hi> s. 11. But Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath a fling at my instances, though his fellow Paedobaptists count them very plain, he is minded it seems to be <hi>ad oppositum</hi> to me in all I say in this argument. The particular command for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens receiving the Lords Supper I said was <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> goes on. <hi>He further saith, that</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press example in formal terms of womens receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; we being many are one bread and one body, for we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of one bread. I demand of Mr.</hi> T. <hi>whether the Apostle speaks in the person of Christians or in the person of women? not of women sure, for he takes in himself, and he was a man, and then the formality of an express example falls. When it is said that the whole house of Israel is circumcised in the flesh, Mr.</hi> T: <hi>will not yield that there is a proof, not by any consequence, that women, though of the house of Israel were virtually cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised: but all partaking of one bread, there is a proof formal and express that they were at the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> An expresse formal example is mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. of womens receiving the Lords Supper, there being relation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the bread in the indicative mood, and the term [<hi>we all</hi>] according to Grammar construction the matter not excluding them comprehending women as well as men. For the Apostle under [<hi>all we</hi>] expresly comprehends all <hi>the many that were one bread and one body,</hi> who are all Christians both Jewes and Gentiles, 1 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> demand makes a disjunction of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers coincident, which is illogical; However to it as it is I say the Apostle speaks in his own person, not in anothers, yet he speaks of the persons of all Christians both men and women, and he takes in as expresly the women as the men, and the formality of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is of one as well as the other. As for the other passage al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged by Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> the Predicate [<hi>circumcised in the flesh</hi>] being necessarily understood of actual circumcision, there is a necessity to understand the Subject [<hi>the whole house of Israel</hi>] synecdochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, else the speech would not be true. But tropes are not to be made but where there is a necessity to make good the speech, or to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100457:53"/>
make it agree with the scope, circumstances and other expressions: of which there is no necessity 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. to verify the speech of the Apostle, but that it is true of women as well as men, and must be so understood without a trope, and therefore there the speech is to be expounded according to the plain Grammatical meaning as expressed formally without the like trope.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith of me. <hi>He brings Acts</hi> 20. 7. <hi>that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on the first day of the week came together to break bread. Here is an example as express and formal. Mr.</hi> T. <hi>cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly prove by help of consequence much less expressly that there was a woman there. At that night meeting there might be none but men, as at the first institution. It can never be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press example till it be made appear that none are disciples but women.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I had thought when it is said, <hi>it is appointed unto men once to dy, Heb.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>death passed upon all men, in that all have sinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. it had been express and formal for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens and infants dying though there be other men than women and infants, and yet in both places [<hi>men</hi>] in Greek is in the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine gender, [<hi>Disciples</hi>] in the Acts note all Christians <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Tabitha</hi> is named a disciple <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 36. and therefore there being no reason to make a trope <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. in the word [<hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>] Christian women as well as men are comprehended. And <hi>by breaking bread,</hi> say the <hi>Assembly at Westminster Answer to the reasons of the dissenting brethren</hi> page 67. <hi>Sacramental brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread is understood generally by all, Acts</hi> 20. 7. The like is said by <hi>Chamier Panst. Cathol. tom.</hi> 4. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>s.</hi> 13. And it is confirmed, 1. from the text, the words importing that the breaking of bread is there meant which was the end of their custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary meeting on the Lords day; But this was Sacramental, <hi>Ergo.</hi> 2. From 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. where the Lords Supper is called <hi>breaking bread</hi> as the usual known term among Christians. This seems to me infallible proof, that women were there, or which is to my purpose, that usually they did meet with other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to break break. As for what Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> addes, <hi>That if I had the texts in hand of a whole houshold baptized, they would be sufficiently formal for infant-baptism,</hi> I tell him no: for I could not have withstood the clear light to the contrary, from the

            <p>The other speech of Mr. <hi>Blake, That which will speak for infants to receive them into Heaven, will speak also to receive them into the Church by baptism,</hi> is not true.

He neither in all that section, nor elsewhere, that I know, shews either any other or foregoing institution of baptism to us Gentiles, or any other but this with <hi>John Baptists,</hi> the Apostles, and some forenamed their practice and sayings for a rule of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing: onely p. 212. he dictates thus. <hi>Sir, since it is apparent that here is no new Commission for any new method in their work, but only an enlargement of their Commission to apply their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery to new persons, how could they understand our Saviours meaning to proceed any other way to the Gentiles than among the Jews?</hi> &amp;c. But to whom is it apparent? and when, either sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or waking? where is the old Commission that we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this by, so as to proceed the way to the Gentiles that was taken among the Jewes? Is it the Commission of circumcising <hi>Gen.</hi> 17? If that be it, then baptism is not a Sacrament of the New Testament onely but of the old, then it is not a new admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, then the Commission of baptizing is to any parent, though no minister, to baptize, then it must be done the eighth

            <p>2. It is to be observed, that Mr. <hi>M.</hi> deals not rightly with me in that he makes me to have framed the exclusive rule from pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, whereas I joined institution with practice, and shewed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be for infant-baptism.</p>
            <p>3. If the non-including of persons or things in the institution or practise of baptism be not exclusive, then the institution is not our
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100457:57"/>
rule, then there is no will-worship, or it is no sin to swerve from it, we may add to Gods worship infant-communion, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable other things rejected may be lawful, then do preachers, especially Mr. <hi>M.</hi> unjustly urge the Parliament, and others, to reform invented ceremonies, and Protestants contend against Popish rites in baptism, mass, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>But Mr. <hi>M.</hi> saith, <hi>John the Baptist and the Apostles might not meet with all persons and occasions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Tis true, they baptized no Emperours or Kings, because none were converted, yet they had a rule to baptize them if disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: But this could not be the reason of their not baptizing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, sith innumerable believers had infants in the times of the Gospel story, and Acts of the Apostles, and yet no mention of baptizingany. Do not Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and other Paedobaptists plead that the little children brought to Christ were infants of believers, and yet there's not a word of their being baptized? As for Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> instance to prove no necessity of practice to warrant infant-baptism, though I grant if there were institution without practice it were enough, yet is it not rightly brought. It supposeth <hi>Peter</hi> baptized <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his houshold upon the very powring out of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts, without actual faith and repentance required; And I grant he required them not: but yet withal it is manifest he did not baptize meerly upon the powring out of extraordinary gifts without them. For the text <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 46, 47. expresly saith, <hi>they magnified God,</hi> ere he spake of their baptizing, and <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 17. <hi>that they had the like gift as themselves who believed on the Lord Jesus,</hi> and they gathered thence that the <hi>Gentiles had repentance unto life granted by God.</hi>

            <p>But it is objected by Mr. <hi>Cobbet, Just Vindic. part</hi> 2. <hi>cha.</hi> 3.

               <hi>sect.</hi> 2. <hi>that Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>none but true believers are meant, then if the term be exclusive none but such are to be baptized.</hi> 2. <hi>that those believers had signs following them, verse</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The rule is, disciples by profession are to be baptized, to which is equipollent [believers by profession] I say not that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers only who are such as those <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by us: But yet comparing <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. I gather that a disciple and believer are terms equipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and so it helps me to understand the term [disciple] as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the term [believer] And though by reason of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter predicated <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. the believer there is only a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, yet the term often is given to believers only by profession, and we find such warrantably baptized, and that is enough for our direction: though we are to require more, yet we are not to forbear baptism till we know there is more. We acknowledge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true believers have right before God to baptism: but in the face of the Church believers by profession have right to baptism, and are to be taken by us for true believers upon their profession, till they be discovered to be otherwise. As for verse 17. it doth not say these or some of these signs shall follow every of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: but they are true if they followed some of them that believe, sith the terms being indefinite in matter contingent, the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is true if onely particular. <hi>Indefinita propositio in materia contingenti aequipollet particulari,</hi> say Logicians.</p>
            <p>But there is an objection <hi>ad hominem</hi> against my self, that I have said that if I knew an infant were actually sanctified, &amp;c. I would baptize him, if so, then an infant is not excluded out of the institution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant that an infant barely as an infant is not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the institution, but as ordinarily not known to be a disciple or believer. If an infant were known to be a disciple or believer, I would baptize him, as I would one who having his tongue cut out who is known to be a believer otherwaies. But then I have added that this would be upon extraordinary manifestation onely, and so not according to ordinary rule, and therefore justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies onely that extraordinary fact, not the ordinary practice of infant-baptism, which hath no rule ordinary or extraordinary.</p>
            <p>But then saith Mr. <hi>M. page</hi> 215. shew us your extraordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:100457:58"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> When I do thus, or challenge this, I shall: in the mean time it is enough that my concession doth not infringe my argument against baptizing infants ordinarily without ordinary rule.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> hath yet another exception in his <hi>Sermon, page</hi> 44. <hi>That no other are mentioned to be baptized but disciples, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, because a new Church was to be constituted, and then all were to be baptized upon profession of faith, after the children came in by their right by vertue of the Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ref.</hi> 1. when I come to examine Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> Conclusions I shall shew, that there is no such Covenant as to give right to believers infants to be baptized; yea that title to the Covenant did not give right to Circumcision, and therefore this is a vain pretence.</p>
            <p>2. He assigns that for a reason why no other were baptized, which was not a reason: For in the Jewish Church which was already constituted, and which Christ did join himself to, and to whose children they say did belong the Covenant, yet while other were baptized all the time of <hi>John</hi> and Christs Ministery on earth, no one infant was appointed to be baptized, no not those infants <hi>Mark</hi> 10. which Christ blessed, and which were (if Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists say true) believers infants in Covenant.</p>
            <p>3. It is a vain pretence, that there is no mention of baptized infants; because they had no right till their parents were convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For neither when they were converted is there any mention of the infants baptism.</p>
            <p>4. The institution <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. expounded by the practice of <hi>John Baptist</hi> &amp;c. is the standing rule for Churches at first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and after increasings, nor can any other rule be produced di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from this, and therefore neither at first conversion, nor after settlement of Churches, are any to be baptized according to ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rule till they be disciples of Christ, or believers by profession.</p>

            </head>
            <argument>
               <p>The exceptions of Mr. <hi>Cobbet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> &amp;c. against the order of teaching afore baptizing, of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hussey,</hi> that baptizing is discipling, are refelled.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AGainst the argument from the order of teaching first and then baptizing, it was excepted that it is said <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 4. <hi>John did baptize and preach,</hi> which objection in my <hi>Examen</hi> was removed by the words of <hi>Beza par.</hi> 4. <hi>s.</hi> 1. To which I add, that the reason is manifest from the text why the one was put after the other, not because he did baptize any afore he had preached, but because <hi>Mark</hi> having expressed his baptism, it was needfulhe should shew the difference between <hi>Johns</hi> baptism and the Jewish or Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical baptism.</p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>M.</hi> returns thus much. <hi>Christs order is (say you) teaching should go before baptizing; is not that the same with this; That men must be made disciples by preaching before they be baptized?</hi> To which I only say,</p>
            <p>1. That the arguments are not the same as I made them, the first being taken from the term [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> them] the other from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of teaching afore baptizing.</p>
            <p>2. However I take that which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> grants, that <hi>it is the same to teach, and to make disciples by preaching before baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Cobbet just vindic. part</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 2: allegeth something against this argument. He grants <hi>some things in this order of Christ are perpetual,</hi> but he will not <hi>have all to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidentiall to all Churches and times, because it is said</hi> Mar. 16. 17. <hi>in the same speech, that miraculous signs should follow them that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this were good, then the rule should only hold while such gifts remain, which no churches now have, and so he must fall into the opinion that makes water-baptism a temporary ordinance, and those things which he grants perpetual, as <hi>viz.</hi> preaching the Gospel before baptism is to be administred by such as preach, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled inchurched persons are to be baptized, that in founding
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100457:59"/>
churches the first members are to be visible professors of the faith in reference to church estate, that baptism is with water applyed to the persons baptized, and that into the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, must be temporary as well as teaching before baptizing: If the one be perpetual notwithstanding this reason so is the other, and presidential to all churches and times.</p>
            <p>But saith Mr. <hi>Cobbet, there is a distinction to be made in baptizing at the gathering of Churches, and when they are gathered: the order must be observed at the former, not the later.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If it was to be so at first gathering of churches, why did not those in <hi>New England</hi> observe it then when they first gathered their churches? surely they were not rightly gathered for want of baptism if this be the rule at gathering of churches. Nor can they plead their baptism they had in the National and Parochial churches of <hi>England;</hi> For by their principles, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism belongs to the children of believers, not as such, but as in church-covenant, and church-members, and therefore they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize not any but the children of church-members in covenant, and yet most of them had their baptism in the churches of <hi>England,</hi> and their parents no church-members and so neither they nor others that gather churches in <hi>Old England</hi> do keep to their principles in the gathering of their churches.</p>
            <p>2. But besides what I said before to this objection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. there is no such distinction made, and we are not to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish where the law doth not, yea all the institution, and every thing in it was to be observed in the churches of Christ in gathering and gathered at all times, as is manifest from the promise annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of being with them alwaies to the end of the world, which shewes that he would have that rule continued to the end of the world, and to encourage them therein he promiseth to be with them. To say with Mr. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But (saith Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi>) <hi>the Commission James</hi> 5. 14. <hi>to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:100457:59"/>Be it so, that that appointment of the sign of a gift of miraculous cure now ceaseth, yet it doth not follow that the institution <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. in which a sign of a perpetual duty is institu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, is tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary.</p>
            <p>But saith Mr. <hi>Cobbet, There are variations in the mention of Christs last Commission about the Lords Supper, and therefore another analogy of faith and comparing Scriptures with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is to regulate us in this point of Sacramental order, and so in the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, 1. That the variations Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> sets down are none of them about the order of the actions appointed by Christ pertaining to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not pertinent to the presen: business.</p>
            <p>2. If Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> will not have the order in the institution to be moral and perpetual about the Lords Supper, then they do ill in his Judgement that contend against Papists, Prelates and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to have the Lords Supper reduced exactly to the first pattern as a constant rule, there being such variations as disable it from being a rule.</p>
            <p>3. I grant that analogy of faith and comparing Scriptures with Scriptures is to regulate us in this point of Sacramental order: But till Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> shew that in any other Scripture or analogy of faith there is a rule that persons should be baptized afore they be taught, his reasoning is, not to the present purpose.</p>
            <p>But then saith he, <hi>If order must be observed so strictly, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing must go before salvation,</hi> Mark 16. 16. <hi>repentance may be before faith,</hi> Mark 1. 5. <hi>confession before faith,</hi> Romans 10. 9. <hi>if the place in</hi> Mark <hi>must be so closely stuck to without comparing it with the Scriptures of the old Testament, then we must preach the Gospel to Dogs, Cats, &amp;c. since it is expresly said preach the Gospel to every creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That if it follow not that every thing set before is first in order of time or nature, yet what is first appointed to be done in the solemn institution of Sacraments, is to be done first, as taking, blessing, breaking bread, before eating, so teaching the baptized afore baptizing as the Apostles practice shews, who best understood Christs appointment. As believing upon preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to go before salvation, so baptizing ordinarily and regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100457:60"/>
(for which I now contend) and yet in special cases as persons may be saved without personal actual believing upon preaching, so without baptism. To avoid the inference of preaching to Beasts, we need not go to the old Testament <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But (saith Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi>) <hi>if it be absurd to say the Gospel is preached to little ones, what shall we say of Christs speech</hi> Mat. 19. 14. Deut. 30. 6. Acts 2. 38, 39. Luke 1. 76?</p>
            <p>I answer, This may be said, that all these are frivolously alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to prove that Christ should appoint the Gospel to be preached to infants (which were to make Christ as ridiculous as the Legends do <hi>Francis</hi> the Fryer) sith none of them mention any speech or preaching to little infants, though some of the speeches are of or concerning infants. As for what he further adds, <hi>It was no absurdity that infants were circumcised, Christ laid his hands on infants,</hi> Peters <hi>feet were washed, though these acts were not then understood.</hi> I grant it, and say, if Christ appointed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be baptized, I should not count it an absurdity, but sith his express institution is, that teaching should go before baptizing, till that order be shewed to be alte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, it is a prophane abuse of the ordinance of baptism to baptize those who are not taught.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake Vindic. foederis page</hi> 243. speaks thus, <hi>This is the weakest of all arguments, to reason for a precedency of one before another from the order in which they are placed in Scripture, so we may say</hi> John <hi>baptized before he preached the baptism of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for his baptizing is mentioned before preaching of baptism</hi> Mark 1. 4. <hi>So we may say we must have glory first and vertue after, for so they are placed by the Apostle,</hi> 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Though in Histories of facts sometimes things are s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t down last which were done first, yet in setting down institutions, order and every circumstance is observed, so as thence to conclude it irregular not to observe the order used in the primitive institution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>the cup of blessing</hi> is mentioned before <hi>the bread we break,</hi> and yet it would be counted a disorder and sinful to administer the wine before the bread, because in the mention of the institution the three Evangelists and <hi>Paul</hi> observe exactly the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100457:60"/>
order as well as the use of the elements, as delivered by the Lord. In like manner when Christ appoints, and the constant practice of the Apostles expounds his words thus, that first persons be made disciples and believers, and then be baptized, sure it is an act of transgression of Christs command to do it otherwise, especially considering that by so doing the prime and chief end of baptism, to wit, to signify the baptized persons engagement to repentance and faith in Christ, is thereby evacuated.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I may more truly say, God will not suffer the disorder of Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> to have baptism go before and faith follow, when by <hi>necessity of precept,</hi> as he speaks there, Christ having instituted it and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, discipleship and believing are put before baptism <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. and the Apostles so taught and practised <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8 12. 37. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10 47, 48. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 15, 33, 34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. 8. Glory is put before Vertue 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 3. without disorder, if either the meaning be as <hi>Heinsius</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>Aristarchus sacer</hi> on <hi>Nonnus</hi> conceives, he hath called us by his glorious power, or if the ordinary reading be retained, though Vertue be before glory, yet we are called to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry first as the end, and then to vertue as the means, the end being first in intention, though last in execution.</p>
            <p>There is another exception which I counted in my <hi>Examen</hi> p. 126. a very absurd one, and such as I presumed none that had any wit would entertain it, to wit that making disciples <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. is to be by baptizing them, and yet Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> pag. 212. goes about to maintain that <hi>the Jewes children were discipled when circumcised,</hi> &amp; <hi>pag.</hi> 213. <hi>that baptizing may be well rendred discipling,</hi> and allegeth <hi>Spanheimius</hi> for it. Mr. <hi>Hussey</hi> vents it as very remarkable and advantagious to prove infant-baptism. But against this toy I argued in my <hi>Examen</hi> page 131. 127.</p>
            <p>1. No <hi>Lexicon,</hi> nor I thought expositor do expound [<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>2. That the word plainly signifies so to teach as that the persons

            <p>But 3. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> refers me with a blind direction to <hi>Spanheimius</hi> to consult with, which however I have done, as I find his words <hi>Dub.

            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:100457:61"/>For 1. it is false, that [<hi>to make disciples</hi>] <hi>signifies the end of their sending, and not the act they were to do,</hi> whereas it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notes the first act they were to do: and if it had been the end of the act of baptizing and teaching, it should have been thus [baptize and teach them all things, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> that ye may make all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons disciples.]</p>

               </gap> 
               <hi>he maketh disciples, John</hi> 4. 1.] But there it is another thing than baptizing, for making disciples and baptizing are knit together as two distinct things, and the making disciples there was by preaching, as the story of the Evangelist shews, therefore making disciples <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 19. is by preaching, and is not barely baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>3. His own words do refute the reason of his analysis. For he allegeth this reason, because <hi>if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> should simply signify only to teach, there would be found a tautology in Christs words thus; Go teach all Nations, baptizing them, teaching them.</hi> But this absurdity is not avoided by his own exposition. For he himself saith, <hi>non significat solum docere, sed &amp; discipulos fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> now if it signifie at all to teach the tautology is alike, if we say, Go, not only teach, but also make disciples baptizing them, teaching them, for by his own words teaching is twice comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Nevertheless in my exposition (commonly received) there is no tautology, Go, make by teaching or preaching the Gospel (that Jesus is the Christ) disciples, so as that they learn him to be the Messias, and profess him, as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> expounds <hi>John</hi> 9. 27. <hi>will ye be his disciples?</hi> and then baptize them, and after teach them to observe all that I have commanded. So that here is a double teaching injoined, one to preach or teach them the Gospel, that Jesus is the Christ, as <hi>Philip</hi> did the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36, 37. and then baptize, and then teach duties commanded by Christ. And for what <hi>Spanheimus</hi> saith, <hi>That this may in its manner be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted to infants. For when parents do give their names to Christ for themselves and their families, their whole house is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, their children as well as themselves,</hi> it is false. For then if a parent give his name to Christ for himself and his family,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100457:62"/>
and the whole house is discipled, thereby it will follow, that the wife, child, servant, though infidels, are discipled, and so in fidels should be Christs disciples. But no where is in Scripture any made a disciple but by his own act of learning. As for what Mr. <hi>M.</hi> adds to shew <hi>that without teaching first, by initiating into a Master a person may become a disciple,</hi> it is insufficient to that end. For 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. though all <hi>our Fathers be said to be baptized into Moses,</hi> yet not to be discipled, and the term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>was discipled, Matth.</hi> 27. 57. doth not note a bare entring into Christs School without teaching or hearing of Christ, much less such an initiating as they give to infants without any act of their own, and <hi>John</hi> 9. 27. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> himself paraphaseth thus, <hi>will ye be his disciples, will ye profess him?</hi> which is an act of their own, of which infants are not ordinarily capable, and it supposeth some teaching and learning, at least this, that Jesus is the Christ.</p>
            <p>2. I argued from <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. to which our Translators refer in the margin at <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 19. as cleering the meaning of it, and generally interpreters shew thence how they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to make disciples, to wit, by preaching the Gospel, and so Mr. <hi>M. Sermon page</hi> 35. <hi>Express command there is that they should teach the heathen and the Jews, and make them disciples, and then baptize them,</hi> and <hi>Defence page</hi> 210. <hi>Their commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to preach and baptize,</hi> and hereupon from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. is gathered, that none are to baptize but preachers. Whence I argue, If the making disciples were to be by preaching the Gospel to them who were made disciples, then by making disciples is not meant baptizing, nor baptizing to be rendered discipling, For baptizing and preaching the Gospel are not all one; But the making disciples is appointed to be and was by preaching the Gospel to them who were made disciples; <hi>Ergo</hi> discipling is not by baptizing.</p>
            <p>3. I argued from <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. in which it is confessed by the <hi>New Annot. edit.</hi> 1. on <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. [<hi>made disciples and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>] answer to [<hi>make disciples baptizing them Mat.</hi> 28. 19.] now <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. making disciples is one thing, and baptizing is another thing, though coupled with it; therefore the making disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is not baptizing, but a distinct thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:100457:62"/>4. The Commission of Christ is to be understood according to the Apostles practice, unless we will say that either they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not, or followed not Christs appointment; But their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice was <hi>to make disciples first by preaching, and then to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, and no other mentioned,</hi> as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> grants in his <hi>Sermon page</hi> 44. <hi>Ergo.</hi> I truly said, nor need Mr. <hi>M. wonder at it,</hi> or call it <hi>a wild consequence,</hi> as he doth <hi>Defence</hi> page 214. that if the Apostles had understood Christs Commission as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> doth, baptize according to the rule of circumcising, they might have saved a great deal of labour in preaching to the baptized afore they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized them, and in baptizing females, sith the rule of circumcising did not require either. And though I grant it to be true, <hi>that male and female are all one,</hi> yet in the rule of circumcising a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is made, and if that be the rule of baptizing infants, then in baptizing them male infants should be baptized and not female.</p>
            <p>5. If making disciples be by baptizing without preaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the baptized, then non-preaching ministers may and do bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize rightly though they preach not the Gospel; But this I suppose will be denyed by Mr. <hi>M. Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. If making disciples be by baptizing without preaching to them, then the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America</hi> who drove the <hi>Indians</hi> into the water to be baptized, without teaching them or preaching the Gospel to them, did rightly, For they followed Christs rule thus expounded; But that is absurd; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and other Paedobaptists say that the commission <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. was the commission for first constituting the Churches of the Gentiles: If then the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission be to be understood, make ye disciples by baptizing them, without first preaching to them, then he had appointed them to constitute or plant the first Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preaching, and then the Apostles gifts of tongues &amp;c. were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary, they might have constituted Churches by hands, baptizing them only without the use of those gifts; but these things are absurd, besides other absurd consequences w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> follow on the exposition that discipling is baptizing, or baptizing discipling, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
            <p>Lastly many of their own grants and expositions before recited do so cross this conceit, that as I said before, I thought none that had any wit would embrace it, so now I wonder that such men as have taken it up did not better make use of their wit, to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100457:63"/>
decline so witlesse a shift. Onely I perceive any thing will erve turn to keep up the credit of Infant sprinkling.</p>

               <hi>nations is in the accusative case, that it is boldness to put it into the Genitive, that then the whole of the nation should not be appointed to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and so not infants,</hi> I have answered them in my <hi>Postscript sect.</hi> 14. And I further prove that the nation entirely is not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be baptized.</p>
            <p>1. For then the infidels of the nation should be to be baptized, for they are a part of the nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:100457:63"/>2. Then the Apostles were not to baptize regularly till they baptized a whole nation, yea all nations together, for so it is construed by them who make nations entirely the subject of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism according to Christs institution.</p>
            <p>3. The Apostles practice is an infallible comment on our Lord Christs words. As they practised, so Christ meant; But they baptized not any entire Nation, Countrey, City, or Tribe, but believers or disciples out of them; therefore no other were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be baptized. 4. If the baptizing of all the parts of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a nation entirely, were appointed by Christ, then there might be some rule to know when a nation is discipled, chosen, so as that it ought to be entirely baptized; But there is no such rule, <hi>Ergo.</hi>

            <p>To none of these do I find any thing replyed by Mr. <hi>M.</hi> but by telling me <hi>I fall to my old artifice of framing many senses</hi> (which yet in this point were but two) for which he blames me, as if it were blameable: whereas it is the only way to cleer truth to shew the divers senses of a speech, for avoiding of ambiguity, according to that saying, <hi>Qui benè distinguit benè docet, he that distinguisheth well teacheth well,</hi> and his not distinctly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by shewing in what sense his speech is meant tends to nothing but the hiding of truth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Whereto I reply, 1.

            <p>To which I answer, I said that if Christ would have had a

whole nation made his Church as the nation of the Jews was, comprehending old and young he had used Emperours and Kings to gather his Church as he did Moses to gather the Jewish Church in the Wildernesse by his authority, not Apostles and Preachers by perswasion. What he saith to it in his first edition, shall be (God assisting) in its place fully answered, I may more truly say that in this conceit of his, that Christ should bid the Apostles disciple infants, there is giddiness, if not an higher degree of folly.

making disciples all nations, in like wise as the one nation of the Jews were circumcised, which was by vertue of their birth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods appointment, as descended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> or as joined to that people.</p>
            <p>Yet Mr. <hi>Cobbet Just vindic. part</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. <hi>s.</hi> 4. argues thus. <hi>All nations are the subject to be discipled and baptized by commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore at least all the specifical parts of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all sorts of persons in the nations, but not all of every sort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, The consequence is not of any validity, all nations, therefore all sorts of the nations, It follows not, <hi>all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall serve him,</hi> therefore all sorts of the nations, <hi>all nations compassed me about,</hi> therefore every sort of persons in a nation.</p>
            <p>But, saith Mr. <hi>Cobbet, I would know then why the collective nations are mentioned under that title of nations rather than that of grown persons of the nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, the reason is because the thing said, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently shews who of the nations are meant, and it is very frequent to restrain the extent of speeches <hi>pro subject a materia,</hi> as the matter spoken of will bear it with truth and sense. And that this is usual in the use of the term [nations] is shewed before.</p>
            <p>As for what Mr. <hi>William Cook</hi> saith in his <hi>Font uncovered</hi> page 14. <hi>children are not to be excluded</hi> Mat. 28. 19. <hi>because children are a very considerable and essential part of a nation,</hi> it is frivolous, For</p>
            <p>1. If he mean by children infants, it is false that infants are an essential part of a nation, it is possible there may be a nation which may have for some time never an infant in it.</p>
            <p>2. If it were true, yet it is not to his purpose till he proves that [<hi>nations Mat.</hi> 28. 19.] is not taken synecdochically for a part of the nations, those that are of age to understand preaching of the Gospel, but that it must comprehend every essential part in its full latitude.</p>
            <p>And in like sort Mr. <hi>Nathanael Stephens</hi> his reasons taken not from the text, but from his own conceit, <hi>That [nations] must be taken as [nation] was in the application of it to the Jewish Church, and that otherwise there should be a shortning of the Covenant,</hi> they have been often answered and shewed to proceed upon such mistakes as these, that the Church of Christians was to be modelized after the fashion of the Jewes, and the use of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100457:66"/>
baptism was to seal such a national Covenant, and that title to a Covenant made by God gives right to baptism. And for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances page 9. of his <hi>Precept for infant-baptism,</hi> to infringe our argument from <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. to prove that <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. only disciples actually made are the subject appointed to be baptized, they all proceed upon a mistake of the reason, as if from the example there were gathered an universal rule, whereas it is onely brought, First to explain the meaning of the phrases <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. of making disciples and baptizing them. Secondly, that example is brought not by it self alone (as Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> brings it) but together with the institution, and all the examples in the New Testament to prove infant-baptism irregular, but his single instances do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. And whereas page 10, 11. he takes on him <hi>to shew a certain rule to know a discipled nation,</hi> he should have added initiating infants of that nation to baptism, and sets down <hi>their publique profession,</hi> he cleers not the difficulty, except he tell what profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and whose makes it a publique profession, whether when the representative of it professeth, or the King, or the Major part, or every person of understanding, and if he mean these wayes or any other, how he can acquit the Apostles from swerving from Christs rule, never looking after any other than personal profession, nor baptizing any infant upon his imagined rule, and if as he speaks, <hi>as the parents do now receive the faith, so far they and theirs must go under the account of a discipled nation, if they profess to bring up theirs in the faith,</hi> then though the children and servants be professed infidels, yet the parents and masters being believers, and promising to educate theirs in Christianity, these shall be baptizable because part of a discipled nation; And when he saith, <hi>Not only the families of those that truly believe, but the families of others also that are willing to yield to the Christian education, and to live under the tuition of a Godly Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Commonwealth, and the instruction of a powerful Ministery in the Church; so far forth as they are willing to be guided by the Lawes, and the Government of the Church of Christ, and are no worse, so far they must go under the notion of a discipled nation: and parents and children both be the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful subject of baptism:</hi> He speaks nothing but riddles leaving it to his Reader to study what he means by so many [<hi>so fars</hi>] whether
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100457:66"/>
he thinks all these do amount to a profession of the faith, whether these do make a man a Christian compleat, or onely an half Christian, what he means by [<hi>and are no worse</hi>] and how such a submission, as for ought I can perceive may stand with grosse ignorance of Christ, and at some times, as in <hi>Constantines</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> his times was in <hi>Pagans,</hi> afore the Inquisition in <hi>Spain</hi> in many <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> and is at this day in <hi>Spain,</hi> yea and <hi>England</hi> in many that know nothing of Christianity, nor have any savour of the faith of Christ, can make a discipled na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and entitle to baptism, not shewing any Scripture for what he saith, but <hi>Abrahams</hi> circumcising, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12, 17. which how impertinent it is to this point of baptism, is, and shall be more fully shewed hereafter.</p>
            <p>But I am necessitated yet to say something more to my teasing, and eager Antagonist Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> who speaks thus <hi>Vindic. foed. pag.</hi> 194. <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>in his Apology sect.</hi> 14. <hi>pag.</hi> 143. <hi>would fain fasten another interpretation on these words, and make the Commission not to sound according to the Letter of the words, nor yet according to the successe by grace attained, but to his liking and therefore is put to it to change the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> then all nations must either be put by apposition <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and so instead of disciple all nations, it will be make disciples in all nations. This he thinks is very to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, because to disciple and to make disciples is all one. But though they may be one in themselves, yet it makes a main diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the phrase, and with the additions of his preposition inverts the whole meaning of the words, as to the thing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, which is such a violence offered to the Text, that is not to be endured in him, that is about to draw a Logical argument for his advantage against his adversary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ:</hi> What I do in expounding Christs words is not onely tolerable, but necessary to be done to cleer the meaning of them. I do no more than <hi>Beza,</hi> the <hi>New Annot.</hi> and others. Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> me thinks allowes my exposition in these words a little before. <hi>The Apostles were to make disciples, to bring men into Covenant with God, and being discipled to baptize them, seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as Gods in Covenant; So John</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>when the Lord</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:100457:67"/>
               <hi>knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more disciples than Iohn, though Iesus baptized not, but his disciples. Here</hi> John <hi>made disciples &amp; baptized them being made, the disciples of Jesus made disciples, and baptized them being made; an outward work then to make profession of the faith is sufficient to make one a disciple and to bring him into the verge of the Covenant.</hi> In which he plainly asserts, that Christ appointed and the Apostles practised the making disciples by an outward work to make profession of faith, and baptized them so made. Now if this be the meaning of Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> I see not wherein there needs be difference between us. For whether we read make dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples all nations, or make disciples of or in all nations, and this making disciples by an outward work, and profession of faith upon that outward work are that which makes one a disciple, and these are to be baptized that are thus made disciples, I shall not stick to yield that Christ appointed, and the Apostles practised by the outward work of preaching to make disciples by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work of profession of faith, the whole of all nations, and baptized them wholly being made disciples by profession of faith: And I mean this as <hi>Pareus</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Tertium mandatum est de baptizandis omnibus gentibus, hoc est sacramento bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismi initiandis &amp; consecrandis omnibus iis qui Christo nomen darent.</hi> And herein I make the Commission to sound accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the letter, and according to the success by grace attained, without the least interverting the whole meaning of the words, without any violence offered to the text. Nor do I expect any thing in this matter to be indured in me but what I find agreeable to speeches of <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, Pareus,</hi> the <hi>New Annot.</hi> and M. <hi>Blake</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea but the text is to be expounded so as to comprehend every age of men, and the term [all nations] is to comprehend the whole of every nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is clear by comparing <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. with <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. that [<hi>make disciples all nations</hi>] answers to [<hi>preach the Gospel to every creature</hi>] which later term is in shew more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive then [<hi>make disciples all nations</hi>] But I suppose Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> will not be so absurd as to conceive that any other than of humane kind are meant thereby, nor that any other of them are meant thereby than those that were capable of hearing and understanding it, me thinks he should not conceive Christ bid them preach the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100457:67"/>
Gospel to every deaf man, every natural fool, or mad man that have at no time use of reason, or men that wilfully would not hear: yea methinks Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> should yield further, that when Christ bids them preach the Gospel to every man that is fit to hear, he did not intend to charge them, that they must preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel so as that every intelligent person of mankind in the world must hear it from their mouth: For then it had bin their sin being a breach of Christs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, if every person of natural understanding, whether of Jews or Gentiles, did not hear the Gospel from them; which must have tied them either to sin, or else to search out every Countrey, Continent, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Island be it never so small, every house in every City, village, wilderness, and to preach Christ to them, wherever they were, which had been according to the course of ordinary humane abilities altogether impossible for them to do. I conceive Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> will yield that in what sense it is meant <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>the Gospel was preached to every creature under heaven,</hi> that is it was preached to all sorts of persons that were hearers without difference of Jews or Gentiles, in the same sense Christ bids them [preach the Gospel to every creature] &amp; [make disciples all nations] being the same command as the comparing the texts shews. If [every creature] be not meant of every creature universally and distributively, but of any sort or number of men indefinitely, to whom they might and it was fit to preach, in like manner in the same command thus expressed [disciple all nations] by [all nations] are not meant <hi>omnes gentes totaliter totae,</hi> all nations whole and wholly, but any persons indifferently in any nation whom they might, and were fit to be made disciples by preaching, and to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them that were professing disciples of Christ so made, which is the only sense that the success by grace attained to makes good. Neither did the Apostles in the event preach the Gospel to every humane person capable of hearing and understanding, they came not to every Village, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le, civil or barbarous, sure not to every house, yea sometimes they were restrained, as <hi>Paul</hi> from preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Asia, Bithynia, Acts</hi> 16. 6, 7. nor was there ever by the Apostles or any other the Gospel preached so successfully as that there was ever one whole nation, I mean <hi>totaliter tota,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending every individual humane person of that nation, discipled thereby, so as that every one of the nation, not one excepted, did
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100457:68"/>
upon hearing the Gospel, freely, or of their own accord, soberly, or in their right wits, seriously, or not in jest, understandingly, or knowing what they spake, become disciples of Jesus, confessing him to be the Christ the Son of the living God.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> goes on <hi>Vindic. foederis</hi> pag. 195. [<q>And as it is against the letter of the text, so it is plainly against our Saviours scope and end in giving this Commission. Mr. <hi>T. Examen page</hi> 130. saith, This enlargement unto all nations in this place was in opposition to the restriction <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 5. now in that nation to which there they were limited, the whole of the nation was in covenant, all the Land was the Land of <hi>Immanuel, Isa.</hi> 8. 8. And consequently so it was to be in other nations by vertue of this happy inlargement, or else the opposition is utterly taken away, the meaning of the words clouded, and the Apostles at a losse for understanding of them; for having spent their pains before in a nation all disciples, and now having a commission for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipling of all nations, how shall they understand the words, unlesse the whole of the nation where they come are to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled?</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The nation in which the Apostles according to the commission <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 5. 6. before spent their pains, were the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israel, and to say <hi>that nation were all disciples,</hi> understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it of disciples of Christ, and of every person of that nation, is to say the snow is black; For the contrary is manifest by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Scripture <hi>John</hi> 1. 11. &amp; 7. 5, 48. &amp; 9. 28, 29. &amp; 10. 20. &amp; 12. 37 38. But, saith he, <hi>The whole of the nation was in Covenant,</hi> I grant that the whole of the nation were in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants at <hi>Horeb, Exodus</hi> 19. and in the plains of <hi>Moab</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> his edicts from God <hi>Deu.</hi> 29. But what is this to prove that the Apostles spent their pains in a nation all disciples, every person or persons, even the infants of that nation were disciples of Christ. Were all of the Jewish nation when the Apostles preached to them, disciples of Christ, because in <hi>Moses</hi> his time many hundreds of years before all were engaged in the covenants at <hi>Horeb,</hi> and the plains of <hi>Moab</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> authority? It is but a new non-sense gibberish to make these terms synonimous to be disciples of Christ, and to be in covenant according to the manner of the Jewes being in covenant. And the reason of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100457:68"/>
Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> is as frivolous, <hi>All the Land was the Land of</hi> Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 8. 8. therefore <hi>The whole of the nation were in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that nation were all disciples</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p>For first it is plain that [<hi>the Land of Immanuel</hi>] there is not the people, but the ground or earth they inhabited, because it is that, <hi>The breadth of which the King of Assyria did fill with his wings,</hi> that is his forces, and <hi>did pass through.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. How doth Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> prove that it was called <hi>The Land of</hi> Immanuel, because <hi>the whole of the nation was in Covenant?</hi> It might be called <hi>Immanuels</hi> land, when the <hi>Assyrians, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans,</hi> and other strangers inhabited it, <hi>Israel</hi> being expelled, because of Gods title to it, and the people might and shall be in covenant when they shall not be in the Land.</p>
            <p>3. But it is in my apprehension a meer whimzy, to infer the whole of the nation was in covenant in <hi>Isaiahs</hi> days, therefore the nation of the Jewes were all disciples of Christ when the Apostles spent their pains in preaching according to the commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>4. There is no less dotage in the rest of his frivolous speech, that it [<q>is plainly against out Saviours scope and end in giving the commission Mat. 28. 19. to understand, make disciples in (<hi>I said of</hi>) all nations, that if the whole of the nation be not in covenant in other nations as in the Land of <hi>Immanuel</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this happy enlargement, the opposition is utterly taken away, the meaning of the words clouded, and the Apostles at a losse for the understanding of them.</q>]</p>
            <p>All which are but vain words. The meaning is plain enough, as I conceive, it was understood so by the Apostles, and hath been so by Expositors, as I have shewed, even by the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of the Paedobaptists, without any such construction as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> makes.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> goes on thus. [<q>And hereto accord the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Scripture, for the calling of the nations of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, God shall enlarge <hi>Iaphet,</hi> and he shall dwell in the tents of <hi>Sem, Gen.</hi> 9. 27.</q> 
               <hi>Sem</hi> was wholly in covenant not by pieces and parcells, but universally in covenant, <hi>Iaphet</hi> is to come in succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into covenant in like latitude; <hi>Psal.</hi> 28. Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100457:69"/>
parts of the Earth for thy possession. It is not some among the nations of the heathen that are to be the inheritance of Christ, but the heathen. To which agrees <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 15. The Kingdomes of the Earth shall become the Kingdomes of the Lord and of his Christ; <hi>Immanuel</hi> of old had one, now he shall have more Kingdomes; And they become his no other way, than by disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling; Gods Ministers are his men of War for subduing and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. and Kingdoms are promised them, not some in a Kingdom. <hi>Alexander</hi> would not sit down with such a conquest, neither would Jesus Christ. If to possess some in a Kingdome be to possess a Kingdom, then Antichrist of long time hath had his Kingdom; All Kings shall bow down before him, all Nations shall serve him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. 11. All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee O Lord, and shall glorify thy name, <hi>Psal.</hi> 86. 9. Thou shalt call a nation which thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 55. 5. There God calls the nation, and the nation doth answer Gods call. In that day Israel shall be a third with <hi>Egypt,</hi> and with <hi>Assyria,</hi> even a blessing in the midst of the Land, whom the Lord shall blesse, saying, Blessed be <hi>Egypt</hi> my people, and <hi>Assyria</hi> the work of my hands, and <hi>Israel</hi> my inheritance. There <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Assyria</hi> are in equipage with <hi>Israel,</hi> all three sister-Churches; <hi>Israel</hi> without any preheminence, either Israel then was not a nation of Disciples, a nation wholly within covenant, or else there are to be national Churches, the whole of the nation to be discipled and brought into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith, <hi>The prophecies of Scripture accord hereto, that</hi> Mat. 28. 19. <hi>they were to make all in a nation dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the whole of the nation was to be discipled, and that the words were not otherwise to be understood.</hi> If this reason were of force, where any thing is said of the nation it must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the whole of the nation, of every person in it or of it, even the infants. Which how monstrous and wild a conceit it is will appear by multitudes of instances. Matth. 21. 43. <hi>The Kingdom of God shall be given to a nation</hi> (contradistinguished to the Jews) <hi>bringing forth the fruits of it:</hi> If Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> say right, there is a prophecy of a nation, the whole whereof every

particular, even infans should bring forth the fruits of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 9. <hi>Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name sake,</hi> that is, the whole of all the nations, and if so, then of the Christians even themselves, who are a part of the nations. Besides, if this were the meaning, the prophecy of Christ would be contradictory to the prophecies Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> brings, in the latitude in which he expounds the word [<hi>nations</hi>] Mat. 24. 7. <hi>Nation shall rise up against Nation, and Kingdom against Kingdom,</hi> that is, if Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ile dictates were ought worth, the whole of the Nation and Kingdom, even the infants, should rise up against the whole of another Nation and Kingdom, even the infants. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18. <hi>God hath given repentance to the Gentiles, or nations,</hi> that is, according to the rate of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> expositions, the whole of the nations, even the infants. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 3. <hi>The conversion of the Nations,</hi> that is, of the whole of the nations, even the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>All the nations upon whom my name is called,</hi> that is, the whole of the nations, even the infants. The instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are so many to shew the futility of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> reasoning, that I hope either he himself will discern his folly, and those that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify him, his weakness herein, or else me thinks the impudence of such reasoning should be exploded.</p>
            <p>But to shew further the vanity of his dictating, rather than dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, He mentions <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 27. as a prophecy of the calling of the Gentiles, but he takes it as presupposed, but proves it not; and what exceptions ly against it will appear in that which follows in answer to Mr. <hi>Cobbet.</hi> And then he saith, <hi>Sem was wholly in Covenant, not by pieces and parcels, universally in Covenant,</hi> if he mean it of the Jews, in the sense wherein being in covenant is as much as being disciples of Christ by profession, it is most palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly false: for they disclaimed it, <hi>John</hi> 9. 28. But were it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that they were in Covenant wholly, yet where is there a word to prove that <hi>Japhet</hi> is to come in succession into covenant in like latitude.</p>

Besides, what sense is there in these words [<hi>some of the nations of the heathen</hi>]?

For then at his comming he should have no enemies to put down, none to condemn. No doubt Antichrist, yea and the Devil too, hath had of long time a Kingdom, some its likely in most or every Kingdom, yea even where Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath been.

of malignancy to me, if not vanity also in the Censurer and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator. And ill will seldome speaks well: He may bestow his censure more rightly elsewhere. I say still, it is a shameful thing to abuse Scriptures as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> doth to understand by nations the whole of the nation, even infants, when, if they be so understood the Scripture should in that sense be most palpably false; for it should foretell a thing that neither was nor will be. I conceive myself not ignorant of what Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith, and though I grant all he saith, yet it covers no part of his shame in abusing the text. For even in his allusion, the whole of the nation, females and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, did not appear before the Lord, and therefore were the extent of the prophecies as large as that they are conceived to allude to, yet the whole of the nation, even infants, were not included. And this is enough to shew the futility of his talk about discipling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which in his sense never was. Nor is there one reason gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> for his exposition, and reasons sufficient are given for mine, and I may retort Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> words upon him, <hi>All indifferent men may challenge their reason that heed him,</hi> and when I am taken with such frivolous dictates as his are, I expect my friends should conclude that I doat.</p>

But this is so sorry a shift, so contrary to the notation and use of the word in the New Testament in the text, to the Apostles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice which best expounds Christs commission, to their own or fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows confession elsewhere, that it looks like the putting a face on a thing when there is small hope to hold it.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless because such men as Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> have put this text in the front to prove infant-baptism by it, I shall lay down sundry arguments against that abuse of the text, and then examine what they say about this.

               </hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 92. acknowledgeth it to have <hi>denomination from the act</hi> of learning. Mr. <hi>Blake Vindic. foederis pag.</hi> 205. <hi>They are still stiled in New Testament-Scriptures, Believers from the faith that they profess, Saints from the holiness to which they stand engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Disciples from the doctrine which they profess to learn, and Christians from him whose they are, whom they serve, and from whom they expect salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence I argue. They are not disciples as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. who do not learn or profess the learning of Christs doctrine; But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants do not learn Christs doctrine; <hi>Ergo</hi> they are not disciples. The <hi>major</hi> is proved from the notation and use of the word before confessed, and intimated in that speech of the Apostle <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which shews, that to be a Disciple is to be one that learns Christ. The <hi>minor</hi> is manifest, from the want of capacity to learn, and from sense, to which it is apparent that they regard not, heed not, understand not any thing of Christ, as by other signs, so by the difficulty to teach them when they come to years.</p>
            <p>To this what Mr. <hi>M.</hi> replies is answered before. Mr. <hi>B. part</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. saith <hi>You must understand that one may be called a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> 1. <hi>in a large sense relatively, as being of the number of those that belong to Christ as Master and King of the Church, and destinated or devoted to his oversight and rule, and teaching, for the future: thus believers infants are disciples, of which I shall give you proof anone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Sometimes the word is taken in a narrower sense for those who are actually learners. But commonly applied to men at age it includeth both relation and subordination, and also actual lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:100457:72"/>
               <hi>but the former principally: but applied to infants it inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the relation at present and actual learning, as one end of it intended for the future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, 1. I take it for granted that it is sometimes taken for those who are actually learners.</p>
            <p>2. That the term [disciple] commonly applied to men of age includes actual learning.</p>
            <p>3. That applyed to infants it intendeth the relation as present, and actual learning as one end of it intended for the future.</p>
            <p>Wherein letting passe the uncouth expression that [the word in tendeth an end] and taking his meaning, I observe,</p>
            <p>First, that he makes the term [disciples] to be meant in one manner, when it is said of men of age, and another when of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. Which me thinks is as absurd as that he chargeth Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> with <hi>pag.</hi> 300. that he made one end of baptism in the aged, another in infants, one covenant to parents, and another to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as if the aged were one sort of disciples meant <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. and yet the same word includes another sort of disciples in a clean different sense. It would be known of which sort of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he understands it, for certainly there is but one sort of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples there mentioned: and if he will stand to his words in that place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he must understand it of disciples upon instruction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he sets down the sense of a word, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth no place for the present where the distinction is put, but refers us to another place, which his Reader must seek, and when he hath sought all his book he shall find but one text <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. and that miserably abused by him. Of which in its place.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That he acknowledgeth <hi>page</hi> 92<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and here, that the denomination is from the disciples act of learning, yet will have it imagined that an infant may be a disciple without his own actual learning, onely from his belonging to Christ by Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and mens destination and devoting to learn hereafter. But it is to me unconceivable that the denomination which is from the act inherent in the person should be without the act inherent in the person from some acts of another, and those acts not putting the form denominating in actual being, yea when oftentimes the form denominating is never in act. For by Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> doctrine, Gods covenant, and mans devoting make a disciple, and yet I think not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100457:72"/>
the covenant, and mans devoting, many thousands, yea the most part of infants whom he would have baptized never actually learn by reason of death or disaffection, yea many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly renounce it. Were Gods covenant absolute to every true believers infant that he shall be a disciple, yet for the present it doth put nothing actually in the person to whom the promise is made, no more than election doth put actually any thing in the elected. <hi>Praedestinatio ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The covenant is to a person afore he is born, as to <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> shall it be said, that afore they were born they were actually disciples, and had actual Church right? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse they might be called disciples or believers in possibility, but not actually. Gods election and promise denominate a man elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and a child of the promise (which are terms of the same extent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8.) but not justifyed, converted, regenerated, or actually a believer, disciple, or visible Church member. But this is yet more in consistent with Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> bypotheses, who when he assigns the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which he will have to make an infant actually a disciple, makes it onely the conditional covenant of grace (as I shall shew hereafter) and that covenant is upon condition of faith, and this he will have to belong to all men whether believers or unbelievers, and me thinks he should not say all men are actually disciples, visible Church members, though God hath made that covenant with them which he seals in baptism, which he often saies to be only the conditional covenant, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eckons it my prime errour that misleads me in the point of baptism, that I make baptism seal the absolute covenant of grace. And yet he chargeth Mr. <hi>Bedford p.</hi> 300. 301. as with an absurdity following his tenet that baptism should seal one covenat to the Father, another to the son. If then the covenant make not others actually disciples, then neither insants. <hi>Idem quà idem semper facit idem.</hi> Again, a conditional covenant cannot make an actual disciple, till the condition which is actual
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100457:73"/>
faith be put. <hi>Conditionale nihil ponit in esse.</hi> Therfore the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditional covenant sealed in baptism cannot make an actual disciple. Nor is it to be said, the parents faith is the condition of the covenant for the child.</p>
            <p>For 1. it being not the condition of the covenant to the parent that another should believe for him, neither is it the condition for the child, except Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will fall into the absurdity he chargeth on Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> that one covenant should be to the Father, and another to the child, sealed in baptism.</p>
            <p>2. A child, the father believing, shall be actually a disciple before it is born, for a conditional proposition, the condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put, becomes absolute. Now it is his child, and he believing afore it is born; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner it may be said of anothers devoting or destina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an infant to be a disciple, that is no act of the person deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, it can only make a disciple intentionally; a persons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting is but his wish, or desire, or promise, and shall that make a child actually a disciple? yea destinating and devoting is before the child is conceived or born, as <hi>Hannah</hi> did devote <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> was <hi>Samuel</hi> therefore actually a disciple and visible Church-member afore he was born? many of those whom the parents destinate and devote to be actual learners in after time, yet never are such: yea many of them are express disclaimers and opposers of that doctrine; shall these be called actual disciples, from their parents wish, or hopes, or promise?</p>
            <p>Again, he makes the term [<hi>disciple</hi>] <hi>applied to an insant to note a relation present, actual learning as one end of it intended for the future.</hi> I confess that [disciple] notes a relation between the teacher and person taught, yet it seems to note a passion as its form or quiddity, so that if any should ask who is a disciple, I should say, one that hath learned, and what it is to be discipled, it is to be taught or learned, and so doth import a passion, and is to be put in that predicament, and the relation is as they say <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundùm dici,</hi> not <hi>secundùm esse.</hi> But were it granted that the whole essence of a disciple did consist in relation, I would fain know what shall be the foundation of his relation. Logicians say, To relation there is requisite a foundation, as begetting, two terms, as Father and Son, and a respect arising between them from
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100457:73"/>
that foundation, as fatherhood It is an unheard-of thing that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation should be without a foundation, a Father without begerting, an actual Father without actual begetting. It is true, a man may be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Future learning, being acording to Mr. <hi>B. the end intended,</hi> is not in being, perhaps will never be, and therefore it is in my apprehension a most illogical and absurd conceit which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath hatched, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon us such a notion of a Disciple, as supposeth a relation without a foundation, and contrary to <hi>Grammar,</hi> to call a person a Disciple who hath learned nothing, no not so much as to know or own his Teacher. To say a person may be a Scholar afore he learns, serves not turn, to avoyd the force of this Reason: For the term [Scholar] coming from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, leasure or vacation from other exercise, may be without actual learning, but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>hath learned,</hi> and Disciple <hi>à discendo,</hi> from <hi>Learning;</hi> and therefore as it is absurd to call one learned or a Learner, without Learning, so it is absurd to call one a Disciple without actual learning. But I rest not on the notation alone, but proceed to the use of the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>a Disciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I argue thus. The word [<hi>Disciple</hi>] <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. is to be understood as it is understood all along the <hi>New Testament;</hi> But all along the <hi>New Testament</hi> it is applied to those that addicted themselves to some as Teachers, followed them, learned of them, no where to an insant, who doth none of these. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants are not Disciples, meant <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. The <hi>major</hi> is plain from the rule of understanding words, that it is to be according to the use of them. The <hi>minor</hi> is proved thus. The <hi>Disciples of Christ</hi> are <hi>understood as the Disciples of Iohn and the Pharisees, Luke</hi> 5. 33. as the <hi>Disciples of Moses, Iohn</hi> 9, 28. <hi>of the perverters, Acts</hi> 20. 30. But in all these places, and in all the rest, they are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Disciples of <hi>John,</hi> the Pharisees, <hi>Moses,</hi> and the perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who addicted themselves to them, followed them, learned
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100457:74"/>
of them, no where an infant, who doth none of these; Therefore the term [Disciples of Christ] notes onely such, and no where an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant.</p>

If he mean it in another, sense, he should shew how an infant may be said to be virtually a believer, and prove that sense out of Scripture, and not abuse men with a nonsense distinction, if he mean to cleer truth.

            <p>6. That infants of believers are not Disciples appointed to be baptized, <hi>Matth</hi> 28. 19. is proved from the means of making Disciples, to wit, by preaching the Gospel to them, as appears by <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. For what is <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Make Disciples of all Nations,</hi> is <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Preach the Gospel to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Whence I argue, Those Disciples which Christ hath ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily appointed to be baptized, an such as are made such by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gosepl to them. Rightly saith Mr. <hi>Collings Vindic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. pag.</hi> 145. <hi>How i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> one made a disciple, but by conversion? and when is a man converted, but when he is brought to believe?</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:100457:75"/>
But infants of believers are not made disciples by preaching of the Gospel, as is of it self manifest, and acknowledged by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse party, who make them Disciples by an imaginary Covenant, and their parents profession; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not Disciples appointed by Christ ordinarily to be baptized.</p>
            <p>7. Those are appointed to be baptized, and no other, whom the Apostles did baptize, for the Apostles practice shews how they understood Christs Commission, and rightly saith Mr. <hi>Norton, respon. ad Apollon. c.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 34. 35. <hi>Religio est nobis judicare Apostolos in baptizando observàsse regulam à Christo latam Matth.</hi> 28. 16. <hi>religion binds us to judge the Apostses to have observed in baptizing the rule made by Christ Matth.</hi> 28. 19. But they baptized no other than repenting and believing Disciples of Christ, no infants, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To say that in Christs and the Apostles daies there were no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants which they might baptize, is neither true, nor consistent with their own allegations of <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 13, 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 15. To say that at first gathering the Church they were not to do it, but after, is to make them faulty in not observing the commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christ, as they expound it, that even in the first planting of the Church they were to baptize disciples immediately and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely such, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> speaks; and to hold that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles practice is not our pattern, and that the first Church was not best ordered, though it was indeed the purest reformed Church, and therefore the solemn covenant ties us to endeavour the establishing the worship of God according to it. To say, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were baptized by them but not recorded, is without proof, or any likelyhood of truth, and tends to derogate from the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and perfection of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Out of all which I conclude, that infants, even of believers, are not disciples appointed <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. ordinarily to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> allegations in his Dialogue, the first chapter, to prove infants Disciples, are shewed to be insufficient.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AGainst this Mr. <hi>John Cotton</hi> in his <hi>Dialogue,</hi> intituled, <hi>The Grounds and Ends of Baptism,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>chapter</hi> 1. disputes thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That all the children of the faithful (or which is all one, all the children of the Church, for the Church is a congregation of the faithfull) that they are all of them disciples, may appear by the testimony of the Prophet</hi> Esay, <hi>who speaking of the times of the Church in the New Testament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All thy children (saith he) shall be taught of God,</hi> Esa. 54. 13. <hi>and if they be taught of God then are they disciples, for that is the meaning of the word disciples. Disciples are taught or learnt of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is supposed but not proved that the tossed <hi>v.</hi> 11. is meant of the Church of the N. T. and not of the people of the Jews after the Captivity.</p>
            <p>2. The phrase of [<hi>children of the Church</hi>] is not a Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase, nor that I know is the Church made a mother, though <hi>Jerusalem, which is above be called the Mother of us all,</hi> Gal. 4. 26. which seems to be meant of the Evangelical Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>3. It is supposed that to be children of the Church, and to be children of the faithful, are one, yet Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> in his <hi>Just Vindic.</hi> makes them only the Church seed, who are children of persons inchurched, otherwise, though the parents be faithful, yet they are not the Church seed. Besides to be [children of the Church] is not all one with to be natural children of believers. For the Church doth not beget or bring forth by natural seed, but by spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, to wit, the word of God, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 23. and children are begotten in the womb of the Church by the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said <hi>to be born after the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 4. 29. by the promise or covenant of the <hi>free woman,</hi> v. 30.

            <p>4. It is supposed that the Church whose children those are is the visible church as such.</p>
            <p>Whereas 1. in Scripture no Church is called the Mother but <hi>Hierusalem above,</hi> Gal. 4. 26. <hi>which is the mother of us all,</hi> and that is either the Evangelical covenant, or the invisible Church.

Our Lord Christ where he cites this passage of the Prophet, <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. applies it to those that <hi>are drawn of the Father, and whom he will raise up at the last day,</hi> ver. 44. who are only the children of the invisible Church. <hi>Diodati annot.</hi> on <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. <hi>all not all and every particular person, as it appears by</hi> ver. 44. &amp; 65 <hi>but all the elect and children of God.</hi> No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> shift, rather than answer, of any moment, when he saith, <hi>For look what promises are made to the invisible Church, they are for their sakes offered to all the members of the visible Churches, whereof the lively members are the chief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 1. He doth alter the term in the objection, which was [<hi>made</hi>] not [<hi>offered</hi>] wherein both he, and Mr. <hi>George Philips</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, deal not rightly, so speaking as that it may be taken, that <hi>to be in covenant; to have the covenant made,</hi> is all one with <hi>to have it offered:</hi> Whereas it is offered not only to the children of the visible Church, but to many professed unbelievers, as <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 46. Now this answering is a way to delude Readers, when the objection is, that the promise is made only to the children of the invisible Church, to answer <hi>the promises are also offered to the members of the visible,</hi> and when it is expected that it should be proved the promise is made to conclude <hi>that it is offered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> dare not say that promise to be made to any but those that are children of the invisible Church, and therefore it can be meant of no other, and so no other taught of the Lord and disciples, which will not reach to the natural children of visible in churched believers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:100457:76"/>3. [<hi>Thy children</hi>] is not all one with [<hi>thy infants</hi>] Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> denies not, that the meaning in part may be of men of years, and if so no necessity to understand it of infants, and then his argument falls, which is to prove infants to be disciples.</p>
            <p>4. Besides, our Lord Christ, where he cites <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, leaves out the word [<hi>children</hi>] and applies the teaching of God onely to true believers. <hi>Omnes,</hi> saith <hi>Grotius, quibus ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Evangelii annuntiatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Were it granted Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> that all believers infants were taught of God by secret indiscernable teaching, yet this being such, cannot be applyed to the disciples meant <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. who are disciples by preaching the Gospel, and known to be such by their profession.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> tells us, <hi>The infants or children of the faithful are not to be excluded from the number of the children of the Church. For the same Prophet speaking of the same Church, fetcheth in infants among the blessed ones of the Church, and blessed with such spiritual light and life from Christ, as if they had lived an hundred years in the Church</hi> Esa. 65. 20. <hi>There shall be no more (saith he) then<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

How shall the child dy as at an hundred years old, but that he is so well instructed, and inlightned by Christ, and thereby as capable of enterance into heavenly glory, as a grown disciple of an hundred years old?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ans. 1. Were M. <hi>Cottons</hi> paraphrase granted, yet the conclusion followes not thence, that therefore infants are disciples to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. or as he speaks, <hi>children of the Church.</hi> For <hi>to be so well instructed, and enlightned by Christ, and thereby as capable of entrance into heavenly glory as a grown disciple of an hundred years old,</hi> may agree by extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration to one that is only of the invisible Church, and not of the visible Church as disciples meant <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>

            <p>But, saith he, <q>Whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God, as a little child (to wit, as a little child receiveth it, for so much the Grammer construction requireth) he shall in no wise enter therein.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is untrue, that the Grammar construction requireth, that it should be understood thus, that a little child receiveth the Kingdom of God, but only this is meant, that none shall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of God, but such as have such an humble mind, free from ambition, as a little child hath, as our Lord himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>But, saith he, <q>Christs testimony of them and his carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, shew that little children born in the Church are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted disciples of Christ, and therefore commanded to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with their believing parents.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> himself confesseth, that it doth not appear that their Fathers, who brought them, were baptized themselves; how are they then said to be children born in the Church, or to be baptized according to rule? wherefore his own words shew it to be uncertainly, and therefore insufficiently alleged to prove that the infants of believers are among the blessed ones of Christ, such as of whom his Church and and Kingdom consisteth, and so come under the fellowship of his disciples, whom Christ commandeth to be baptized. And in very truth in that there is nothing appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, whether the parents brought them or others, whether the parents were disciples or not: nor is any thing at all ascribed to the parents but to Christs indulgence in this action, and it appears Christ did not command them to be baptized, nor spake any thing as intituling them to discipleship and baptism, though
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100457:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he said, <hi>Of such is the Kingdom of God,</hi> this text is not only impertinently brought to prove the discipleship and baptizability of believers infants, but also makes to the contrary, that infants are not disciples nor baptizable, sith if they had been so Christ would have so declared on this occasion, which was opportune for it.</p>
            <p>But there is yet another argument in that chapter of Mr. <hi>Cottons,</hi> and it is to this effect, <q>That the Commission <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points believing parents to be baptized, and would infer, that in Gods account, and in Scripture phrase, parents themselves are not reputed of God to be baptized, if their children remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But will any man believe Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in this, that <q>in Scripture phrase parents are not reputed of God to be baptized if their children remain unbaptized?</q> Scripture speaks of thousands baptized, and mentions not the baptizing of any of their children under that relation as their children, shall we believe Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> that those phrases of Scripture, that say they were baptized, speak false? and that they were not reputed of God to be baptized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no mention of their childrens baptism? many belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were baptized their children being infidels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 35. were not the parents reputed in Gods account baptized because the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were against it? But let us hear Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> goodly proof in his own words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Surely, <hi>saith he,</hi> in the old Testament a man was accounted of God as uncircumcised himself, if his children were uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised:</q> for so it is written in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48. that if a man will come and keep the Passeover, all the males in his house must be circumcised: and the reason given, is, for no uncircumcised per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shall eat thereof, which plainly argueth, that a man is uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised himself, and (as an uncircumcised person) is to be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Passeover, until all his males be circumcised. If then our Lords Supper come in the room of the Passeover, and our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism in the room of circumcision, look as he that had not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his males was accounted as one uncircumcised himself, and so to be debarred from the Passeover, so he who hath not baptized his children is accounted of God as not baptized himself, and so to be debarred from the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:100457:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That baptism and the Lords Supper come in the room of Circumcision, and the Passeover, is often said, but never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But if it were granted (though I still deny it) yet Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> inference is not good, till it be also yielded, that every rule of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and the Passeover is a rule to us about Baptism and the Lords Supper, which me thinks he should not maintain. Nor do I think he can give any reason why in this the rule should bind more than in others. Yea did he consider it, he might have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that if the proportion be stretched according to this rule, no parent must be counted baptized, nor to eat the Lords Supper, except he had not only all his children baptized; but also all his Servants. For the males to be circumcised were not only children, but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants also, and so those must be baptized who are out of covenant, and a national church must be fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>med like to the Jews, which I think were hated of him as the blind and the lame were of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> soul. And methinks it should follow, that if it happen (as it may happen many waies, especially in new <hi>England,</hi> where many baptized persons may not have their children baptized, because the parents are not Church-members) the infants be unbaptized the parent is to be baptized again, because counted of God, and according to Scripture phrase, if Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> dictates hold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized.</p>
            <p>Which being absurd, I count his inference (If therefore you forbid baptism to children, you evacuate the baptism of their parents, and so make the Commandment of God, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the Apostles, and the baptism of believers, of none effect, together with that other passage of his <hi>pag.</hi> 4. If godly parents do withdraw their children from the covenant, and the seal of the Covenant, they do make void (as much as in them lyeth) the Covenant, both to themselves, and to their children also. And then will the Lord cut off such souls from his people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14.) to be meer Mormoes or bugbears to fright children, though I am afraid they are used for a further evil end to incite Magistrates a gainst Antipaedo baptists, and to justify their hard dealing with then in new <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>

            <p>2. I grant the wives are not necessarily excluded from being disciples, nor children by the enumeration <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 5. nor are they necessary to be included: but how doth Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> prove the the children, babes carried in armes, or such little ones as had not abilities of understanding?

               <p>Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> allegation of Acts 15. 10. to prove infants disciples is fully answered &amp; his arguments retorted.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>ALL that are Christs disciples ordinarily ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; But some infants are Christs disciples; Therefore some infants ordinarily ought to be baptized.</hi> He tells us how he means by [<hi>disciples</hi>] which meaning of his is before proved not to be the meaning of the text, and then saith, <hi>His major is evident in the text from the conjunction of the two commands: Go make me disciples, baptizing them. If any shall be so quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some against the plain tezt to say, It is not all disciples that they were commanded to baptize, but only all that were made disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and this making was onely by teaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I answer,</hi> 1. <hi>If I prove infants Disciples, I sure prove ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were made so, or else they they had never been so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:100457:80"/>2. <hi>By teaching the parents and children were both made disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the parents directly, the infants remotely or mediately: if they be proved once to be disciples, it will easily follow it is by this way. He that converteth the parent, maketh both him and his infants disciples incompleat or in title; This therefore lies on the proof of the Minor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>But I would say more to this, but that Mr.</hi> T. (<hi>as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi>) <hi>hath in his Sermons professed, That if we will prove that infants are Christs Disciples, he will acknowledge that they ought to be baptized: the like he granted to me; and well he may.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is well Mr. <hi>B.</hi> grants that to <hi>go make disciples, baptizing them, are two Commands,</hi> and that <hi>there is a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them,</hi> whence it follows, that he appoints not baptizing till the making of disciples, nor of any but disciples made as Christ appointed.</p>
            <p>2. It is no quarrel against the plain text, but the very plain doctrine of the text to say, <hi>It is not all disciples (visibly or invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, directly or remotely, compleatly, or incompleatly, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or in title) that they were commanded to baptize,</hi> but only all that were made disciples, and this making was only by teaching <hi>or preaching the Gospel to them Mark</hi> 16. 15.</p>
            <p>3. It is true, I have often granted, that if it be proved infants are Christs disciples made by preaching to them the Gospel, they ought to be baptized. But when I granted this, it did not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my thoughts, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would ever have hatched, much lesse have printed such wild nonsense fancies as here he doth, of a disciple by title without learning, like a King of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> without reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the Popes Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> without overseeing, of teaching remotely in the Parents conversion without any personal teaching in themselves. For which fancies he neither brings a text of Scripture, nor any approved Author, nor any other besides himself thus speaking. Such distinctions are but meer abuses as are without any instance of such an use of terms. And to shew the grossnesse of this foppery of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> which a School<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> boy may easily discern that hath gone no further than <hi>Qui mihi discipul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s.</hi> I argue thus,</p>
            <p>1. If he that converteth the parent maketh the infant a disciple,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100457:80"/>
then either because the infant is an infant, and then evrey infant should be made a disciple by that conversion; or because his child, and then every child is made a disciple, yea though he be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed infidel; or both, and then it would be shewed what grant there is to the child while infant, which ceaseth when grown up: where the relation of a disciple in his sense is appropriated only to infant child. Yea all the plea is, <hi>by teaching the parents and children were both made disciples,</hi> therefore this relation comes from being a child of such a one: But the professed infidel child is the child of the Father; therefore also a disciple in title, and to be baptized after Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> doctrine.</p>
            <p>2. If children be made disciples remotely and mediately accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the command <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. in that the parent is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that the teaching of the parent is the teaching of the child, then it follows, he that teacheth the Father hath done his duty of teaching, though he teach not the child himself, and so a preacher need not at all go and catechize each child but only preach to parents. It would be ill with <hi>Kederminster</hi> if it should be so there. But this follows according to Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> exposition of Christs command <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
            <p>3. It will follow as well, that he that baptizeth the Father bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth the child, for there is a conjunction of these commands, and the baptizing is to be correspondent to the teaching; if then the teaching the parent is the teaching the child, then is the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the parent the baptizing the child according to the command, and so the command is only to baptize in another him who is taught in another, and it is a gross transgression of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to baptize him in himself, who is only a disciple in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>4. Forasmuch as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doth not limit the childs being a disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or teaching remotely to the next parents being converted, he that shall teach the Grandfather, great Grandfather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the child, makes him a disciple, yea according to his doctrine <hi>pag.</hi> 101. he that converts the Master of the house makes his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and those that are at his dispose, though not his children, (whom he would have baptized) disciples, for sure he would not have them baptized that are not disciples. Now I appeal to any man of understanding whether this be not as gross and pernicious
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100457:81"/>
a delusion as <hi>Hart</hi> the Jesuit held (so much exagitated in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference by Dr. <hi>Raynold ch.</hi> 2. <hi>divis.</hi> 7.) <hi>That the Pope preacheth by another,</hi> to say he that teacheth the parent teacheth the child, Assuredly had I ever dreamed that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had such phantastick, if not frantick notions, I had denyed his <hi>major,</hi> and do now expresly deny it in his sense, <hi>All that are Christs disciples incompleatly, in title only, remotely by the parents conversion without their own ordinarily ought to be baptized,</hi> and expect it to be proved by him <hi>ad Graecas Calendas.</hi> Nor would I have laid the stress of the argument on the proof of his <hi>Minor,</hi> if I had understood his deceitful gibberish, by which he detestably abused many people, and perverted Christs words. But it is my lot to answer such a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and I follow him.</p>
            <p>He next goes about to prove his <hi>minor</hi> thus, [<q>That some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are Christs disciples, and so called by the Holy Ghost is most evident to any that will not grosly pervert the text or overlook it, in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. why tempt ye God to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear? now who were these disciples? no doubt those on whom the false Teachers would have laid the yoke. And what was that yoke? It is plain it was Circumcision, as necessary and as enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to keep the Law. And whom would they have perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thus to be circumcised? Why both the Parents and Children in that Age, and only the Children in all following Ages ordinarily. So that thus I argu, Those on whose necks the false Teachers would have laid this yoke were Disciples: But some, yea most of those were infants on whose necks they would have laid this yoke: Therefore some Infants are Disciples, and so called here. The <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> is plain in the Text.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> Argument, that <hi>Infants are Christs Disciples,</hi> should not be understood of Disciples in that sense, that Christ appoints Disciples to be baptized, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. Discipleship in Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> sense in title without learning, by remote teaching in the Parents conversion, being a sense unknown to the Scripture, and a meer figment of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> brain, is falsly said to be a scribed to infants by the Holy Ghost, or to have any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Scripture for it: nor do I think any do more <hi>grosly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Text, Acts</hi> 15. 10. or <hi>overloook it more than Mr.</hi> B.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100457:81"/>
But let us look a little nearer on Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> arguings: he premiseth three Questions, and answers them; concerning which I grant his answer to the first, <hi>that those were Disciples on whom the false Teachers would have laid the yoke.</hi> In his second Question and the Answerly sundry fallacies, 1. in that he puts the Question about the yoke what it was; whereas the Question that should have cleared the difficulty had been, what was the putting on of the yoke, (which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doth I fear sophistically omit) the point in question being who are meant by [<hi>Disciples</hi>] and it being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by Mr. <hi>B. Those on whom the false Teachers would have laid the yoke,</hi> the Resolution must be not by knowing barely what the term [<hi>yoke</hi>] imported, but by knowing how they would lay the yoke, or what the act was of the false Teachers, termed, <hi>laying a yoke on their necks.</hi> Were the act effected or attempted, or intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely, it's that we must know what act it was, whether such as infants were the passive subjects of, or whether such onely as persons of age were capable of? And here I conceive two ways they might be said to lay the yoke, one by cutting with their own hand off the little skin of the privy member, either of Parents or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or both, according to the rite of <hi>Moses</hi> Law; the other by teaching, perswading, charging Parents that they and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should be circumcised, or else they should not be saved; the former had been an act of their hands, this latter of their tongues; the former onely can prove infants to be meant by [<hi>Disciples</hi>] if this latter be meant, then infants are not meant by [<hi>Disciples</hi>] for they were not subjects capable of that act. There was no act ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effected or attempted on infants, but onely the act of the hand using an instrument to cut off the skin. If they had attempted to act on infants the later way, by telling sucking children, you are to be circumcised, and to keep <hi>Moses</hi> Law, they had done rather like mad men than cunning Seducers. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself, when in the next words [<hi>And whom would they perswade to be circumcised?</hi>] and when after he confesseth, <hi>that which the false Teachers did, was Teaching,</hi> doth plainly intimate that the false Teachers act, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the yoke, was onely of the tongue, not of the hand, and therefore not infants the passive subject of it, and so not meant by Disciples. Yea, the Text it self clears what their act was, when it says, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>They taught the brethren, v.</hi> 24. <hi>They trouble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>them with words, subverting their souls, saying.</hi> And this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to shew the foppery of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> and others, arguings hence to prove infants Disciples, had they any minde to heed what is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Those onely are meant by Disciples who were Patients or passive subjects of the act of laying on the yoke: that is Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> own <hi>major</hi> in effect: but infants were not such, for they were not taught, nor troubled with words, nor had their souls subverted by the sayings of false Teachers; therefore they were not the Disciples meant <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. 2. Concerning the Answer to the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he lays it down, [<hi>That the yoke was Circumcision, as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and as engaging them to keep the Law,</hi>] it may be meant ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the command concerning Circumcision, and so it is granted that the yoke was Circumcision, that is, the command of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision propounded, and taught as necessary to the Disciples, that they might be saved, and engaging them to keep <hi>Moses</hi> Law; or by Circumcision is meant Circumcision in act, or actual Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, as passively received in the flesh, and this it seems Mr. <hi>B.</hi> understands, sith it was it which was to be put on infants, and it onely, in which sense it is not meant <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 3. The terms [<hi>as necessary, and ingaging them to keep</hi> Moses <hi>Law</hi>] may be understood variously, either as necessary and inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them in the opinion of the circumcised, so that the sense is, they would have laid the yoke on the necks of the Disciples, so as that the Disciples should have received circumcision with this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that thereby they were ingaged to keep <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, and in this sense it is true, the yoke was the command of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to beget this opinion, or else in the opinion of the Teachers or Circumcisers onely, and so it is false, that the yoke was actual Circumcision as necessary, and ingaging to keep <hi>Moses</hi> Law, they did not onely teach or circumcise, so as to have an opinion of this necessity, but so as to indeavour to possess those they would lay the yoke on, that it was necessary, and they were ingaged to keep <hi>Moses</hi> Law. As for his Answer to the third Question, according to the plain sense of the words, it is false, <hi>that they would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the children,</hi> I mean infant children, <hi>to be circumcised:</hi> For though they would perswade the Parents to be circumcised, and then to circumcise their children, yet that they would have perswaded the children, that is, that any of them went to an infant
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100457:82"/>
and would have perswaded him to be circumcised, is false, and the thing would have been ridiculous.</p>
            <p>As for the argument from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. as it was framed by Mr. <hi>M.</hi> I did <hi>Exam. pag.</hi> 135. deny the <hi>major,</hi> and gave my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it is not said, they would put it onely on Disciples, it is more probable they endeavoured to put it on the necks of all, whether Disciples or others, as a thing universally necessary to salvation, <hi>v.</hi> 1. which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in his <hi>Defence</hi> overthrows not, but puts it off without answer, onely imagines that then I cannot evince from <hi>Matth.</hi> 3 5, 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42, <hi>&amp;c. that John and Christs Disciples baptized onely penitent believers.</hi> But I presume Mr. <hi>M.</hi> will be better advised than to make it alike argumentative to prove all were Disciples on whom the false Teachers would have put the yoke, from <hi>Acts</hi> 15 10. and to prove that there was Baptism in the New Testament but of penitent believers, from the perpetual course of the history thereof, in the former Disciples being onely mentioned occasionaly in condemning a fact done to them, in the other are set narrations of Acts done in the Church of God, and therefore there would have been a defect in the narration if there had been any other than penitent believers then Baptized,</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> pleads thus, <hi>If any will say, that it is not all, but some of those on whom they would have laid the yoke that are here called disciples, that is onely them at age, I answer, Then it is but some onely whose Circumcision the Apostle and the Synod doth conclude against, that is those of age. For he speaks against laying the yoke on none but Disciples, And then for any thing the Apostle saith, or this Synod, all infants might be circumcised still: which is a most grosse absurdity, when the very business of this Synod was to decree against the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Circumcision and the Law.</hi> To which I replied, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the <hi>major</hi> as expressed by Mr. <hi>M.</hi> thus [<hi>all they upon whose necks those false Teachers would have put the yoke of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision are called Disciples and to be called Disciples</hi>] because I conceived they would by their teaching put a necessity of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision even on unconverted <hi>Jews</hi> who are no Disciples, yea upon all persons whatsoeuer, holding of all sorts of persons that <hi>except they were circumcised and kept the Law of Moses they could not be saved.</hi> And in like sort I deny the <hi>major</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:100457:83"/>
Argument if it be universal, <hi>all those on whose necks the false Teachers would have laid the yoke mentioned Acts</hi> 15. 10. <hi>were Disciples.</hi> Nor is it plain in the Text, there is no more plain in the Text but this, that the persons expressed <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. on whom the false Teachers would have layd the yoke were Disciples. but it doth not follow that they would have layd the yoke on none other than are there expressed, as when it is sayd, <hi>Christ would have gathered the children of Jerusalem, Matth.</hi> 23. 37. though none but the children of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> are there expressed, yet it follows not all are the children of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> whom he would have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. Nor doth that imaginary grosse absurdity follow which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would fasten on this deniall of his <hi>major.</hi> For 1. there are in the Synods letter both <hi>v.</hi> 24. Condemning the false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers Doctrine, and <hi>v.</hi> 28. 29. laying no other burden on them to whom they wrot, plain pasages exempting old and yong from Circumcision, though <hi>v.</hi> 10. were left out. 2. Even in that, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Peter</hi> reproves their putting a yoke on the neck of the aged, he doth determine parents not bound to circumcise their children, and this is a conclusion against Circumcision of infants, as A canon against Priests marriage is a Law against their wives living with them; and the concluding against a practise in some upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reason, to others is a general prohibition, as the Apostles deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2. is a determination against the like in others. But however, this is enough to answer Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> Argument; and some perhaps would yield his <hi>minor,</hi> yet I deny it, and doubt not to shew that in the thing wherein he is most confident, in so much that in his Epistle before his <hi>Saints Everlasting Rest,</hi> he makes me with others play the Devil in accusing my own children as no Disciples, when God saith the contrary, (<hi>O utinam!</hi>) <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. he is an egregious Trifler.</p>
            <p>To prove his <hi>minor,</hi> he thus argues, <hi>I prove it was the Infants also, thus, If it were Infants also whom the false Teachers would have had to be circumcised as necessary, and as engaging to</hi> Moses <hi>Law, then it was infants also on whom they would have laid the yoke; but it was infants also whom they would have had circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, &amp;c. Therefore, &amp;c. The Antecedent is undeniable. But it is the Consequence Mr. T. denieth; for he saith, It is not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision as necessary, and as engaging to</hi> Moses <hi>Law, which was</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:100457:83"/>
               <hi>the yoke, but it was the Doctrine of those Teachers. But was Mr.</hi> T. <hi>of this minde when he wrote these words? Exam. p.</hi> 101.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Should the Conclusion be granted him, <hi>that they were infants also whom the false Teachers would have had to be circumcised, &amp;c.</hi> yet sith he grants, that they would have had the Fathers circumcised, they onely may be meant by [<hi>Disciples</hi>] though Circumcision were yielded to be the yoke. 2. Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is no way necessary, that I know, but as commanded, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to keep <hi>Moses</hi> Law, but as taught, and yielded to. And therefore I know not what sense Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> words have, <hi>that it was infants also whom the false Teachers would have had to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised as necessary, and as engaging to</hi> Moses <hi>Law,</hi> but one of these, they would have them circumcised, having this opinion, that it was necessary, and did engage, or that they taught Circumcision as a necessary command, and as engaging to <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and in this latter sense I should not have sayd, (if I did say it) that it is not Circumcision as necessary, and as engaging to <hi>Moses</hi> Law, which was the yoke, but it was the Doctrine of those Teachers; but rather have sayd, it was Circumcision as necessary, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to <hi>Moses</hi> Law, which was the yoke, that is, the Doctrine of those Teachers. But because Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> expression is du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious, or nonsense, and that which he mainly bends himself to prove, is, that it was not the Doctrine which was the yoke to be put on Disciples, (for then there would have been no colour to expound [<hi>Disciples</hi>] of infants) but Circumcision in act, or acted on the flesh, though as a blinde he add those words, <hi>as necessary and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to</hi> Moses <hi>Law,</hi> therefore I denied the Consequence, as if those words were left out, which indeed he himself leaves out in the proof of his Antecedent, proving onely they would have had them circumcised, without saying any thing, to prove they would have had them circumcised under this formal consideration or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, as yielding to the necessity of it, and engaging themselves thereby to keep <hi>Moses</hi> Law. But if he put in those words in the <hi>minor,</hi> in this sense, I deny it also. As for the Consequence there is no proof brought for it to confirm it, but by overthrowing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I gave of denying it, so that had I given no reason of denying it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there had been brought no proof. But as yet I do not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100457:84"/>
though I had granted him, that Circumcision was the yoke, and not the Doctrine, (which I do not) that yet it would have followed, that if the false Teachers would have had the infants circumcised they were those also on whom they would have layd the yoke, for they might have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lay the yoke of Circumcision on the Parents, and so the laying on of the yoke might be onely the circumcising the Parents, though they would have also the infants circumcised. But it being true, that I gave that reason of my denial of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> Consequence, that I may the more abundantly shew the futility of his foolishly magnified dispute, I will engage with him even upon that point al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. And to clear my meaning, it is true, <hi>Exam. pag.</hi> 101. I said, the yoke, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. was Circumcision, as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>pag.</hi> 39. of his <hi>Sermon,</hi> and all the legal Ceremonies, and the reason why I used that expression was, because I alleged Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> words. But that I meant not Circumcision in act, or as acted on the flesh to be the yoke, but Circumcision in command, as commanded and imposed on the conscience, appears by the words following: if it be a privilege to be free from Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is a privilege to be free from any Ordinance in the room and use of it, it was the Ordinance then, I made the yoke. And my minde is expressed thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 135. The putting the yoke of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision is not actual Circumcision in their flesh, for that they were able to bear for many Ages, but the necessity of it on mens consciences to salvation. In my <hi>Antidote, sect.</hi> 6. I deny it to be actual Circumcision, but somtimes call it the doctrine or opinion of the necessity of it. In my Book of <hi>Scandalizing</hi> I call it the Ordinances of the <hi>Jews.</hi> In my <hi>Praecursor, pag.</hi> 10. the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and commands: but most plainly I express my self in my <hi>Praecursor, pag.</hi> 74. in my Answer to the <hi>27th</hi> absurdity Mr. <hi>B.</hi> chargeth me with, <hi>pag.</hi> 208. of his <hi>Plain Scripture Proof, &amp;c.</hi> where I make it the yoke of Doctrine, or the command of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and shew, that not onely <hi>Grotius,</hi> but also <hi>Pareus, Piscator, Diadati, the new</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There's not a word in either of the three Verses, that says so expresly, or by any good consequence, that the <hi>yoke v.</hi> 10. is Circumcision actual or in act, that is, acted or to be acted on the flesh. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> me thinks if he could have made any good inference from thence, for his Conclusion, should have formed it, being not ignorant that in my <hi>Antidote</hi> I bring these very verses and words to prove the contrary.</p>
            <p>2. Saith he, <hi>It appears evidently from the same, v.</hi> 10. <hi>the yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear, that which neither their fathers nor they were able to bear, was the yoke there meant: but it was Circumcision as necessary, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to keep the Law, and not the Doctrine of the false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, which their fathers and they were not able to bear, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c. The</hi> major <hi>is in the Text; the</hi> minor <hi>is plain;</hi> 1. <hi>In that there is no mention in the Scripture of the Fathers being so burdened with that false doctrine; but that there is mention enough of their being burdened with the Law, and Circumcision as engaging to it.</hi> 2. <hi>It was true and good Doctrine before Christ which these false Apostles taught,</hi> viz. <hi>that except they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, and kept the Law, they could not be saved: I mean as to the</hi> Jews <hi>it was true,</hi> (<hi>for I will not now meddle with that great controversie whether the Gentiles were bound to keep</hi> Moses <hi>Law. I know not what</hi> Grotius, Franzius, <hi>&amp;c. say on one side, and</hi> Cloppen burgius, <hi>and many more on the other.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> This passage I also allege against Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> opinion, in my <hi>Antidote sect.</hi> 6. to prove that it is not Circumcision in act but in command or doctrine that is there meant by the yoke. But that we may determine the thing it is to be considered: 1. Who [<hi>We and our Father</hi>] are: 2. In what part or respect, and how it was intolerable. Doubtless by [<hi>we</hi>] the Apostle means the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Jews,</hi> and by [<hi>our Fathers</hi>] the <hi>Jewes</hi> of former times. The intolerableness <hi>was not to their flesh,</hi> as <hi>Diodati</hi> speaks, <hi>for the labour in observing it,</hi> for though it be true that it was very irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100457:85"/>
to observe Circumcision, and the Rites of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, yet Circumcision was possible to be born, especially by an infant, though, in the end and intent of the circumcisers it was done as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and engaging to keep <hi>Moses</hi> Law, yet the infants being not sensible thereof, it was not intolerable to them. And the Apostle <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. 6. speaks of himself, as <hi>touching the righteousness of the Law, blameless.</hi> But it was intolerable <hi>to their mindes and consciences, by reason of the imperfection of it to quiet the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the condemnation it bound to for not keeping it in,</hi> saith <hi>Diodati locum.</hi> And therefore it was the Command and Doctrine that was intolerable to persons on whose consciences the Law was imposed, not the acting Circumcision, or Circumcision acted, which alone was put on infants, and consequently the yoke is not what was imposed on infants, but on persons taught and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As for Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> reasons, the first he himself answers by his second. For he saith <hi>that doctrine was true to the Jews before Christ,</hi> therefore sure the Fathers were acquainted with it, it was doctrine known among them whether the Scripture mention it or no; and whether it were true or false if it were received by them it must needs be burdensome to them. And for his second: 1. <hi>That it was true doctrine to the Jews before Christ that except they were circumcised after the maner of</hi> Moses <hi>they could not be saved, and that it was needfull to circumcise them, and to Command them to keep the Law, v.</hi> 1. 5. is in my apprehension diametrally opposite to <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. concerning the non-necessity of observing the Law for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, justification by faith without the works of the Law both in <hi>Abrahams, Davids, Moses</hi> his time. 2. If the <hi>doctrine were true to the Jews,</hi> it was the more intolerable, it wouldly the more heavy on their consciences, finding themselves unable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it; therefore this reason is against Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and proves the doctrine was the yoke.</p>
            <p>But he adds, Mr. <hi>T. saith it was the Pharisees doctrine of being justified by the Law which was the yoke. But I answer,</hi> 1. <hi>the Pharisees were not of so long continuance as to be the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Fathers by their doctrine.</hi> 2. <hi>these in the Text taught but a necessity that those who believed in Christ should be circumcised and keep the Law: so did not the Pharisees.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Those in the Text taught not onely a necessity that those who believed in Christ should be circumcised, and keep the Law, by way of Precept, but also of means, that <hi>except they did so, they could not be saved,</hi> and that was still taken by the Apostle in the Epistles to the <hi>Romans, Galatians, Philippians,</hi> as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification by the Law. And that this was the yoke which was so intolerable, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. appears by the next words, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>But we trust or believe to be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, even as also they.</hi> The term [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>but</hi>] being adversative, shews the Apostles assertion, <hi>v.</hi> 11. to contain an <hi>Antithesis</hi> to their <hi>Thesis</hi> or Doctrine, that is, whereas they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this intolerable yoke of Doctrine, that without Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and keeping the Law, Disciples cannot be saved, <hi>We believe they may be saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their hearts by faith, v</hi> 9 without the observation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> Law. 2. It is not true, <hi>that they taught onely a necessity that those who believed in Christ should be circumcised, and keep the Law;</hi> as if they exempted others. For though there is mention onely of their <hi>teaching the Brethren,</hi> yet doubtless they held a like necessity of it, or rather a greater, for <hi>Jews.</hi> whether converted or unconverted, as for Christian <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 3. But were it true, <hi>that they taught but a necessity that those who believed in Christ should be circumcised, and keep the Law,</hi> yet the Doctrine might be an intolerable yoke both to Disciples, and to the Ancestors from whomsoever they learn'd it. Whose Doctrine soever it were, yet it was a yoke intolerable to present Disciples and the Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of former Generations. 4. The antiquity of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees is variously conceived by Writers; it is conceived that Sect began three hundred years before the birth of Christ, by some higher; sure they were ancient enough to burden the Fathers, that is, the Ancestours of the modern <hi>Jews,</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> spake those words. 5. Were it that others spake that Doctrine, and burdened the Fathers with it, yet it might be well called by me the Pharises Doctrine, who taught it afterwards. 6. That Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to cavil may appear, let <hi>v.</hi> 5. be read, and there it is said, <hi>The false Teachers were of the Sect of the Pharisees.</hi> 3. Saith Mr. <hi>B. The Doctrine is no further a yoke than as it hath reference to Circumcision, and keeping the Law, in practice, and as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:100457:86"/>
               <hi>to bring them to the belief and practice; therefore it is evident, that the Doctrine is not the yoke; but the judgment and practice which that Doctrine did teach them; else it would be in the power of men to yoke and burden us at their pleasure: But till we obey it we are free from the yoke; therefore the yoke lieth not in the Doctrine, but the obeying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This Argument however faulty, yet it plainly crosseth Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> purpose; for his aim is to expound the yoke, so as that it may be said, to be laid on infants, and so they be reckoned for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples; but if it be <hi>that the judgment and practice which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrire did teach were the yoke, if the yoke didly in obeying,</hi> as he here saith, then the yoke was not put or endeavoured to be put on infants, the false Teachers neither did put nor endeavoured to put any thing on the judgment or practice of infants, nor to have brought them to obeying. What was to be done to them was not to be done by false Teachers, but the Parents; there was no act to be done on the infants mindes, consciences, judgments, but on their flesh, nor were they to be active in practice, or willing in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but meerly passive, and likely very unwillingly. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I infer from Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> own Argument, <hi>If the Doctrine were no further a yoke, than as it hath reference to Circumcision, and keeping the Law, in practice, and as it prevaileth to bring them to the belief and practice, that the yoke is the judgment and practice, which the doctrine did teach, that it lieth in the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> then it is no yoke to infants, then it is not Circumcision as act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but as taught and yielded to, then it was not to be put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and consequently no infants are meant by the <hi>Disciples, Acts</hi> 15. 10. But for the thing objected, as I have sayd before, the doctrine may be considered either <hi>in se, in it self,</hi> as it came from the Teachers, or in the event to the persons taught, being yielded to by them: It is true, the doctrine was not à yoke to the Disciples eventually, till the Disciples yielded to it, but it was in it self a yoke, and might so be called before, as the truth of Christ is <hi>the Gospel</hi> or <hi>glad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>idings</hi> in it self, and may be, and is often so called, though it prove not so to all that hear it. Wherefore I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called the yoke the command, sometimes the doctrine, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the necessity of observation, sometimes the opinion of the necessity, and all these in different respects are rightly made the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100457:87"/>
Yoke, in respect of God the command and necessity of observance, of the Teachers the doctrine, of the persons yoked the opinion and judgment, when it becomes such in the event, not onely <hi>in fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> but <hi>in facto esse,</hi> yet no way barely Circumcision acted on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and consequently they not Disciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. which conceit is plainly overthrown by Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> own Argument.</p>
            <p>4. Saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> [<q>That which this Synod did decree against, and <hi>Peter</hi> here spoke against, that was the yoke here meant. But it was Circumcision as needfull, and engaging to keep the Law, which this Synod decreed against, and <hi>Peter</hi> here spoke against: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Circumcision was the yoke. The <hi>minor</hi> is evident in the the three verses before named, and in the whole Chapter. Who dare say that this Synod did not decree against Circumcision and keeping the Law? And the <hi>major</hi> is as plain; And yet the very sum and strength of all that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath to say against this Text is here, which seems apparently to me to be but a meer cavilling with the plain Scripture.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> All this may be justly retorted. That which this Synod did decree against, and <hi>Peter</hi> here spake against, that was the yoke here meant: but it was not barely Circumcision as acted on infants, but Circumcision as taught, the command, doctrine, obligation, necessity of it to salvation, &amp; opinion of that necessity urged on Disciples by teaching, which this Synod decreed against, and <hi>Peter</hi> here spoke against: therefore this doctrine, command, obligation, necessity, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Circumcision and keeping the Law urged on persons taught was the yoke, &amp; not barely Circumcision as acted on infants by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, after the manner, and by virtue of <hi>Moses</hi> Law. The <hi>minor</hi> is evident in the three verses before named, and in the whole Chapter. Who dare say that this Synod did not decree against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, doctrine, obligation, necessity, opinion of Circumcision, and and keeping the Law? And yet the very sum and strength of all Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath to say against this Text is here, which seems appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to me to be but a meer cavilling with the plain Scripture.</p>
            <p>But he adds of me, [<q>He saith that the Synod decreed against Circumcision but by consequence, and not expresly; and that the thing they directly and expresly decreed against, and <hi>Peter</hi> spoke against, was not the yoke it self, but the putting the yoke on them, which was the act of the false Teachers in Teaching.</q>]</p>

               </gap> Circumcision acted on infants immediately, but the command, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, obligation, necessity and opinion of necessity of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and keeping the Law to salvation, and consequently the infants Circumcision, which how or in what sense they are the yoke, and what the putting on of the yoke is, hath already been often shewed.</p>
            <p>But saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> [<q>1. If this were granted, yet neither directly nor consequently do they decree against the circumcising of any but Disciples, and therefore infants must needs be part of those Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</q>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> That which <hi>Peter</hi> spoke against was the practise of the false Teachers, <hi>v.</hi> 10. The decree of the Synod was expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1. a condemnation of the false Teachers practice, <hi>v.</hi> 24. 2. A release to Gentile Disciples of other commands called bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens save onely some excepted, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 25. And it is true that these decrees are directed onely to the Disciples of the Gentiles for the freeing of their consciences. But it is false that they decree against the circumcising of none but Disciples. It is true the decree is not for the release of burdens to any but Disciples: But he that releaseth the burden that is the command of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision to the Father who is a Disciple, doth withall by plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence free the childe from Circumcision, and yet the childe no Disciple.</p>
            <p>2. Saith Mr. <hi>B. But the Text expresseth actual Circumcision three times over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> And it expresseth also keeping the Law, doth it therefore follow that the yoke, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. is the <hi>actual</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law, and that this might be put on infants.</p>
            <p>3. Saith he, [<q>It is undeniable in the 28, 29. <hi>v.</hi> that it was matter of their practice, as directly as the false Apostles teaching, and much more which was decreed against.</q> It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay upon you no greater burdens than these necessary things: that ye abstain from meats offered to Idols <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mark 1. their practice is the thing decreed upon expresly, and not the doctrine of the false Teacher (though that is implied) they do not say we do not decree, that they preach so no more, but that you abstain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Though they do not say <hi>v.</hi> 28. we decree that they preach so no more, yet when they say, <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens than these necessary things,</hi> this is an express decree against the Doctrine of those false Teachers, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Except ye be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised after the manner of</hi> Moses <hi>ye cannot be saved, and v.</hi> 5. <hi>that it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Law of</hi> Moses.</p>
            <p>2. Saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 
               <q>This is it also which is here called [the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den] in the sense, no doubt, with that which before was called the yoke, no greater burden or yoke. And can any impartial mans conscience tell him that the onely chief question here debated and determined was, whether the false Apostles should any more preach such doctrine. and not rather whether the Disciples ought to be circumcised and keep the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100457:88"/>
practise were both in question, and both determined in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and therefore both decreed against, and so the doctrine is the yoke in respect of the yoakers, and the judgment and practise in respect of the yoaked.</p>
            <p>4. Saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 
               <q>It was the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> and not the false Teachers that sent to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for resolution. 5. And it was to the brethren, and not to the false Teachers that the Synod did direct their letters, and decrees: therefore it was the Disciples practise that is more directly decreed against (or at least as much) than the Doctrine of the Teachers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Be the Conclusion granted, yet the Doctrine is decreed against, and consequently is meant by the yoke <hi>v.</hi> 10. even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> argument, <hi>That which the Synod did decree against was the yoke here meant.</hi> But doth not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in these words plainly intimate that <hi>Disciples</hi> are the same with <hi>brethren, to whom the letters were directed,</hi> which sure were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants? It is true the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and not the false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, sent to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for resolution, and that the letters were directed not to the false Teachers, but brethren called <hi>believers, Acts</hi> 21. 25. yet they sent about the false Teachers Doctrine, and the decree and speech were against that Doctrine: even as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees or Canons of Councils are against the doctrine of Heretikes though sent to the Churches.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, his own arguments prove, that the Doctrine of the false Teachers is the yoke. But he hath not yet done.</p>
            <p>6. Saith he, <q>If it were granted as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> would have it, that it is onely putting on the yoke that is here expressely decreed against, and the yoke or practise it self but onely by consequence, then he would make this Synod so weak as to leave the matter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and obscure, which they were to determine expresly: and perhaps it might put him hard to it to prove that consequence: For it will not alway follow that what may not be taught may not be practised, as I could shew in several cases.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I hold the Synod to decree expressely against the yoke, understanding by it the Doctrine of the necessity of Circumcision, the obligation and opinion of its necessity, and the pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100457:89"/>
against the Gentiles believing Parents practice of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising their Infants as of duty, nor do I know how any other way Mr. <hi>B.</hi> can gather it from the Epistle of the Synod than as I do; sure in all the Epistle I finde not any other way to prove Gentile believers are not bound to circumcise their children, but by urging the words <hi>v.</hi> 24. 28. 29 in which parents are not discharged of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising infants expresly in so many words, But by consequence. And yet the matter is not left imperfect or obscure, but there is an express determination against that which was the occasion of the Synod, to wit the Doctrine of the false Teachers, <hi>v.</hi> 24. nor is the consequence hard to infer, if the Apostles give no command to the Gentile parents to be circumcised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to keep the Law, then parents are not tied to circumcise their infants, there being no necessity or duty to them who have no command or burden put on them. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mistakes in conceivng I framed the consequence thus: What the false Apostles might not teach, the parents might not practice. And therefore though he could shew in many more cases than he can, that it will not alway follow that what may not be taught may not be practiced, the consequence as I frame it may be clear, &amp; the determination of the Synod express and perfect.</p>
            <p>But he adds: 7. <hi>And me thinks we may be allowed to prove baptism of infants by consequence: if this Synod assembled of purpose about Circumcision and the Law did yet leave them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but consequence against it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I never said, that the Synod left nothing but conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence against Circumcision and the Law; nor did I disallow at any time the proving of infants baprism by consequence, but have often declared the contrary, though Mr. <hi>M.</hi> most unbrotherly charged me with it, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. of his <hi>Defence,</hi> but absolved me of it, <hi>pag.</hi> 205. as I shew in my <hi>Apology, sect.</hi> 11. and in my <hi>Praecursor, sect.</hi> 8. But having so long expected some proof by consequence for infant-baptism, and finding upon trial in so many Authors as have occurred nothing worth the name of a proof, I conclude there is no such thing, but that Paedobaptists, and none more than Mr. <hi>B.</hi> do onely gull the world, and which is more to be detested, the godly, and of those, many that are teachers of others, with flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes and shews, instead of proof, in so much as some who are of able parts magnifie his book about infants baptism as excellent,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100457:89"/>
whether it be out of rashness, or for advantage sake to themselves, finde it upon strictest examination to be but a meer cheat.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath one string more to his Bowe. 5. <hi>Further,</hi> saith he, <hi>that it was Circumcision it self as needfull, and as enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to</hi> Moses <hi>Law, which is here meant, is plain in Gal.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. <hi>No doubt either those that mis-taught the</hi> Galatians <hi>were the same with those or their companions teaching the same Doctrine, and therefore</hi> Paul <hi>there decideth the same cause; and mark what he cals the yoke, Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

Because the exhortation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5 1. is inferred from his determination in the precedent Chapter, from <hi>v</hi> 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end, to wit, that <hi>the Covenant of the Law did beget to bondage,</hi> and that <hi>they were children of the free woman,</hi> and therefore the yoke of bondage is not simply Circumcision as acted, but as Mr. <hi>Dicson</hi> expresseth it, <hi>the yoke of the Covenant of Works and legal Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> 2. Because [<hi>if ye be circumcised, v.</hi> 2.] is expounded rightly, if ye be willingly circumcised, upon the opinion, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of the false Teachers to seek justification thereby, as the reasons of the Apostle, <hi>v.</hi> 3. 4 do evidently shew. 3.

               <p> The Arguments are vindicated, which are brought to prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants not meant by Disciples, Acts 15. 10.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BUt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> proceeds, <hi>Well, but Mr.</hi> T. <hi>hath one argument for his conceit, and but one that I have heard, and that is like the conceit it self. If</hi> (saith he) <hi>putting on the yoke be onely by teaching, then the yoke it self is onely the Doctrine, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it was to be put on none but those that could be taught. Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>I deny both the Consequences, and he will never prove them. For,</hi> 1. <hi>by</hi> [<hi>putting</hi>] <hi>he confesseth is meant</hi> [<hi>an endeavour to put</hi>] <hi>therefore it must be more than bare Doctrine. And if by Doctrine they perswade the People of the necessity of practice in so doing, they put on them both the mis-belief and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> it seems either did not reade, or not heed, or forgot what was in <hi>Examen. pag.</hi> 135. when he saith, <hi>he had heard but of one Argument for my conceit,</hi> though it be his meer ignorance that makes him call it my conceit, as if it were my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar conceit; whereas his own conceit is scarce any thing older than himself, and mine agreeable to the Exposition of the best and elder Interpreters. And however when Mr. <hi>B.</hi> wrote this he might know of no more Arguments against his conceit, yet there are more i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> my <hi>Antidote, sect.</hi> 6. to which with this here I shall review his Answers. My Argument in form is this, They onely are meant by Disciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 15 10. who were to be the subjects passive or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient of the act of the false Teachers whether effected or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is of that which they would have done to them. But no infants were to be the subjects passive or recipient of the act of the false Teachers whether effected or attempted, that is of that which they would have done to them. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is plain to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon understanding, according to all Rules of Logick and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. So we argue, they must be meant by <hi>all men, John</hi> 12. 32. when Christ saith, <hi>I will draw all men to me,</hi> who were the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects recipient of the act of <hi>drawing.</hi> Every particular man is not the subject of Christs drawing, therefore [<hi>all men</hi>] doth not note
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100457:91"/>
every particular man. Innumerable such Arguments are among Writers Ecclesiastical and Civil, nor is there any thing more plain to common understanding The <hi>minor</hi> is proved thus: the onely act of the false Teachers by which the yoke was to be put on Disciples was teaching, or that which they would have done to them was onely teaching. But of this act no infant was the passive subject. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The former is confessed by himself in calling it <hi>perswading,</hi> and if it were not, the Text proves it, v. 1. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>minor</hi> is manifest, they were neither capable of it, nor were the false Teachers so sensless as to endeavour it. But let's view Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> Answer. <hi>He denies this consequence, if the putting on the yoke be onely by teaching, then the yoke it self is onely the Doctrine.</hi> But this is not my consequence, but this, if their act of putting on the yoke were onely Teaching then the <hi>terminus,</hi> at least im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, must be Doctrine in respect of the agent, and in respect of the patient learning, as if the act of the Sun be Teaching, the immediate <hi>terminus</hi> is heat, although other effects follow, as dryness or the like; so if the false Teachers did put the yoke on the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by Teaching, they did put Doctrine on them, and if they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it they learned that Doctrine, although other effects followed, as disquietnes of minde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may be comprehended under the metaphor of a yoke. By Teaching parents, an infant is not cut or cicumcised, no not though the parents receive the Doctrine, he may have no childe to circumcise, or no strength, or the like: no though it come to pass that the childe be circumcised, yet this is not done by the false Teacher, but by the parent. If then their act was onely teaching, then the product result or <hi>terminus</hi> must be Doctrine, though there were other consequents to follow. But <hi>Mr.</hi> B. <hi>denies also this consequence, that if the yoke were onely doctrine, it was put on none but those that could be taught.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I reply, he may as well deny the Snow to be white, as deny it: Can any put Doctrine but on Persons that can be taught? What is this but to hold that a Person may have Doctrine put on him, that cannot be taught, which is a meer contradiction, all one as to say, He may be taught that cannot be taught. But he will forsooth give us some Reason of his denial as wise as the rest. <hi>For,</hi> 1. <hi>by</hi> [<hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>] <hi>he confesseth is meant</hi> [<hi>an endeavour to put</hi>] <hi>therefore it must be more than the bare doctrine. Answ.</hi> 1. I confess not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100457:91"/>
               <hi>by</hi> [<hi>putting</hi>] <hi>is meant</hi> [<hi>an endeavour to put</hi>] though I confess that <hi>Peter</hi> accu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth them onely of their endeavour to put the yoke. 2. If I had confessed it, yet Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> Reason is foolish, for it would rather follow, that it is less than bare Doctrine, the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to put being less than putting. Yet it is not true that I said, <hi>The yoke notes bare Doctrine,</hi> without any other effect, but that the yoke notes doctrine, command, opinion of obligation, and necessity, and perhaps disquietness, trouble, care, fear consequent. However they that put the yoke by teaching did put doctrine on whom they put the yoke, the putting the yoke being nothing but teaching. That which follows, <hi>And if by doctrine they prevail to perswade the people of the necessity of practice in so doing, they put on them the both the mis-belief and mis-practice,</hi> is as little to purpose. For, 1. to put on them the misbelief is to put on them the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for doctrine is put on by being learned or believed.</p>
            <p>2. They that do prevail do put on the mispractice it may be in the event, but not barely by their putting on their doctrine, for it may be they may both teach, and that effectually, so as that the person do learn or mis-believe, and yet not mis-practice through many intervenient impediments, yea though he do mis-practice, yet the mis-practice is not the <hi>terminus</hi> of his teaching, nor is he the mis-practicer, it is not his act logically or physically, though it be his morally, that is, the fault of it be imputed to him, as arising from the Doctrine be taught. However if it be by perswading and by producing mis-belief and mis-practice, they onely are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it who mis-believe and mis practice, which being not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of infants, they are not meant by Disciples, on whom the yoke is put.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> gives a Reason of his denial of the latter conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and it is this, 2. <hi>The latter consequence is as false; For he that perswadeth a parent to circumcise himself, and his childe, doth as properly put that burden of Circumcision on the childe as on the parent. Though he teach onely the parent, yet by teaching the parent he puts the burden on both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If the putting the yoke be Teaching or perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, sure he onely is the subject of his putting the yoke, who is the subject of his Teaching, (as if we say the killing there was wounding by the sword, it folows he was not there said to be
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100457:92"/>
killed who was not wounded by the sword) though it may be true also that another agent by another act may put the burden on one not taught. 2. But were Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> speech true, yet it is nothing to his wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>less denial of the later consequence, for the consequence is thus, if the yoke were onely Doctrine it was put on none but those that could be taught, which may be undeniable, though it be granted, that <hi>he that Teacheth onely tho parents, yet puts the burden both on parent and child.</hi> 3. Yea Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doth grant it by supposing that he <hi>Teacheth onely the parent,</hi> that Doctrine is put onely on the parent. For what is it to put Doctrine on any but to Teach him? And therefore if the yoke were onely Doctrine, sure it was put on none but such as could be taught, unless we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Doctrine can be put on those that cannot be taught, which is all one in my apprehension as to say they may be taught who cannot be taught. And therefore if there be any silly wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the dispute between us, sure Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doth wrangle here either as a silly man or as a most perverse man in denying this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and in his whole arguings about this Text, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing <hi>the yoke to be not onely the Doctrine but the judgment and practise also of Circumcision, and that the false Teachers would put it onely by Teaching,</hi> yet doth imagine he can perswade his reader to be so silly as to conceive that they did any thing to infants or that infants are any of those <hi>Disciples</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10.</p>
            <p>And here I shall inforce the arguments of my <hi>Antidote sect.</hi> 6. The first is <hi>ad hominem.</hi> He counts it a heinous offence that I take the word [holy 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.] in a different sense than it is used six hundred times in the Scripture, and yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that is <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. by their baby sprinkling, when the very words of Christ, practise of the Apostles, constant use of the word [Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples] throughout the New Testament, common consent of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters shews Christ appointed Disciples onely to be baptized ordmarily, who were made such by preaching the Gospel, upon pretence that infants are called [<hi>Disciples Acts</hi> 15. 10] in a sense different from what <hi>Luke</hi> useth it elsewhere even in the precedent and following chapters, and that sense or rather nonsense self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradicting acception devised of late by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> without any ancient Author I know, or any reason from the Text. That which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> replies is as frivolous. 1. He saith <hi>infants are called Disciples Acts.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>They are there part of Christians and Disciples;</hi> but this is false theres not a word in the Text that soundes to this sense, that infants are any part of the Christians or Disciples there mentioned, yea there is that which is plainly to the contrary <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>Then the Disciples, every manaccording to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren.</hi> If every one of the Disciples determined to send, and no infants determined to send relief, then no infants are part of the Disciples. 2 Saith he, <hi>the case is not alike, In</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>I argued about the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the word</hi> [<hi>holy</hi>] <hi>here we are agreed about the sense, that it signifieth one so related to Christ as their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aster, the difference is about the application of this term.</hi> But this is false that I agree with him about the signification and sense of the word [<hi>Disciple of Christ</hi>] <hi>as it notes a relation to Christ as Teacher,</hi> yea I utterly deny it notes such a relation as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> fancies <hi>in title without actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al learning or owning Christ as Teacher,</hi> in which sense it is no where taken in Scripture or any Ancient Author I know. 3. Saith he, <hi>However I am certain, if we have not the name else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, yet we have the description and names of the same signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, they are Church members, Gods people, his servants, and therefore Disciples. Answ.</hi> 1. This doth not at all avoyd his owne charge of prostituted consciences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in another case, he charged these things on me for using the word [<hi>holy</hi>] in a different sense from what elsewhere it is used, though I brought a term of the same signification <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cogent reason out of the Text for my interpretation, and therefore by his own Law to me, he is to be charged as he chargeth me for doing the same, though it were true
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100457:93"/>
               <hi>he had the description and names of the same signification.</hi> 2. It is not proved, no nor can be proved, the terms [<hi>Churchmembers, Gods people, Gods servants</hi>] to be of the same signification with [<hi>Disciples of Christ</hi>] 3. There is no: so much as one Text in the New Testament, which alone is written in Greek by the Holy Pen-men, and therefore the fittest if not the onely way to shew the meaning of a New Testament term, brought to prove infants under the New Testament to be caled <hi>Churchmembers, Gods people, Gods servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The consequence shall be examined in that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>Besides I argued from the Text, <hi>the putting the yoke on the necks of the Disciples</hi> is the same with that which is mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>they taught the brethren,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>they said it was needfull to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>and v.</hi> 24. <hi>certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying ye must be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and keep the Law.</hi> Now is any man so sensless as to think they did these things to infants? Again the Text. <hi>v.</hi> 1. 23. calls <hi>the Disciples v.</hi> 10. <hi>brethren,</hi> saith <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>their hearts were puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith</hi> upon the hearing of the word, which none but those that are resolved to outface a plain truth would aver to be meant of infants, therefore neither the term <hi>Disciples, v.</hi> 10 fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h what is said of the <hi>brethren</hi> is meant of the <hi>Disciples v.</hi> 10. To this all the reply I finde in Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is this <hi>pag</hi> 252. <hi>And your bringing some passages of the chapter not applicable to infants doth not prove that therefore the rest is not, no more than several passages in</hi> Deut. 29. <hi>applicable onely to the aged, will prove little ones were not taken in to be Gods people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, the bringing some passages of the chapter not applicable to infants doth not prove that therefore the rest is not: if I had made such an Argument I would give him leave to use his Rhetorick <hi>of silly insipid arguings.</hi> But my arguing is this, The same thing which is expressed, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>by putting the yoke on the necks of the Disciples,</hi> is expressed <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>by teaching the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, v.</hi> 5. <hi>by saying to them it was needfull to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>v</hi> 24. <hi>by trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with words, subverting their souls, saying, ye must be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:100457:93"/>
               <hi>and keep the Law,</hi> and the same persons which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by <hi>Disciples, v.</hi> 10. are termed <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Brethren,</hi> are said <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>to have their hearts purified by faith, v.</hi> 19. <hi>those of the Gentiles that were turned to God, v.</hi> 23. <hi>Brethren of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> But these things were not done to infants, nor infants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under these persons, in these places, which express the same thing, and the same person, which is apparent by the narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Peter</hi> reprehends the same thing in the same persons, <hi>v.</hi> 10. which is related <hi>v.</hi> 1, 5, 23, 24. the occasion of his speech was the same fact, the drift of his speech is to condemn the same fact, the determination of the Council is against the same practice, the same persons are in all these places spoken of, and this is proved by Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> first Argument, who brings <hi>v.</hi> 1, 5, 24. to prove Circumcision to be the yoke, <hi>v.</hi> 10. which Argument supposeth the same persons and things meant, <hi>v.</hi> 10. which are meant, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 5, 24. But not one of the things said there is applicable to infants. How then can any man imagine that the same act being meant in all the places, it should be meant of the act of Circumcision, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and not <hi>v.</hi> 1, 5, 24. and the same persons meant, they should be infants meant, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and not <hi>v.</hi> 1, 5, 24? Is not this to make the same act and the same persons not the same, which is a contradiction? I know not how men conceive of my intellectuals: But I am still possessed of this to be so good proof, that I should as soon doubt of other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions as of this, and as soon believe that the Moon is made of green Cheese, as believe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> affirming that <hi>Peter</hi> meant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants by <hi>Disciples, Acts</hi> 15. 10.</p>
            <p>I added further, if the putting on the yoke had been Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it had been to be done not on their necks but elsewhere, the yoke was put not on their flesh, but on their consciences, <hi>their souls are said to be subverted, their mindes troubled, v.</hi> 24. not their flesh pained by the putting on the yoke, it was done <hi>by words, v.</hi> 24. not by a knife or such like instrument. Again, the <hi>yoke v.</hi> 10. was such <hi>as neither the present</hi> Jews <hi>nor their fathers were able to bear:</hi> but Circumcision put on infants was tolerable. I argued also that Christs doctrine is called his <hi>yoke, Matth.</hi> 11. 29. I alleged the testimonies of <hi>Pisc. sch.</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. <hi>Grot. Annot.</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. calling it the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that <hi>the yoke of bondage, Gal.</hi> 5. 1. is the Doctrine or <hi>Covenant of the Law, which genders</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:100457:94"/>
               <hi>to bondage, Gal.</hi> 4. 21, 24. That Circumcision is not the yoke without subjection of minde or opinion to it, which are not verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of infants. <hi>These things</hi> he saith <hi>are answered already,</hi> but where I know not: if he mean in his Argument before, he may see his Cannon turned against himself.</p>
            <p>I said, all the colour Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath from this Text to prove infants disciples, is by conceiving the yoke to note barely and precisely the cutting off a little skin. To this he answers, <hi>I must say it is but one of your fictions. Did you over hear me talk of such a thing? Cutting that skin is not Circumcision, as the word is used for a Sacrament. The end, signification, and engagement go into the definition of Circumcision. And if from hence you would infer, that it is onely the aged that are capable of signification and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, you may strait conclude that no infant was ever cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised.</hi>

            <p>I reply, it is no fiction of mine, but a truth, whether Mr. <hi>B.</hi> talked or thought of it or no, that all the colour, that is shew of reason Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath from this Text to prove infants Disciples, is in taking the yoke for the cutting off a little skin. For his proof is from what was done or endeavored to be done to infants; but that was onely the cutting the little skin. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would have the yoke to be actual Circumcision, or Circumcision as acted, and that was nothing but the cutting off the litle skin. It is true, Circumcision in the users is more than the cutting off the little skin, there is the end, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and intended engagement, but as infants receive it, as it is acted on infants, the yoke can be no more than the loss of the skin and the soreness following, they neither are taught, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the end, signification or engagement, and Circumcision as it includes these is as I say in my <hi>Antidote</hi> Circumcision not as acted on infants, but taught persons of years; nor was it my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that Circumcision as a Sacrament was onely the cutting off a little skin, but as it was acted on infants, and the imagined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oke endeavored to be put on infants <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. which sure <hi>Peter</hi> never blamed them for, and therefore it is not the yoke there meant. Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> talk of Circumcision as a Sacrament, and what is the definition of it as a Sacrament, as it leades to a dispute about the notion of a word not found in Scripture, so being besides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent business, I shall let it pass.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:100457:94"/>Lastly I added, that if it were granted that the term [<hi>Disciples Acts</hi> 15. 10] noted infants, then onely male infants, for they onely were to be circumcised, therefore female infants should not be thence proved Disciples, nor to be baptized. To this he answers, <hi>That is as much as I needed, when my position was that some infants are Disciples and to be baptized.</hi> I reply, It is not as much as he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unless he understood his position onely of some male infants. 2. Saith he, <hi>I should hence prove, that if males are Disciples, then certainly females, both being Church-members till Christ, though but one circumcised.</hi> I reply, 1. It is more than he can prove that those who were Church-members in the Jewish Church are Disciples of Christ in the New Testament to be baptized. 2. If he could prove it, yet not from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. it being certain no more can be proved thence to be Disciples, than are there called Disciples, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself will not say of female infants. I conclude still, that in this arguing of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I finde nothing but froward, and, I had almost said, impudent wrangling against a plain truth, that the Disciples <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. were onely the brethren con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and the yoke the Doctrine the false Teachers would have put upon them, and the reader, of whosoever education or tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Infants discipleship is not proved by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> from <hi>Lev.</hi> 25 41, 42. which speaks of the <hi>Israelites</hi> being Gods servants.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>MY second Argument, saith Mr.</hi> B. <hi>to prove that some infants are Disciples, is this, If no infants are Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then it is either because they are not capable, or else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God will not shew them such a mercy; But neither of these can be the cause; Therefore that no infants are Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is false Doctrine.

[<hi>that the reason why they are not Disciples is because they have not learned.</hi>]</p>

               </gap>n appearance as would stir up passions in hearers against me as lessening Gods mercy to their infants, and then aggravating these imagined absurdities, turning to the people with his wonted exclamations, and other Rhetorick (whereby he hath befooled not onely those parts, but a great number of shallow heads throughout the Land) which I found to be his course in his first argument in <hi>ch.</hi> 6. now printed to prove his Ordinance of visible Church-membership of infants unrepealed, with which he began, when he should have first proved such an Ordinance and its continuing in force out of Scripture, it being an indirect way, though popular and taking, to prove a thing done by God, because we conceive it fit to be done, and having been tired with answering three or four hours his long hypothetical Syllogismes, and those somtimes brought to prove an hypothetical propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, contrary to the use of schools, not allowing me to ask a question for clearing his termes, neither allowing me time to consider of his reasonings, nor at first liberty of repeating, I did thus answer to this argument, hoping though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What need any man assigne any cause at all why infants are not Disciples, but because the term [Disciple] agrees not to them?

               </gap>. <hi>B.</hi> should have overthrown if he would have
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100457:95"/>
proved, as he should, infants to be Disciples. But then he might have been hindered in his vagaries and popular discourses, which with his Rhetorical exclamations were that he most minded to use, and been brought to discover his nonsense acception of the word [<hi>Disciple.</hi>] But saith he, <hi>or is it not evidently reducible to one of the former? For if their unlearnedness hinder them from being Disciples, either it must be because it maketh them or sheweth them uncapable, or because God will not shew the unlearned so great mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is neither because unlearnedness maketh or sheweth them uncapable, nor because God will not shew them that mercy: But because what ever their capacity be, or Gods intent toward them, they have not yet that which alone denominates Disciples. If his disjunction were good he should prove that capacity of a title, or Gods intention of shewing mercy, without actual learning or professing Christ, is enough to denominate a person a Disciple of Christ, which is so manifestly contrary to all the use of the word in the new Testament, and to expositors of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 29. that I am now bold to say, that it is no better than height of impudence after so evident proof to maintain so gross an absurdity. But I am necessitated to follow Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his vagaries.</p>
            <p>1. <q>If infants, saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> are capable of being Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, then they are capable of being Disciples.</q> For as they signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy here the same thing and denote the same sort of persons, so there is the same capacity requisite to both: or if you will make a difference, there is more required to a servant than to a Disciple. But infants are capable of being Gods servants: this is plain; For the Lord God himself doth call them his servants, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 41. 42. they are commanded in the year of Iubile to let their brother that was sold to them, and his children, depart; and the reason is added [for they are my servants] that infants are here inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among [his children] cannot be denied or doubted of (Mr. <hi>T.</hi> began to deny it, but he quickly recalled it) Is not here then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection enough to help us to judg of the minde of God, whether infants are his servants and Disciples or no? Doth not God call them his servants himself? what more should a man expect to warrant him to do so? men call for plain Scripture, and when they have it they will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

minde. It may be some may say, They were then capable of being Gods servants, but they are not so now. But this were a wretched answer. For their capacity was the same then and now: Infants then were like infants now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is certain that the term [<hi>servants of God</hi>] is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways equipollent to [<hi>a Disciple of Christ.</hi>] For <hi>Jer.</hi> 43. 10. <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> is called <hi>Gods servant,</hi> and <hi>the heavens, Psal.</hi> 119. 91. But then when it is taken in the sense the Apostle useth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>His servants ye are to whom ye obey,</hi> and therefore unless he means by [<hi>servants of God</hi>] men voluntarily obeying the Gospel, yea and visibly appearing so to do, I shall deny his consequence, and his dictates, that either <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. or <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>a Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and <hi>a servant of God</hi> in his sense <hi>signify the same thing, or denote the same sort of persons.</hi> And if <hi>more be required to a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant than a Disciple,</hi> it follows that a person may be a Disciple and yet not a servant of God, and so the terms are not reciprocal, and his consequence so much the more infirm. As for his <hi>minor</hi> it is denied, understanding it of capacity of infants while infants in an ordinary way, and of being <hi>Gods servants</hi> in the sense used <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 16. in which alone it is equipollent to a Disciple.

            <p>But he goes on. <hi>May I not make this a third Argument of it self? If God call Infants his Servants, though they can do him no service, then we may call them so too: for we may speak as God doth: but God doth call them so; therefore we may.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Conclusion is granted: he may call <hi>Hebrew</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants <hi>Gods servants</hi> in the sense meant, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 41. But if he cal the children of Gentile-believers <hi>Servants of God</hi> in a sense equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent to a <hi>Disciple, Matth.</hi> 28. 19. He must bring better warrant
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100457:97"/>
than that Text, or else I shall deny it, slighting his vain censure <hi>of a forestalled minde,</hi> and conceiving rather it verisied of himself. <hi>As the Man thinketh, so the Bell tinketh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, saith Mr. <hi>B. If God call Infants his Servants, though they are uncapable at present of doing him service, then we may call them Disciples, though at present they are uncapable of learning. But God doth so call them; therefore we may, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If God call infants his servants according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles description of a servant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. then I confess infants may be called Christs Disciples, but not if onely according to the sense of <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 41.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> goes on. <hi>Hath he a good wit now or a bad minde, that can raise a dust for the darkning of so express and plain a Text? and yet still call for Scripture proof?

So Mr.</hi> T. <hi>O what cause have we all to look to the tenderness of our consciences in time, before engagement in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cause hath benummed them, and made the Word of God to be of no force to us? I know shallow brains are uncapable to discern the weakness of the silliest Answer: they go that way as their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection doth byass them: their approbation of an Argument or Answer is no credit to it. But let any man of a tolerable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and conscience not seared, but weigh-seriously this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and I dare warrant he will think it a bad cause that must be underpropt by such palpable abuse of Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I loath to take notice of such base insinuations, far unworthy of a christian brother or an ingenuous scholar, but that thereby Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath more prevailed to hinder the entertainment of the truth I maintain, than by any arguments he hath brought. And were it not that the Law of Charity forbids me to put the worst construction on things, I see so much as might move me to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100457:97"/>
retort upon himself his insinuations against me, as if I had a bad minde, and a seared conscience, and a bad cause, and that I darken so express and plain a Text, and so palpably abuse Scripture because of my answer about this Text. I will not deny him to have a good wit, nor impute to him a shallow brain, I wish his judgment were as good as his fancy, &amp; that with his quickness of apprehension he had more considerateness in his determinations, and especially about the meaning of Scripture; if it were so, the Church of God might have much more benefit by his laboures than it hath, nor would his polemick writings especially, have so many crudities in them as there are. As for this present business I think that intemperate zeal to the cause he thinks good hath so transported him that he shews much want both of ingenuity of spirit, and clearness of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, which he hath in other writings, and that however he doth often pretend love to me, yet his gall doth so overflow when ever he speakes of me, that he can neither give aright inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of what I do, nor of what I say. But to the matter. I had sayd in my <hi>Sermon,</hi> and in my <hi>Antidot sect.</hi> 4. that what is sayd <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 41. is nothing to our children, it being spoken peculiarly of <hi>Hebrew</hi> children. To this in his <hi>reply pag.</hi> 182. 248. he tells me. 1. <hi>The</hi> Iewes <hi>infants were infants, and our dispute you know was of the</hi> species.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> infants were infants its true, and so were the <hi>Canaanites</hi> infants, yet not servants of God, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 41<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is meant. 2. The dispute was not as it was first mannaged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> nor as it was by Mr. <hi>Bs:</hi> first argument borught to an issue, of the <hi>species,</hi> whether any infants indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or any ones infants whatsoever were to be called Disciples of Christ and to be baptized, but whether the infants of believers, of whom his meaning is in his first argument, however he make his <hi>position,</hi> that <hi>some infants are to be baptized.</hi> 3. whatever his <hi>position</hi> were, yet his wordes in his <hi>Epistle to the people of</hi> Kederminster were <hi>that God saith our children are Gods servants,</hi> which is palpably false, he saying it of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> children as such; and not of ours.</p>
            <p>2. saith he, <hi>I have proved that our privileges are greater than theirs (and you deny it not) and that this was not perculiar to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:100457:98"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> if it be granted that our previleges are greater than theirs, yet it is but in some respects, and therefore there is no good argument, if it be confessed God shews more mercy to our children therefore he gives them every such privilege as the <hi>Jews</hi> had. God shews mercy to ministers of the Gospel more than to the Priests of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet it follows not, our children must have such privileges of continuance in office, inheritance &amp;<hi>c.</hi> as they had. That what is sayd <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 41. was peculiar to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> is so clearly proved, that it hath a shew of impudence to deny it. 3. saith he, <hi>it proves that there is nothing in the age to make them uncapable, or else the</hi> Jews <hi>infants would have been uncapable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It proves that there is nothing in the age to make them uncapable of being Gods servants in the sense of <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 41. But it proves not that they are capable of being Gods servants or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily as the title is used <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. and is equipollent to a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, Matth.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
            <p>But saith he, <hi>How have the believing</hi> Jews <hi>lost this privilege or Proselytes of the Gentiles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This privilege was belonging to the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> while it continued, as well as the believing. 2. If it be lost (as I think it is) it is lost by the dissolving the judicial Laws of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the national policy the <hi>Jews</hi> had.</p>
            <p>But saith he, <hi>where you talk of servants in this sense and that sense, they were so servants as to be visible Church-menbers, and that is all that I contest for. They were reckoned among</hi> Moses <hi>Disciples, and so are ours to be among Christs Disciples or Christians (as</hi> Moses <hi>Disciples also in some sort were Christs Disciples.</hi>)</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> The sense in which the <hi>Jews</hi> children were called <hi>Gods servants</hi> is not all one with to be <hi>visible Church-members, nor</hi> Moses <hi>Diciples,</hi> as is proved above where the genuine sense is shewed. But to the distinctions I used in my <hi>Sermon</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote,</hi> I deny not that I used both distinctions, and they are usual in schools. The former is used by the Author of the <hi>New annot.</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 24. the later is common, in the differencing of active and passive scandal, Conversion taken actively and passively, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>p.</hi> 81. distinguisheth of being <hi>sanctified actively and passively.</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:100457:98"/>
But he thinks the <hi>application to be a palpable abuse of Scripture. For,</hi> 1. <hi>He (meaning me) saith they were servants of God</hi> de jure, <hi>but not</hi> de facto, <hi>in right, out not in deed. But a servant is a relation, that is the form of it,</hi> servus est Domini servus. And <hi>have they onely a right to this relation? who then or what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth them from possessing the relation which they have right to? Is it not God that giveth them right to this relation? And is not that to give them the relation it self? I would he would tell us what more he giveth them that have th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> elationo it self</hi> de facto, (<hi>for I suppose he dare not interpret it of a future right.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I said in my <hi>Sermon</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath printed it <hi>pag:</hi> 181. that the meaning is not that infants are actually servants, but in right, to me, he doth not speak what they did, but of Gods right and interest he had in them: which is so plain a truth that I supposed he could not have sound any matter of exception. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is so quarelsome with me that he will either finde or make a Knot in a Bulrush. 1. He renders <hi>de facto in deed,</hi> as if I had said, they had relation of right, but not in deed, that is not in possession: whereas my meaning was plainly exprest, they were not actually servants in respect of what they did, or in respect of the act or fact of service. 2. he misunderstands it as if I spake of <hi>their being servants of right,</hi> that they had the right of being Gods servants so as to claim it as a privilege on their part, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I meant it and expressed it in respect of Gods right and interest in them, though I deny not the other to follow. To his questions I answer. They have a right and possession of that relation, and it is given them by God with the relation, and to those that have the relation in fact, or as I spake actually in respect of what they did. God gives this more to them that are his servants by reason of his right in them, that they have actual obedience to him, according to that of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>His servants ye are to whom ye obey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Saith Mr. <hi>B. whether they are servants actively or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively is nothing to the being or form of the relation; they are servants of God still. And it seems by this answer, that if God had called infants Disciples never so oft Mr.</hi> T. <hi>would have put God off with this distinction, and said, they are Disciples passive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not actively. For</hi> 3. <hi>What reason can he give why they</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:100457:99"/>
               <hi>may not be called Disciples in a passive sense as well as servants?</hi> 4. <hi>Doth not God bid his Apostles baptize those that were Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples without distinguishing? or doth he bid them baptize active Disciples, but not passive ones? Where is that distinction in the command?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is so inured to his spitefull language, that my giving him an answer to his objection and clearing the words <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 41. is termed by him <hi>putting off God with a distinction,</hi> as if I answered God, and not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> But to the matter. 1. Though servants actively and passively may be both called servants, as a slave bought with money, but sick and weak, who never did ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice actually, may be called his Lords servant, because at his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose, yet not univocally, as they speak in Logick, in comparison of him that doth actually service, because he is a servant but in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, whereas he that is a servant not onely by being at his Lords dispose for his Lord to assign what he will for him, because of his propriety in him, but also doth service actively for his Lord, is in a double respect a servant, of which the later is that which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and from which the denomination is primarily and principally taken, as the relation of a son is principally from generation, though analogically in some respect an adopted son have that title. 2. But were it supposed the term did univocally agree to both, yet the question being whether Infants be Disciples, and the argument being brought from the title of Gods servants to prove them Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the term [<hi>Servants of God</hi>] passively taken for one that doth not voluntarily any service to God, but onely is at Gods dispose, is not as much as [<hi>a Disciple of Christ</hi>] which signifies one <hi>that hath learned Christ,</hi> and professeth himself to follow his teaching. And so it is a clear answer, that infants are not proved to be Christs Disciples by being proved to be passively Gods servants, except they be also proved to be actively such, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> obeying the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and professing that obedience. What ever seems to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (whose imaginations of me are still to the worst) If I had found God call once Infants Disciples in the sense, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. I should quickly have yielded there is no need of such a distinction of active or passive Disciple, si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h I finde the title given to none but such as are actual learners, and that is a reason why Infants may not be called Disciples in a passive sense as well as Gods servants.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100457:99"/>
For use is the rule of understanding words, and Christ bids us baptize onely Disciples that are actual learners, and profess Christ their Master, as appears both by Christs words, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. in which he expresseth that by [<hi>he that believeth</hi>] which he did <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. by [<hi>a Disciple</hi>] and by the practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, who best understood Christs precept, and by the constant use of the word [<hi>Disciple</hi>] in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> as is proved above. Nor needs there be any such distinction of active and passive Disciple in the command, because the word [<hi>Disciple</hi>] is not used passively, though [<hi>Servant of God</hi>] be.</p>
            <p>5. Saith Mr. <hi>B. But I shall be bold to take it for one of Mr. T. his fictions, and a meer falshood, that Infants are here called Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants passively onely, till he have done somewhat to prove it; to which end he hath not spoken one word, as thinking it seems that he spake to men that will take his word. Why may they not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Servants from the meer interest of Dominion that God hath to them? and authority over them? Are Infants the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or Servants in a passive sense onely? Is it not foundation enough for the relation of a servant, if God will own them so, and number them with his family of meer grace, though he should make no use of them at all? or if there must be more: may they not be called so, as being destinated to his service for the future? And so they may have the relation before the service; which is common with those men that buy children with their parents for their future service. So Eccl.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>reade it.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> How egregiously doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> trifle, who expects I should prove, who was but the Respondent, and that also which is apparent to common sense, that infants are not servants of God actively in obeying his precepts, or as I sayd in my <hi>Sermon,</hi> in freely and voluntarily giving service to God and doing what he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>s many importinent questions to me, as if he would by them know my minde in that which I had plainly though more briefly expressed, to wit that the <hi>Jews</hi> infants were Gods servants. 1. Of right, because God had a right, propriety or perculiar interest in them,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100457:100"/>
he had purchased them otherwise than he had done other people. 2. Passively, so as that their bodies and liberties were at his dispose, not allowing men to dispose of them, as he did to dispose of others. As for the question <hi>may they not be so called as destinated to his service for the future?</hi> I conceive not; destination to his service for the future doth not either there or any where else that I know, give denomination to a servant as actually such: no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> doth I think any thing in the Text lead us to such a reason of the denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to that which I have set down. And to his question, <hi>Are infants the Kings Subjects or servants in a passive sense onely?</hi> I answer, yes, while they are infants, and should question his intellectuals that should deny it; and when he cals it <hi>my fiction and meer falshood, that infants are here called servants passively only,</hi> it seems prejudice against me makes him count that a fiction and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in my mouth, which is current enough when it comes from his own pen. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is not yet reconciled to me, theres more anger yet behinde. For thus he speaks.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>But the grossest is yet behinde, (as the worst errour is still at last, and the further a man goes out of his way the further he goes amiss) would any man think that such a man as</hi> Mr. <hi>T. can possibly believe that infants are called Gods servants in no other sense than the Heavens and Earth are?</hi>

And yet if I had said so I know no errour in it, much less gross erour, or grossest of all. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> asks <hi>placet.</hi> Well! room for Mr. <hi>B.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100457:100"/>
and to answer his questions, though he would not answer mine at the Dispute, when he should. To his first and second I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer affirmatively. It is not good Philosophy to say, the Heavens onely suffer, and act nothing: but it is very good Philosophy, and Divinity too, that the Heavens are onely passive servants of God, when they do Gods will, they do it not with consent of will, as when <hi>the stormy windes fulfill Gods word, Psal.</hi> 148. 8. they do act, but not actively obey God. Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>did what Gods counsel determined, Acts</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27, 28. yet were not active servants of God, but passive, the doing of Gods will was besides their intentions So <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Jer.</hi> 43. 10. <hi>Sennacherib, Isai</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren, <hi>Shimei, Absolom, &amp;c.</hi> are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God in this sense. And in this sense <hi>the Heavens are Gods servants,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> might have perceived by the joyning <hi>the earth</hi> with them, which moves not, or rather in this passive sense, because they are at Gods disposing.</p>
            <p>2. Saith he, <hi>What if the Earth and Infants were both called Gods Servants onely in a passive sense, because God maketh use of them? Is it therefore in the same sense? Answ.</hi> Yes. Mr. <hi>B. Is it the same use that God maketh of both? Answ.</hi> No, and yet it is the same sense. Again, Mr. <hi>B. What if Christ were called Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant for his suffering? Shall we say it were in no other sense than the Earth is so called? when the use and sufferings are so unlike?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No, for if Christ were called Gods servant for his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, I would call him an active servant of God, not a passive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For though he in his suffering were passive, and Divines call it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive obedience, yet he did not obey passively, that is, against his will, or without consent of will, as the Earth doth, but actively, out of his free and voluntary intention, and consent of will. Be the use and suffering never so unlike, those persons or things may be in the fame sense passive servants of God, whose sufferings or use ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisheth Gods will without their intention, and they active ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the same sense whose use or sufferings are with intention and consent to accomplish the will of God, though their use or sufferings are much unlike.

that they are servants in the same sense, when the action is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, for I never took the identity of sense to presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose necessarily likeness in the actions. The same sense is when words signifie a like meaning, whatever likeness or unlikeness there be in the actions of the subjects to which the Predicate is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted. And I pity Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> oscitancy that doth not observe such obvious things, but troubles others with such frivolous questions. But yet there are more of these demands to be answered.</p>
            <p>3. Saith Mr. <hi>B. Hath not God prevented all these Cavils by joyning Parents and Children together in the same title? He saith of Parents and Children both together, they are my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: where it is evident that both therefore have the same kinde of relation. And will he say that the Parents are onely passive servants?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, in that place, according to the explication before given; and I conceive that God hath prevented all Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> Cavils against this exposition, even in that he joyns Parents and Children, (who can be no other ways servants of God) together, in the same title; besides other passages of the Text do shew it, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged above.</p>
            <p>4. Saith Mr. <hi>B. Or if all this be not enough, yet look further, where God himself tels you the reason why he cals them his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, (who knows better than Mr.</hi> T.) <hi>They are my servants which I brought out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>&amp;c. Gods interest and mercifull choice of them, and separation to himself, is the reason. When God cals us his servants, it oftn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r signifieth the honor and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of that relation, which in mercy he cals us to, than any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice we do him therein. Are the Heavens Gods servants, because he brought them out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and separated them to himself as a peculiar People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is a strange man, most shamefully dealing with me, who suggests to the world of me as if I took no notice of that in the Text, which in my <hi>Sermon</hi> as it is printed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>pag.</hi> 181. was observed in the first place with advice to my hearers to mark it, and urged it to that end that I might shew this was peculiar to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> children, and therefore imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently brought by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to prove <hi>our infants Gods servants</hi> as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100457:101"/>
there it is meant much less as [<hi>Gods servants</hi>] is a term equipollent to [<hi>a Disciple Matth.</hi> 28. 19.] all which he seems not to take notice of, but in stead thereof after a dictate or two without proof, he puts to me this frivolous question, <hi>Are the Heavens Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants because he brought them out of Egypt, and separated them to himself as a peculiar people?</hi> To which I answer no, but what then? cannot therefore the Heavens be said to be Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants passively, that is, at Gods dispose, because they were not brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> as the infants, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 41.? The reason is given there in respect of the subject, why they were Gods servants when other people were not, not on the part of the predicate, as if none were servants but they that were brought out of <hi>Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is called <hi>Gods servant, Jer.</hi> 43. 10. for going into <hi>Egypt</hi> there executing Gods will on the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> though he had no intention of doing any thing for God.</p>
            <p>5. Saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 
               <q>yet if all this be not enough, he that will see may be convinced from this.</q> The <hi>Jews</hi> and their infants are called Gods servants in a sense peculiar as chosen and separated from all other: the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at age were not so Gods servants as the <hi>Jews</hi> infants were. If God call these infants his servants in no other sense than the Heavens and the earth, then it seems in the year of Jubilee men must release the earth from its service to them: But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> knows that even the Gentile servants that were actively so were not to be released in the year of Jubilee: and therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> and their infants are called Gods servants in another sense than the Heavens or the heathens either; even as the chosen separated people of God and members of his family. or else how could it be a reason for releasing them in the year of Jubilee any more than for releasing any other? But no Scripture can be so plain, but a man that hath a minde so disposed may finde some words of contradiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, and Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> cavils about this Text appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently preve it. But this with all the rest is not enough to convince me that the infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> are called <hi>Gods servants</hi> actively, as the term [<hi>Gods servant</hi>] is equipollent to [<hi>a Disciple Matth.</hi> 28. 19.] though I would see it, yet I cannot, no not by Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> spectacles, even by this last reason. I confess that <hi>the Jews infants were Gods servants in a peculiar manner, other than the</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:100457:102"/>
               <hi>Gentiles at years, yea though godly, as Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. 2. that God for this reason required their release from bondage at the Jubilee, and yet why it should follow, that if the Earth be called <hi>Gods servant</hi> passively, as the <hi>Jews</hi> infants, it must be released by men from service at the year of Jubilee, I see not. If it were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into an Argument, it would rest on this or the like Proposition, They to whom the same thing is predicated, in the same sense must have all other things predicated on them alike: which is so absurd a thing, that me thinks Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should disclaim it, and yet his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son turns on that hinge. To shew its absurdity, Magistrates are called <hi>Gods, Jehovah</hi> is called <hi>God</hi> in one sense in respect of rule, else the term [<hi>God</hi>] should signifie nothing common to both. Doth it therefore follow that what is said of Magistrates must be said of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that <hi>he must dy like men,</hi> or else the term [<hi>God</hi>] cannot predicate on both in the same sense in which [<hi>God</hi>] is taken for one that rules? This and such like mistakes of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> even then when he runs with full curreer shew his heedlesness, and overliness in handling controversies, which require a man of more insight in the meaning of the Scripture, and more circumspect in observing the consequents on his sayings and reasonings than I finde him.

               <p>That Infants are not proved to be Christs Disciples, from being Subjects to Christ, Christians, belonging to Christ, Luke 9. 47, 48. Matth. 18. 5. Mark 9. 41.</p>

            <p>THe sum of the next Argument is, <hi>Infants are capable of being Subjects of Chrsts kingdom, therefore of being his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. The reason of the Consequence is, that Christs Church is as properly called his Kingdom as his School, all Subjects of Christ in his visible Kingdom are Christians, all Christians Disciples, according to Acts</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Infants are capable of being Subjects in any Kingdom on Earth, nothing can be shewed to</hi>

            <p>To all which I answer, Its enough to deny the consequence sith infants may be subjects which imports onely somthing passive, whereas [<hi>Disciple</hi>] imports action, which agrees not to infants. But I distinguish, subjects of Christs Kingdom may be so called from active or passive subjection, visibly or invisibly, by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary or ordinary operation. I deny infants to be subjects of Christs Kingdom actively, visibly, by ordinary operation through Preaching the word in which sense alone the term [subject of Christs Kingdom] is equipollent to [a Disciple <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.] and in which sense alone the consequence is true.

Though infants be reckoned as parts of human Kingdoms, yet it follows not they are parts of Christs visible Kingdom or Church. For then natural fools, yea the mostungodly professed unbelievers, must be subjects of Christs visible Kingdom or Church, because such are subjects of human kingdoms. I have seen <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 24. and see nothing there for Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> purpose, but against him, there being no subjection there meant but what is willing, which infants have not, except by extraordinary operation unknown. Infants whether of believers or unbelievers are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being Christs subjects passively, or actively by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary secret invisible, and unknown operation, but not actively, visibly by ordinary means for want of the use of reason. This consequence will never be proved by Mr. <hi>B. Infants were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the</hi> Jewish <hi>Church, therefore visible Church members of the Christian Church.</hi> To this argument, <hi>Infants were Disciples in the</hi> Jewish <hi>Church,</hi> Ergo, <hi>God will shew the like mercy now,</hi> I answer by denying his antecedent, which he would prove from <hi>John</hi> 9. 28. <hi>we are</hi> Moses <hi>Disciples in opposition to Jesus Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> But <hi>infants were</hi> Moses <hi>his Disciples.</hi> This proposition I
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100457:103"/>
deny, and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath brought nothing to prove it. The Text mentions none as <hi>Moses Disciples</hi> but persons of years, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theres no need of further answer to his argument.</p>
            <p>3. <q>My third argument saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to prove some infants are Disciples, is this from Christs own words. If Christ would have some children received as Disciples, then they are Disciples; But Christ would have some such received as Disciples; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some such are Disciples. All the question is of the antecedent and that is plain in <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 47, 48. compared which <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 5. and <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 41. He that receiveth this childe in my name receiveth me. Here observe. 1. It was the childe himself that Christ would have received. 2. He would have him received [in his name] now that can mean no less than as a Disciple: when they are baptized it is into his Name: And that which in <hi>Luke</hi> is called [receiving in Christs name] is expressed in <hi>Mark</hi> [one that belongeth to Christ] and in <hi>Matthew</hi> [in the name of a Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple] though some of these places speak of infants, some of others: yet compared, they plainly tell you this; that to receive [in Christs Name] and [as belonging to Christ] and [as a Disciple of Christ] in Christs language is all one, for they plainly express the same thing intended in all. So that Christ hath encouraged me to receive children [in his Name] <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 47. And he expoundeth it to me, that this is to receive them [as belonging] to him, and as [Disciples] I know some frivolous answers are made to this: but they are not worth the standing on. Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Argument hence remaineth as good as unanswered.</q>

            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, if the Answers be more frivolous than the Argument they are not indeed worth standing on. But let us see what kinde of Argument it is. 1. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>Some Infants are Disciples,</hi> and he concludes that <hi>Some Children are Disciples,</hi> or else he means by [<hi>some such</hi>] in the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> and conclusion others than by [<hi>some Children</hi>] in the <hi>major,</hi> now <hi>some Infants</hi> and <hi>some Children</hi> are not all one. 2. The phrase in the middle term [<hi>received as Disciples</hi>] may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood two ways, 1. thus, that Christ would have them received as being Disciples, and in this sense I grant the Consequence, but deny the <hi>minor,</hi> understood of some infants. 2. That he would have them received with such tenderness and love as is given to Disciples, though they be not Disciples. And in this sense I might grant the <hi>minor,</hi> and deny the Consequence of the <hi>major,</hi> though I think the <hi>minor</hi> is not true in that sense.

               </gap>, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 48. must be expounded <hi>of this little childe,</hi> then the speech of Christ is to be understood onely of that one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual little childe and no other, for in that sense it is a Pronoun demonstrative, and so notes a demonstrative individual, as Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans speak, and so it shall note not onely <hi>the childe himself,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> observes, but even that particular little childe then present, and it would onely import a privilege appropriate to that little childe, and agreeing to no other, whereas the sense is manifest from the words there, and other places, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 40. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. <hi>John</hi> 13. 20. to be this, whosoever shall receive any one that comes in my Name, though he be as mean and as inconsiderable as this little childe, receiveth me; and therefore it is added presently, <hi>For he that is least among you all, the same shall be great,</hi> which shews that by [<hi>this</hi>] or [<hi>such a little childe</hi>] he meant the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, whosoever receiveth any of you, though as mean as this little childe, or such a little childe, receiveth me. 4. There are sundry things in the Text, and in parallel places, which do evince, that <hi>the receiving the little childe,</hi> neither is nor can be meant of a little childe in respect of age, much less an infant.</p>
            <p>As, 1. that it is supposed that the little childe here meant may <hi>be received in Christs name,</hi> but that agrees not with the meaning of the speech as there is meant to understand it of a little childe in age. For <hi>receiving in Christs name</hi> presupposeth <hi>coming in Christs name,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> 5. 43. 2 <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is either professing Christs name or Preaching or acting in Christs name. And that this is presupposed here, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 48. appears partly by the phrase <hi>receiveth him that sent him,</hi> which intimateth this to be the force of the speech, he that receiveth one such little childe sent by me receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me, and partly from the very next <hi>v.</hi> 49. where <hi>John</hi> is said <hi>to answer and say</hi> taking occasion, as it seems by the relation from Christs words, <hi>Master we saw one casting out Devils in</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:100457:104"/>
               <hi>thy name,</hi> which words intimate that he understood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>receiving in Christs name</hi> to be meant of one acting or speaking in Christs name, and thus is the phrase [<hi>in my name, in the name of the Lord</hi>] often used <hi>Matth.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23. 39 <hi>&amp;</hi> 24. 5. which thing is more fully confirmed by Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> parallel place. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 37, 41. It is plain that <hi>Mark</hi> sets down Christs words upon the same occasion of their contention for preheminence which <hi>Luke</hi> doth, and the same words <hi>v.</hi> 37. and there expresseth it, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall receive one of such little ones in my name,</hi> which cannot be meant of that little one then set before them, but of his Apostles and others who should be as mean as such a little one, and <hi>v.</hi> 39. expounds [<hi>in my name</hi>] of acting in my name, and <hi>v.</hi> 41. <hi>whosoever shall give you a cup of cold water in my name because ye are Christs,</hi> that is, ye are sent by Christ, or act for Christ, which shews <hi>v.</hi> 37. to be meant of the Apostles not little children in age, but such as did act for Christ though mean as little children. The same may be proved from <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 40, 41, 42. 2. Again, <hi>the receiving of the little childe</hi> proves it is not meant of a little childe in age. For what is the receiving? It is, 1. by hearing <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. 2. By entertaining upon travayl, as <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 52, 53. <hi>they did not receive him by making ready for him,</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 41. <hi>by giving a cup of cold water,</hi> which was no small kindness to a travailer in those dry and hot Countreys. But what kindness had this been to a little childe in age as an infant, that travayls not? On the contrary, <hi>not receiving</hi> is expressed <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 11. <hi>by not entertaining them into their house nor hearing their words.</hi> so the <hi>New Annot.</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 42. [<hi>he that receiveth you</hi>] <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. <hi>John</hi> 13. 20. <hi>that heareth your Doctrine willingly, and entertaineth you,</hi> which receiving agrees not to infants, nor any other receiving mentioned in the Gospels that hath such a blessing assured to it as here. 3. The reward annexed, to wit, <hi>the receiving of Christ</hi> shews <hi>the receiving of a little one in Christs name,</hi> to be another thing than the receiving of a little infant in Christs name, that is, after Mr. Bs. silly conceit, the receiving into the visible Church by baptizing it. For then the greatest blessing, that is, of receiving Christ and his Father should be annexed to so poor a thing as may be done by every poor Presbyter, or Curate, how ill mannerd soever
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100457:105"/>
he be; the baptizing, that is, as now its used and defended, the sprinkling of a little holy water on an infant. 4. It appears that a little infant is not meant <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 48. from the description of the little childe there meant. For Mr. B. himself compares that speech in <hi>Luke</hi> with the like, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 5. Now <hi>such a little childe Matth.</hi> 18. 5. is expressed <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>one of these little ones which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in me,</hi> (not as Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> in his <hi>Just Vindication, pag.</hi> 117. fondly conceives without any other Author that ever I heard of besides himself, <hi>one of those little ones, who are the little ones of them that believe in me.</hi> For then it should be either <gap reason="foreign">

I grant that in the places named <hi>to be such a little one, Matth.</hi> 18. 5. <hi>to belong to Christ, Mark</hi> 9. 41. <hi>to be a Disciple of Christ, Matth.</hi> 10 42. note the same sort of persons, yet I deny that proposition, which is the hinge of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> proof, [every one that belongs to Christ is a Disciple of Christ] For the holy Angels, those yet uncalled whom his Father hath given him, <hi>John</hi> 17. 10. belong to Christ, and yet are not to be called Disciples of Christ. And therefore I infer, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath no encouragement from Christs exposition of these Texts to account infants Disciples, and what he collects in his own fancy without the Text is frivolous and self contradicting, so little worth the standing on, that for my part I think this sheet of his Book, what ever be said of the rest, worth no more than a sheet that is made <hi>thur is piperisque <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus,</hi> yet he cannot forbear but must add more of this frivolous stuff.</p>
            <p>In answer to this objection, <hi>Infants cannot learn, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be Disciples,</hi> he adds thus much more. 1. <hi>They</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:100457:106"/>
               <hi>can partake of the protection and provision of their Master (as the children of those that the</hi> Israelites <hi>bought) and enjoy the privileges of the family and school, and be under his charge and dominion, and that is enough to make them capable of being Disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What privileges of Christs family and school, infants enjoy, I know not, what ever they be what ever protection, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, rule, care is for them, yet this is not enough to make them Disciples, as Christ meant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. till they have learnt, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess learning of this Lesson, that Jesus is the Christ; all that is said here of Children may be said of slaves bought with money, they are all then with him Disciples of Christ, though professed infidels.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>They are,</hi> saith he, <hi>devoted to learning, if they live: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are consecrated to him as their Master, who can teach them hereafter, and that is yet more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I may add, they may cry, as <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and his sixty six <hi>Bishops</hi> alleged for their Baptism, and suck, and smile, and play with the mother, and that is more than this, but neither the one nor the other any thing to the denomination of a Disciple of Christ.</p>
            <p>3. Saith he, <hi>I wonder you should be more rigorous with Christ in this case than you are with men. Is it not common to call the whole nation of the</hi> Turks <hi>both old and young by the name of</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, <hi>or Disciples of</hi> Mahomet?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What a pretty passage is this to set out a man as rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous with Christ, who expounds his words <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his constant language in all the Evangelists, because he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not infants to be called Disciples, as if Christ forsooth did plead for infants discipleship, and I were so stiff, as that I would not yield to him. But he thinks <hi>I will allow</hi> Mahometans <hi>children to be called</hi> Mahomets <hi>disciples, for it is the common use, and why not then we and our children by the name of Christians and Disciples of Christ. Answ.</hi> I confess I think the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use now is to call the <hi>Turks</hi> young and old <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and in Chorographical relations, <hi>English, French, &amp;c.</hi> are called Christian Nations, old and young, termed Christians: but neither do I finde the common use to be to call infants either <hi>Mahomets</hi> or Christs Disciples, nor if I did, should this sway me at all to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100457:106"/>
infants discipleship according to <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. till Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture use of the term [Disciple] applicable to that sense can be shewed.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath more of this childish arguing. <hi>And when a man hired a Philosopher to teach him and all his children, were they not all then Disciples of that Philosopher? They are entered under him as their Master for future teaching, are at present in the relation of Disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is no such strange thing to hear of a Physician taking a stipend to cure a man and all his children, but to hear of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher hired to teach a man, and all his children, even his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant children, and counting them Disciples, and entering them under him as their master, is so strange to me that it seems to me somewhat like a tale of a man of <hi>Gotham.</hi> Yet if there were any such thing acted by wise men in sober sadness, it is nothing to prove infants Disciples in Christs or his Apostles language. But the prettiest part of this Comedy or poppet play of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is yet behinde.</p>
            <p>4. Saith he. <q>And truly I wonder also that it should go so currant that infants are not capable of learning, the mother is a Preacher to the infant, partly by her action and gesture and partly by voice.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 
               <q> And why not by smiles, and kisses and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? But what then? <hi>They can dishearten and take off from vices and teach them obedience.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Tis true they can still them from crying: but how they can take them off from vices and teach them obedience to Gods Command I am yet to learn, it may be nurses may better inform me than Mr. <hi>B. Me thinks</hi> saith he, <hi>we should not make an infant less docible than some brutes.</hi> What doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mean by this? Doth he think they that deny infants to be Disciples allow brutes to be Disciples? A parret I think will sooner learn some words of Christs than an infant, yet I think neither learn any thing of the Doctrine of Christ till they understand it. But <hi>I am referred to nurses, who he</hi> saith, <hi>will tell me more in this than he can,</hi> It may be so; yet sure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to shew that any have made their infants learn the Doctrine of Christ. He adds. <hi>And what if they cannot at first learn to know Christ? even with men of years that is not the first Lesson: if they may be taught any of the duty of a rational</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:100457:107"/>
               <hi>creature it is somewhat. Answ.</hi> If they do not learn to know Christ they learn not that which should make them Disciples of Christ. It is somewhat indeed that they can learn to kiss the mother, stroke her breasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but whats this to make them Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christ? <hi>And if they can learn nothing of the parents either by action or voyce; yet Christ hath other ways of teaching than by men even by the immediate working of his Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true, and he may make infants Disciples, nor do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it to be done invisibly, but it would be a greater wonder than yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath had for all his wonderments, a very prodigy that any of them should become a visible Disciple. 'Tis true <hi>they may learn something of God very young and are to be bred up in the nurture of the Lord.</hi> But that in their infancy at two or three dayes old they are learners of the things of God, of the admonition of the Lord from mothers and nurses is a fiction like <hi>Galilaeus</hi> his New World in the Moon, or <hi>Copernicus</hi> his Circumgyration of the earth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tels us <hi>he might argue further, All that are saved are Christs Disciples, some infants are saved, Ergo.</hi> And I might answer him, that they may be saved, and yet no visible Disciples according to the meaning of Christ <hi>Matth.</hi> 28 19. But sith he hath put this off to another time I shall take a little breathing from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and set him aside a little while till I have heard what his seniors say further for their baby-baptism.</p>

as the reason of infant baptism <hi>Lumb. Sent.</hi> 4. <hi>Dist.</hi> 3. allegeth some as making the institution of baptism to be <hi>John</hi> 3. 5.

But the former is true.</hi> Ergo, <hi>the latter.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 43. <hi>none ought to exclude the children of the faithfull out of the Kingdom of Heaven. But by denying them baptism (as much as in us lieth) we exclude them out of the Kingdom of Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For as Christ affirmed to</hi> Nicodemus, <hi>and confirmed it with a double oath or most vehement asseveration, Amen, Amen; or verily, verily (I say unto thee) except a man he born of Water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Ergo, <hi>we ought not to deny them baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This arguing is the same in effect notwithstanding the Doctors mincing it (which is but a little) with that which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists bring for their horrid tenet of Exclusion out of the Kingdom of Heaven of infants dying unbaptized. For he holds that there is a necessity of baptizing children or else they cannot enter into the Kingdom of God ordinarily. In which assertion he denies any infants enterance into the kingdom of God ordinarily without water-baptism. And no more is said as I conceive by the more moderate Papists, such as <hi>Biel, Cajetan, Gerson,</hi> cited by <hi>Perkins in his preparative to the demonstration of the probleme.</hi> But no marvail the Doctor; who was addicted to the Common Prayer Book, concurred thus far with the Papists: For in it the Doctrine of <hi>Augustin,</hi> and others is retained, of asserting the necessity of infant-baptism because of original sin and Christs words, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 5.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100457:108"/>
as appears by the Preface appointed to be used before the solemnity of Baptism. But Protestant Divines do generally refute this opinion, as <hi>e. g. Chamier Panstr. Cath. tom.</hi> 4. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>de Bapt. c.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> teaching that infants of believers are ordinarily holy, and admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven, though dying unbaptized? But to answer his Arguments, 1. it's known that <hi>Calvin, Piscator,</hi> and many more do take [water] metaphorically, and the conjunction [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>and</hi>] to be exegetical not coupling differing things, but expounding what is meant by [<hi>water</hi>] as if he had said, <hi>that water which is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> as when it is said <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>He shall baptize with you the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost and with fire,</hi> that is, with the Holy Ghost, which is as fire. And this they conceive as necessary, that the speech of Christ may be verified. For simply understood it is false, sith the Thief on the Cross, sundry Martyrs and others have entered into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven unbaptized. And this Exposition <hi>Chamier Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat. Cath. tom.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. hath taken upon him to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain against the opposites to it, and if true the objection of Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> fals, which rests on this, that there a necessity of water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism is imposed on all that shall enter into the Kingdom of God. Nevertheless I confess my self unsatisfied in this Exposition. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Because I do not think that <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11. by [<hi>fire</hi>] is meant the Holy Ghost as being like fire in his operation on every sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed person: but that the words are an express prophesie of what Christ also foretold, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 5. and was accomplished at Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 3. <hi>when the Holy Ghost filled them, and fiery cloven tongues sate upon each of them.</hi> 2. Because if it were parallel to that place, and [<hi>water</hi>] were used metaphorically, (as is said by them) and exegetically added [<hi>water</hi>] should be after, and [<hi>spirit</hi>] before, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11. [<hi>spirit</hi>] is first, and [<hi>fire</hi>] after, and after the usual manner of speaking, it should run thus, except a man be born of the spirit and water, if it were to be expounded of the spirit which is as water. Dr. <hi>Homes animadv.</hi> on my <hi>Exercit: pag.</hi> 30. allegeth <hi>Bullinger,</hi> saying, <hi>Omnes penè de baptismo, Ioh.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretantur,</hi> to which he adjoyns <hi>Bullingers,</hi> and his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For these reasons I am much inclined to expound it of the Element of Water. Yet, 2. am very apt to conceive, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Mr. <hi>Selden de jurenat. &amp; Gent. juxta discipl. Heb. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. tels us that when the <hi>Iews</hi> did initiate Proselytes by

baptizing them with water, they called it Regenerating, and that Christ, when he taunts <hi>Nicodemus</hi> with dulness in being a Master in <hi>Israel,</hi> and yet not knowing of Regeneration, but by imagining a natural New-birth, when Regeneration was frequent in bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Proselytes among the <hi>Iews,</hi> insomuch that by it they taught a person lost his natural relations of kinred as he shews, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 18. and hath these words in the place above cited, [<hi>tamet si de eâ quae spiritu fit non solùm aquâ loqueretur Christus</hi>] our Saviour meant baptism of water, not according to his Apostles practice, but the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that the sense is this, Except a man be born of water, and of the spirit, that is, Except a man be not onely born again by water, as ye Pharisees regenerate, when ye make Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, but also by the spirit, as I do beget again he cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of God, although he may enter into the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth or policy of <hi>Israel:</hi> which sense nevertheless doth not assert a necessity of their water-regeneration, but onely of Christs spiritual regeneration, and the insufficiency of the other by it self, which is so much the more probable, because I finde <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 29. seems to answer to [not onely but also] yet because I finde not a place every way parallel, I onely propound it to be examined. But 3. it being granted that it is meant of Christs water-baptism, yet Papists themselves make not such a necessity of it as is without limitation and exception, and therefore they put in some one, some another restriction, which <hi>Chamier</hi> in the place alleged reduceth to four: 1. <hi>Unless the person be baptized either with the baptism of water, or some other thing instead of it, as the baptism of bloud and spirit.</hi> 2. <hi>If they may be baptized, and they despise it.</hi> 3. <hi>If they be not baptized with that Regeneration which is by water, though it may be otherwise also.</hi> 4. <hi>If they be neither baptized in deed nor desire.</hi> Why may not then this limitation be added, <hi>Except a man be born again of water,</hi> that is, except such a person of whom baptism is required, according to my institution, be born of water, when he may have it, and its cleared to him to be his duty, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom of God. And indeed this and such like speeches <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 18, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that require faith as well as baptism, are to be understood of persons to whom the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100457:109"/>
is preached, and do or may hear it, and speak not of infants, whom we finde not that God enters into the Kingdom of Heaven any other way than by his invisible election and operation of his Spirit. And it is observable, that whereas <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. our Saviour joyns <hi>water and spirit</hi> as means of Regeneration, yet <hi>v.</hi> 6. he names onely the spirit, omitting water; whence may be gathered, that water is not of such universal unrestrained necessity, that in no case a person is not born again without it, nor admissible into the Kingdom of God, yet such as is necessary ordinarily to those to whom the Gospel is preached, and their duty made known. Whence in answer to the Doctors argument I say, that his speeches are to be thus limited at least, <hi>none can enter into the Kingdom of God ordinarily without baptism,</hi> to wit, of those to whom the Gospel is preached, their duty made known, and Baptism may be had; and to his later Argument I answer, by denying that children are excluded out of the Kingdom of Heaven by denying them Baptism, sith those unbaptized persons onely are excluded who are appointed to be baptized, to whom the Gospel is preached, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Baptism made known, and they may have it administred to them, which cannot be said of infants.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Stephens</hi> in his Book intituled, <hi>A Precept for the Baptism of Infants out of the New Testament,</hi> having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised some thing about the Text, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. about <hi>the necessity of baptism of water, and the efficacy of it,</hi> in which many things are meerly dictated, and very slightly handled, he would infer <hi>pag.</hi> 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Precept for infant-baptism from <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. because <hi>infants are guilty of original sin, where the disease is there is need of the remedy, when Christ doth press a necessity of washing both by water and the spirit, he doth not this so immediately in reference to actual sin, as in reference to birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin, and to the natural pollution in which infants are born.</hi> The same is the plea of Mr. <hi>Thomas Fuller</hi> in his <hi>Infants Advocate, c.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That either baptism of water or Circumcision are made the remedy of original sin is more than I finde in Scripture, though it go as currant among many of former and later times. It is true our Lord Christ saith, <hi>Except a man be born of Water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, John</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:100457:109"/>
3. 5. and he assigns this as a reason thereof, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>That which is born of the flesh is flesh,</hi> but that either thereby he intended to make baptism as the remedy of sin, or of original sin rather than actual is more than appears, For though our Lord Christ <hi>v.</hi> 5. make regeneration to be by Water and Spirit yet I conceive rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is by the Spirit onely as the cause, by baptism of water onely as the sign, whereby the person baptized testifies that he is born again by the Spirit. Now a remedy is a cause and not a sign onely: no man calls that which is onely a sign of cure a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, but that which doth operate for healing. That baptism of water is not the cause of regeneration appears. 1. Because <hi>v.</hi> 6. our Saviour giving the reason of the necessity of regeneration and the effect of regeneration, leaves ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> [<hi>water</hi>] and mentions onely [<hi>the Spirit</hi>] 2. Because the person baptized is supposed to be born again, to be a repenting and believing person afore he is baptized: But if baptism were the cause it should be before regeneration, (for the cause is before the effect) and so men should be baptized afore they are believers, or repenting persons, which is absurd, and contrary to the Scripture, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and contrary to the order of Christ that persons should be made Disciples afore they were baptized <hi>Matth.</hi> 28 19. 3. Because it is altogether inexplicable how the use of water can be a cause either principal or instrumental to work a new birth or inward change on the soul; If it be sayd, that it is by virtue of Gods promise, it is meet that promise should be shewed, that at, by or upon the use of baptism, God hath promised to regenerate persons. That it is a sign of regeneration will not be I suppose denyed; for it is made the sign of repentance (which is all one with regeneration) and therefore called <hi>the baptism of repentance Acts</hi> 19. 4. because as <hi>Beza</hi> on <hi>v.</hi> 3. baptism was <hi>symbolum resipiscentiae, the token of repentance.</hi> And so in like manner it was the sign of faith, and therefore the Apostle <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. saith, <hi>That as many as were baptized into Christ had put on Christ,</hi> that is, had by the sign of baptism testified their putting on Christ by faith. And in this sense it is termed <hi>the washing of regeneration</hi> (if bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism be meant by it) <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. because by that washing the person baptized testifies his regeneration. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>We are buried with him by baptism into death,</hi> that is, we by being under water

But this I still say, that could it be clearly proved that Christ ever appointed baptism of water taken severedly from the preaching of the Word to be the cause of Regeneration, or that God had assured that by outward baptism with water he would confer regenerating grace to an infant, I should not oppose the practice of Paedobaptism. What Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> hath produced for the efficacy of baptism, hath been answered by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Appendix</hi> to his <hi>Plain Scripture, &amp;c.</hi> Nor doth it appear to me that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is of his minde, notwithstanding what Letters have past between them now printed, and the syncretism yielded to in the printing of the <hi>Friendly Accommodation,</hi> and leaving out the <hi>Appendix.</hi> Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> his Treatise of <hi>Baptismal Regeneration,</hi> hath been freely censured by many. Dr. <hi>Ieremiah Taylour</hi> in his <hi>Discourse of baptism</hi> hath like an Orator rather than a Disputant pleaded for infant-baptism from the efficacy of baptism, more from speeches of the Fathers than from the Scripture. Sure I am, baptism was appointed by Christ, and used in the examples of the Scripture, as a testimony of Repentance, of faith in Christ, no cause of either. And therefore I deny <hi>baptism to be the remedy of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal sin, or the cause of Regeneration, or that Christ intended to assign the use to baptism to heal original sin, or to testifie the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from it without actual.</hi> These things have been delivered by

               <p>The 31. Chapter of Mr. <hi>Bs. Plain Scripture Proof,</hi> &amp;c. is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and Mark 10. 13, 14, 15, 16. is shewed to make nothing for infants visible Church-membership and baptism, and his description of visible Church-membership is considered, and his Argument from Deut. 29. shewed to be insufficient.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THere are yet some other Texts which are brought by Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists out of the New Testament, for an institution and practice of infant-baptism. Mr. <hi>B. Plain Scripture Proof of infant-baptism, part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. brings <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 36, 37. to prove that, <hi>Christ hath expresly assured us that he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed the privilege of infants visible Church-membership,</hi> and upon it fals to his Rhetorick, and tels us <hi>of his boldness in adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing on this rule.</hi> All which I judg frivolous; nor needs it any further answer, there being no new Argument, and what he before spake of that Scripture is answered before <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. where it is shewed that <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 37. by [<hi>little childe</hi>] is not meant one that is so in respect of age, but in respect of quality, and that <hi>the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> is not meant of baptism, but entertainment in receiving the Doctrine brought, and shewing kindness to their persons.</p>
            <p>But he adds, <q>And it is not once but oft that he hath thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested his will: in the very next Chapter he doth it more fully yet, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14, 15, 16.</q> And they brought young children to him that he should touch them; and his Disciples rebuked those that brought them: but when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said to them, Suffer ye little children to come unto me, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little childe he shall not enter therein: and he took them up in his arms,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100457:111"/>
put his hands on them, and blessed them. And is not here enough to satisfie us yet, that he doth not cast all infants in the world out of his visible Kingdom or Church? but that it is his will they should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? Will any say that it was not infants in the former Text and this that Christ speaks of? Did he take any but infants into his arms? Was it not plainly them that he did bid them receive (in the former Chapter) and was it not them that he would not have to be kept from him? And was it not them that he bid should be suffered to come (that is to be brought) and was it not them that he blessed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in his <hi>Sermon</hi> had alleged this Tex to prove, that <hi>the infants of believers even while they are infants do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the inward grace as well as grown men.</hi> I answered, 1. It is doubtfull whether those little children <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14. were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. 2. Whether it be said of them, <hi>Is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> 3. Whether they were believers infants. 4. Whether the Kingdom of Heaven be said to be of them in their present estate or their future. 5. The reason why <hi>of them is the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> may be referred to Christs blessing, not to their Parents faith 6. That Christs action in this was proper to him, as the great Prophet, and extraordinary, and therefore not fit to make a constant rule for an ordinance, and if it be to that use it is more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to establish confirmation than baptism, sith Christ did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baptize, nor appoint them to be baptized, though he said <hi>of them is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> In all likelihood, if infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism had been according to Christs minde he would have taken this occasion to appoint it, which he not doing, it is very probable that he would not have it done.</p>
            <p>To all which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in his <hi>Defence pag.</hi> 221, 222. replied onely this, <hi>that they were dictates and brought in to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi> whereas there is nothing sayd by me without reason and some proof, and yet I being a respondent it was more than my business necessitated me to produce so much, a denial being sufficient for the respondent. And whereas he saith I <hi>grant enough to serve his turn, that the Kingdom of Heaven did belong to those infants and concludes that their infants in their infantile age are capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace, and some of them actually partakers of it, and this is enough for him, and that more than this cannot be said of grown</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:100457:111"/>
               <hi>men who are visible professors.</hi> To it I say, Though I should grant that the Kingdom of Heaven did belong to these infants, yet it serves not his turn to prove thence that the infants of believers are visible Church-members, and that believers infants have right to baptism, except it be proved that their parents were believers, that the Kingdom of Heaven for that reason did belong to them, and in this thing was intended by Christ, the establishing a settled rule for infants interest in the Church and baptism. Capacity of inward grace is not denied to infants, no not to <hi>Turks</hi> infants: whether any of them be partakers actually of inward grace is not determined: nor is it true <hi>that no more can be sayd of grown men:</hi> for the making of visible profession may be said of grown m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, which cannot be said of infants.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is eager for infant-baptism as conclusible hence, lets see what he saies. First he begins with his Rhetorick, which commonly supplies the want of proof. Then he heaps <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p seven or eight inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rogations, and takes all for granted which he demands. But to them I say.</p>
            <p>To the first, 1. I except against his expression which infinuates as if by denying that infants are visible Church-members they were cast out of Christs visible Church, whereas it is one thing not to reckon them in and another to cast them out, which is but once used in Scripture 3 <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. and this phrase serves onely to provoke passion. 2. It is so far from being true <hi>that there is enough in those Texts to satisfy that Christ would have infants admitted into his visible Church,</hi> that it is rather true on the contrary that there is enough against it. To his other questions, I answer. 1. By denying that they were infants he would have received <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 37. 2. whether they were infants he took in his arms, whom he would not to be kept from him, but suffered to come to him, and whom he blessed, it is uncertain. <hi>Piscator, Estius, &amp;c.</hi> conceive they were young ones that could come of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves being called. But be it granted they were infants, lets see what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> gathers thence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence,</hi> saith he, <hi>I argue thus.</hi> 1. <hi>If Christ would have us receive infants in his name, then we must receive them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him and his Church. But he would have us to receive them in his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore &amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>If he that receiveth an</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:100457:112"/>
               <hi>infant in his name receiveth himself, then some infants are to be received in his name; and those that refuse them sin: But the former is true, therefore the later.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Both the conclusions might be granted and yet Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> cause not gained, the former, because infants may belong to Christ and his Church, to wit, the invisible, and yet it not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thence they are visible Church-members; the later, because they may be received in Christs name as by harbouring, feeding them, and yet not be admitted to baptism. 2. The <hi>minor</hi> in both Syllogismes is false: For the Text <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 37. speaks not of infants in age to be received, but of believers that are humble, and low in condition as infants, particularly of his Apostles.</p>
            <p>3. Saith Mr. <hi>B. if Christ was much displeased with those that kept particular infants from visible access to him, then (though they could not keep them from his visible grace) I think he will be much more displeased with those that keep all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the world from visible access to him in his Church now (though they cannot keep them from the invisible Church:) But the former is true: Therefore the later.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The conclusion is granted. For what visible access to Christ in his Church now can be but by profession of faith I know not. If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> know of any that keep infants from professing faith let him threaten them, and spare not. But that which he tels us that we keep infants from visible access to Christ, because we baptize them not for want of profession of faith, is but a squib that may affright women and children, when intelligent persons laugh at it.</p>
            <p>4. Saith he, <q>If Christ command us to suffer them to come, and not to forbid them, then those sin against his express Command that will not suffer them to come but do forbid them, (for it is a standing Command and speaks of infants, and not of these individuals onely; and there is now no other visible admittance to Christ but by admitting into his Church and to be his Disciples) But <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The conclusion is granted without any detriment to our cause: we forbid not any to come to Christ. There's no coming to Christ no was those little children came, that is, to come to his person for blessing, cure, or teaching by himself in the flesh. There's
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100457:112"/>
no coming to Christ now but by hearing his word, and believing in him, as <hi>John</hi> 6. 35. is expressed. If any forbid infants to do so let him bear the blame. But we forbid infants to be baptized till they come to Christ, that is, till they believe, and we are sure we have the Scripture for us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26, 27. A thing so known that all that heretofore baptized infants did take this as unquestionable, that believers onely are to be baptized, and therefore to justifie infant-baptism they run into wilde fancies, as that they believe in the Church, in their Parents, in their sureties, in their being baptized. But Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> hold is in his <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> against which I except, 1. that his speech of [<hi>admitting into his Church, and to be his Disciples</hi>] sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that a person is first admitted into Christs Church, and then to be his Disciple, whereas no man is rightly admitted into Christs Church, who is not first a Disciple. 2. That he saith, <hi>This Luke</hi> 18. 16. <hi>is a standing Commandment.</hi> But this we must take on Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> word, theres nothing in the Text, or in Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> writing to prove it. Nor is it likely. For if so, me thinks the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and the Writers of the New Testament should not have been so negligent as neither to observe this command after this time, nor to have recorded any act done by the Apostles according to that command. 3. <hi>That Chists speech is of the</hi> species <hi>of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and not of these individuals onely.</hi> 1. Is said without proof, yea it is more probable that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is as much as, <hi>Suffer these little children to come to me,</hi> and that because, as Paedobaptists urge, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>of such is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> (which is the reason of Christs injunction) is meant of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. 2. Were it granted not to be meant of those individuals onely, yet this is all that can be thence proved, that if after that time other infants were brought to Christ in that manner to be touched by him, they should be suffered. It may be granted, that <hi>there is now no other visible admittance to Christ but by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into his Church.</hi> But this is enough to prove that there is now no such visible admittance to Christ as those <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14 had, who were admitted to Christs person to be touched by him, and not into his visible Church by baptism.</p>
            <p>5. Saith Mr. <hi>B. If of such be the Kingdom of God, then of such is the visible Church: but the former is true. Therefore, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:100457:113"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The consequence is denied. Of infants in the mothers womb, as <hi>Jacob, John Baptist, &amp;c.</hi> is the Kingdom of God, and yet the visible Church is not of such.</p>
            <p>But saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 
               <q>Here they have two cavils against the plain sense of the Text, 1. By [such] is meant [such for doc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ess and humility] To which I answer, 1. Then it seems they are so docible and humble, that the Kingdom belongs to them.</q> For if it belong to others, because they are such as them, then it must needs belong to others also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> censure of the Answers I gave as cavils is as the rest of this his Dispute rash and inconsiderate. For the very words <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 15. do directly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lead to that sense I give, and the words of Christ <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3, 4. plainly expound wherein they that enter into the Kingdom of God must be like children. But to the matter of his Answer, 1. The conclusion is granted, nor was it ever deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me, that of some infants is the Kingdom of God, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of those whom Christ blessed, but yet not because of their docibleness and humility, but because of Christs blessing. Nor do I allow Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> consequence, that <hi>if the Kingdom did belong to others, because they are such as them, then it must needs belong to them also.</hi> For the Kingdom of Heaven did belong to others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are such as them in the properties common to them with other children. But the Kingdom of Heaven did belong to them as blessed by Christ, not in respect of docibleness and humility. It may be it will be said, that then little children have those proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for which of them may be the Kingdom of God. I answer, it doth not follow: but this onely follows that there is such teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness and humility in little children in other respects, which other men imitating and expressing in spiritual things, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming such as they are by analogy and resemblance, in that respect belong to the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>2. Saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 
               <q>Doth Christ say, To such as them in this or that respect onely, and not to them, (or saith he) not in general, To such? even to such as he took in his arms and blessed? He would not have taken up, and blessed any, for a meer Emblem of such as were blessed; he would not have taken up and blessed a Lamb or a Dove as Emblems of humility and innocency. If Christ say, [of such] is the Kingdom, I am bound to take Scripture
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100457:113"/>
in the most extensive sense, till there be a plain reason to necessitate me to restrain it. And therefore must understand it [to such] both of that age, or any other age. Who dare think that the word [to such] is not rather inclusive as to them than exclusive? If I love humble poor men, and my servants keep them from my house because they are poor, and if I chide them for it, and say, Suffer such to come to me, and forbid them not, for my delight is in such: who would so interpret this speech as to think I would exclude them, while I command their admittance? And that I meant other humble ones, and not these?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Doth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> say, To such in general in respect of age onely belongs the Kingdom of God. If he do say so (as his words seem to import) then it follows, that to every infant, whether of believers or unbelievers, elect or reprobate, belongs the Kingdom of God: If not, then he must say as I say, if he will speak truth, that 1. To those infants belonged the Kingdom in this respect onely as they were blessed by Christ, or elect. 2. If it be applied to other infants, it can be applied to no others but such as are blessed by Christ, or elect. 3. And for other persons, that under the term [of such] are meant also persons of age like them in humility and teachableness is so manifest from <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3. 4. 5. that it is nothing but cavilling in Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thus to carp at my plain and clear exposition of the words agreeable to the most approved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors, as <hi>Beza Annot. ad Matth.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>talium</hi>

And though Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> rule may be questioned, <hi>whether a man be bound to take Scripture in the most extensive sense till there be a plain reason to necessitate him to restrain it,</hi> yet I gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say it not, to understand [<hi>to such</hi>] <hi>both of that age or any other,</hi> and I allow that Christ meant <hi>those, and other humble ones,</hi> and that the term [<hi>of such</hi>] is both <hi>inclusive,</hi> including more than those particular little ones; and <hi>exclusive,</hi> of those that are not elect or
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100457:114"/>
blessed by Christ. And though I maintain by firm Arguments in my <hi>Postscript</hi> to Mr. <hi>Blake, sect.</hi> 20. that by <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. or <hi>of God,</hi> as <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 16. is meant the Kingdom of Glory, (which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not) yet were it allowed Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that it is meant of the visible Church, it is not true of all infants of believers, that of them is the visible Church, for infants in the womb, as <hi>Jacob,</hi> are of the Kingdom of God, that is the invisible Church, yet not of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, much less of the <hi>species</hi> of infants, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> speaks. For then every individual infant should be of the visible Church, though the Parents be unbelievers, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> me thinks should gainsay: and therefore there is plain reason necessitating to restrain the speech of Christ, as I do.</p>
            <p>3. Saith Mr. <hi>B. When Mr.</hi> T. <hi>maketh their docibleness the thing intended by Christ, he forgot that he judged them uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being Disciples. Why may not those be Disciples who are not onely docible, but exemplary for their teachableness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tels Mr. <hi>B.</hi> he did not forget, but thinks Mr. <hi>B.</hi> did not heed. The docibleness allowed to infants was in things natural, such as are to know the Nurse, imitate gestures, to be stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from crying when rebuked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not in things spiritual, to know Christ to be the Son of God, the <hi>Messiah, &amp;c.</hi> which are necessary to denominate them Disciples of Christ. Yet such teachableness, and humility onely negative, in not ambitiously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting preheminence are sufficient for Christ to propound them as examples or similitudes rather, to direct his Disciples to imitate in another kinde.</p>

               <q>Their second Objection, saith Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>B.</hi> is that by [the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God] is meant the Kingdom of Heaven. And I think so too: but then if the Kingdom of Heaven belong to such, much more a standing as members in the visible Church: For what is it to be a member of the Church visible, but to be one that in seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or appearance, or to the judgment of man, doth belong to the invisible Church or the Kingdom of Heaven? For the Church is but one, and the difference respective as I shewed before: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both visible and invisible, both military and triumphant are called in Scripture [<hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> or <hi>of God</hi>] If a man be known (or any sort of men) to belong to the Church invisible,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks it seems with me that by the Kingdom of God is meant the Kingdom of Heaven, that is, of Glory, or the invisible Church; which if true, then of no infants but elect is the Kingdom of God, for no other are of the invisible Church, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Glory. And if so, not the the very <hi>species</hi> of infants but particular persons, and of these not all perhaps but a few of the infants of believers, perhaps more of the infants of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers are of the Kingdom of God. But however he thinks it will follow <hi>à majori,</hi> that <hi>if of infants is the Kingdom of God, that is the invisible Church or Kingdom of Glory, then much more they have a standing in the visible Church.</hi> To which I say, 1. If this Argument were good, it could onely prove those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be of the visible Church who are elect. 2. It can prove it onely of those <hi>who in seeming or appearance, or to the judgment of men do belong to the invisible Church, or be known to belong to the invisible Church.</hi> But no infants in particular are known to belong to the invisible Church, nor is there any note whereby any infant in particular may be discerned to be of the invisible Church, which may make it seem or appear to the judgment of man, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> there is no infant, no not according to Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> own description, hath a standing in the visible Church. The <hi>minor</hi> of this Argument I expect should be denied, but it will concern them that do deny it, to shew us out of Scripture, where God hath given us any sign, though but probable, to judg such an infant to be of the invisible Church of the elect, such a one not. If any say Gods covenant and the Parents faith. I reply, God hath plainly declared <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18. that he hath not made any promise to the natural seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he will be their God in respect of saving grace, much less to the natural seed of every or any believer of this time, but that notwithstanding any covenant he hath made, he takes the seed of unbelievers to be his children, and leaves the seed of bellevers to be hardened: and this appeared plainly in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> of the same Parents believers, born together, yet one lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100457:115"/>
the other hated, and the Gentiles called, when the <hi>Jews</hi> were rejected. We say truly the book of life is a secret which belongs to God, who hath hidden it, yea hath so ordered it by the strange va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations of his calling, that <hi>his judgments should be unsearchable, and his paths past finding out, Rom.</hi> 11. 33. And therefore no man hath warrant from Gods Word to frame any judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this or that infant to be of the invisible Church. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Mr. <hi>B.</hi> says somewhat to prove his consequence, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what he brings. That which he sayth is, 1. <hi>The Church is but one, and the difference respective.</hi> 2. <hi>He that saith that they belong to the invisible, saith much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more, even that which includeth that they are visible,</hi> (if I understand his obscure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions) <hi>Church-members.</hi> 3. <hi>That to be a member of the Church visible, is to be one that in seeming or appearance, or to the judgment of man, doth belong to the invisible Church, or the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is true, the universal Church of the elect is but one, and the difference respective, yet the difference such, that all the invisible are not of the visible Church, nor all the visible of the invisible; nor by any good consequence can it be made good, they that are of the invisible are much more of the visible, no not when they are known to be of the invisible Church. The first is manifest by instances, the spirits of the just made perfect, elect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons yet unbegotten, yet uncalled, called, but not yet shewing it are of the invisible Church, but not of the visible: on the other side, secret hypocrites are of the visible, but not of the invisible. And the last Assertion is manifest, in that though it is more to be of the invisible Church than of the visible, yet that which denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates a person of the visible Church doth not agree always to a member of the invisible Church. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks the contrary to be true, and accordingly frames an explication of what it is to be a member of the Church visible, which I must not call a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that is excepted against by him, <hi>Praefestin: Morator, sect.</hi> 11. as if in Logick any descriptions or explications of words or things were not usually called definitions, though imperfect. Let's examine it however. He tels us here what it is to be a visible Church-member, which because he doth elsewhere more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, I shall have an eye on the writings elsewhere, and so much
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100457:115"/>
the rather, because in this mistake of his lieth much of the fallacy of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> second Argument. In his <hi>Praefest. Morator, sect.</hi> 11. He saith, when he distinguisheth the Church into visible and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, <hi>He doth not divide the</hi> genus <hi>into the</hi> species, <hi>sed aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum in sua aequivocata:</hi> but I think he is mistaken in this; for then a term is <hi>equivocal,</hi> as <hi>Arist. Categ.</hi> in the beginning tels us, <hi>When the name is onely common, but not the reason of being,</hi> or the definition according to that name; but the definition of the Church of Christ, even that which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself saith, <hi>All Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are agreed on plain Scripture, &amp;c. pag.</hi> 82. <hi>that it is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of persons separated from the world to God, or called out of the world,</hi> doth agree to the visible Church, and therefore the term [<hi>Church of Christ</hi>] is not an equivocal term, but a <hi>genus,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther univocal, or <hi>analogum. And I add,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the reason of the appellation given to the visible body is, its seeming to be the same with the mystical; or that the name is given secondarily, borrowedly from the mystical to the visible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant that the Church invisible is <hi>famosius</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marium Analogatum,</hi> that is, the invisible Church is more truly, or in a greater degree of propriety Christs Church than the visible, yet do not think <hi>the name of the Church is given secondarily, borrowedly, from the mystical to the visible.</hi> For the original meaning of the word] [<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100457:116"/>
Christs approbation, or non-approbation of them. And that the seeming to other men to be of the invisible Church, is not the reason of the appellation of a visible Church or Church-member, I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hence, becaus a person may seem to be of the invisible Church, yea may be known to be of the invisible Church of Gods elect, as for instance, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>John Baptist</hi> in their mothers womb see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yea were known to be of the invisible Church of Gods elect, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 15. yet not of the visible. For sure they were not visible Church-members, when they were not visible men. Yea there may be many visible men who may seem, with great probability upon signs of their conversion wrought on them, to be of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, and not of the visible as a number of <hi>Indians</hi> hearing Mr. <hi>Eliat,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Mayhew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> preach, and shewing affection by tears, smiting of their breasts, lifting up their eys to Heaven and such like actions, have seemed, from these sensible expressions, of their own, to be elect persons, such as God intended to save, and yet I think no man will say that at that time they were visible Church-members till they afterwards made profession of faith in Christ. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> goeth on thus, <hi>So that if you ask me, whether it be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or onely probable, that infants are members of the visible Church? I say, certain. Answ.</hi> If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mean it of the sorts or as he cals it <hi>species</hi> of infants, it may easily appear by this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view</hi> that it is so far from being certain [that infants are members of the visible Church Christian] that it hath scarse a shew of probability. If he mean it of the individuals, I say that according to Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> own sayings, there is no certainty that any infant is a visible Church-member. For according to him <hi>to be a member, of the Church visible is to be one that in seeming, or appearance, or to the judgment of man, doth belong to the invisible Church, or the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> But this belonging in seeming appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or to the judgment of man is uncertain, its but a judgment of probability which any man, hath of any mans belonging to the invisible Church, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself <hi>plain Scripture &amp;c. p.</hi> 73. sayth, <hi>Therefore even Cardinal</hi> Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>anus <hi>calleth the visible Church Ecclesia conjecturalis, as receiving its members on conjectural signs.</hi> Therefore there is no certainty of it that any particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is a visible Church-member. If it be sayd that the seeming is certain, though it be not certain that they belong to the invisible
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100457:116"/>
Church, I reply, so it may be sayd that if <hi>Turks</hi> infants seem to be of the visible Church, though to a fool or frantick man, the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is certain. But I suppose Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means that it is certain and not onely probable to considerate men to whom things are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of which they have not certain evidence, that infants are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church-members. But this (understanding it of particulars) is not certain upon any good evidence that they are members of the Church invisible, and therefore it is not certain they are visible church-members sith by Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> description, <hi>to be a visible Church-member is to seem to be of the invisible Church,</hi> and therefore as the seeming to be of the invisible Church is, so is the visibility, both uncertain and as most probable, and so all baptizing of infants is upon uncertain grounds and therefore a man cannot do it in faith he being uncertain he doth his duty: which thing is also made good elsewhere from Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> concessions <hi>Antipaedobapt. part.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 35. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thinks he hath sure grounds, and therefore he added! <hi>If you ask me, what is it that directly or immediatly constituteth them such members. I answer, their visible or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that is their external engagement by Covenant to Christ: This (performed by the parent for them) is it on their part; supposing Christs title to them, and the offer of himself in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant that the visible or audible that is their external en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement by Covenant to Christ doth make the persons so ingaging freely, seriously, soberly, and understandingly, visible Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But that the parents performing this for the childe doth make the infants such directly and immediately, is an assertion not proved by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> nor is it true, nor consistent with the descriptions of the visible Church and sayings about it, which Protestants of note give, nor doth it as here and elsewhere set down by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> yield any sure ground to know certainly any particular infant to be a visible Church-member. That I may make good these in their order. Two things are supposed and one thing named as <hi>directly and immediately constituting infants visible Church-members.</hi> The things supposed are, 1. <hi>Christs title to them,</hi> 2. <hi>The offer of himself in Covenant to them.</hi> But there is nothing but ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity in these expressions. For 1. it is uncertain whether he mean that these are supposed when the parent doth perform the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100457:117"/>
for the childe that Christ hath a title to them, and that he doth offer himself in Covenant to them: or whether he mean that the parents engagement doth constitute the childe a visible Church member, if Christ have a title to it and offer himself in Covenant to it. If in the former sense, then it had been enough to have mentioned the parents act without that supposition; if in the later, then what ever the parents act be yet no man is certain of the childes visible Church-membership by it alone without the other two. 2. What title of Christ to them he means whether by election and gift of his Father to him, or by his Spirit, which he that hath not is <hi>none of his, Rom.</hi> 8. 9. or what other title he means I am uncertain. 3. What Covenant he means whether the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Covenant of grace belonging to the elect, or the conditional Covenant to all upon condition of faith, or the national Covenant made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides I cannot tell how to determine. 4. How the Covenant is offered except by Preaching to them or by some secret work of the Spirit I cannot imagine. 5. It is somewhat uncertain whether the external engagement that may make the infant a visible Church-member must not be of a parent that is a real and sincere believer, or whether a dogmatical faith serves turn. Sure in his <hi>plain Scrip. &amp;c. chap.</hi> 29. <hi>part.</hi> 1. He makes a real faith necessary in the parent to that sanctification without which the childe is not holy, that is a visible Church-member. 6. Whether he make the parents engagement to constitute immediately infants born or unborn also visible Church-members is uncertain. Lets see what we can gather elsewhere I cannot for present find a place where he more fully expresseth himself than in his <hi>plain scrip. &amp;c. pag.</hi> 336. of the first edition, <hi>whereas</hi> saith he, <hi>some stick at it that I make the condition of the infants Church-membership and justification to be wholly without him in the faith of the parent; I answer them.</hi> 1. <hi>That it is evident in all the Scripture that God put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a very great difference between the children of the faithfull and other mens.</hi> Which I grant, but withall that this is true onely of the sincerely faithfull and not onely inexternal profession, and yet not so as to count any a visible Church-member in the Christian Church for the parents faith. 2. Saith he, <hi>that he maketh such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to them, and giveth them such privileges as I have exprest</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:100457:117"/>
               <hi>in this Book.</hi> But if he mean by <hi>the promises</hi> those of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, I say, they are made onely to elect and true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, if other promises of temporal blessings they are not made to the children of meer seeming believers but true believers, nor do they at all reach to visible Church-membership or Justification of children. These privileges are no where promised to the children of believing Christians though sincere meerly because of their parents faith. And therefore that which he adds. 3. <hi>That this is to them as they are the children of the people who believe,</hi> is false, And when he saith. 4. <hi>And that he never requireth any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition inherent in the infant, that I finde in Scripture,</hi> yet others conceive an inherent condition required in an infant <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. and elsewhere. But he adds, <hi>And doth not this plainly tell us, that the parents faith is the condition? if the parent be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, the childe is entered the Covenant, the father entering it for him, and his</hi> Deut. 29. <hi>If the parent be not a believer, the childe is left out: And what other condition can be imagined?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Scripture had required no inherent condition in the infant, yet it had not followed that the parents faith is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the infants Church-membership and justification. For there are other ways, to wit, their election, Christs death for them, which are a vouched as sufficient to their justification without the consideration either of any inherent condition in the infant, or the parents faith. Nor is it true, <hi>that if the parent be a believer the childe is entered the Covenant, the Father entering it for him and his, and that if the parent be not a believer, the childe is left out.</hi> For if it be meant of the Covenant of grace it is most false, <hi>that if the parent be a believer the childe is entered the Covenant. Esau</hi> was the childe of <hi>Isaac</hi> a believer, <hi>Ishmael</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet neither entered into the Covenant of grace, neither justified by the parents faith? if it were so then they were entered into the Covenant of grace and justified, and after out<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, which infers falling from grace. Not is there any such Covenant of visible Church-membership which if the parent be a believer the childe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

true it is said <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>They stood all before the Lord, the Commandors and the men, then the litle ones, wives, strangers, hewers of wood drawers of water, that they might enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> but that, 1. The parents peculiarly as parents did enter into Covenant for their children appears not: but rather that the entering of the Covenant was by the Rulers in behalf of the subject, as the league with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> was by the Princes in behalf of <hi>Israel,</hi> whereto they were bound <hi>Josh.</hi> 9. 15, 19. nor is there any consideration of a Father entering into Covenant for his childe more than of a Husbands entering into covenant for his wife, or a Masters entering into Covenant for his servant, and therefore if this fact were good to prove, <hi>if the parent be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever the childe is entered the Covenant, the Father entering for him and his:</hi> it is good to prove that if the Husband, or Master be a believer, the wife, and servant are entered into Covenant, the Husband and Master entering it for them and theirs, and so wives, and servants shall be visible Church-members, as well as infants of believers, by the faith of Husbands and Masters. 2. If the parents faith procure this privilege for the child then either because it is his childe, and then it procures it for the childe while it is his childe though the childe be at years and an infidel, for then it is his childe, or else upon condition the childe agree to it, but then the privilege belongs not to infants, and there is an inherent condition required, to wit, the childes consent besides the parents faith: if it be said that it procures it to the childe while a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> infant, but not when it comes to years how can this be true that the parents faith or covenanting should immediately and directly constitute them visible Church-members when infants because they are their children, and the covenant is made with them and their children (as they say) and yet they not visible Church-members while they are children? surely, the immediate cause continuing, the effect continues, and therefore if the parents faith with the covenant) make the childe in infancy a visible Church-member it must also make it a visible Church-member at years though an infidel. 3. Whereas it is supposed by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that the parents as believers entered the covenant <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. it rather appears by <hi>Moses</hi> his preface <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4. that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Moses</hi> did therefore draw them into this solemn Covenant, because they were to that day unbelievers,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100457:118"/>
4. It is false, that this entering into covenant did make them Church-members. For. 1. The end of it was to prevent them from backsliding <hi>v.</hi> 18. to Idolatry, and to prevent Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking them thereupon, <hi>v.</hi> 13. 2. They were Church-members before both by Gods special separating of the whole nation to be his people, and the solemn Covenant at mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> and so were members of that Church as part of that nation. 3. If this entering into covenant made them there Church-members visible then it made their posterity also then visible Church-members, for with them also was that covenant made, <hi>v.</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. and so persons should be made visible Church-members afore they are born. 5. If it were true, that that covenanting made them visible, Church-members of that Church, yet it advantageth no whit to prove infants now visible members of the Christian Church, which is not national as that was, nor gathered by the chief Magistrate as that was, nor injoyned such a national Covenant as that, but consisting of particular believers of all nations, gathered by the Preaching of the Gospel and voluntary personal covenanting for themselves onely testified by their being baptized into Christ. If any ask whether a national covenant or a covenant of parents for children be now allowable? I answer, I deny not but such a national or parental covenant may be allowed, and in some cases covenient, yet I say that it makes not all the subjects and children Church-members, nor bindes them without their consent any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the matter of the covenant it self bindes. As for that which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith, <hi>if the parent be not a believer the childe is left out,</hi> it is false, if we understand it in respect of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership of children at years they may be in the Church visible though their parents were unbelievers and left out of the Church though believers; if of justification, it is false both of infants and children of years. And it is utterly untrue that in the Christian Church children are made visible Church-members by parents faith, or left out because of their unbelief. For, 1. There is no word of Scripture that saith so. The three Texs <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. are fully discussed already in the first part of this <hi>review,</hi> and what Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath replied shall be examined (God willing) in that which follows. 2. No one passage of the New Testament doth shew that any infant was
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100457:119"/>
reckoned for a visible Church-member of the Christian Church in the New Testament, but many shew they were not. 3. If the infant children of the faithfull had been accounted in the Apostles times visible members of the Christian Church there had been some thing done by the Apostles and other holy men to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served their right, but no practise of baptism on them, nor any other act can be produced that the Apostles or other holy men did to preserve such a right, <hi>Ergo.</hi> 4. The Covenant of the Gospel is with particular persons made believers out of all nations, their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering by Preaching the Gospel to them, which evidently shew that God intended to take in persons into the Christian Church upon their own faith, and not in a national way as he did the Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi> 5.

            <p>There was lately a printed sheet brought to my hands intituled, The profession of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is owned by Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Baxter in his Christian concord,</hi> in the <hi>Preface</hi> of which are these words. <hi>And because Ministers cannot well know who are members of the Churches, and who not, and so must be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the extent of their charges and duties without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of their peoples consent.</hi> Hence I argue, 1.

Then the parents faith upon which they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized without their own consent expressed doth not make them visible Church-members, for if it did they might know them by their memory and registers that they were Church-members. 3.

there is no certain way to know a particular infant to be a visible Church-member. For in his determinations there is no resolution, nor according to his grounds do I think can be given a certain resolution whether the parent be such a one to whom the Covenant is, whether he have that faith which may intitle his childe to visible Church-membership, whether the immediate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents engagement be necessary or a remote parents engagement be sufficient, whether the engagement must be open in the face of the Congregation, or it be sufficient that it be done privately, when it must be, at Baptism, or at some other time, whether it need not be as o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

of God, I should not stick to grant it, nor need Mr. <hi>B.</hi> thus trouble himself to prove it, though I think his consequence is not good. For it might be their sin to keep back those infants from Christ, if Christ did by any sign discover his minde to have them brought, though it were not to declare their title, or any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants title to the Kingdom of Heaven, but onely to use them as Emblems. Nor is Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> reason forcible, <hi>that then it might have been their sin to have forbidden Sheep and Doves to be brought to Christ.</hi> For it may be granted, that this might have been their sin, if Christ had in like manner declared his minde by any sign concerning such Sheep, that they should be brought to him. Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> arguing runs upon this supposition, that the Apostles might know it was their duty at all times to permit infants to come to Christ from a general truth, that of all infants (at least of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) is the Kingdom of God, (which he neither proves, nor can prove) whereas the Apostles fault might be in not heeding some particular thing he had then by some words or other sign made known of those infants then brought, or not considering Christs Office, and constant practice of doing good to all, specially to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and diseased persons, such as those infants might be, and as some conceive were, and accordingly brought to be cured by Christ. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is not yet come to that he would have.</p>
            <p>9. Saith he, <hi>Those that Christ took in his arms, laid his hands on, and blessed, were visible members of his Church, and not meer resemblances of such: but some infants Christ took in his arms, laid his hands on, and blessed: therefore some infants were members of the visible Church, (and consequently Christ hath not repealed the Church-membership of infants) and they were not meer resemblances of such. For would Christ have blessed so a Sheep or Dove? or are they blessed of Christ, and yet not so much as visible members of his Church? Sure there are none visibly blest without the visible Church. And it was not these onely; for I have proved, it was the Disciples duty to admit others to the like blessing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I do not say, that the infants Christ took in his arms were meer resemblances of visible Church-members, and therefore Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in seeking to prove it still follows a false sent, proving what is not denied. But the other part of the conclusion is denied by
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100457:122"/>
me [<hi>to wit, that some infants were members of the visible Church</hi>] and that part of the <hi>major,</hi> [<hi>those that Christ took in his arms, laid his hands on, and blessed, were visible members of his Church</hi>] and for his proof, that [<hi>none are visibly blest without the visible Church</hi>] I deny it, nor doth he bring any thing to prove it but his own words, sure it is so. But I count it false. For <hi>Jacob</hi> visibly blessed <hi>Pharaoh, Gen.</hi> 47. 10. and yet <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not of the visible Church. When Christ did raise <hi>Jairus</hi> daughter, heal the daughter of the <hi>Syrophoenician,</hi> I conceive they had a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible blessing, and yet were not of the visible Church. And if it were the Disciples duty to admit others to the like blessing, yet there is neither in the Text nor elsewhere a word to prove, it was their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to admit them to the like blessing by any other than Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his own laying hands on them. Or if it were imagined, that Christ intended this should be a Rule to the Disciples for their conferring a like blessing on infants, yet that it must be a Rule to successors, and if to successors, to all Ministers to do it, or that they must do it by baptism, and not rather as the Bishops did it in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, by laying on of hands, hath not the least shadow of proof; but rather the contrary is more likely.

            <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> adds, <hi>And it is yet more considerable, that all the three former Evangelists make full mention of these passages of Christ; and therefore it is evident that they were not taken for small circumstantials, but Doctrines of moment for the Churches information. They are recorded also in Matth.</hi> 18. 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.

               <hi>infants, than any that ever the Anabaptists brought will be to them for refusing them.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> wanting proof fals here to his Rhetorick, which elsewhere he falsly chargeth on me as my fault, but is indeed the chief part of his Book, and prevails much with the most of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But it is the property of childish persons to be affrighted with such mormo's. I grant that the passages of Christ were by the Evangelists taken not for small circumstantials, but Doctrines of moment for the Churches information: yet not teaching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants visible Church-membership and baptism. What ever Christian I be, I have read over the Texts impartially, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately as I think this and other writings shew, and I do declare in the presence of God that these passages do confirm me in this truth, that it is not the will of Christ that infants should be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, because he neither baptized, nor appointed these to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and that the words of Christ here are so impertinent that they are more likely to be a plea against infant baptizers who on such weak conjectures go against the plain institution of Christ <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. 16. and the constant use of the Apostles and first ages. And I do further declare that on my most serious studies I do resolve notwithstanding the evasions they bring, that the plea they make hence for infant baptism, and that which is alleaged of their being Disciples, visible Church-members, in the Covenant, doth as well tie them to admit them to the Lords supper as to baptism, and that in refusing to admit them to baptism we have as good a plea and better at Judgment then they have in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to admit them to the Lords Supper. Nor is it to me any other than a sad sign either of injudiciousness or slothfulnes in searching after the truth, or prejudice, or adhering to mens sayings out of reverence of their persons, or faction or some such like evil quality both in Ministers and people even those of tender consciences that they still retain so gross an abuse as infant baptism is upon such weak reasons as they do, and neglect yea and oppose the baptism of believers so manifestly Commanded by Christ and practised by his Apostles. But I must follow Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what saith</hi> Mr. <hi>T. against this? why.</hi> 1. <hi>He saith, it was some extraordinary blessing to them that Christ intended Apol. p.</hi> 149. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>it was a discovery of their title to</hi>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:100457:123"/>
               <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven. It was such an extraordinary blessing that included the ordinary. If extraordinary blessing the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> much more ordinary.</hi> 2 <hi>It was such as the Disciples should have known that these should be admitted to, or else Christ would not have been displeased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true I give this reason why I conceive that [of such] included those infants as conceiving from the circumstances of the thing that Christ intended some extraordinary blessing to them, and declaration concerning them. And in my <hi>Examen pag.</hi> 147. I say, Christs action in this business is proper to him as the great Prophet of the Church and extraordinary, and therfore yeilds no ground for an ordinary rule of baptizing infants by the ordinary Ministery, no more than Christs whipping buyers out of the Temple, though related by the four Evangelists, for an ordinary practise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable thereto. Now this is not denied by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> But he says, <hi>it was such an extraordinary blessing as included the ordinary: if extraordinary blessing, then much more ordinary.</hi> But 1. these things are said without proof. 2. Their falshood is shewed, and the rest is answered before.</p>
            <p>He adds, <q>But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> saith, <hi>Apol. pag.</hi> 151. That [the reason of Christs anger was their hindring him in his design, not the knowledg they had of their present visible Title; this is but a dream.] To which I answer, 1. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is as bold to speak of Christs thoughts without Book, and to search the Searcher of hearts, as if he were resolved to make Christs meaning be what he would have it. 2. What Design was it that Christ had in hand? Was it any other than the discovery of his mercy to the <hi>species</hi> of infants, and to those among others? and a presenting them as a Patern to his followers, and to teach his Church humility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, and to leave them an assurance against Anabaptists, that it is his pleasure, that infants should not be kept from him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. There was no such boldness in my speech as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> rashly, and like a calumniator chargeth me with, but such as must be granted true, if we conceive Christ to have acted as a rational being that propounds an end or design in his actings. 2. The last of the designs Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mentions, <hi>assuring that it is his pleasure that infants should not be kept from him;</hi> meaning by not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100457:123"/>
them, is his figment. His design I knew without searching Christs heart immediately by reading his facts, which shew his ends to be 1. the blessing those infants. 2. Teaching Doctrine concerning such. 3. Shewing himself thereby the great Prophet of his Church, and bestower of blessings.</p>
            <p>3. Saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 
               <q>How did the Disciples hinder Christs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign? Not by hindring him immediately, but by rebuking those that brought the infants. 4. If this were no fault in them, why should Christ be displeased, and much displeased at it? And how could it be their fault to hinder people from bringing infants to Christ, if they might not know that they ought to be admitted? And could they know of Christs private intents and designs? Were there but this one consideration hence to be urged, I du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st challenge Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to answer (as far as modesty would permit a challenge) that is, if Christ had intended onely that humility or docibleness should be commended from these infants as an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem to his Disciples, then it could be none of their fault to forbid bringing of them to Christ; for how could they know what use Christ would make of them? or by what Emblem he would teach them? or when he would do it? All the creatures in the world may be Emblems of some good; and must they therefore permit the bringing of all to Christ? Christ had not told them his design before hand to teach them by these Emblems; and when they knew his minde they desisted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They might know Prophets did bless persons even little ones, they knew that <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 2. Christ had before familiarly used a little childe, and so was not averse from them, they knew or might know that Christ was the great Prophet that was to come into the world, that he made it his work to do good, that he did permit all sorts of persons that came for healing or other blessings to come to him, and therefore it was their fault to hinder Christ in this design, and to hinder any that came to him for his blessing. I neither say that his design was onely to teach humility by these as an Emblem, nor that they knew or might know what use Christ would make of these infants. Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> challenge is upon a mistake, as if I affirmed, that Christ would have those infants brought one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to teach humility by them, when the very words he cites are to the contrary. I am weary with answering such meer cavils of a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100457:124"/>
man, who if he were not set on wrangling, might by heeding my words answer himself.</p>
            <p>5. Saith he, <q>If it had been onely for the present design, then Christ would have spoke but of those individual infants, and have said, Suffer those now to come: But it appears from the Text, 1. that it was not those individuals more than others that the Disciples were offended at, or disliked should be brought; but the <hi>species,</hi> or those infants because infants. 2. And that Christ doth not onely speak against their hindring those individuals, but the <hi>species,</hi> and lays them down a rule and command for the future as well as for the present that they should suffer little children to come to him, and not forbid them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is in all the Evangelists <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which notes the children then brought, and no other, though I deny not but this fact and the reason thereof were a rule for the future as well as for the present, yet not either for the Apostles or any Successors to lay hands on them, or baptize them; but for them, if any more infants were thus brought to Christs person, that his own hands might be layd on them, that they should permit it.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> still mistakes me, as if I had said [private design] that is a design proper to those infants onely; whereas my words were [present design] which I shew before what it was, and thereby it may be easily conceived I meant such a design as tended to shew his Office, readiness to do good, and interest that infants and such as were like them might have to the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>7. Saith he, <q>And where Mr. <hi>T.</hi> saith, It was not from any knowledg they had of their present visible title; I answer, Who said it was? Did Mr. <hi>Blake?</hi> No; but it was a thing the Disciples ought to have known, that infants are welcom to Christ, and that of such is the Kingdom, and therefore because of such is his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they should not be kept from him? God will not be much displeased with men for being ignorant of that which they ought not to know.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> in his <hi>Answer to my letter</hi> had said <hi>pag.</hi> 90.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100457:124"/>
               <hi>They</hi> (the infants brought to Christ) <hi>had a present visible title such as the Apostles ought to have known,</hi> and this he gives as the reason why Christ was so much displeased with the Disciples for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them to be brought. To which my words are rightly opposed. Nor is any thing put on Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> But his own words. If Mr. <hi>B. will not say that Christs anger was from any knowledg the Apostles had of the infants present visible title,</hi> then he must acknowledg the Apostles had no knowledg of the visible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membership of infants then, or visible title to one Church privilege which shews that in Christs Church no infants were then counted visible Church members, else these could not but know it. Nor is there any thing in the Text that shews that Christ was angry with them for not knowing this, nor did this teaching inform them in this, nor did Christ <hi>admit them as</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saith, <hi>to a Church privilege,</hi> nor if it were true that the blessing were a Church privilege common to all Church-members, yet infants were as capable of baptism as of it, sith the institution of baptism is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. To me it is a strong presumption that the Apostles understood not Christs words and deeds as importing Church privilege con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on those infants which did infer a title to baptism, as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> imagins, in that the Apostles did not baptize them, which is confessed by some paedobaptists, and appears both in that no such thing is enjoyned them by Christ, or related as done by them, and what was done to them is related as done by Christ himself who did not baptize <hi>John</hi> 4. 2. and it is said <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 15. <hi>when he had put his hands on them he departed thence,</hi> and with him his Disciples, as appears by the speeches of them upon occasion of the yong mans conference with Christ, which presently followed. Now if the Apostles knew not such baptizability of infants there is no likelihood that Christs words or blessing proved such baptizability. If they did know it, and yet did them not right, no doubt Christ would have been more angry for their not baptizing them, then for rebuking those that brought them. And whereas Mr. <hi>B. blesseth Christ for his discovery concerning infants</hi> as he construes it, I bless God that hath shewed me the frivolousnes of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> arguings, and I say of such as are led away with such trifling reasons, as the Apostles sayd 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 14. 38. <hi>If any man be ignorant let him be ignorant.</hi> As for his observation in the close
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100457:125"/>
of the chapter its like the rest. For Christs <hi>calling his Disciples little children</hi> and the <hi>Apostles so calling Christians</hi> shews love and tendernes, but not that infants are visible Church-members, no more then Christs calling the same his Lambs and sheep, <hi>John</hi> 21. 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shews that sheep and Lambs are visible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members. Thus much for answer of that chapter of M. <hi>B.</hi>

               <p>The 41. Chapter of Mr. <hi>Blakes Vindic. Foed.</hi> about Christs speech of little children, Matth. 19. 14. is answered, and my sayings in my <hi>Postscript</hi> vindicated.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MR. <hi>Blake</hi> since the publishing of my <hi>Postscript</hi> to my <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> in reply to his <hi>Answer to my letter</hi> in his Book intituled <hi>Vindic. foed. c.</hi> 41, 43. <hi>sect.</hi> 1. hath published somewhat that is to be further examined. He saith, <hi>They looked upon Christ (as it seems) as a great Prophet highly in favour with God, and such were wont to bless in the name of God, and their blessing was highly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and hands were used to be imposed on persons in blessing, Gen.</hi> 48. 14. which I allow. He sets down six positions, the first of which having confirmed, he speaks thus of me. Mr. <hi>T. brought his reasons against this, to have nipt all in the bud, but those he hath quit, and is brought to confess that he contradicted himself in them, and hath not a word to excuse his false quotation out of Mark, concerning scandalizing, onely excusing himself that he delivered himself doubtfully in them. Apol.</hi> 149.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true I brought in my <hi>Examen p.</hi> 146. <hi>Piscators</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in his <hi>Observ.</hi> 11. on <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. to prove the little children <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 13. 14. <hi>not to have been infants, but boyes who were capable of instruction,</hi> which it is true I say in my <hi>Apol p.</hi> 149.

               </gap>d not stick to, nor need I sith at first I said <hi>Examen pag.</hi> 145. onely, It is doubtfull whether these were infants or no. Nor is it truely said by Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> that <hi>I excused my self,</hi> as if I had been in a fault. For it is true which I alleged, not onely <hi>Piscator</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they were not infants, but <hi>Estius</hi> also <hi>Annot. ad Marc.</hi> 10. 13. saying <hi>it is not certain that they were infants which could</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Which very doubtfulness doth weaken the argument thence for infant baptism, yet I had no reason to stick to that, there being other answers sufficient besides. Not is it true which he saith, <hi>that I am brought to confess I contradicted my self in the reasons brought,</hi> and that they were my reasons, for I expresly said they were <hi>Piscators</hi> reasons, and therefore though <hi>Piscator</hi> should contradict my exposition of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 5. in those reasons I need not own it, much less do I confess that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict my self in them, as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> falsely chargeth me as one that cares not what he prints so he may fully me with a black coal. Nor was any false quotation out of <hi>Mark</hi> used by me, I onely brought <hi>Piscators</hi> words <hi>&amp; de quali non scandalizando ibidem monet,</hi> which if he misapplied to infants, and thereby crossed my interpretation of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 5, 6. he opposed himself, though I think neither <hi>Piscator</hi> nor my self, were guilty of any self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, but Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> of mistake and calumny. Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> saith <hi>he knows not that any in print hath maintained it that little children brought to Christ were diseased so as to have need of cure.</hi> But there is now a Book in <hi>folio</hi> written by Mr. <hi>Samuel. Fisher</hi> intituled <hi>Baby baptism meer babism,</hi> in which <hi>p.</hi> 134: are these words, <hi>that he should touch them, and put his hands on them and pray, no question 'twas in order to healing, for 'twas at a time when he healed many others, if you compare this passage as 'tis in Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>with the first and second verses of the chapter: yea v.</hi> 15. <hi>'tis plainly expressed what he did,</hi> i. e. <hi>he laid his hands upon them and departed thence; besides</hi> Luke <hi>says, they brought little children to him also that he should touch them: which</hi> [<hi>also</hi>] <hi>shews that others were brought too, as sick folks commonly were, because virtue went out of him, so that as many as touched him were made perfectly whole.</hi> Nor do I think Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> reasons sufficient to countervail the other: For though <hi>the Disciples well knew that it was usual with Christ to cure those that laboured under infirmities of all ages,</hi> yet they sometimes shewed their unwillingness to have persons trouble Christ about diseased persons as <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 39. and whereas Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> saith, <hi>the Evangelist would never have concealed this reason and mentioned another,</hi> if he mean it of the reason why the Disciples rebuked the bringers of the little children, the truth is the Evangelists men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100457:126"/>
no reason at all of the Disciples rebuke, if he mean it of the reason why Christ would have them brought, such reason stands well with this, that the children were diseased, brought to Christ to be cured, and cured by Christ.</p>
            <p>I had said, there is no certainty onely conjecture that they were the children of believers, Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> sets down his third position thus, <hi>These were infants of such parents that were in Covenant with God,</hi> which he proves <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 24, 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8. <hi>This farther appears by that which they requested for these infants: This</hi> Mr. <hi>T. seems to yeild; they came (saith he) to Christ upon the conceit that he was a Prophet,</hi> and <hi>so they might bring children to him to be blessed; And farther says, if this reason prove any thing, it is that the childrens parents were</hi> Jews, <hi>Apol. pag.</hi> 150. <hi>which is all that we contend for; the</hi> Jews <hi>as yet were in Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The reasons of Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> some of them prove rather the bringers to be <hi>Jews</hi> than the parents. 2. The proving the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to be <hi>Jews</hi> (if any do prove it) is not a proof that they were believers, for there were a great part, if not the greatest part by much of the <hi>Jews</hi> unbelievers, <hi>John</hi> 12. 37, 38. And what he sayes, <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>as yet were in Covenant,</hi> if he mean it of all the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of the covenant of grace in Christ it is palpably false, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to the Apostles determination <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8. where it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly resolved that all the natural children of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> were not at any time children of the promise: If he mean it of any other covenant, or promise of God, or of some of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it would nothing avail him for his purpose, though his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position were granted him.</p>
            <p>His fourth Proposition is thus exprest, These infants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were in covenant, and stood in relation to Christ, bearing his name, and being of his people; and were not as Heathens in their present state without Christ, aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> and strangers from the covenant of promise. This is evident by their free admission by Christ, and the reason by him given. When this was prest upon Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in solemn disputation, he took time to consider, and after more than two years in his <hi>Examen,</hi> we have an answer which shame will not suffer him to own. But in his Apology doth disclaim, yet not convinced by Mr. <hi>M.</hi> my self,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100457:126"/>
or any other: it is enough with me, if the truth is confest; if the truth may have the honor, I am satisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Were I nor sufficiently acquainted with Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> charges without cause, I should be jealous of my self that there is some thing done by me which might occasion this imputation. What was prest on me in the disputation in <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1643. and what time or for what reason I took time to answer after 10. years elapsed, I cannot trust in my memory to inform me. What answer I gave in my Examen which in my Apology I disclaim, and shame will not now suffer me to own, concerning this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> and its proof, it is such a riddle to me that I cannot yet tell how to understand it, except I have Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> heifer to plough with. Sure I am, this kinde of crimination which Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> useth, is very unsuitable to a clear and solid disputant thus by dark flirts, and quips to abuse me; But I think it best to slight his charge, presuming intelligent men will be little moved with it. As for his position, the terms being ambiguous, and especially the term [in covenant] being used (as I often complain) in such variety of senses or rather sometimes non-sense by Paedobaptists, that it seems to be used by them to elude rather than to inform, it may be either granted or denied as the terms are explained, and if this did occasion me to take time to answer it I did therein prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and if after two or ten years my answers be various they are so upon due considerations; For present I grant, those infants (if they were infants) mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. were in the covenant of saving grace, stood in relation to Christ as chosen in him, and in that respect bare his name as his bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>heren, were of his invisible people, not as heathens in their present state without Christ being given to him, nor aliens from the Common-wealth of the <hi>Israel</hi> of God the invisible Church of the elect, nor strangers from the covenant of promise, that is, the covenant of promise commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surate with election of grace, and this I grant to be evident of those particular persons if not by their free admission to Christ, yet by the reason by him given, it being supposed that [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of such] is meant of them as well as of those that were like them in humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But if the position be understood of being in covenant either by their own act of cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anting, or that which is called by Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists in their non-sense or proper gibberish the outward cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100457:127"/>
or that it be meant that they stood in relation to Christ as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible members of the Christian church in their present state while they were infants, I deny it to be true, or that it is evident by their free admission by Christ, and the reason by him given.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> fifth position is, <hi>They were admitted upon a common right, equally belonging to all infants of covenanting parents, and not by virtue of any extraordinary privilege, peculiar to them, and not common to other. This is plain, saith he,</hi> 1. <hi>By the general admission which he gives to infants on this occasion; Suffer little children come to me, and</hi> (<hi>as Mr.</hi> T. <hi>more than once observes</hi>) Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarium non facit regulam communem, <hi>here is a general Rule, all have admission, and therefore there is nothing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</hi> 2. <hi>It was such a right that the Disciples of Christ ought to have understood, as plainly appears by Christs sore displeasure conceived against them, for forbidding their admission to him, and that must be a known right, and not secret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. There is not a word in the Text to prove that they were admitted upon any right to their admission as due to them, and which might be claimed for them, but they were admitted out of grace. 2. There is nothing in the Text to prove they were the children of covenanting parents, or that they were admitted out of any respect at all to their parents state, whatever it were. As for Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> reasons. To the 1. I say, The words are a Command onely for those little children, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Suffer the little children,</hi> to wit them brought to come to me; nor doth it appear by any after instance of Christ or his Apostles that this was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as a general rule, that all should have admission. 2. Were it granted that this rule of Christ did reach to others besides those then brought, yet there is nothing in the Text to prove this rule of admission to be onely of infants of covenanting parents or to these or any other by reason of right from their covenanting parents. Yea rather if any right be intimated it is the personal right of the infants, <hi>for of such is the Kingdom of God.</hi> 2. It is true, the Disciples of Christ ought to have understood they were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, But that this was the reason why they ought to know they were to be admitted because of their known right is imagined but not proved. And how or for what reasons they might know they were to be admitted is shewed above in answer to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:100457:127"/>Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> adds, Mr. <hi>T. indeed says, They were not admitted out of any known right common to others, but a perculiar privilege as being elected, for which he quotes</hi> Piscator; <hi>when as he hath heard (and replies nothing) that</hi> Piscator <hi>syllogistically concludes the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I said not, <hi>they were admitted out of a peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege as being elected, nor for this did I quote Piscator,</hi> and therefore in my animadversions in my <hi>postscript</hi> I made no reply to Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> in this thing. My words in my <hi>Examen pag.</hi> 146, 147. were these. 4. Let it be granted they were the infants of believers and that it is said, of these is the Kingdom of God, it may be as <hi>Piscator</hi> observes referred not to their present estate, as if for the present they were in the Kingdom of God that is believers and justified; but that they were elect persons, and so in time of them should be the Kingdom of God: in which I do not at all assign the reason why the little children were to be admitted to come to Christ, nor do I quote <hi>Piscator</hi> for it, and therefore Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ecites my words, but shew how it might be true that of those infants was the Kingdom of God, yet in their present estate they neither believers nor justified. Against which <hi>Piscator</hi> is so far from concluding syllogistically (as Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> says) that disputing against the <hi>Lutherans</hi> affirming infants to be believers because of Christs words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. in his Observe 11. out of that <hi>v.</hi> he sayth thus, <hi>Deinde etiamsi ponatur, sermonem hic de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantibus esse: tamen non potest hinc certò concludi illos praeditos esse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I do not <hi>confess,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> sayth
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100457:128"/>
of me, <hi>that elect infants might be baptized, were they known:</hi> but that elect infants being actual believers, if they were known might be baptized, and therefore I need not fear Christs displeasure for not admitting elect infants to baptism, no not though they were known to be elect, except they were known to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, much less for not admitting to baptism those that are neither known to be elect nor believers: But Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> hath just cause to fear the displeasure of Christ for admitting to baptism those that are neither known to be elect, nor believers, but infants of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents who are manifestly <hi>children of the Devil, covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp;c.</hi> according to his Doctrine in opposition to Mr. <hi>Firmin Vindic.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> sixth Position is, <q>They are here admitted by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ to a Church-privilege. This appears <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 22, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the end of the Chapter. The <hi>Israel</hi> of God are under the blessing, little ones are ordered to be received to this blessing, little ones therefore are of his <hi>Israel, Deut.</hi> 32. 9. These are the blessed of the Lord upon this account, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 23. children are within this number, they are the inheritage of the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 127. 3. and consequently admitted by our Saviour Christ to this privilege of a blessing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> Position is ambiguous, 1. It is uncertain whether he mean it of Christs laying on hands, or his prayer also, and blessing with it, which is the Church-privilege. 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he make it a privilege of the visible or invisible Church. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whether he will have these to be a constant Church-privilege. 4. To whom he will have it a Church-privilege. 5. By whom it is to be done since Christs ascension, whether by Apostles onely, or Bishops, or Presbyters. All the proof he brings for blessing, as a Church-privilege, is the prayer of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sons, for the whole congregation of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> which how it proves Christs laying on of hands, and praying or blessing of a few little children, (when Christ was neither <hi>Aaron</hi> nor any of his s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

It should be his sixth Position, <hi>They are here admitted by our Saviour Christ to a Church-privilege:</hi> but his conclusion is, <hi>Little ones therefore are of his Israel;</hi> and this is proved by a syllogism that is either faulty in that there are four terms, or else it is in the second figure of all Affirmatives. If it be said that Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> infers from that and the rest his Position, neither is that true: for his conclusion is this, <hi>and consequently admitted by our Saviour Christ to this privilege of a blessing;</hi> which though not denied by me, yet is neither his sixth Position, nor any thing in the Texts he brings proves it, which are all impertinently alleged by him, and the last especially, which he seems to understand, as if they were said to be the heritage of the Lord, as if they were the Lords pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar possession, whereas the meaning is <hi>Psalm</hi> 127. 3. that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are such a blessing to parents, that they are an heritage given by the Lord, as <hi>Ainsworth</hi> rightly expounds it; and so an house-privilege rather than a Church-privilege is there meant, as the words following shew.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> had said, <hi>pag.</hi> 91. <hi>of his answer to my Letter, there is no direct precedent for baptism in particular, but for Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privileges of which infants are capable,</hi> on which I inferred, if [<hi>but</hi>] be adversative, (which must be granted if Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> speaks sense) then Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> grants that infants are capable of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privileges, not of baptism. To this Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> replies, 1. <hi>that I make a great triumph of his speech.</hi> 2. <hi>That I leave out that which would fully explain his meaning.</hi> 3. <hi>That his meaning is, this act of Christ is no direct precept for baptism, but of Church-priledges in general.</hi> 4. <hi>If I can make it good that baptism is no Church-privilege I have wrested this Argument out of his hand, and that this Text as to the Argument fals, otherwise it is of force and an undeniable consequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I said truly, that grant which Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> words (if he understand himself) implies, overthrows all his dispute, and is a triumph (if it be to be so called) on a victory. 2. I left out nothing which being put in would have hindered the inference I make: but Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> as if he were ashamed of his own words, leaves out in his explication the words [<hi>of which infants are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>] from whence I made my inference. 3. His own explication makes the matter worse. For, 1. if this act of Christ be a direct
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100457:129"/>
precept of Church-privileges in general, then it is of baptism in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, being a Church-privilege, that which is said of the <hi>Genus</hi> being true (as Logicians say) of the <hi>species, Quicquid praedicatur de genere praedicatur de specie.</hi> Whence it follows Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> speaks in consistencies. 2. It follows also, that if it be a direct precept for to admit infants to Church-privileges in general, then it is to admit them to the Lords Supper, to Ordination, for these are Church-privileges. If he mean no more than this, that they are to be admitted to prayer for them, and that is the Church-privilege he means, I should grant it, and accordingly when desired I do both publish the names, days of infants birth, and pray for them. 4. What he would gather from hence, <hi>by necessary consequence I wrest out of his hands,</hi> I think easily, without gratifying <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Antibaptists,</hi> (who if they <hi>triumph over Antipaedobaptists, and beat them down with their own weapons in the parts w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>re Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>lives,</hi> the more shame for them, who betray by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulness so good a cause) with this, <hi>that baptism is no Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privilege.</hi> His Arguments are thus formed, <hi>cap.</hi> 43. <hi>sect.</hi> 1. <hi>They which are admitted to Church-privileges have right to baptism, the leading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> privilege; but infants are admitted to Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, Mark</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 16. <hi>Infants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have right to baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer, if he mean by [<hi>Church-privileges</hi>] any other than prayer, and the laying of hands on them by Christ; I deny the <hi>minor;</hi> if he meant it of them I deny the <hi>major.</hi> And whereas he makes <hi>baptism the leading Church-privilege,</hi> I grant it is so in order to the Lords Supper, yet to be among the catechized, commended to God in prayer, may be antecedent Church-privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to baptism.</p>
            <p>His other Argument is this, <hi>The children of the Kingdom, that with others make up the Kingdom of God, have right to baptism; but infants are the children of the Kingdom that with others make up the Kingdom of God, Mark</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 16. <hi>Infants therefore have right to baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer. The phrase [<hi>Children of the Kingdom</hi>] I finde diversly used, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8 12. it is appropriated to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and it is spoken of them which <hi>shall be cast out into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> But <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 38. it is meant of the elect, who shall be
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100457:129"/>
saved. In the former sense, the <hi>major</hi> is manifestly false, and the <hi>minor</hi> can be onely true of <hi>Jews</hi> infants: in the later sense the <hi>major</hi> Proposition is true of children of the Kingdom who are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly such by their profession of faith in Christ; and the <hi>minor</hi> is false; if it be meant of such as are invisibly children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the <hi>major</hi> is denied, and the <hi>minor</hi> is granted.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> adds somewhat more about the meaning of the words of Christ, [<hi>of such is the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>] And first he saith, <hi>The particle</hi> [<hi>such</hi>] <hi>cannot here have reference to their qualification, that those that were qualified as these (in humility and meekness) had their interest; so are Sheep and Doves as well as infants, not proud nor revengefull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This reason is not of force to prove that [<hi>such</hi>] cannot here have reference to the qualification of meekness and humility. For being so expounded [such] notes others than the infants, to wit, men that are humble and meek positively, as infants are negatively, and this cannot be sayd of Doves or sheep, yet infants may be included as <hi>Beza</hi> doth <hi>Annot: in Matth.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>talium <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, id est, horum &amp; similium, ut supra.</hi> 18. which is plainly proved by our Lord Christs own words <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 15. where [<hi>of such v.</hi> 14.] is [<hi>whosoever receiveth the Kingdom of God as a little childe v.</hi> 15.] and so it is meant <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 5. as I have proved above. Nor is Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> reasoning of force, <hi>That which the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples took to be an impediment of force to hinder infants, and a just ground of those that brought them, is that which Christ under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands in this reproof of the Disciples and admission of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But <hi>it was their want of growth, their littleness, which the Disciples took to be a just impedinent, and which occasioned their reproof, Ergo.</hi> For the conclusion may be granted, yet this proves not that by [<hi>of such</hi>] is meant in respect of quantity onely, not of quality, but onely that in the words before [<hi>suffer little children to come to me</hi>] quantity is meant not quality, for in those words onely is <hi>the reproof of the Disciples, and Christs admission of infants.</hi> The other are a reason of his command, which is good if by [<hi>such</hi>] be meant likeness in quality as well as agreement in quantity. And for Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> paraphrase, it is but his own conceit, <hi>that the little children had no need of cure, or that the Disciples</hi> rebuke was after his model. But enough of this before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:100457:130"/>Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> excepts against me for saying, the Kingdom of Heaven is meant of the Kingdom of glory, and that on this hinge the answer to the whole argument turns. He saith, <hi>I had six exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the orthodox interpretation of this scripture in my</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen, <hi>being hunted out of all the rest I think to finde s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lter there.</hi> But this is his figment, for though I of mine own accord expressed some onely as doubtfull, and let pass others for more ample conviction of the invalidity of the vain arguing, called falsely <hi>Orthodox interpretation of this Text</hi> by paed baptists, yet I did not so much as relinquish one of the exceptions, much less have been hunted from them, as Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> after his pedant que fashion talks. But in opposition to me he first saith, <hi>That all hangs not on this, appears, in that our Saviour had said enough in his order for admission of these infants on which we can build our conclusion.</hi> And then brings his argument, which being answered before there is no need of any more reply to this. Yet I add, that of the argument drawn by Mr. <hi>Bl. pag.</hi> 91. of his <hi>answer to my letter none that are int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ressed in the Church of Christ which is his Kingdom may be denied an admission to it by baptism, but infants have their interests in the Church of Christ which is his Kingdom, and therefore may not be denied admission by baptism;</hi> the hinge did turn on this point, that by the Kingdom of Heaven is meant the visible Church, into which he would have infants admitted by baptism; and my speech is true of that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> adds, <q>Secondly, for his Reasons there is not force in them, 1. Saith he, The kingdom of God must be understood <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14. as it is <hi>v.</hi> 15. and <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 16. as <hi>v.</hi> 17. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. as it is in both those; This I prove, because our Saviour from their estate infers a likeness to them in others for the same estate, <hi>Apol. pag.</hi> 150.</q> This Argument howsoever it carries more colour than usually is fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Reason, yet it is not conclusive. It may be taken more largely in Christs argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and in a more restrained sense in his words of instruction and application, as in a place much parallel I shall shew, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 1, 2. There we have the Apostles reproof, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and his Reason, <hi>v.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in the Evangelists we have Christs assertion confirming his reproof, <hi>v.</hi> 14 and his application, <hi>v.</hi> 15. Now [Saint] in the Apostles reproof is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100457:130"/>
taken more largely than it is taken in his Reason. A visible Saint is meant in the first place, a real and glorified Saint in the second; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Saints may judg in small matters, for real Saints in glory shall judg the world, shall judg Angels; and so it may be here, infants have their present title to the visible Kingdom; and men qualified as infants, shall onely enter the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I see Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> so pertinacious in what he hath said in this argument, that he is <hi>cedere nescius,</hi> he knows not how to yeild to any thing against his dictates, though it be never so plain. He denies not <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 17. must be understood of the Kingdom of glory for the reason given by me in my <hi>Postscript</hi> The proposition being false, being understood of the visible Church; many proud persons entering therein, as <hi>Simon Magus, Diotrephes, &amp;c.</hi> But denies it to be conclusive, and therefore must deny the <hi>major.</hi> But he answers nothing to the proof of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Saviour from their estate infers a likeness to them in others for the same estate. Whence the argument ariseth. The same estate is meant <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14. which is mean <hi>v.</hi> 15. This is proved from the inference of Christ which is, as <hi>of little children is the kingdom of God, so whosoever doth not receive the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God as a little childe shall not enter into</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>it</hi>] or the same estate, the relative particle plainly notes it to be the same. But the estate <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 15. is meant of the Kingdom of glory, which is proved, because otherwise the proposition were false: nor is it denied by Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> therefore the argument is most plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive. Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> answer is either upon a wilfull or heedeless mistake of my argument as if it were onely from the identity of the words in both verses, whereas it was taken from the sameness of estate gathered by the force of our Saviours whether application of <hi>v.</hi> 15. as Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> terms it, or inference from what he had said <hi>v.</hi> 14. and the relative [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>it.</hi>] I deny not that it is frequent according to the figure in Rhetorick termed <hi>antanaclasis</hi> to use terms some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the same verse elegantly in a different sense: but it cannot be so here for the reasons given. And yet Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> instance 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2. is not right: For 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. the term [<hi>Saint</hi>] doth not note <hi>a glorified Saint.</hi> For the sense is this, <hi>know ye not these</hi> now despised <hi>Saints shall hereafter judg the world,</hi> and so though it be true that then they shall be glorified, yet the term [<hi>Saints</hi>] is
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100457:131"/>
attributed to them according to their present estate of debasement, in which the very <hi>Emphasis</hi> is put. Besides if it had been so that in the one <hi>v.</hi> it noted a visible Saint here, and in the other a glorified Saint hereafter, yet the same persons were meant in both verses: whereas if <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14. were meant the visible Church, who are a number of persons, and <hi>v.</hi> 15. were meant an estate of glory, there would be a greater difference than in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> doth not rightly say, the one place is much parallel to the other.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> goes on. <hi>His second reason, that Christ directs his speech to the Disciples already in the visible Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore speaks not of the Church visible, I know not how to make up into a reason; if I understood it, I would either yeild or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The reason is thus formed. The same is meant <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14. which is meant <hi>v.</hi> 15. as is before proved. But by [<hi>the Kingdom of God] v.</hi> 15. is not meant the visible Church, <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither <hi>v.</hi> 14. The <hi>minor</hi> is thus proved. By [<hi>the Kingdom of God</hi>] is meant that estate into which the Apostles had not but were thereafter to enter into. For the speech is meant of them as well as others, and directed to them, <hi>Verily I say to you,</hi> and so where the same thing is sayd <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3. it is sayd to and of them, <hi>Except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of the Heavens.</hi> But the estate the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were to enter into was not the visible Church, for that they had entered into already, but the Kingdom of glory. Therefore by [<hi>the Kingdom of God Mark</hi> 10. 14.] <hi>is meant the Kingdom of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> adds, <hi>The third reason, that the speech Mark</hi> 10. 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 17. <hi>is like Matth.</hi> 18. 3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>but there it is meant of the Kingdom of glory;</hi> Ergo, <hi>so here, is answered already. If Mark</hi> 10. 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 17. <hi>be like Matth.</hi> 18. 3, 4. <hi>yet Mark</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 16. <hi>which we have in question is unlike Matth.</hi> 18. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 15. be like <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3, 4. then also <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14. is in like manner understood <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven, as Matth.</hi> 18. 3, 4. For it is understood of the same <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14, 15. as is proved before. 2. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> conceived
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:100457:131"/>
them like by putting them together in the chapter before answered, and the New <hi>Annot.</hi> and <hi>Diodati,</hi> whose Testimonies are alleged in my <hi>Postscript. pag.</hi> 151.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> adds, <hi>Thirdly, were it granted him, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of glory must be understood both in Christs reason and application, yet he is nothing holpen. Infants have right to the Church visible militant, bcause they are in a capacity of entrance into the Church triumphant, Acts</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 47. <hi>The Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved; not necessarily saved, but now (having entered Covenant with God) they were in a capacity, and therefore added as visible Church-members. Infants stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this capacity ought to have admission likewise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It helps me much to answer the arguments drawn from <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. for infants visible Church-membership, if by <hi>the [Kingdom of Heaven</hi>] be not meant the visible Church, For then it is not there affirmed, that infants are visible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members. Nor doth Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> reserve regain the loss, to prove it by consequence, For his speech is not true, <hi>Infants have right</hi> (meaning of admission) <hi>to the visible Church, because they are in a capacity of entrance into the Church triumphant.</hi> Nor is it proved <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 47. where Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> perverts the meaning of the term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>which is in English</hi> [<hi>the saved</hi>] that is either [<hi>the saved from that crooked generation v.</hi> 40. by their effectual <hi>calling as</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5.] or by an enallage of tense [<hi>such as should be saved</hi>] and that certainly or necessarily] as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. not as Mr. <hi>Bl. they were in a capacity to be saved,</hi> (for so were those that were not called) <hi>and therefore added as visible Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi> Nor is Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> proposition gathered thence: for neither is there any thing in the words to prove that then all were added to the Church which should be saved, much less which were in a capacity to be saved, or on the contrary that all that were added to the Church should be saved: much less that their right to be added to the Church was from this, that they should be saved; It is said, <hi>the Lord added to the Church such as should be saved,</hi> it is not said the Apostles added them to the Church because they were to be saved, yea <hi>v.</hi> 41. it is said, that even of those that were to be saved, <hi>they gladly received the word;</hi> and then were <hi>baptized and added.</hi> So that if the Text be rightly looked into there is
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100457:132"/>
nothing to be gathered thence of the persons right to be added to the Church, or the Ministers duty to add to the Church by baptism, persons meerly upon this consideration, that they shall be saved, but onely that it is the course of Gods providence to add to his Church such as shall be saved. I yet add that if Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position were granted him, <hi>they have a right to the Church-visible militant who shall be of the Church triumphant,</hi> yet this right cannot be claimed but by those who are elect, and therefore from these Scriptures so expounded <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 47. it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved that any other than elect infants are to be baptized and to be added to the Church, not the natural children of true believers, who are many of them non elect; nor can a Minister gather thence, he ought to baptize any of them till he know they are elect, and shall be saved, and therefore they rashly and profanely baptize from hence them, that they have no knowledg of, that of them is the Kingdom of glory and that they shall be saved.</p>

And so to Mr. <hi>Cobbets</hi> objection I answer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 10. it is not said, theirs shall be the Kingdom of Heaven, but [<hi>is</hi>] and yet it must be understood of present title and future possession, so here. And for his exception at my words, that the reason may be given why these infants did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Gods Kingdom, because they were such as Christ would bless, is not avoided by saying, <hi>they were blessed, because of Gods Kingdom.</hi> For both ways the reason is good, they should not be hindered from blessing, because theirs was the Kingdom of Heaven the end of blessing, or they should not be hindered from blessing because he intended to bless them, and therefore theirs was the Kingdom of Heaven. Either way that I intended to prove <hi>Examen pag.</hi> 147. is evinced, that the reason why theirs was the Kingdom of Heaven is not from their parents faith (which should have been if it were meant, as Paedobaptists would, of interest in the visible Church) but Gods election or Christs blessing.</p>
            <p>I have often said, that if Christs minde had been that infants should be baptized, he would have commanded these little ones to have been baptized for an Example. To this Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> answers, <hi>that according to our principles they were elect, heirs of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of glory: now why should not or were not these infants at least baptized?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Because though elect, yet were not believers or Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by profession.</p>
            <p>But <hi>You would allow,</hi> saith he, <hi>such to be baptized if of grown years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No, untill they were believers or Disciples, not barely because elect and heirs of glory.</p>
            <p>But <hi>You say,</hi> saith he, <hi>that if by extraordinary revelation you knew an infant to be sanctified, you would baptize it, because the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary revelation would authorize it, and the words of</hi> Peter, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47. <hi>and the institution, Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>And then it would follow,</hi> 1. <hi>That persons may be Disciples without being outwardly taught.</hi> 2. <hi>It is agreeable to the rule that persons without personal profession of faith should be baptized. Albeit</hi>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:100457:133"/>
               <hi>extraordinary things done besides rule cross not ordinary rule; yet neither extraordinarily nor ordinarily is any thing to be done, which is in it self contrary to rule.</hi> 3. <hi>It was the minde of Christ they should be baptized, as that they should be instructed, though it be not expressed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is true I grant in my <hi>Examen, p.</hi> 142, 158, 160. upon the grounds mentioned, that an infant regenerated, united to Christ, sanctified by the Spirit upon extraordinary revelation of this might be baptized; and the like is said by Mr. <hi>Blackwood Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Bapt. p.</hi> 51. <hi>And for those that have the thing signified let them make it appear to any Church of Christ, and they cannot deny their baptism.</hi> But yet it follows not that these infants might be baptized which are mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. For though their election be mentioned, yet not their regeneration and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Now <hi>Praedestinatio nil ponit in praedestinato,</hi> and therefore it makes not Disciples or believers at present, but assures it as future: but we are to baptize actual Disciples and believers, not future.</p>
            <p>But <hi>However,</hi> saith he, <hi>they may be Disciples who are are not outwardly taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Who denies it? yet they must be learners of Christ in their own persons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then,</hi> saith he, <hi>a person may be baptized without personal profession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is granted, when God supplies the absence of it by his revelation otherwise: nor is this contrary to the Rule, sith that is, to baptise known Disciples, who are ordinarily known by their personal profession, though in this case Gods extraordinary act sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that want. Yet Mr. <hi>Cobbets</hi> saying is not right, <hi>that neither extraordinarily nor ordinarily is any thing to be done, which is in it self contrary to rule.</hi> For <hi>Abrahams</hi> killing his son was in it self contrary to rule, yet upon extraordinary command it was to be done. And for the third, though it might be conceived Christs minde, that the children should be instructed, though it be not mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 16, 17. because it was a duty of perpetual equity by virtue of the moral Law: yet baptising infants being a meer positive rite, that hath no reason or warrant but institution, is not to be conceived Christs minde, without some declaration,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100457:134"/>
which he neither then when he had so fit opportunity, nor at any time else expressed.</p>
            <p>There are some more things in Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> censurable, as <hi>that he makes the infants paterns as well of receiving the kingdom at least externally, as of the affection and disposition with which it is to be received;</hi> whereas, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. the words <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>4. do plainly make them paterns onely of humility, and such good dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions as are in children fit to be imitated. 2. In Mr. <hi>Cobbets</hi> sense the words of Christ would be false, [<hi>whosoever shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the kingdom of God as a little childe externally by an initial seal or some other visible sign, as laying on hands, &amp;c. shall not enter therein.</hi>] For then that Popish Doctrine, or rather more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid than Popish must be maintained, that no unbaptized Martyr or other shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> without proof sayd [<hi>of such like infants, like them in covenant, and Church interest in God is his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>] there being not a word in the Text that leads to this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase, and the plain meaning is before expressed.</p>
            <p>That which Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> sayth in answer to the reason of <hi>Pisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Why they were not infants because Christ called them;</hi> I conceive is not an answer. For what he sayth, <hi>that things ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the children are rather to be understood of parents, and he instanceth in</hi> Levi's <hi>paying Tyths in</hi> Abraham, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. is not right. For, 1. that which is sayd of <hi>Levi</hi> is to be understood of <hi>Levi,</hi> not of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for it were neither good sense nor to his purpose, to say, <hi>Abraham</hi> payd Tyths in <hi>Abraham.</hi> 2. If things done by a parent and related by the Holy Ghost as mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous passages are imputed to the children, yet it is absurd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand in an historical narration of facts that to be meant as spoken to the parents, which was spoken to the children. Other things I let pass, which oppose not my dispute but others: and what things he speaks in answer to my Objections, and what concerns the answering the imaginary absurdities arising from our Doctrine in that chapter, I refer to another place. This is sufficient in answer to what he sayth in opposition to me about that passage <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> in his <hi>Animad. on my Exercit. pag.</hi> 57, 58. argues thus, <hi>To whom indefinitely as such, Heaven and the blessing of and</hi>

               <hi>for Heaven belongs, to them as such the seal of converance, and confirmation of Heaven and that blessing belongs. For if the Land be mine the Deeds and Seals of Conveyance are mine. But Heaven and the blessing of and for Heaven belongs indefinitely to such little children, more, whiles little children; so the Text here expresly. To them belong, or (which is all one) of such is the kingdom of Heaven, and he took them in his arms and blessed them. Therefore to little children indefinitely belongs the Seal of Conveyance or Confirmation of Heaven, and the blessing of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which in the New Testament, according to the time Christ spake, is baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Neither is it true, That <hi>baptism is the seal of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of heaven, and the blessing for it,</hi> that I finde in Scripture, but the Spirit, <hi>Ephos.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. Nor is it true, <hi>That heaven and the blessing of heaven belong to little children indefinitely as such,</hi> that is as little children. For then it should belong to all little children, nor to them as children of believing parents, for it should belong to all children of believing parents, but as they are elect. And to these I grant baptism be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs when they are called, and believe, not before; as a conveyance may be made to a childe, yet he is not to have it in his hands till he come to understand it, and is fit to make use of it. So that the <hi>major</hi> may be denied if [<hi>the belonging of the seal</hi>] be meant in respect of present use or possession. And the <hi>minor</hi> is to be denied, if [<hi>as such</hi>] be meant [as little children, or children of believers] and the inference on the conclusion is denied, <hi>the seal belongs to them,</hi> Ergo, <hi>baptism.</hi> Other arguments of Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in my <hi>Apology pag.</hi> 102. though briefly yet sufficiently.

               <hi>infants; that therefore baptism a seal of that same kinde, when once the Lord had solemnely at his ascension appointed it to be the ordinary seal of initiation into his Church ought not to be denied to them</hi>] is but dictates. 1. He says, <hi>baptism is a seal of the same kinde with Christs laying on hands,</hi> which he saith without proof, nor is it true. For. 1. Christs laying on hands was an act extraordinary done by Christ himself as the great Prophet, but baptism was an act of ordinary ministration not done by Christ himself but <hi>his Disciples, John</hi> 4. 1, 2. 2. Baptism was the duty of the baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. not onely the baptizers, but not so laying on hands by Christ. 3. If <hi>baptism be a seal of the same kinde with laying on of hands,</hi> then laying on hands is a seal, and a Sacrament of the same kind with baptism, which is counted a point of Popery. 2. To shift off the objection, that Christ appointed not those infants to be baptized, he allegeth <hi>that Christ did after solemnly appoint it at his ascension, and since then it ought to be done:</hi> which intimates that infants were not to be baptized before, but after the ascension. But, 1. The appointment and practise of baptism was before, if not as solemn, and the same use and order of it, and therefore this reason is of no force why others should be baptized after, more than these before the ascension. 2. It will follow that <hi>Jews</hi> infants were not to be baptized till after the ascension of Christ, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws his and other Paedobaptists argument about the seal and Covenant, which if of any validity, prove infant baptism as well before the ascension as after. 3. It is false, that Christ at his ascension appointed infant baptism any more than before, the commission of Christ and the Apostles practise shew the contrary. Therefore I deny his argment in the words set down as being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof or shew of it. Mr. <hi>Thomas Fuller</hi> in his <hi>Infants ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate ch.</hi> 18 hath these words St. <hi>John addeth ch.</hi> 21. 21. <hi>And there are also many other things which Jesus did which are not written, amongst which for ought appears to the contrary, the baptizing of these infants might be one of them;</hi> wherein he runs to the Popish plea for their unwritten traditions, and forgets that besides what I have alleged before to shew those infants were not baptized, there appears something to the contrary out of <hi>John</hi> 4. 1, 2. where it is said, that Jesus baptized not, but his Disciples,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100457:135"/>
and therefore the baptizing of those Infants could not be one of the things which Jesus did though not written <hi>John</hi> 21. 21. His argument, they were capable of a blessing, therefore of baptism; hath been often denied and answered before. There came to my hands also the <hi>Exercitation</hi> of Mr. <hi>Cuthbert Sidenham,</hi> in which <hi>ch.</hi> 10. he terms Antipaedobaptism <hi>denying infants with scorn a little water,</hi> and after, <hi>this Text Matth.</hi> 19. 13, 14. <hi>if there were no more, will fly in the consciences one day of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident contemners of infants, and their baptism.</hi> To which I say, it shews too much youthfull rashness u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> for <hi>a Teacher of a Church either</hi> to call Antipaedobaptists <hi>contemners of infants, and their baptism,</hi> and their denying infants baptism (which they do for ought he knows out of tender conscience of not profaning Christs ordinance) an act, <hi>of scorn,</hi> and to speak of the <hi>Texts flying in their consciences,</hi> who know that he had more reason to expect the flying of this Text in his conscience, who in this (as he doth in the rest of his pamphlet) makes the objection against his urging it for infant baptism so as that he might put it off with a slight answer, For whereas Antipaedobaptists object, if Christ hinted their right to baptism, why did he neither baptze them, nor appoint them to be baptized by his Apostles? Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> leaves out the later part of the objection, and answers. 1. <hi>He baptizeth none.</hi> 2. <hi>He did that which was an ordinance usually, in those primitive times, administred after baptism and equal to it in dignity, and so we may argue from this to baptism either inclusively or</hi> à majori <hi>from the greater, he did such acts to them as are equivalent if not supereminent.</hi> But doth Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> indeed think such petty arguings, which he knows not how to form in a Logick way, but in pathetick Rhetorick, likely to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>errify our consciences so much, when he himself dares not positively assert, that the laying on of Christs hands did include and presuppose baptism, yea he acknowledgeth it to have been extraordinary; and for his way of proving <hi>à majori,</hi> he either is ignorant in Logick or else might understand, that an argument <hi>à majori</hi> is not thus; there is conferred on such a one a greater thing, therefore the less; Christs blessing therefore right to baptism; For then the argument were good, Christ blessed the infants which is the greater, therefore he gave them the Lords supper, or made them Apostles, or gave them
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100457:136"/>
the gift of tongues, which are the less. But an argument <hi>à majori</hi> is <hi>à magis probabili,</hi> and so it is not more probable that Christ would have them baptized, than that he would bless them, sith they were not meet subjects of the one as of the other. There is nothing else in that chapter but what hath answer before, this is enough to abate the insolency of this Scribler.</p>

That the new administration is much different from the old, to wit, baptism from Circumcision. 2. That the practise of baptism in all the Evangelists is set down of singular persons. 3.

            <p>THere is another Text which is by Mr. <hi>Cobbet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bailee,</hi> Dr. <hi>Homes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> and others produced for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of infant-baptism, and it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2.

               <hi>The Fathers baptized in the Cloud, and in the Sea, were the whole People as well young as old; for no doubt the infants went as well through the Cloud and the Sea as their Parents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Antecedent may be denied, because it is sayd [our Fathers] not infants. But sayth Mr. <hi>Cobbet, This is spoken of the Church Fathers to</hi> Paul <hi>and the Gentile Church-members, and the young ones were in after ages instruments to convey Church-truths and blessings.</hi>

               <hi>Refut.</hi> 1. It is not sayd <hi>our Fathers</hi> as we are a Church, none but <hi>Abraham</hi> that I know is termed a Father to the Church of Christ, he being onely named <hi>the Father of the faithfull,</hi> and they <hi>his seed:</hi> but either [<hi>our Fathers</hi>] notes simply the Ancestors that went before, as it is usual to call those our forefathers who were before us in former generations, though they begat us not; or else if it note their fathers in respect of natural generation, it notes as <hi>Grotius</hi> in his <hi>Annot in locum, the Fathers of us,</hi> to wit, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi> But it may be sayd, that cannot be, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Refut.</hi> 1. It is not unusual to speak of persons in the second person by figure of Communication or Enallage of persons, when the thing is not true of them but our selves, and when the thing is not true of us but others; as when we say, we have preached, it is meant of one person that speaks, and 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 17. it is sayd, [<hi>we which are alive, and remain</hi>] and yet none of those that wrote were such, and so [<hi>our Fathers</hi>] is no more than the Fathers. 2. But there's no need of a figure: For the Epistle was written by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. And for <hi>Paul</hi> there's no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Sosthenes being a Ruler of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, Acts</hi> 18. 17.

It doth appear the infants were not meant in that they are onely meant, who were in a state of pleasing or displeasing God, as appears by <hi>v.</hi> 5. but so were not infants. 3. They onely are sayd to be baptized to whom the same thing was signified by the cloud, that is, signified by our baptism; but to the infants nothing was signified by the cloud and sea, and passing

through or under them, for they were not subjects of instruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> capable to know a resemblance, <hi>Ergo,</hi> infants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were not baptized. But sayth Mr. <hi>Bailee, They went through the Sea,</hi> Ergo, <hi>they were baptized.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> So did the beasts also, and yet are not sayd to have been baptized, but those that did or might understand the signification of it. 4. They that are sayd <hi>to be baptized, v.</hi> 2. are all sayd <hi>to eat and drink Manna and Water,</hi> and that it was or might have been to them <hi>spiritual meat or drink, v.</hi> 3, 4. But this is not to be said of their infants. For as Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> grant, <hi>the infants did not eat Manna cakes,</hi> nor is it likely they did drink water, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving breast milk, much less is it true that they were <hi>spiritual meat or drink</hi> to them, or might have been, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not meant by the Fathers baptized.</p>
            <p>Nor is Mr. <hi>Bailees</hi> consequence good. For if the infants might be sayd to be baptized with <hi>Moses</hi> baptism, yet it follows not they are to be baptized with Christs, sith <hi>Moses</hi> his baptism was not formal baptism, but similitudinary after a sort, they were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, that is, as <hi>Grotius Annot in locum quasi baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ti, as if they had been baptized;</hi> but a Rule holds not from similitudinary to formal baptism. But Mr. <hi>Bailee</hi> would prove the consequence thus, <hi>The Reasons which may be brought for the exclusion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants from being baptized with their Parents by Christs baptism, militate as much against their being baptized with their Parents by</hi> Moses <hi>baptism. Therefore if nowithstanding they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the one baptism, they may as well be admitted to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The antecedent of this proof is false; for in that of <hi>Moses,</hi> the baptism is onely similitudinary in respect of a fact or event, which was no duty: but formal baptism of Christ is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the person baptized, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2 38. &amp; 22. 16. which cannot agree to an infant though the other should. Nor is such kinde of shadowy, typical, analogical, similitudinary ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism any more a rule about Christian baptism than <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, which had the like resemblance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. And this Reason is confirmed from the Text. For if by [<hi>Fathers</hi>] are meant infants, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and they were baptized, and this must be a rule to us now about baptism of water appointed by Christ, which was sayd of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:100457:139"/>
het similitudinary baptism, then sith the same are meant by [<hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, v.</hi> 3, 4.] and they are sayd <hi>to eat the same spiritual meat and drink,</hi> which was <hi>Christ,</hi> which is manifestly meant of the Lords Supper, by the same reason which Mr. <hi>Bailee</hi> brings, infants must not be excluded from the Lords Supper. Yea, but saith Dr. Homes, <hi>They did not eat all the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Refut. They did all eat the same spiritual meat, and drink the same spiritual drink,</hi> which if he deny to be meant of the Lords Supper he deserts Protestants and other Divines acknowledging it, and may be refuted from the scope of the Apostle, which is, to shew that they had in a sort, in respect of signification and use the same Sacraments with ours, and yet were not secured thereby when they sinned. But Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> says, <hi>There must be a</hi> Synecdoche <hi>in the later, not all the Fathers simply being meant, but such as were capable of making a spiriual use thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Refut.</hi> If [<hi>all our Fathers</hi>] must be meant Synecdochically, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. then also in <hi>v.</hi> 2. it being the same term in either, and the <hi>sense of them, v.</hi> 5. being meant of as many, <hi>v.</hi> 3 4 as <hi>v.</hi> 2. Yea, but <hi>there's a bar put against infants receiving the Lords Supper,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Refut.</hi> There are more bars, and more express put against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants baptism, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 5 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which it seems Paedobaptists will leap over, or break down, notwithstanding they are so plainly set up by Christ and his Apostles to prevent their infant-baptism.</p>
            <p>That which Mr. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> in his <hi>Dialogue</hi> brings out of <hi>Psalm</hi> 77. 17. <hi>to prove that the</hi> Israelites <hi>were indeed formally baptized with water,</hi> is upon mistake, that the water there poured out was on the <hi>Israelites,</hi> whereas his own <hi>Annotations</hi> on the places, and the words of the <hi>Psalm</hi> refer it to what was done to the <hi>Egyptians, Exod.</hi> 14. 24, 25. And thus <hi>Junius</hi> and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. Yet were it granted him, there must be a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> in the term [<hi>all the Fathers</hi>] for the reasons given, and otherwise beasts as well as infants must be sayd to be baptized.</p>

            <p>MR. <hi>Blake</hi> had in his <hi>Birth-privilege, pag.</hi> 9. argued from <hi>Gal</hi> 4. 29. for infant-baptism, and his passages in his arguing I censured as very gross in my <hi>Examen, part.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. which he seeks to make good <hi>Answer to my Letter, cap.</hi> 4. to which I reply in my <hi>Postscript sect.</hi> Yet he hath thought good to reinforce his allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Text, and in his <hi>Vindic.

            <p>To which I answer, if he mean by [<hi>the Church</hi>] the Church Christian visible, and by [<hi>being in the bosom of it</hi>] having actual visible Church membership, I grant the <hi>major,</hi> and deny the <hi>minor,</hi> and for the Text <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alleged to prove it, am no more induced by Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> arguings to believe that it makes to his purpose, than I am to think the Snow is black.

That he understands this sayd of infants, which must then be sayd to persecute. 2. That he takes [<hi>being born after the flesh</hi>] in the later part to note <hi>natural birth:</hi> but that is clean besides the Apostles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who considers persons born after the flesh, not as born by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane members and seed, but as born by a fleshly covenant. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it should import no Allegory contrary to the Apostles speech, <hi>v.</hi> 24. which tels us these things are an Allegory, that is, do speak or declare some other thing than the narration accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Grammar-sense imports, and that is, to be born accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleshly covenant, that is, to imbrace the Doctrine of that covenant. 3. That [<hi>to be born after the flesh</hi>] should import birth of <hi>Abraham</hi> as a believer, and so natural generation of each childe of a believer in that respect, but then [<hi>to be born after the flesh</hi>] would be common to <hi>Isaac</hi> with <hi>Ishmael,</hi> to him that is born after the spirit, of the free woman, by promise, with him that is born after the flesh of the bond woman; for to be born of <hi>Abraham</hi> or a believer agrees also to <hi>Isaac,</hi> to him that is born after the spirit, of the free woman, by promise; whereas to be born after the flesh is taken in a sense from which <hi>Isaac</hi> and we, that is, <hi>Paul</hi> and other Christian believers are excluded.

Now actions though they are capable of various modifications, yet I do not think any Logicians call them subjects, or their several modifications adjuncts: but the substance whose acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or passion it is, is the subject both of the action and passion, and their degrees and modifications, and these are adjuncts of that substance.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> adds of me, <q>He is pleased to deny that it is a distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the subject according to its adjuncts, and gives in the thing in dispute for a reason. Then the same person (he says) would be born after the spirit and after the flesh.</q>

               <q> Presently he confesseth that <hi>Isaac</hi> was born after the flesh in the two senses I mention.</q> And I am sure Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will not deny that <hi>Isaac</hi> was born after the Spirit, and then either truth is very absurd, or else Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath quit me from absurdity; but then he says, It is untrue in the Apostles sense, for then he should be the childe of the bond-mayd, not by promise, a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor to be cast out, not to inherit. To which I answer, that my sense is the Apostles sense, and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his sense far from it: For though the Apostle doth indeed allegorize the Text, as <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> renders it, <hi>quae sunt allegorizata,</hi> yet the Apostle in the parallel looks at the letter of the history, as I have shewen, not at the Allegory, which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> had not a face to oppose, either he must deny now and then to be Adverbs of time, or else he must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of my interpretation, <hi>Ishmael</hi> did never as a Justitiary prosecute <hi>Isaac</hi> under the notion of a follower of Evangelical righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I do confess <hi>Isaac</hi> was born after the Spirit, and that he was born after the flesh in the two senses of Mr. <hi>Bl. for one born of natural parents</hi> Abraham <hi>was his natural father, and in the</hi>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:100457:144"/>
               <hi>sense more common in Scripture for the outward prerogatives that accompany such a birth</hi> (though I do not find the phrase, <hi>born after the flesh</hi> in this later sense in Scripture, not <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. where the term [<hi>flesh</hi>] is used and yet I think onely in the first place importing prerogatives, no where the phrase <hi>born after the flesh</hi> in that sense) yet not in the Apostles sense, in which to be <hi>born after the flesh</hi> notes birth without consideration of the father as by a mother that was a bond-woman, and so no prerogative is intimated in it but a debasement or deminution and so <hi>Isaac</hi> was not born after the flesh, that is not of a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, by an usual way of generation, but of the free-woman by Divine virtue according to a promise to her when past childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing in the course of nature. And this to be the Apostles sense is proved before, and Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> sense proved very absurd, and his reasons for it answered.</p>
            <p>Yet he adds of me. <q>After some concessions in full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to himself, I deny not (saith he) but legal Justitiaries may be in the visible Church as <hi>Ishmael</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> house, though the Apostle make the parallel onely in the casting out, that they might not inherit, <hi>Apolog. pag.</hi> 114.) he saith, if Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> would gather anything hence for himself, he must prove that the Apostle makes some to be of the visible Church by virtue of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born after the flesh as their prerogative, which is as wide from the Apostles meaning, as the East is from the West, as far as the East is from the Sun-rising, he should have said, that is the thing that I have proved, and do maintain, I laid down by way of Syllogism and have an Apology instead of an answer.</q> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath a notable faculty in begging of the question in agitation. The Apostles full scope (I confess) is another thing; but I still affirm that he occasionally expresses that from whence this is evidently deduced, namely a distinction of births literal not allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> never will be able with any reason to deny, till it can be proved that <hi>then</hi> and <hi>now</hi> look at the Allegory, not at the History; I can prove from <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 16. that the <hi>Israelitish</hi> women are daughters of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though it is plain that another thing there was Christs main intention.</p>

my self. This may be true, Justitiaries may be in the visible Church, and this also, To be born after the flesh or to be a Justitiary doth not import a prerogative giving title to be of the visible Church, my speech was right, and needs not to be mended by any of Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

He hath a full answer to his Syllogism before, and so he had before in the Apology, the strength of his arguing being thus expressed here, <hi>The consequence is plain, birth of the flesh in the Church gave a Church interest,</hi> which is denied to be proved from <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 26. and was denied before. And though being an answerer I need not prove, and therefore begging the question is charged on me frivolously by Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> For he only begs the question who takes for granted that which he should prove (which is Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> fault who useth to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ctate when he should prove) yet did I prove that the Apostles scope is not onely another thing than the asserting of a prerogative of visible Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership by being born after the flesh, that is, being the childe of a believer by natural generation, but that he deduceth their casting out of the Church from it, and that <hi>the birth after the flesh</hi> is taken in the worser part as that which bringeth bondage not Church estate or Christian liberty, nor doth <hi>birth after the flesh</hi> respect the descent from a believer but the bond-woman, and that this birth is in the Antitype allego<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Generally interpreters take the words, <hi>even so it is now,</hi> as meant of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which cannot be true literally: for they were not born after the flesh, that is, of bond-women, but of free-women, which were true <hi>Israelites,</hi> or <hi>daughters</hi> of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> here confesseth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> proceeds. <hi>Secondly, he sayth that I say, such are in the bosom of the Church, when the Apostle sayth, they persecute the Church, and are cast out: I desire the Reader to consider, if this had any truth in it; whether it hold with greater strength for me or him? They are cast out, and therefore they were in, is my Argument: they are cast out, and therefore were never in, sayth Mr.</hi> T. 2. <hi>The Apostle sayth no such thing, that they are cast out;</hi> Ishmael <hi>was in the family when he persecuted, though afterwards he was cast out of the family; these are in the Church, though in case they continue persecution, they shall</hi>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:100457:145"/>
               <hi>in fine be cast out; now in present they have a being in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true that this was my second Exception against his gross perverting of the Apostles words, [<hi>even so it is now</hi>] as if the meaning were, that by virtue of being born after the flesh, some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, to wit, those that are born of a believing parent are in the bosom of the Church, when the Apostle sayth, 1. <hi>They persecute,</hi> which cannot be meant of infants. 2. In that <hi>they are born after the flesh they persecute the Church,</hi> therefore he ascribes no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to them, as accruing to them, by the birth after the flesh, but a cursed practice. 3. That <hi>they persecute the Church,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while born after the flesh they were not in the bosom of the Church, that is the Church Christian visible. 4. That <hi>they are cast out,</hi> therefore not in the Church. To the two first of these nothing is answered, the consequence of the third is denied, he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth <hi>they did persecute the Church, and yet remained in;</hi> which is most palpably false: For this being apparently meant of the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> that sought righteousness by the Law, and acknowledged so by Interpreters, it is notoriously false, that <hi>they were in the bosom of the Christian Church,</hi> while they did perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Church; yea, <hi>Saul</hi> himself was not after his conversion taken in presently to communion with the Disciples at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> till they knew that he ceased to be a persecutor, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 26. so that the words [<hi>even so it is now</hi>] expounded as Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate [even so now by virtue of being born after the flesh, that is, by natural generation born of a believing parent, there are some even infants that are in the bosom of the Christian visible Church, as members of it, and remaining in it, do persecute the Church] are so false, and the Exposition so unsavoury, that it is a wonder to me, that neither Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> nor the Prefacers to his Book take care to have it left out. That which Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> answers to the fourth thing in this exception is of like stamp. 1. He sayth, <hi>It follows not they were cast out, therefore never in.</hi> But my Argument is this, they were by reason of their being born after the flesh cast out, therefore not for this reason in the bosom of the Church. 2. <hi>That it follows, they are cast out, therefore they were in:</hi> which consequence I deny, being understood of the Church Christian visible, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons who are sayd to be cast out: for they are sayd to be cast out not from what they had, but from what they might have had
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100457:146"/>
or others had; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 12. it is sayd, <hi>The children of the Kingdom shall be east out</hi> (of the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>v.</hi> 11. in which others were, and they not) <hi>into outer darkness.</hi> He sayth also, <hi>The Apostle sayth no such thing that they are cast out, but menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a command of casting them out.</hi> To which I replied, As if Gods <hi>dictum</hi> were not <hi>factum:</hi> if they were not cast out, why doth the Apostle allege that Text? My meaning was, Gods speech of the casting out of <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Ishmael</hi> was not a bare command, but such as included a sentence and decree of God, which he took course to execute, and that the Apostle allegeth the Text not to prove a duty, but to shew an event, or fact of God. For as the Apostle allegeth it, the casting out is of the legal covenant, and the children of it those that desired to be under the Law, and their cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out is their rejecting from the inheritance of righteousness and being Gods people: now this could not be any mans duty but Gods act determining and accordingly accomplishing this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that righteousness shall not be by the Law, nor Justitiaries his people, and therefore it is most absurd in Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> to determine, that some by virtue of being born after the flesh have a right to be in the bosom of the Church Christian, when the Apostle deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines they are for this reason rejected or cast out.</p>
            <p>I had, thirdly, excepted against Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> as <hi>making those that are born after the flesh, Gal.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, wherein he joyns with <hi>Arminius</hi> in calling them <hi>Abrahams seed who sought justice in the Law.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bl.

And ascribes to them the inheriting of outward privileges as to be members of the visible Church in that they are born after the flesh. Whereas the term [<hi>born after the flesh</hi>] is taken in the worser part precisely from the birth from the bond-woman ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractively from generation by <hi>Abraham</hi> and importing no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, but a privation of privilege. As for Mr. <hi>Bayn,</hi> though he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret [<hi>children of the flesh, Rom.</hi> 9. 8.] <hi>of those onely who in course of nature came from</hi> Abraham, <hi>and proves there that it notes not legal Justitiaries, because it is applyed to</hi> Esau <hi>who is considered as having done neither good nor evil.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> wrongs him in two things. 1. In that he saith, Mr. <hi>Baine interprets it of a natural seed inheriting outward privileges,</hi> whereas though Mr. <hi>Baine</hi> doth interpret [<hi>children of the flesh, Rom.</hi> 9. 8.] of a natural seed, yet not as inheriting thereby out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward privileges. 2. That he makes his exposition of [<hi>children of the flesh, Rom.</hi> 9. 8] to be his exposition of [<hi>those that are born after the flesh, Gal.</hi> 4. 29.] whereas he expresly saith, <hi>though chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the flesh in some other Scripture</hi> (which can be no other than <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>doth note out Justitiaries, seeking salvation in the Law.</hi> I confess <hi>Cameron</hi> in his <hi>Conference</hi> with <hi>Tilenus</hi> in the place before cited makes <hi>Ishmael</hi> not onely a Type of Justitiaries, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 23, 29. but also <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8 9. and <hi>Isaac</hi> a Type of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in both places, and <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> Types not of Justitiaries

            <p>The arguing is to this effect, <hi>If the Doctrine of laying on of hands put after the Doctrine of baptisms cannot be expounded of any other than the laying on of hands for confirming the baptized in infancy than the Doctrine of laying on of hands put after the Doctrine of baptisms presupposeth infant-baptism.

            <p>To which I answered in my <hi>Exercit. pag.</hi> 22. that it is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity to put that among the Principles of Christian knowledg, those gifts being though by extraordinary power, yet frequent in those days, and necessary to be known to confirm young Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that Jesus is the Christ, because the Spirit thus given was the great witness concerning Christ, that he was the Son of God, and shewed that he was gone up to the Father, else the Spirit had not descended, it was it by which the world was rebuked, and the Saints established.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Doctor misallegeth my words: for I do not say positively as he cites them, but comparatively thus; for it is more likely that imposition of hands for Ordination, which was still in use, and to continue to be used, should be there meant, than lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands for confirmation after baptism of infants, which hath no Rule nor Example in Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. Saith Dr. <hi>Homes, Those gifts usual onely in that little time of the Apostles were not to be joyned with, and put among the first Principles of Christian Religion to be taught young ones to fit them for baptism, or to give an account of their faith after baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Those Principles <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. are not sayd to be taught to little ones in age, but in knowledg of Christian Religion, nor are they sayd to be taught to fit them for baptism, or to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their faith after baptism: they may be principles and a foundation, though they were taught them after baptism, and to establish themselves rather than to give account to others. Now for what reason the knowledg of these might be a part of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of the Doctrine of Christ to young Christians is given above. And there is in the Text that which may induce us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the giving the spirit by laying on of hands meant, because <hi>v.</hi> 4. they that were enlightned, which many even of the Ancients under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of baptism, commonly called by the <hi>Greeks</hi> [inlightning] are sayd, <hi>to have tasted of the heavenly gift and to be partakers of the Holy Ghost,</hi> which seems to be meant in respect of these gifts, and <hi>Paul Acts</hi> 19. 2. propounded this as a Catechism question to certain Disciples at <hi>Ephesus, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?</hi> But I rested not on it, because the other of laying on of hands for Ordination seemed to me more likely then.</p>
            <p>2. Sayth Mr. <hi>Brinsley, Its not likely to be meant of laying on of hands for Ordination,</hi> 1. <hi>Because that's not fit to be taught younglings, children, novices, as milk, Heb.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>If this be milk,</hi> viz. <hi>the Doctrine of Church-discipline, Church-officers, Church-goverment, &amp;c. what shall we call o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:100457:148"/>To this was answered, that however all the Doctrine about Church-discipline might be unfit to be taught novices, yet laying on hands for Ordination being an outward ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To this Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> replies, <hi>that no ingenuous man we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To which I say, many even of later Writers, whom me thinks the Doctor should not deny to be ingenuous men do refer the laying on of hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. to Ordination, <hi>Dicson</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Ames Bell.

The <hi>New Annot.

Though it might be conceived unfit for little children in age to be taught, yet it may nevertheless be fit to be taught younglings in Christianity meant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. It seems to me to be as fit to be taught little children as the Doctrine of Confirmation, and may be as easily learned by them as the points about the Resurrection of the Dead, and eternal Judgment.</p>
            <p>2. Sayth Mr. <hi>Brinsley, The very putting these two together</hi> [<hi>baptisms and laying on of hands</hi>] <hi>seems in</hi> Calvins <hi>judgment to import some relation that the one should have to the other, as in the other Principles which are by pairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answered, that baptism and imposition of hands might be fitly coupled, being both Ordinances for initiation, the one into the profession of Christianity, the other into sacred function.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If all this were granted, yet the answer stands good, that the joyning proves not Mr. <hi>Brinsleys</hi> sense necessary, which is enough for my purpose to shew the insufficiency of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> thinks to blow away all by avouching his and Mr. <hi>Brinsleys</hi> interpretation, which he cals <hi>a naked and honest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Text.</hi> And that is, <hi>that the Doctrine of baptisms is the Doctrine which the catechized of the heathens recited afore their baptism, and the Doctrine of laying on of hands was the Doctrine which infants of believers before baptized in their infancy, after they were past childhood, rehearsed before the Church, upon which they were received into the Church by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ:</hi> He may well call it <hi>a naked interpretation,</hi> because it is brought into the world without proof, there being nothing in the Text for it, and all the shew of proof is onely the opinion of some late writers mistaken about the practise of antiquity. Yea me thinks if the Doctor with his brethren of the congregational way, as it is called, did believe this interpretation to be genuine, they should admit their infant-sprinkled members by laying on of hands, which yet I hear not that they do. But against this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation are these reasons. 1. In it is supposed that <hi>the Doctrine of baptisms, and laying on of hands</hi> is not the Doctrine concerning those rites, but the Doctrine recited when those rites were used. But the Doctrine then recited being the Doctrine of <hi>the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of <hi>repentance from dead works and faith towards God,</hi> if the <hi>Doctrine of baptisms and the laying on of hands</hi> be the Doctrine recited by the baptized, and confirmed at the use of those rites, it will be the same with the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment, repentance from dead works and faith towards God, and so those several principles will be confounded. 2. The Doctrine of baptisms was that which in those to whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles wrote was layd before, which is intimated in the words
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100457:149"/>
               <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>not laying again.</hi> But they were <hi>Hebrews,</hi> therefore not, as the Doctor, Heathens that recited it at baptism. 3. There's no distinction in the Text as if some recited the Doctrine at baptism, and others who had been baptized in infancy recited it at laying on of hands, but the same persons had the Doctrine of both layd in them. 4. There's not a word of reciting the Doctrine at the several rites by the taught, but the laying of the foundation of the Doctrine of those rites by the Teachers. 5. <hi>The Doctrine of baptisms</hi> whether by them be meant those of <hi>John</hi> and Christ, or other, and of laying on of hands is more likely and more generally conceived to be concerning the use of baptism and laying on of hands. But the Doctrine of the use of these was not recited by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of catechized persons, though both sorts were taught both doctrines. 6. The placing the words [<hi>the Doctrine of baptisms and laying on of hands</hi>] in the middle between <hi>faith and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead,</hi> is against the Doctors sense, sith <hi>the Doctrine of baptisms,</hi> being joyned by apposition to <hi>faith and repentance,</hi> the sense must be, that <hi>repentance and faith</hi> were the Doctrine recited at baptism, not <hi>the resurection of the dead,</hi> which comes after, if the Doctors sense were right. 7. This order leads us to conceive, that the writer of that Epistle did orderly place the elements of Christianity in which Christians were instructed, to wit, repentance and faith before baptism, then the baptism of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the laying on of hands for the obtaining the Spirit by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er after baptism, and then the declaration of what they were to expect, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in sentence should pass on them concerning their everlasting state. 8. The terms [<hi>of repentance, of faith, of the doctrine, of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, of judgement</hi>] are all governed of [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>] as if they were possessed of it (as the Grammarians speak) the word [<hi>Doctrine</hi>] is not joyned by apposition to [<hi>faith</hi>] as if the sense were [which is the Doctrine of baptisms] which must be the sense if the Doctors interpretation be right. 9.

hands on the baptized or the ordained, yet very few of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants refer it to the laying on of hands for confirmation of them that were baptized in infancy, and the 25. <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> makes <hi>Confirmation one of those things which have grown of the corrupt following of the Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I sayd in my <hi>Exercit. sect.</hi> 14. that if <hi>Hierom. tom.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his <hi>Dialogue against the Luciferians</hi> do assert that use of imposition of hands from Scripture, yet he allegeth not <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. for it, but the Examples of giving the Holy Ghost by laying on of hands in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> replies, 1. <hi>That however the antiquity holds good, that imposition of hands was used to be after applied to them that have been baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I say, This being granted, yet as I shew there and here the use of baptizing infants is not proved thereby, nor doth <hi>Hierom</hi> confirm Mr. <hi>Brinsleys</hi> Exposition.</p>
            <p>2. Sayth Dr. <hi>Homes, In that place he quotes other places than the</hi> Acts <hi>of the</hi> Apostles, <hi>and speaks to our purpose thus,</hi> and then reciting some words of <hi>Hierom,</hi> adds, so <hi>Hieronymus. Wherefore he supposeth imposition of hands may be on them that had the Spirit in baptism before:</hi> which is not denied by me, nor do I see what that is to Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> his purpose to prove <hi>that the laying on of hands Heb.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>is meant of believers infants before baptized, and then upon their own profession received into the Church by imposition of hands.</hi> Yet <hi>Chamier. tom.</hi> 4. <hi>Panstr. Cath. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>sect.</hi> 41. allegeth <hi>Hierom,</hi> as referring the imposition of hands to the time of baptism, not some years after.</p>
            <p>I sayd in my <hi>Exercit. pag.</hi> 23. but if it were supposed, that this imposition of hands meant <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. were on the baptized; yet this proves not the baptism of infants in the Apostles days, unless it could be proved, that it was used after the baptism of infants onely for a confirmation either of the baptism or the baptized. On the contrary, it is apparent out of <hi>Tertullian de corona militis, cap.</hi> 3. that in the primitive times the baptized did make his confession <hi>sub man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>To this Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> says, 1. <hi>That the learned men before quoted gave us the sum of Antiquity.</hi> But how little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100457:151"/>
their words are, or how destitute of proof is shewed above. 2. <hi>He cites in the Margin Tertul. de bapt. Cyprian. Ep.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 70. <hi>August. Tract.</hi> 6. on <hi>Johns Epist.</hi> But none of the passages he cites prove the use of laying on hands after the baptism of infants, which is many years after baptism, but of laying hands presently after baptism. 3. <hi>He excepts against my allegation out of</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, <hi>that he there disputes for receiving unwritten traditions, that he alludes to no Scripture authority, or to any approved An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity:</hi> Which doth no whit infringe my allegation: For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these things his testimony is valid for the practice of what was done at baptism in his time, of which no doubt he was often a spectator.</p>
            <p>4. Saith he, [<hi>Sub manu</hi>] <hi>is a Phrase that hath so many senses as it is no ways certain, that here</hi> [<hi>Sub mann</hi>] [<hi>under the hand</hi>] <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies imposition of hands. Haply it may rather signifie the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters lifting up of his hand in prayer: as</hi> Pacianus <hi>hath it, We obtain, sayth he, in Prayer pardon, and the Holy Spirit in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism by the mouth and hand of the Antistes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The most likely sense is, <hi>the Bishop laying on his hand,</hi> as being nearest the use of the phrase. Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> his sense is not likely, 1. Because that which is sayd was done <hi>under the hand of the Bishop,</hi> to wit, the protestation of the baptized, intimates that the Bishop did not then lift up his hand in prayer, but hold his hand on the head of the Protestant. Nor is it likely he would then be praying when he should attend to his confession. 2. Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> shews not the phrase to be used elsewhere in his sense. For that which he cites out of <hi>Pacianus</hi> is a different expression, <hi>by the hand,</hi> is not all one with <hi>under the hand.</hi> And yet <hi>Chamier. Panstr.

            </p>
            <p>I added further. And to save labour in reciting testimonies <hi>Chamier</hi> may be seen, who in his <hi>Panstr. Cath. tom.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>sect.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at large proves out of the Ancients, that the imposition of hands, which was after made a distinct Sacrament called Cofirmation, was either <hi>a part or Appendix of baptism,</hi> and cites many passages to shew, that it was when the baptized was to confess the fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> his way of proving infant-baptism from the <hi>Jews</hi> baptizing Proselytes children is shewed to be vain.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>DR. <hi>Henry Hammond</hi> in his <hi>Letter of Resolution to six Queries, in the fourth Quere, Sect.</hi> 23. speaks thus, <hi>But there is no need of laying much weight on this, or any the like more imperfect ways of probation,</hi> (meaning the example of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. of baptizing a whole houshold, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 33. Christs reception of little children, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Mark</hi> 10 16.) <hi>The whole fabrick being sufficiently supported, and built on this</hi> Basis (<hi>the customary baptism among the</hi> Jews) <hi>and that discerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be so, if we consider it first negatively, then positively. First negatively, that Christian baptism, which is an institution of Christs, lightly changed from the</hi> Jewish <hi>custome of receiving of Proselytes by him appointed in his life-time, and settled a little before his Ascension hath nothing in the patern, whence it is copi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed out, nothing in the copy it self, as it is set down in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:100457:152"/>
i. e. <hi>in the words of the institution, or in his or the Apostles practice, which doth any way exclude the Christians children from being part of that indefinite number, that ought to be baptized, or for whom baptism was instituted by Christ. That there is nothing exclusive of them in the patern</hi> (<hi>the</hi> Jewish <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of baptism</hi>) <hi>hath been sufficiently evidenced by the several branches of that already insisted on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I like the Doctors ingenuity in his waving the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ways of proving infant baptism he mentions, and doubt not to shew his own to be no better than those he relinquisheth. The substance of his proof is this, as I conceive. <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>were wont when they admitted Proselytes to baptize them and their children, and this is discernible to be the patern of Christian baptism, and that Christs institution was but a copy according to that patern, and therefore infants to be baptized, the Apostles and the first Churches practise shewing it to be so.</hi> Concerning which I say, 1. It seems baptism was a custome of all nations as well as the <hi>Jews. Grot. Annot. in Matth.</hi> 3. 6. conceives <hi>that for as much as strangers washed, not circumcised, were obliged by those Laws onely which God had given to all mankinde, it is easie to be understood that baptism was among old institutions arising, as I think, after the great deluge in memory of the world purged. Whence that famous speech among the</hi> Greeks, <hi>The sea washeth away all the evils of men. Surely we read even in the Epistle of of</hi> Peter, <hi>that baptism is answerable to the deluge.</hi> And <hi>Annot. in Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>yea with prosane nations it was of old used, that they who would be initiated were first washed all over their body, no doubt testifying thereby their purpose of innocency.</hi> 2. By the passages cited by the same Author in <hi>Matth</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Justin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Augustin</hi> alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth those nations custome for their practise; nor do I know that ever Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> or any other hath alleged one passage in Scripture or any of the Fathers, that might evince that the custome of baptizing or baptizing infants was derived from the <hi>Jews</hi> initiating proselytes by baptisme, but some passages in the Fathers shew rather that they took it as instead of Circumcision. Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den de Syned: Ebrae. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 40, 41. mentions some who have conceived that the <hi>Iewish</hi> baptism in initiating Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100457:153"/>
was in imitation of Christs example, though he do not beleive it; and that <hi>Schickardus</hi> conceives they added a certain Baptism to Circumcision to difference them from <hi>Samaritans,</hi> which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to shew that notwithstanding the Doctors supposition, that the whole fabrick of baptism is discernible to be built on that <hi>basis</hi> the customary baptism among the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet many will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it needs more proof than the bare recital of passages out of <hi>Jewish</hi> writers. I for my part conceive that there was a custom of baptizing proselytes afore Christs incarnation among the later <hi>Jews,</hi> but that either it should begin from <hi>Jacobs</hi> injunction to his houshold <hi>Gen.</hi> 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. or Gods Command, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 10. for the <hi>Israelites</hi> to wash their clothes afore the giving the Law (though the <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors allege these for it) I do not conceive, those places speaking of washing <hi>Jews</hi> by nature, not proselytes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Jews</hi> baptized not <hi>Jews</hi> by nature, as <hi>Selden l.</hi> 2 <hi>cap</hi> 4. <hi>de Jure nat. ac Gent. juxta discipl.

There's no more an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to a custom of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the one then in the other, bu a narration of what happened to them by Gods providence, which the Apostle interprets as signs to them of the same thing that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and the Lords supper are to us Christians. And therefore I conceive that the Scripture doth not make the customary use of baptizing Proselytes by the <hi>Jews</hi> as a thing from God, or eyed by Christ as his pattern, but that the custom of baptizing proselytes was a tradition of the Elders as the baptisms mentioned <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 3, 4. and many other things they held. Nor do I think it true that the customary use of the <hi>Jews</hi> in baptizing proselytes and their children, was the pattern of Christs institution of baptism, and the Apostles and first Churches practise. For according to the custom of the <hi>Jews</hi> set down out of Maimony and other <hi>Jewish</hi> Rabbins by Mr. <hi>Selden l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Jure natur. ac gent. &amp;c. cap.</hi> 4 <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de syned.

Whereas not onely <hi>John Baptist,</hi> but also the Apostles both before, and after the ascension of Christ did baptize <hi>Jews</hi> as well as Gentiles upon their profession of repentance and faith in Christ, as being agreeable to Christs institution <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. 2. Christ would not have avouched the baptism of <hi>John</hi> to be from Heaven, and not from men, if it had been in imitation of and conformity to the <hi>Jewish</hi> custom. 3. It is likely some where or other some intimation would have been given of that custom as the Directory for Christians in the use of baptism. 4. The institution and practise would have been conformable to it. But the contrary appears. 1. In their baptizing no infants of the Gentiles at their first conversion: whereas the <hi>Iews</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed onely the Gentiles infants at their first proselyting, not the infants of those who were baptized in infancy. <hi>Selden l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Iure nat. &amp;c. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>sed vero, non aliter at<expan>

a Proselyte. 7. <hi>A</hi> woman proselyte was placed in the water unto the neck by women which baptized her, while the three <hi>Israelites</hi> stood after the manner observing the baptism, yet they were to turn away their faces, and go away when the woman came out of the water. 8. Elder Gentiles were made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes according to their own choice, younger as males before thirteen years and a day old, females before twelve and a day old according to the minde of their father or the court to which they were subject were admitted to Judaism. The same right was of a natural foole. Yet if a person under years when baptized did after as soon as he came to age renounce Judaism, then he lost what privilege he had by baptism either by assent of the parent or the court. 9. The baptism did give them interest in the policy of the <hi>Iews</hi> as other <hi>Israelites,</hi> except some things peculiarly reserved to natural <hi>Israelites.</hi> 10. Yet a servant without his Masters consent was not made free. 11. A blessing was to be used at baptism, but unless he were made free, not by the servant, but by the master. 12. A young one as an infant, whether taken or found, the <hi>Israelite</hi> that possessed it might baptize it, either into the state of an ingenuous person, or freed person, or a servant. 13. They taught that a person baptized was so born again, that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his own natural sister was no incest. 14 If the person be privily baptized, though before two, yet he was not counted a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte.

So that if the baptism of Proselytes among the <hi>Iews</hi> be the patern of Christian baptism, baptizing of women must be by women, no one single Bishop or Presbyter must baptize, but three at least, there must be no private baptism, no baptizing in Fonts or Basons, no baptism without the whole body be washed, and so as that no filth or scab hinder the water from coming to the skin, there should be no infants baptized but at the first conversion of the parent, no <hi>Iew</hi> should be baptized, none baptized in the night, on the Sabbath, or other Feast-day. In most of which Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, and the Apostles varied from the <hi>Iews,</hi> and therefore they took not their baptism for their patern, and if they did not make the <hi>Jews</hi> baptism their patern in baptizing, neither are we to do so, but to follow the rule of Christs institution, and the Apostles practice,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:100457:155"/>
and not the <hi>Iews</hi> use, which is not delivered in Scripture, and much of it according to the superstition and dotages of their Rabbins, and was not a meet religious Sacrament, but a kinde of mixt rite partly religious, and partly civil, intitling to Civil as well as Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical right, and done by persons Civil rather than Ecclesiastical, and so of a far different nature and use from the Christian baptism. I think Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> were he a Bishop would censure such ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing as the <hi>Iews</hi> used as irregular, and then he may well bear with Antipaedobaptists, though they reject his new conceit of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Iewish</hi> baptism our patern, and thereupon grounding the baptizing of infants. Himself in his <hi>Practical Catechism lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. allows of sprinkling, though the <hi>Iewish</hi> custome was dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, yea they so precisely require it, that it was not counted ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, except the whole body were washed, and yet the Doctor confesseth, <hi>that by Christs appointment the baptized was to be dipt in water,</hi> i. e. <hi>according to the primitive ancient custom to be put under water, and the words [I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost]</hi> he sayth, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Christ prescribed to his Disciples must indispensably be used.</hi> So that when the Doctor pleaseth, the <hi>Jewish</hi> custom must be the patern, and when he likes it not, or the Bishops Canons other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise order it, he may vary from it: in one thing which Christ did not prescribe, as the Doctor sayth, nor did the Apostles that we finde so conceive it, yet Christs prescription must be indispensably used, yet in another thing though appointed by Christ, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the primitive ancient custom, a dispensation is allowed by the Doctor, because later custom varies from Christs appointment and the primitive ancient custom. Such a <hi>Lesbian</hi> leaden Rule the Doctor dictates by, fit for such as have resolved rather to forgo Christs appointment than the Bishops Canons. It is conceived Christ instituted the Lords Supper, somewhat like the <hi>Jews Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coenium</hi> after the Passover Shall then the <hi>Iews</hi> after-Supper be the patern to the Christians in the Lords Supper? If so, the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per must be in private, in the night, administred by the master of the house, no more to receive than were usually at the Passover, not many hundreds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. in the use of the Lords Supper, sets down what he received from the Lord, without mentioning the <hi>Iewish</hi> usage, which shews he would have
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:100457:155"/>
Christians in that rite keep to what Christ appointed, not what the <hi>Iews</hi> practiced. And should it not be so in baptism also? It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the use of laying on of hands in Ordination, and the term [Presbyters] were from the <hi>Iews:</hi> Must we then or may we take Rules from their practice in Ordination, and not ty our selves to the Apostles Canons and practice? One Presbyter or Doctor it's sayd, according to the ancient manner of the <hi>Iews,</hi> might create another, and sometime by an Epistle or Books an absent person might be created, as may be seen in <hi>Selden de Syned. Ebrae. vet. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14. Must these usages of theirs be a patern to Christians? The use of Excommunication came from the <hi>Iews</hi> discipline into the Christian, yet so as that the same manner &amp; effect was not retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in both, sayth the same Authorin the same book, <hi>c.</hi> 7. Out of all w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I infer that in the use of those rites which were taken from the <hi>Iews,</hi> and brought into the Christian discipline; yet our Rule accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which Christians are to observe those rites, is to be taken from the words and example of Christ and his Apostles, which I doubt not to make it appear do no whit serve for Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> purpose.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> in his <hi>Defence, p.</hi> 170, 171. thinks, <q>this to be a good Argument, that baptism belongs to infants as well as grown men, because, baptism being in use before as an Ecclesiastical rite, though it begun to be a Sacrament of divine institution when <hi>Iohn</hi> was sent to baptize into the name of Christ, there arespecial testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> which declare that infants both of <hi>Iews</hi> and Gentiles were thus admitted, the male children by Circumcision and baptism, the females by baptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> especially since there is not the least hint given in the word that when it was thus advanced to be a Sacrament it should not be applied to those persons to whom before it was, <hi>viz.</hi> infants as well as grown men.</q>

power to the Canons of Prelates about the Sacraments than is meet, being one who hath written in defence of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer Book, yet by this allegation of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. he seems tacitely to yield that if the words there include not infants under the <hi>discipled,</hi> then there is something in the New Testament, which excludes infants from baptism, although he say, <hi>Sect.</hi> 96. <hi>I do not believe or pretend that that Precept of Christ doth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily infer (though it do as little deny) that infants are to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized.</hi> But me thinks if the Doctor will stand to his own words elsewhere, he must acknowledg that by the precept of baptizing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. infants are excluded. For the Doctor sayth, <hi>Sect.</hi> 55. <q>Christs institution makes dipping or sprinkling with water a Sacrament; which institution is <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. and therefore the Doctor will have the words there indisp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nsably used in baptism; and <hi>Sect.</hi> 92. he sayth, Baptism is a Sacrament, that Sacrament an institution of Christ that institution not founded in any reason of immutable truth, but onely in the positive will of Christ, and so that there is nothing considerable in this question, (or any of this nature) but how it was delivered by Christ. And <hi>Sect.</hi> 94. that which was done by the Apostles, if it were not a Rule for ever, yet was an effect of such a Rule formerly given by Christ, and interpretable by this practice to be so.</q> And <hi>Practical Catech. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. he expounding Christs institution, sayth, <hi>that the words import that the person baptized acknowledgeth, maketh profession of believing in three, delivers himself to three, as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of his faith, and to be ruled by the direction of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and this he will have to be meant by baptizing into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit:</hi> Whence I infer, that if baptism be a Sacrament, and made so by Christs institution, and that institution founded onely in his positive will, and the will of Christ be that baptism be into the name of the Trinity, and this is when the baptized makes profession of believing in three, to be ruled by them, and the Apostles practice interprets Christs rule; no infant that doth not profess faith is baptized into the name of the Trinity, nor was appointed to be baptized by Christ, nor did the Apostles baptize them, and therefore they are not baptized accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christs institution, and so no Sacrament to them. Yea, if the positive will of Christ be the reason of baptism, they usurp upon
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:100457:157"/>
Christs prerogative, who baptize otherwise than Christ hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; then if the precept of Christ doth not necessarily infer infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptsm (which the Doctor ingenuously acknowledgeth) it doth by manifest consequence deny it, sith he forbids that to be done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise han he hath appointed, when he hath determin'd how it should be done. The Doctor when he sayth above, <hi>the words [I baptize into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost] must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably used;</hi> me thinks by the same reason should conceive Christs institution should be unalterably used in baptizing those onely whom he hath appointed to be baptized. But let us consider what shift the Doctor makes to elude the force of Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. that it may not be thought to exclude infants from baptism. I grant that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is best rendred [<hi>make Disciples</hi>] and like it well, that he acknowledgeth [<hi>makes Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and baptizeth, John</hi> 4. 1.] <hi>is all one with [making Disciples, baptizing them, Matth.</hi> 28. 19.] But I deny, 1. that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is well paraphrased by [<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into Discipleship all Nations, baptizing them in the Name, &amp;c. making this form of baptism their ceremony of receiving them</hi>] For by it the making Disciples is made the same with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving into Discipleship or receiving Disciples, and baptism the ceremony of receiving into Discipleship, which is as truly the act of the baptized thereby professing or avouching his Discipleship. 2. <hi>That the making or receiving Discipleship supposeth not any precedent instruction, but looks wholly on it as subsequent.</hi> For 1. that which in <hi>Matthew</hi> is expressed by, <hi>Go ye therefore and make Disciples all Nations,</hi> is in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature;</hi> which shews how they should disciple all Nations. Now they who are made Disciples by preaching the Gospel are made Disciples by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent instruction. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the making or receiving Disciples <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. supposeth precedent instruction. 2. Such as the making Disciples was <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 1. such is the making Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. For by the Doctors confession <hi>they are all one.</hi> But that was by preaching, as is plain concerning <hi>Iohn, Matth.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 5, 6. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Apostles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Whence, 3. I further argue, That way the Apostles were to disciple all Nations by which they were to disciple the lost sheep of the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> but that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100457:157"/>
was by preaching, <hi>Ergo,</hi> discipling supposeth precedent instruction. 4. From the use and notation of the word, which is so to teach as that they learn, and so is used <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 52. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is rendred [<hi>instructed</hi>] by our last Translators, and can be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise rendred than [made a Disciple by teaching] So <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 21. it is sayd, <hi>Having preacht the Gospel to that City,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>having taught</hi> or <hi>made many Disciples.</hi> Whence, 5. it may appear how the Apostles understood the Precept of Christ to preach the Gospel to persons, and thereby make them Disciples. 6. A Disciple and a believer appear to be the same by comparing <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. with <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. For as the way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Disciples is more fully expressed by <hi>preaching the Gospel;</hi> so the Disciple to be baptized is expressed by [<hi>the believer</hi>] which is put before baptism. Nor is it against this that after baptism they are to be taught, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. For that teaching is expressed to be <hi>the teaching the observation of all that he commanded:</hi> But the teaching that makes Disciples is the preaching the Gospel. So that the plain order and meaning of Christs words is this, that 1. the Apostles should not stay onely within the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> but go into all the World. 2. That they should by preaching the Gospel, declaring that Jesus was the Christ, make them Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that is, taught concerning Christ, or believers in him. 3. That they should baptize them. 4. That they should then teach them to observe all his commands. Now infants are not made Disciples by preaching the Gospel, therefore by Christs insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution not appointed to be baptized, and therefore are baptized without his warrant, and consequently unlawfully.</p>
            <p>What Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> sayth <hi>sect.</hi> 26. were it all granted him, yet it would no whit avail to prove that an infant may be a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple appointed by Christ to be baptized. For let putting to school be as early as the Doctor will imagine, yet none is put to school till he doth know his Teacher, and so none is Christs Disciple in the Scripture-language till he know Jesus to be Christ, and take him for his Lord, which infants being not capable of, they are not Disciples, nor to be baptized according to Christs appointment. What he adds <hi>s.</hi> 27, 28. is not right. For 1. it is not true, that <hi>a Disciple and a Proselyte are perfectly all one.</hi> For a Proselyte notes one that is by birth an alien from the Common-wealth of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100457:158"/>
               <hi>Israel,</hi> and comes to the <hi>Israelites</hi> to own their God, and be part of their policy, not to be taught but to enjoy privileges with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jews,</hi> whether Civil or Ecclesiastical. There is no mention of the Disciples of the Priests, but of the Pharisees and Sadduces: But a Disciple of Christ is one that owns Christ for his Teacher and Lord onely for spiritual benifits. Nor doth the Holy Ghost at any time call Christians Christs proselytes but his Disciples, that we might not confound the notions of these terms. And though the origination of the word [<hi>proselyte</hi>] be from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to come to,</hi> and Christ saith, <hi>Suffer little children to come to me,</hi> and this infers their capacity of proselytism, and the next words [<hi>For of such is the Kingdom of God</hi>] suppose them particularly qualified for it, yet that coming and imagined pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elytism being onely for ablessing by prayer, and laying on of hands, not to be made Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or baptized, this will not prove them capable of being made Disciples according to Christs appointment till by hearing the Gospel they own Christ as their Master. The like may be said of <hi>the entering into Covenant, Deut.</hi> 29. 10. which though in some sense it should be yielded, that infants may enter into Covenant, that is, by their parents act engaging them under a curse or oath to own God as theirs, in which sense the posterity then unborn did enter into Covenant, <hi>v.</hi> 15. yet this is insufficient to prove, that such an entering into Covenant makes infants Disciples or subjects of baptism according to Christs appointment. For in it such a discipling is injoyned as is by Preaching the Gospel, and they onely are Disciples to be baptized who are believers, and they onely are appointed to be baptized who in their own persons do enter into Covenant, or engage themselves to be Christs followers.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> neither from 1 Cor. 7. 14. nor from Sayings of Ancients proves that the Apostles baptized infants.</p>
            </argument>

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100457:158"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. in which he imagines is a remain and footstep of the Apostles practice of baptizing infants.</q> 2. The practice of the first and purest Ages of the Church, which received infants to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, and either by so doing testifie the Apostolical usage transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by them, or else affirm, that they received it by tradition from the Apostles. <q>In both which how he is mistaken remains to be shewed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>First he sets down this, which he cais <hi>A brief Paraphrase,</hi> though it be too large for a Paraphrase, and takes in more than he can with any colour shew to have any thing in the Text answering to it. His words of Paraphrase of 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. 12, 13, 14. are these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. <hi>If any Christian Husband hath an heathen Wife, and she be desirous to continue with him, he ought not to put her away, unbelief being no sufficient cause of Divorce by the Law of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. <hi>And so in like manner, for the Christian Wife that is married to an Infidel, if he be desirous to live with her, let her by no means separate from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. <hi>For (beside the command of Christ, Matth.</hi> 5. 32. <hi>which obligeth to this) other advantages there are of the believers living with the unbeleiver, worth considering. For by this means it hath oft come to pass that the unbelieving party hath been brought to the faith by the company and conversation of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; and considering the efficacy of good example,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>and seasonable exhortation and instruction on presumption of the great zeal (and consequent endeavours and diligence) that by the Law of Christianity the Husband will have to the eternal good of any so near him, as a Wife is, there is great reason of hope that still it may be so, that their living together may produce this effect in the unbeliever, and the intuition of that (more than possible) ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect may reasonably move the Christian party not to forsake the other voluntarily. And this one consideration,</hi> viz. <hi>the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that the conversation of the believer</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>should gain,</hi> i. e. <hi>bring the unbeliever to the faith, and the reasonable presumption that it will be so, is the reason why the young children of Christians, which cannot as yet be deemed believers, are yet admitted to baptism, because by their living in the family with</hi>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:100457:159"/>
               <hi>Christian parents they probably, and by the obligation lying on the parents ought to be brought up in the faith, and kept from heathen pollutions, and the Church requiring and receiving promise from the parents) doth reasonably presume they will. And upon this ground it is, that though the children of Christians are, yet the children of heathens are not admitted to baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> This Paraphrase is many ways faulty, and far from the meaning of the Apostle. 1. It puts in many things as explicatory of the Text, to which there is nothing answerable in the Apostles words. For, 1. there is nothing that answers to [<hi>by this means it hath oft come to pass</hi>] Nor, 2. to these words [<hi>by the company and conversation of the believer</hi>] yea the term [<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi>] is quite omitted by the Apostle, which considering the term [<hi>unbeliever</hi>] twice expressed seems to have been done wittingly, that it might not be taken, that he ascribed the sanctification to the faith of the one party. Surely when men specially in Arguments place the force of a reason in a term they use not to omit it, as the Apostle doth here, but to express it remarkably, and with <hi>Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.</hi> 3. All the words [<hi>and considering the efficacy of good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>and seasonable exhortation and instruction on presumption of the great zeal (and consequent endeavours and diligence) that by the Laws of Christianity the Husband will have to the eternal good of any so near to him as a Wife is, there is great reason of hope that it still may be so, that their living to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether may produce this effect in the unbeliever, and the intuition of that (more than possibly) effect, may reasonably move the Christian party not to forsake the other voluntarily</hi>] <hi>are added without any thing in the least intimated</hi> by the words of the Text, but the contrary, even according to his exposition, who makes the term [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>sanctified</hi>] <hi>refer to some past known Examples,</hi> and therfore the forepart of the verse hath not at all that which answers to [<hi>on presumption, &amp;c. there is great reason of hope, &amp;c.</hi>] which import a contingent event for the future, not a thing past, which is always certain. 4. The term [<hi>young children of Christians which cannot as yet be deemed believers</hi>] is more and otherwise than is in the Text, which hath onely [<hi>your children</hi>] which is not restrained to infancy, nor doth it appear, that [<hi>your</hi>] doth imply they were considered as Christians, so as that there should be this
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:100457:159"/>
construction [<hi>your children are holy, because they are children of Christians</hi>] distinguishingly from infidels, but [<hi>your children</hi>] that is, the children of you that doubt, who have had unbelieving hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and wives, and have had or may have children by them. So that the term [<hi>your</hi>] onely notes the particularity and individuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the persons, and if considered in any respect besides, it is their doubting condition, or their having unbelieving yoke-fellows. 5. There is nothing to answer those words [<hi>because by their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the family with Christian parents they probably, and by the obligation lying on the parents ought to be brought up in the faith, and kept from heathen pollutions, (and the Church requiring and receiving promise from the parents) doth reasonably presume they will</hi>] 6. Nor is there any thing answering to these words [<hi>your children</hi>] which his own Paraphrase applies to Christians children. So that the Doctors Paraphrase is beyond measure cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in respect of addition.</p>
            <p>2. It is blameable also in omitting that which the Text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly and emphatically mentions, to wit, the terms [<hi>Wife, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>] when he sayth, [<hi>the unbelieving party hath been brought to the faith by the company and conversation of the believer,</hi> and after, <hi>the probability that the conversation of the believer should bring the unbeliever to the faith</hi>] which may be meant of a companion, brother, father, mother, neighbour. 3. There is much faultiness in quite altering the importance of the Apostles words, by substituting instead of <hi>were or should be</hi>] in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles words [<hi>ought to be, they will be</hi>] in the Paraphrase. Which is the more blameable in that himself <hi>Sect.</hi> 82 <hi>pag.</hi> 257. doth more truly retain the force of those expressions in the Apostle, when he sayth, [<hi>The method of the Apostle must needs be this, unless there were, &amp;c. '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>would certainly follow that their children were unclean</hi>] so that the pretended brief Paraphrase of the Apostles words is very faulty, far from the Rule of a Paraphrase, and instead of explaining doth quite pervert the meaning of the words.</p>
            <p>2. For many other reasons the exposition of the Doctor cannot be right. For 1. In his paraphrase of the Apostles resolution <hi>v.</hi> 12. he puts [<hi>ought</hi>] and of <hi>v.</hi> 13. [<hi>let her by no means</hi>] as if the Apostle did make it a necessary duty, that they must continue
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100457:160"/>
together, whereas the Apostle answerably to their doubt doth onely resolve them of the lawfulness of their continuing together, not of the necessity of it, and so <hi>v.</hi> 14. is a reason of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it notwithstanding their doubt, which appears from the resolution <hi>v.</hi> 15. [<hi>If the unbeliever will depart let him depart</hi>] which cannot be expounded otherwise than thus, you are not bound to stay as you are not bound to cause her to depart or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish him, you are at your liberty. For the very next words [<hi>a Brother or Sister is not under bondage in such cases</hi>] do shew that the resolution was of liberty, not of duty, contrary to the Doctors paraphrase. Now that resolution <hi>v.</hi> 15. is of the same form with his determination <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. 2. He makes the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be of a duty <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. yet makes <hi>v.</hi> 14. to be a motive of the will, when he saith, [<hi>may reasonably move</hi>] as if the Apostle were not deciding a doubt, but perswading the will, and that from such a thing as cannot be reason of duty or liberty, but as it is by him expounded a perswasive to win on the affections, not to settle the judgment, and yet <hi>p.</hi> 207. he saith, [<hi>the unbeliever having been sanctified by the believer is used as an argument why they should live together.</hi>] 3. He puts [<hi>unbelieving Husband v.</hi> 14.] as if he were another than he that is mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 13. for <hi>v.</hi> 13. the unbelieving husband was at that present an unbeliever: But accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his sense expounding <hi>v.</hi> 14. thus, [<hi>it hath oft come to pass that the unbelieving party hath been brought to the faith by the company and conversation of the believer</hi>] the unbelleving hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band must be meant of one that was once an unbeliever, not so then. Now then the Apostle should after this exposition give a reason why the present believing wife need not leave her husband, because another unbelieving husband by another believing wife hath been brought to the faith. Which wherein it could tend to any satisfaction for them that doubted whether they might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully live together because of the present unbelief of the yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow I see not. 4. Such a reason will appear the more unlikely to be satisfactory, because as it hath often happened that the unbeliever hath been won by the wife, so it hath often happened to the contrary, and it is likely the persons whom he resolved had complained, that they had small hopes of their husbands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and so the reason of their living together from experience
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100457:160"/>
would be more likely to be retorted back thus, You perswde us to live together, you tell us we may, because it often comes to pass that the unbeliever is brought to the faith: But our experience is to the contrary, we see many not converted, and our own are obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and hardned, and therefore this reason doth disswade us, and resolve us that we may not live with him. 5. Hence another exception is against this exposition, that it makes the Apostle to resolve them of their duty or liberty by that which was a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent event which might be or not be. For this exposition makes the reason of their living together to be from what had hapened &amp; might be: whereas a contingent event is impertinent to that end, to say, we may lawfully do such a thing, because its likely such a good effect may follow. A contingent event is unfit to resolve of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of a thing without some other rule, things being unlawfull or lawfull not according to disagreement from or agreement to Gods will of purpose what shall be, but his will of Command what he requires to be omitted or done. Besides this contingent event here was uncertain as appears <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>what knowest thou?</hi> implies, thou canst not tell whether thou shalt save thy husband? Perhaps thou mayst. Nor doth the Apostle mention any promise it should be so, but mentions it onely as a contingent event that might be or not be. 6. Besides it is from such an event as is impertinent to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of living together. For the past conversion of others and the future conversion of our own yoke-fellows is meerly extrinsecal to our duty or liberty, though it be much to our conveniency, and therefore it is fitly urged <hi>v.</hi> 16. after the resolution of the judgment <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14 15. Is there any shew of reason why I should live with my own unbelieving husband, because anothers unbelieving husband was converted by her, or because there is great reason of hope it will be so with mine? This would intimate that future events make our present state or acts lawfull or unlawfull, which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like the <hi>Turks</hi> conceit who judged, that pleaseth God which succeeds prosperously,<note place="margin">

According to this Exposition, <hi>v.</hi> 14. should be the same Argument with <hi>v.</hi> 16. and so there should be an unnecessary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:100457:161"/>
of the same Argument. 8. By this exposition the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of an unbeliever should be ascribed to a woman, whereas (though I deny not that she is said <hi>to save, v.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Ye are sanctifyed by the Spirit of our God.</hi> 9. The word [<hi>holy</hi>] is expounded in a sense no where else found, nor is there any reason of that sense by way of allusion or otherwise given by the Doctor, though according to him a known fact is expressed which had another appellation used commonly even in that Epistle, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. 13. For he expounds [<hi>holy</hi>] by [<hi>are admitted to baptism</hi>] and so makes the Apostle in narration of a fact to use a term to express what was in his conceit well known to them by a term not imagined to note the thing elsewhere, when there was another term [<hi>baptized</hi>] used in the same Epistle and familiar to them. 10. He makes the Apostle to infer the lawfulness or duty of living together from that contingent event, which might with like probability be brought to pass by another than the believing yoke-fellow, even by the endeavour of a Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, Companion, especially a Preacher of the Gospel. So that if this reason were of force to conclude husband and wife might live together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one may bring the other to the faith, the reason might be as good for Father and Daughter, Son and Mother, Brother and Sister, Companions, Preacher and people to couple or live together, because it hath been and there is great reason to hope one may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the other. 11. According to his exposition the Apostles speeches were not right. For according to him the meaning should be unless there were cohabiting, and there had been an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing husband brought to the faith by the wife, and <hi>vice versa</hi> the <hi>Corinthians</hi> children could not reasonably be presumed to be admitted to baptism. 2. Upon this ground that an unbelieving husband was brought to the faith by the wife and <hi>vice versa,</hi> and there is great reason it might be so for the future the children of believing <hi>Corinthians</hi> unequally matched were admitted to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism. Himself <hi>pag.</hi> 257. saith. <hi>This must needs be the method of the Apostles arguing, unless there were some hope, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of a believer should be a means to bring an unbeliever to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>that is not admitted to baptism.</hi> Now I think all Paedobaptists will disclaim as manifestly false this proposition, That the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Corinthians</hi> young children were not or could not be, or it could not be reasonably presumed they should be admitted to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, till the unbelieving yoke-fellow were converted, or without hopes or reasonable presumption, that he might be won to the faith by the believer. It is such a toy as I cannot imagine they will own when they discern it. If they do they must quite change their plea and practise about infant baptism, their plea being from the imagined federal holines of the childe of one believer without consideration of the others present or future faith, and their practise being to baptize infants of one believer, though the other parent died or should die in professed unbelief. And for the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position it is a like false, that whether <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, note as much as <hi>hoc. posito, upon this ground</hi> as the Doctor expresseth it, or to be an Adverb of time noting when their children were holy it is most false, that upon the ground of hopes of cohabiting and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the unbelieving, yoke-fellow, and experience of what happened, the <hi>Corinthian</hi> believers yonger children no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> deemed yet believers, were admitted to baptism, or were reasonably presumed to be admitted, or that they were then admitted to baptism when the unbelieving husband was converted, or likely to be converted by the believing wife and not before. This proposition I make no question other paedobaptists will disclaim, nor need I any other proof against his sense than his own words against another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation brought in as the Anabaptists, though I know none that so interpret it. I use his own words <hi>pag.</hi> 257. <hi>sect.</hi> 82. <hi>muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis mutandis. Now I demand of this pretended interpretation, whether it be possible</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls argument should conclude in this sense? Suppose</hi> the <hi>Corinthian</hi> parents of these younger children <hi>had been one a believer, and the other an unbeliever, could it of them be concluded, if they did not upon the hope of doing good one upon the other cohabit, their children could not be</hi> holy by designation of the Church in baptism, to which when they are brought by the congregation and admitted by the Minister they are thus consecrated and devoted to God? <hi>This were absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confine the Churches designations</hi> to holiness and the Ministers admissions thereto <hi>to none but the children of believers, as if the</hi>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:100457:162"/>
               <hi>childe of parents</hi> whereof one is a believer were not thus holy, and admitted to baptism without experience of what hath been done in converting the unbeliever by the believer, and hopes it should be so. <hi>It is known</hi> that admission to baptism depends upon Chrsts institution, <hi>not upon such accidental conditions as is the cohabiting of the parents,</hi> the experience of the converting some unbeliever by the believing yoke-fellow, and hopes so of theirs. 12.

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Paraphrase expresseth it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> should signifie not onely that an unbelieving husband hath been sanctified, but also that there is hope they will, and so it should note, not onely some example past, but also some to come, of which there can be a less reasonable account given than of putting it in the Present-tense in <hi>English.</hi>

So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Doctors conceit, yet there may be a very reasonable account given without understanding it of an Example of another person sanctified heretofore by another Wife, which is very far from the Apostles meaning, as I shew before.</p>

            <p>The Doctor adds, <hi>Sect.</hi> 33. <hi>Which being once yielded to be the true meaning of the first part, there will then be little reason to doubt but that this of the admission of the Christian children to baptism on this score, is the importance of the later part, that and no other being it, which exactly accords with the former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, and it being not imaginable, that this should be here added in that argumentative stile [<gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true the style is argumentative, and [<gap reason="foreign">

But that this exposition [<hi>else were your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unclean, that is, not admitted to baptism, but now they are holy, that is, admitted to Christian baptism</hi>] exactly accords with the former reasoning yielded, so as that the Doctors para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100457:165"/>
being once yielded to be the true meaning of the first part there will be little reason to doubt but that this, of the admission of the Christian children to baptism on this score is the importance of the later part, is so far from having any colour of truth, that in my apprehension the Doctors exposition makes the Apostles words <hi>Are nam sine calce, sand without lime,</hi> that is without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. For what shew of connexion is there in this consequence, <hi>If some other unbelieving yoke-fellow had not been converted by the faith, diligence and conversation of the believing party that then was, then the children of you who are believers, but begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or brought forth by one that yet is an unbeliever had not been admitted to Christian baptism in infancy: but now, that is upon this score that some former unbelieving yoke-fellows have been brought to the faith of Christ by the faith, conversation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the believer, they have been admitted to baptism?</hi> According to the tenour of this reasoning these propositions should be included in the Apostles argument. <hi>The children of a believing yoke-fellow who is joyned to an unbeliever had not been admitted to Christian baptism, if some other believing yoke-fellow had not been brought to the faith. The children of a believer by a unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving yoke-fellow have been admitted to Christian baptism by reason that it hath been usual that other believers have brought the unbeliever to the faith.</hi> Whence will follow. 1. That at the first conversion of a people, at whieh time there is no experiment of such events of the believing yoke-fellows bringing the infidel to the faith, then the infants of the believer were not admitted to Christian baptism: which is directly contrary to the <hi>Jewish</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing infants of proselytes, which is onely at first conversion, which yet the Doctor will have the patern of our Christian ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism. 2. That the Doctor derives a title to baptism of this believers infant children from the diligence and happy success which another believer hath had, which is a thing meerly extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal to the institution of baptism. For where did ever Christ say, Baptize those or their children who are yoke-fellows to unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, for some other believing yoke-fellows have had good success in converting their yoke-fellows to the faith? I can hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to call such reasoning <hi>à baculo ad angulum.</hi> On the other side, the Doctors exposition makes the children of the believer
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100457:166"/>
joyned to the unbeliever not capable of Christian baptism, if there had not been some experiment of a believer bringing to the faith the unbelieving yoke-fellow, and some hopes that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unbeliever would become a Christian by the diligence of the other yoke fellow, which would exclude the believers childe from baptism whose yoke-fellow is deceased in unbelief, and so the conversion of that person is hopeless. So that what ever pretences are made for infant-baptism, no children (according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors exposition) of a believer can be rightly baptized without proof of such experiment of the converting of the unbeleiving yoke-fellow by the believer; it would not suffice that the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be by a Minister, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this being rare and hard to prove, it will certainly make questionable, if not void most of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended infant baptisms that are. Confident I am that no Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist ancient or modern besides the Doctor ever asserted Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism on this score, which is the onely ground, if the Doctors exposition of the Apostle be right. The Ancients did admit to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism any ones childe whether Pagans or Believers being brought to them, as I shew in my <hi>Examen part.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 8.

               </gap> sanctifications, to intimate <hi>as if any kinde of sanctification of a part of the body though but by sprinkling with water were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism.</hi> It is a like abuse when Christ bids baptize, to sprinkle one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or pour water on the face as it would be, when he bids to eat, onely to chew in the mouth; or when he bids to drink, to wet the lips onely. But that to sprinkle is not to baptize, is elsewhere as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, <hi>Addition to the Apology, Sect.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>The Doctor goes on in his dictating way thus. <hi>Fourthly, it is known of the legal uncleannesses, contrary to those their sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that they were the cause of removing men from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, they that were so</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>unclean, might not partake of the privileges of the Temple, till they were washed and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, and that is proportionable also to the notion here given of it, that the Christian children are holy,</hi> i. e. <hi>not inherently, (they are not capable) but in the account of God and men capable of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the service of God, of being entered into the Church, into Covenant, which denominates men holy, (as the Gentiles as long as they were out of it were unclean and unholy, Acts</hi> 10.) <hi>now are they holy,</hi> i. e. <hi>it is the present practice of the Church, that Apostolical Church of S.</hi> Pauls <hi>time, to admit to baptism such infant-children of Parents of whom one is Christian, though not of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is sayd without proof, that the uncleanness excluding from the Tabernacle and sanctification restoring are proportionable to the notion here given of childrens being excluded or included in the Church. Why should <hi>Cornelius</hi> be counted out of the Church by God or men, when God sayth, <hi>He was a devout man, and one that feared God, with all his house, who gave much alms to the</hi>

               <hi>people, aend prayed to God always, Acts</hi> 10. 2. It's true, he was excluded from the familiar society of the <hi>Jews</hi> according to their superstition, and so unclean, but not accounted by God to be out of the Church, but in it. <hi>That Christians children are denied to be capable of holiness inherently,</hi> will not be granted him, much less his paraphrase on the words [<hi>now are they holy</hi>] i. e. <hi>it is the present practice of the Church that Apostolical Church of S.</hi> Pauls <hi>time to admit to baptism such infant children of parents, &amp;c.</hi> It will not stand with his own exposition, as hath been shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it makes the Apostle relate a matter of plain fact in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure terms. <hi>Augustin</hi> did disclaim this interpretation <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> gave another, and so did <hi>Tertullian de animâ, cap.</hi> 39. what he adds is frivolous. <hi>And to put all out of question, the aneient Fathers which certainly knew the sacred Dialect, call baptism sanctification. So</hi> Cyprian Epist. 59. Eum qui natus est bapt. zandum &amp; sanctificandum, <hi>He that is born must be baptized and sanctified; where baptizing is sanctifying of infants. So</hi> Greg. Nazian.

            </p>
            <p>For 1. That the Ancients of the third or fourth Century knew certainly the sacred Dialect especially the Latin Doctors, me thinks the Doctor should know them better than to assert it. He sure is not ignorant that in multitudes of things later writers do finde their many mistakes about the sacred Dialect, and how few of them had any skil in <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> the Doctor is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant I presume. 2. In this very thing if those Fathers certainly knew the sacred Dialect and from their use <hi>Paul</hi> must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, then the word [<hi>sanctified</hi>] not the word [<hi>holy</hi>] (for the Doctor doth not shew they used the word [<hi>holy</hi> for [<hi>baptized</hi>] but the word [<hi>sanctified</hi>]) must be 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. as much as [<hi>baptized</hi>] and then the sense is, The unbelieving husband is baptized by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is baptized by the husband, of the absurdity of which interpretation I need say no more.</p>
            <p>The Doctor proceeds <hi>sect.</hi> 37. thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>This passage than being</hi>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:100457:168"/>
               <hi>thus interpreted, is a clear proof of the point in hand. And were not this the importance of it there were no privilege imaginable, no sanctity, which could be attributed to the infants of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which would not belong to the infants of heathens also, which yet is here distinctly affirmed of the one and denied of the other by the Apostle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> How absurd the Doctors interpretation is hath been shewed before, yet were it granted him it would not be a clear proof for infant-baptism, unless [<hi>your children</hi>] were all one with [<hi>your infants</hi>] which will not be cleared till it be shewed that the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Christians had then no children but infants, or that he meant no other under that term then the infants. Which sure is not according to the <hi>Jewish</hi> pattern, in which they baptized Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes children if females under twelve, if males under thirteen, not according to their will, but of the Father or court to which they were subject, I add, if the Apostle should by [<hi>holy</hi>] understand a privilege where upon they were baptized he should conceive otherwise than the <hi>Jews</hi> did, who conceived all unclean, whom they baptized, till by baptism they cleansed them and made them holy. And for what he sayth <hi>that no privilege imaginable &amp;c.</hi> I answer, 1. By denying that the Apostle there attributes a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege or sanctity belonging to the infants of Christians, which would not belong to the infants of heathens. I have I conceive in the first part of this <hi>Review</hi> demonstrated the contrary against Mr. <hi>M</hi> Mr. <hi>B. &amp;c.</hi> 2. If there were a privilege attributed yet it might not be baptism. For. 1 That belonged according to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers opinion and practise to unbelievers children also, if they were brought as I shew <hi>examen part.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 7. 8, 2. There are other imagined privileges or sanctities belonging to them, as, by some real actual inward holiness, by others federal external holiness, by others holiness in hope and expectation.</p>
            <p>He goes on. <hi>And as this evidently concludes such a custom, known and acknowledged among Christians at that time: so it is directly the thing that the</hi> Jewish <hi>practise, in which Christ foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his institution, hath laid the foundation of, in baptizing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes and their children, and to which the primitive Church conformed. And so though that Judaical practise taken alone were not deemed any demonstrative evidence, that Christ thus</hi>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:100457:169"/>
               <hi>instituted his baptism for the Gentiles, yet being taken in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with this Testimony of the Apostolical practise, and the primitive usage it brings all the weight with it, which a Divine Testimony imexpreted by practise can afford, which is as great as any such matter can be capable of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is false <hi>that Christ founded his institution in the</hi> Jewish <hi>practise of baptizing proselytes and their children.</hi> If he had done so he would have bid the Apostles, baptize Disciples and their children as the <hi>Jews</hi> did. There is not any thing that is brought by the Doctor that proves it, yea if it were the minde of Chrst to baptize Disciples and their children, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes, it would utterly overthrow all use of baptism of water after the first conversion of Progenitors to be Christs Disciples, none but they and the children then born should be baptized, all Disciples and their infants which descended from the first baptized should not be baptized with water being clean or holy without baptism. For they baptized because they were unclean till bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, not because holy before. Nor did they baptize any of the posterity of the first baptized though born but a few moneths after their first baptism. So that this conceit of the Doctor would help much for the <hi>Socinian</hi> conceit, as if water-baptism belonged onely to the age of the Apostles. 2. It is false <hi>that there is any evidence in the Apostles words</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>of such a custom of baptizing Christians and their children as was among the</hi> Jews <hi>of baptizing the Preselytes and their infant's.</hi> Nor do I think ever any of the Fathers did interpret the Apostles words as this Doctor doth. <hi>Tertullians</hi> words in his Book <hi>de anima cap.</hi> 39. are not as the Doctor saith <hi>an exact parallel to the Apostles speech</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 14. as the Doctor renders and interprets it The terms <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didati sanctitatis</hi> or <hi>designati sanctitatis,</hi> or <hi>candidati side<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

this day, and in order thereto womens baptizing. The Protestant reformers who composed the <hi>Common Prayer Book,</hi> do appear to have had the like conceit, in that in the preface before publique baptism they use the old reason from <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. for infant-baptism, affirming <hi>infants to be regenerate, and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly saved dying baptized, allowing Midwives to baptize,</hi> till the words [<hi>lawfull Minister</hi>] were added in the Rubrick after the conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, where had not King <hi>James</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled them the Bishops had not yelded to that reformation; yet still they kept private baptism, with that ridiculous use of propounding the questions of repentance and faith to the infant, to which the sureties must answer in the childes behalf, with profession of the childes desire to be baptized into the faith recited, though the childe were then crying when the words were spoken; and for the sureties they had no desire to be baptized; and the Bishops and Presbyters requiring it would have censured them as Anabaptists had they indeed minded baptism according to Christs minde: which thing was a meer mockery, as <hi>Chamier</hi> calls it. Yet in the Rubrick it self in the Common prayer Book in the title of Publique baptism it is confessed that <hi>the Ancient custom was of baptizing onely at</hi> Easter <hi>and</hi> Whitsuntide, &amp; baptizing is acknowledged to have been by dipping: sprinkling or pouring water on the face I do conjecture by reports and such writings as I have seen, was most after the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at Hampton Court.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> himself in his <hi>Practic Catech. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 23. saith, <hi>All men were instructed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently in the foundamentals of faith before they were permitted to be baptized.</hi> And therefore for the present I shall put by the answering of the stale and rotten allegations out of the Fathers for infant-baptism brought by the Doctor, because having sayd so much in my <hi>Examen part.</hi> 1. and my <hi>Apology sect.</hi> 16. I presume those that are not willing to be deceived will not be swayed with Dr. <hi>Hammonds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ms. friends,</hi> or any other citations from them, some being of meer counterfeit Authors, as <hi>Justin Martyr, Pope Hyginus, Dionysius Areopagita, Athanasius,</hi> some suspected as <hi>Origens</hi> words, some misinterpreted as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> some the very Authors shew that they maintained infant-baptism but in the case of danger of death, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cyprian</hi> as he avouched infant-baptism, so he

did rebaptization, and that as from the Apostles. <hi>Augustin</hi> as he avouched infant-baptism by Apostolick tradition, so he did also infant-communion. But of these things if God will more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after if it appear necessary. This I take to be sufficient for the present to answer Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> new device which he vainly boasts <hi>to have all the weight that a Divine Testimony interpreted by practise can afford, and is as great as any such matter can be capable of.</hi>
