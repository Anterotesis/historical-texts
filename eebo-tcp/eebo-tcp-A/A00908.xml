            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>First we read that presently after the persecution of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian wherin our protomartyr saynt Alban with some others was put to death about the yeare of our Lord 286. the Christians that had liued before in woods and caues,<note place="margin">Cap. 7 &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This being donne, and the affayres of the Iland both spiritual, and temporal wel composed, saynt Bede sayth the holy Bishops had a prosperous returne, partly by their owne merits, &amp; partly by the intercession of blessed saynt Alban, whereby he geueth to vnderstand that such was their opinion according to the great deuotion they had shewed before to the blessed martyr.</p>
                     <p>It is also to be gathered playnly out of S.

the tyme of celebrating the feast of easter, the second in the manner of administring the sacrament of Baptisme, and the third in preaching the faith to the Saxons; all which the monkes of Bangor refused, vpon no better reason, then for that S. Augustine did not ryse to them when they came to the synod, condemning him therefore to be a proud man, notwithstanding that he had restored a blynd man to sight by his prayers in the presence of all the Bishops and clergy of Britany, who vndertooke to do the lyke in confirmation of their customes, but could not performe it.</p>

                        <hi>that no man can lay any other foundation, then that which is layed already; Iesus Christ</hi>; which place, our aduersaries are wont to obiect against this our Catholyk doctrin; whereas they may learne not only in the Fathers,<note place="margin">Concil.

                     <p>Hereby it appeareth that although our sauiour Christ be the cheefe and principal foundation, that is to say the head of his churche, yet by buylding the same vpon S.

                        </gap>rinsecally from the very grounds and principles of nature it selfe, that their can be no perfect religion nor good common welth without it.</p>
                     <p>For as for religion whereas the special office and end therof is to acknowledge by external acts the seruice and subiection wee owe to our Lord and creator, and the dominion he hath ouer vs, it is manifest that no external act of religion doth so fully and conueniently expresse and signify the same as sacrifice, wherby wee gratefully offer to almighty God his owne creatures, not only rendring him part of his owne gifts, and yeilding him thankes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but also destroying them in his honour, to testify as wel that he is souuerayn Lord of lyfe and death, as that we hold our beeing and all wee haue of him, and depend wholy of his wil and prouidence, yea and that we owe our owne lyfe to him in sacrifice and doe as it were redeeme the same with the death or destruction of an other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; in signification wherof,<note place="margin">Euseb. de praep. eua lib. 1. cap.</note> he which in the old law did present to the priest any beast to be sacrifised, did hold him by the head, wheron the priest did also lay his hands, to shew that it was offred as a price <hi>pro capite,</hi> for the head or lyfe of him, that made the oblation.</p>
                     <p>Therfore for as much as this kynd of worship is the greatest &amp; most proper testimony we can externaly yeild, of vassellage and seruitude to our creator, it cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice of his right be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to any creature whatsoeuer, in which respect it is caused by the deuynes <hi>latria</hi> as due to God alone and for that cause not only the deuil (that seeketh to robbe almighty God of his glory) but also such men as haue made themselues to be held for Gods, traue euer affected this kynd of woorship as the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghest and most due to diuinity.<note place="margin">Aug. li. eo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aduersat. gis.</note> Seeing then sacrifice is most essential to religion, and a most proper and principal act therof, it followeth that there can be no perfect reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without priesthood and sacrifice for which cause

                     <p>And for the furder explication of this question it is to bee considered, that although the sacrifice of the Crosse was a most absolute and perfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>summation of all sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices whatsoeuer, and a ful redemption and satisfaction for the sinnes of the world, yet neuerthelesse it cannot be sayd properly to haue distinguished the old testament from the new, for that it was as I may tearme it, a certayne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and transcendent good; indifferent to both states and testaments, whereto all sacrifices as wel of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the law of Moyses, had a relation, as now also the sacrifice of the Churche hath in the law of grace, yet with this difference, as S.

Augustin, <hi>signa pro rebus ipsis nescientes quo referrentur, taking the figures or signes of things, for the thinges themselues not knowing whither they were to be referred,</hi> and therfore S. Paul proueth that this absolut perfection which they ascrybed to their sacrifices, could not be found in the priesthood &amp; sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices according to the order of Aaron but in the sacrifice &amp; priesthood according to the order of Melchisedech, which he declareth by euident arguments grounded vpon the vnity and excellency as wel of the priest, and host or sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as of the act of oblation, shewing the infirmity of the priests by their mortality, plurality and continual necessity to offer dayly, first for their owne sinnes, and after for other mennes, whereas in the other of Melchisedech, he sayth, there was a priest, that is to say our Sauiour Christ, who had an eternal priesthood, and therfore needed no successor, and being vnpolluted and without sinne had no neede to offer sacrifice for himselfe, and so was more fit and worthy to obtayne pardon for the sinnes of the people; and as for the hosts or sacrifices he sheweth also the infirmity
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2393:61"/>
thereof, for that they were but only of brute beasts, and in that respect could not be of that infinit valew, that was requisit for an absolute and general redemption, whereas the sacrifice in the priesthood of Melchisedech was of infinit price, being the body of our Sauiour offred voluntarily by himselfe, who was both the sacrifice, &amp; the priest. Lastly he proueth also the insufficiency of the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> by the continual and dayly oblation therof, for that sayth he, yf they could haue made perfect such as offred them, <hi>cessassent offerri, there would haue ben an end of offring them,</hi> for <hi>vbi est peccatorum remissio, i am no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est oblatio propeccatis, where there is remission of sinnes, there needeth no oblation for sinne.</hi> But our Sauiour by his sacrifice vpon the crosse, <hi>vnica oblatione consummauit in aeternum sanctificatos,</hi>

                     <p>Thus argued S.

Paule doth not impugne by these arguments any sacrifice whatsoeuer, but only the sacrifices of the the priesthood of Aaron, neither yet he impugneth those in such sence that he denyeth them to be true sacrifices, but only proueth by the infirmity thereof, and of the priests that offred them, that they could not suffice for the perfect sanctification, and iustification of man, nor for the general redemption of the world, to which purpose he sayth of the priesthood of Aaron, <hi>if there were,</hi> sayth he,<note place="margin">Heb. cap. 7.</note>

                     <p>The first is that, which at the first I vndertook to proue, to wit, that the oblation of the blessed body and blood of our Sauiour Iesus Christ (which wee caul the Masse) ys the proper sacrifice of the new testament, prophesied by Malachias, prefigured by the sacrifice of Melchisedech, promised, instituted and offred, by our Sauiour, practised
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2393:65"/>
by his Apostles, and by the Churche euer since.</p>
                     <p>The second is, that it is propitiatory not only for the liuing but also for the dead.</p>
                     <p>The third, that the heretykes of this tyme that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict &amp; abolish the same, hold not the law of the new Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament instituted by Christ, seing they haue not the proper priesthood and sacrifice therof, without the which the sayd law and Testament cannot be, S. Paule teaching such a necessary concurrence of the one with the other, that he affirmeth, that <hi>the priesthood being translated the law must also of necessity be translated</hi> as I haue shewed before,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.</note> therfore seeing they haue not this priesthood and sacrifice, it followith they haue not the law and Testament of Christ, which can not be without the same.</p>
                     <p>The fourth poynt that followeth of the premisses, is that they are most pernicious enemies of humainkind, seing they labour to depriue vs, of the most souerain remedy that God of his infinit goodnes hath left vs for the reparation of our dayly wracks by sinne, and for the consolation both of the quick and the dead; for which cause the old Christians in the persecutions vnder Dioclesian, being persecuted for hearing masse, as wee are now (as I haue shewed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this treatise) answered the tyrants that the masse was <hi>spes salus que Christiantum, the hope and health, or sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of Christians,</hi>

                     <p>But what needeth it? seing they cannot proue that any Pope, I wil not say from S. Eleutherius to S. Gregory, but from S.

                  <head>AN ADVERTIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT TO THE READER ABOVT A FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER ANSWERE OF M. M. Ar.</head>
                  <p>AFter I had set downe to my self this defence or Apologie in the forme that here it goeth, there came to my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des a certayne breif pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet writen in Rome by M. Mar. Ar. presentlie vpon the execution of Squier in England, which confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thoughe for the substance of the matter it seemed to me very sufficient to giue any man satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by shewing the whole matter of Squyers accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, and execution to be a very fiction and deuised for certayne endes which there are touched; yet thought I not amisse to let this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie passe also as it was made, partly for that it conteyneth my owne particuler defence which the other toucheth not, but hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the whole action in general, and partly also for that the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of both our proceedings is different, he shewing the whole subiect and argument to be a fayned thing, and I that albeit some occasion had byn geuen of suspition yet the forme of proceeding against Squyer &amp; the rest to be vniust &amp; against all reason, equitie, law, and conscience.</p>
                  <p>M. Mar. Ar. to proue his intent layeth downe the historical narration of all the whole matter and men touched in the same, to wit how Squyer and Rolles were taken vpon the sea and brought prisoners to Siuil, and had their liberty there by Father Parsons meanes, and how afterwards geuing newe occasion of offence in matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were taken agayne at S. Lucars, &amp; brought back to Siuil, and there agayne after certayne monethes impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, deliuered out of prison &amp; put in different Monasteryes for to be instructed, whence they fled away to the sea syde, and
<pb facs="tcp:2393:77"/>
excused their flight afterwards by letters to Father Walpoole that was most in daunger by that flight which letters are yet extant.</p>
                  <p>It sheweth also the improbability of the deuise, to wit, that Father Walpoole (being the man he is) should euer haue thought of such a fond way of sending poyson into England by such a fellow as Squyer was, suspected stil to be a dissembled protestant, as afterwards he proued, and that thing could not be wrought, nor the poyson caryed so farre but that Rolles his compagnion must know somewhat thereof, who being at that present in the Towre of London, and neither brought foorth, nor mentioned, nor yet made partaker of the fact, was a token that matters went not wel, nor were directly handled.</p>
                  <p>Besides this that book declareth by many examples the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of Protestants in these our dayes for making Catholykes odious, especially Iesuites of which order Father Walpoole is, who was fayned to be the contriuer of this conspiracy which is shewed to be as farre from the condition of the man, as the matter it self is from all probability of truth, to wit, any such poyson to be made, bought and sold in Siuil proued by the death of a dog, sent into England by sea in bladders of leather, poured vpon the Quenes Sadle, as also vpon the chayre of the Earle of Essex without hurt to the sitter or ryder, the matter discouered by one Stanley, that neyther sawe Squyer in Spayne, nor spoke with him, and it was denyed by Squyer first at the barre, and after at his death, and since his death called in dowt by Stanley his first detector, (as by some hath byn written from the place where he abydeth) the force also of that poyson (yf any such had byn) is declared by reasons and authoritie both of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick and Philosophie that it could not worke any such effect as was ymagined, or pretended, &amp; consequentlie that those applauses &amp; congratulations both by woords, sighs, &amp; teares which a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of flatterers shewed foorth at Squyers arraynment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for her Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> so miraculous escape was most ridiculous and vayne.</p>
                  <p>This is the summe &amp; effect of that answere as breifly set downe, as I can gather it, and it maketh the fiction most euident to all such as without partiality wil read it, though I heare say that it may chance come out agayne more ample in a seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d edition, with many Autentical letters, as wel of the citty of Siuil, as of the courte of Inquisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that place, to shew the manner of Squyers and Rolles
<pb facs="tcp:2393:77"/>
running away from those partes with some other circumstances to improue the probabilitie of the deuised slander in England, which letters and instruments I thought not good to insert heere to my Apologie but to leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to M. Mar. Ar. now at his returne hither from Rome to ad to his former Answere if so he shal think good, for that he maketh mention thereof in the same, and as for this my defence (gentle reader I shal not need to aduise thee of the substance, manner, method, or argument therof, for that the breife chapters ensuing wil sufficiently setfoorth the same, only I would admonish thee to consider maturely with thy self how rhow mayest be vsed in matters of Religion which do most import thy soule and saluation, when in matters of fact and open action thow shalt fynd thy self so egregiously abused.</p>

                  <p>RIght honorable vnderstanding by common fame, confirmed by letters from Italy, Flanders, and France, that one Edward Squire, was lately condemned, and executed in England, for hauing attempted to poyson the Queenes Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> and my Lord of Essex by the instigation as was surmised of one Father VValpoole a Iesuite in Siuil, with the priuity &amp; consent of Father Creswel and my selfe, here in Madrid, I was (I assure your Lordships) at the first brute amased and much afflicted to heare that these good men so farre of in my conscience from such cogitations, and my self no lesse, were slaundered with matter so haynous, &amp; odious, and although I had re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The one was for that it is not only conuenient in respect of your place &amp; dignitie, as also of the duety I owe &amp; beare you, but also importeth for the preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of the inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce aforesaid, that I seek to satisfie your honours, before all others in whose hands principally resteth the satisfastion of her Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> &amp; the moderation of the rigour, or iniust persecution &amp; vexation which vpon this false conceyt may otherwayes be vsed against the innocents Catholyks of England, which haue neyther parte nor fault therin.</p>
                  <p>The other is for that persuading my selfe, that so fond a fiction, or rather so foule &amp; vnchristian a practyse te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to the spilling of guyltlesse blood in this acte, &amp; to the slaunder of innocent people both at home &amp; abroad, could not proceed from the body of a councel consisting of men so honnorable graue, &amp; wise, as your Lordships are presumed to be, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some inferiour persons of lesse consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; more desyrous of garboyles to whose examinations such causes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>THERE was red to the Iury the deposition of one Iohn Stallage alias Stanley who lately before was come from Spayne, and had affirmed that one day in my lodging in Madrid I enueighed against Squyre with great passion, and othes, saying that he had deceyued vs in not performing his promise, and that I feared we should be vtterly discredited with the King therby. Wherto I answere that I protest before God, and vpon my saluation, that I neuer said any such thing to Stanley in my lyfe, neyther is their any man (I suppose) that knoweth him and me, and both our qualities, behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and conditions, wil thinke it probable that I would vse such wordes before him if there had byn cause, or that so easely, and eagerlie I would fal to sweareing vpon the suddayne, which hath byn so farre of from all the rest of my former lyfe, as my acquaintance wil beare me witnesse. But to the end it may appeare to your honours what a substantial witnes he was, I craue your pacience, whyles I discourse of the sufficiency first of the man, and then of the matter by him alledged.</p>

                  <head>OF THE TESTIMONIE geuen by a priuie councelor. CHAP. VII.</head>
                  <p>IT is further reported heere that a priuie councelor being present at Squyres araygnme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t did witnesse that he had seene a letter which had passed betweene me, &amp; a kinsman of myne at Rome wherein we aduertised one the other, that although Squyre had not yet performed that which he promised, yet he continued his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do it when oportunity should serue.</p>
                  <p>Hereto for answere I do first make the same asseuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as before vpon my Saluation, that there neuer passed any letter betweene my kinsman and me concerning Squyre in any sence or to any purpose whatsoeuer, and that I think in my conscience my said kinsman neuer hard tel of him, nor so much as dreamed of him, or any matter of his in his lyfe except now by this occasion of his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution written from England.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I say that persuading my selfe that so great a councelor would not so litle respect his honour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb facs="tcp:2393:90"/>
as to forge of his owne head a matter so false and odious as this, and to affirme it in such an honorable and publyke assembly to the preiudice of any mannes lyfe and fame if he had seene no such letter in deed I must needes think that he was abused by some of his intelligencers or inferiour informers, who to make a shewe of their double diligence in such affayres did counterfet the sayd letter in my name or my cosens.</p>
                  <p>But howsoeuer that was, in this testimonie two thinges are to be considered, the one, the estate and qualitie of his person, the other the weight and valewe of the matter, which being weighed ioyntly may seeme not a litle to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice this cause, but considered a parte do nothing at all hurte the same.</p>

                  <p>This I am bold to intimate to your Lordships, not to blame the a foresaid wise and woorthy councelor (to whome I beare all due reuerence and respect) but to the end it may appeere that yf his autoritie &amp; dignitie, moued the Iury more then the weight of the matter which hee testified, as yt is lykely it did, it neither ought so to haue donne, neyther was it I am sure any parte of his honours meaning or desire that it should do, and thus much for his person.</p>
                  <p>As for the matter which he testified; I shal not need to spend many wordes therin, for that I am persuaded his honour did not speake as a witnesse, but by the way of discourse, seing that so farre as I vnderstand, he was not deposed and sworne, neyther yet the letter brought foorth and red in the court, nor proued to be a true and no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit letter, which I verely beleeue his honour wil not for all the good in the world, affirme vpon his credit, &amp; much lesse vpon his oth, as it had beene necessarie eyther he or some other should haue donne to make the same forcible in law, wherof I saw once the experience in an action of <hi>scandaelum magnaetum,</hi> in the Kinges bench, where a letter of the plaintiffes being presented by the defendant, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member M.

their furie vpon them without contradiction.</p>

                  <p>Then came they to declare how many wayes rebellions and tumultes had byn attempted by such kynd of people, as the excommunication of Pius Quintus, the hanging vp of it by M. Felton, the rysing in the North by the Earles of Northumberland and Westmerland, the late attempts of Doctor Sanders and others in Ireland, and when no end was made in amplifying &amp; exaggerating of these matters, the prisoners often tymes desyred that they would come to the perticuler poynts of the inditement and proue some particularities against any one of them of whom some said that nothing was alleadged but original sinne, &amp; the factes of others, some that they were very children when most of the matters alleadged did happen, some that they were of farre different places, states and conditions.</p>
                  <p>And when these accusers or rather declamers went stil forward to vrge the insurrections of other Catholykes against these that were present F. Campion among other thinges sayd, Sir, supposing that diuers men Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke in Religion hauing for the sayd Religion, or other causes taken sometymes armes (as of Protestants
<pb facs="tcp:2393:98"/>
also I thinke, no man can deny yt that considereth what hath passed in our dayes in Germanie, Fraunce, Flaunders and Scotland) yet what is this to any of vs heere at the barre, though we be of the same Religion, this doth not proue vs to be of the same action; yf a sheep were stolne and a whole familie called in question for the same were it a good manner of proceeding for the accusers to say your great grand fathers and fathers, and sisters and kynsfolke loued all mutton, ergo yow haue stolne the sheep, if yow wil proue any thing against vs M. Attorney and Solicitor yow must leaue your ranging speech &amp; come to say thow Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pion or thow Sherwyn, or thow such a one, hast done, or dealt, or committed this act.</p>
                  <p>This sayd that seruant of God, and to all indifferent men that were present his demaund seemed most iust and reasonable, but yet would yt not be hard for a great while, at last notwithstanding were brought in certayne witnesses whose names were Slead, Cradock, Munday, &amp; Eliot. The first had bene a seruing man in Rome and sayd he had heard by common report that some styrres were lyke to be shortlie in England; Cradock had byn a broken Merchant about Italie, and imprisoned in Rome for a spie and testified of one that to comfort him in prison should say, he has happie that he was foorth of England, seing yt was lyke that great troubles would ensewe there; Munday was a player of commedies, and had byn some fewe dayes in Roome, and could say litle or nothing at all; Eliot was a seruingman who hauing byn a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke before, but now in danger for stealing away a yong gentlewoman out of M. Ropers house, and for sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of a robery for which he and his frends were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to appeare at the next assyses) to get himself free, betrayed first his best and greatest frend M. Payne a Priest, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward took F. Campion and now came into iudgment, not to accuse any particuler man present of any matter of weight but to make them odious by relating a certayne
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2393:98"/>
fiction of his owne against M. Payne absent but in the tower whom he accused to haue told him of a deuise that had byn thought of to kyl her Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> in tyme of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse or hunting with fiftie armed men, which the other after vpon his death took to be most false.</p>
                  <p>Now then all these witnesses being brought in, and saying no more in effect them heer hath byn layd downe how insufficient there depositions were to condemne any one of his companie, and much lesse all and euery one of them together I referre me to the iudgement of any man that hath but common sence, for albeit we graunt that these witnesses were all honest men, (as it is euident they were lewd and infamous fellowes) what proued they against F. Campion or any of the reste there araygned? what particularities brought they of the conspiracie, and pretended inuasion as with what forces yt should be do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, what forreyn Princes had ben treated with all, and how or by whome the matter had beene negociated, &amp; by what meanes they at Rome conferred with them at Rhemes and how it came to passe that the conspiracie came to be held by so many seueral persons, and in such distant places at one tyme, as in the end of one moneth of May? no doubt for the condemnation of the prisoners, yt had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that yf not all, at least some of these particulars should haue beene proued, eyther against them all or at least against some one of them as yt is euident yt was not, for though we should graunt that some bodie had told Slead, or Cradock in Rome that there would be great styrres in England shortlie, what did that touch F. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion in particular or any of the rest?</p>
                  <p>And wheras one sayd that he had heard also at Rhemes of some such styrres lyke to ensew, what proued this against any of those that came from Rome, or yet against those that were come from Rhemes diuers yeares or monethes before or els afterward seing that there was at that tyme neare hand 200. English at Rhemes of whom it could
<pb facs="tcp:2393:99"/>
not be with any reason presumed that they were all priuie of the conspiracie, yf there had byn any such, and yf only some were priuie therof how did it appeare that those which were araygned were of that number seing the witnesses did not particulerlie charge any of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with?</p>
                  <p>Lastly he which testified that M. Payne the Priest, told him of a conspiracy of some Catholykes to kyl the Queene in a progresse what proued he against any of them at the barre, seing that M. Payne was none of their companie, and the matter altogither differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the other where vpon they were indited.</p>
                  <p>Was this then such playne and sufficient euidence as is necessarie in law for condemnation of a man in matter of lyfe and death, which euidence as before I haue shewed in Squyres case, ought to be as cleare as the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, not general but particuler, not of hearesay, but of assured, and certayne knowledge and testified by witnesses, auouching one and the self same particulers.</p>
                  <p>But what need I labour to ouerthrow their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by law seing it was cleare to all them that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at their araignme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts or deathes, that they were neyther all knowne one to an other, neyther yet to the witnesses themselues, before they were brought to the barre and that some of them were in England and some in other places, at the same tyme that they were supposed to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spired at Rome and Rhemes as diuers of them affirmed, and was by the othe of M.

                  <p>HAVING determined to speake no more of Squyres affayre but rather to haue ended with this that hath beene said, I receyued from a frend of myne a pamphlet printed in England by the deputies of Christopher Barker the Queenes printer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter and offence of Squire, intituled, A letter written out of England to an English gentleman remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at Padua, conteyning a true report of a strange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy &amp;c. the which pamphlet doth geue me occasion to enlarge my self somewhat further then I meant.</p>
                  <p>For although I hold the same to be sufficiently ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered as wel by that which I haue already discoursed in this Apology, as also by the foresaid treatise lately pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by our frend M. A. in confutation of the whole fiction, besydes that the pamphlet it self hauing neyther name of author nor priuiledge, nor licence for the printing may seeme rather to be reiected as an infamous libel, then held worthy of further answere; neuertheles considering that the Author therof taketh vpon him such particuler knowledge of all the proceedings in that matter, that he seemeth to be no ordinary person, but rather some one that had his hand in the pye, and agayne forasmuch as it may be thought that the Queenes printers, neyther would nor durst set foorth any such pamphlet touching her Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> &amp; the state, withoue the warrant of some man in authoritie, and lastly for that the Author therof amongst many fooles bolts that be hath shot therein, seemeth to haue leuelled
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2393:116"/>
one particularly at me, though he name me not, I haue thought good briefly to touch some points therof.</p>
                  <p>To come then to the matter,<note place="margin">Parts of the Pamphlet.</note> his discourse consisteth of 3. partes: the first, his declaration of Squyres confession, touching the particulers, as wel of the supposed conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, as also of the execution therof: the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of the discouery of it, the third this pamphletters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment and censure vpon the same, interposed, sometymes by the way of discourse.</p>
                  <p>In the first I only wish to be noted two notorious and impudent lyes, within the compasse often lynes auowed by him vpon his owne knowledge. The one that Squyres confession concerning the conspiracy was deliuered by himself, without torture, or shew of torture; the other that it was in no point retracted or disauowed, eyther at his tryal, or at his death, whereas all those that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereat, are witnesses of the contrary, and amongst many others some of your Lordships that assisted at his tryal may wel remember I am sure that he vrged a long tyme that his confession was extorted by torment, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he confessed the fact after vpon some persuasions and expectation perhaps of pardon, yet at his death when it imported him for his euerlasting good to discharge his conscience, he reuoked his said confession, not only disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowing the fact, and all intention therof, but also his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed employment by Father Walpoole, and when the shyrif vrged him with his confession made at seueral tymes, he answered in the hearing of all the assistants and lookers on, that he would as wel haue said any thing els in the world at that tyme to deliuer himself from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he endured, and being pressed to confesse at leaft his subornation, and employment by the Iesuit (for Father Walpoole was not otherwyes named there) he flatlie denyed it, and gaue a sufficient reason to cleare both himself and the father, saying that he ranne away from Seuil without the fathers knowledge, and that therfore it
<pb facs="tcp:2393:117"/>
might easely be iudged that he was not suborned nor sent by him.</p>
                  <p>And this I affirme as wel vpon diuers relations that I haue seene thereof in wryt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What then may I say of the impudency of this man that maketh no bones to put in print, yea and to affirme vpon his knowledge such a notablely, disprouable by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of so many hnndreths as were present as Squires death? wherto serueth all his exaggeratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the foulnesse of the fact, his opprobrious speeches against Father Walpoole his deuises of charmes, coniurations, enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, exorcismes, cyrcles, &amp; all his Sinons tale so smothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly framed, but to bewray both his vanitie and malice, seing he taketh delight and glorie in the vayne oftentation of his owne lying tongue to the slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der both of the quick and the dead,<note place="margin">Psalm. 11.</note> and therfore let him consider what the psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist sayth to him, &amp; such other calumniatours, Why doest thow glory in malice thow which art potent in iniquitie &amp;c. thow hast loued all woords of ruyne and destruction, thow which art a very tongue of tromperie, and deceit, &amp; therfore God wil destroy the finally, and pluck the vp and remoue the from thy tabernacle, and thy root from the land of the liuing.</p>

                  <p>Is it likely then, that we would take such a desperate resolution, only vpon a bare suspition?

                  <p>The second cause was the doctrine of your owne gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers in Q. Maryes tyme, who because some of their fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers were burnt for heresy (according to the Canons and lawes of the Churche) cryed out that they were persecuted, and published in their bookes and sermons, that faith ought to be free, and not forced, &amp; that therfore it was against all conscience to punish or trouble men for their religion, in which respect the authors of the change, that serued themselues of them in the ecclesiastical and pastoral dignityes, could not for shame at the very first, vse the bloody proceeding which afterwards they did, though neuerthelesse they forbore not in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to imprison, and otherwise to afflict, all Bishops and cheif pastours; and such others as would not subscribe, &amp; come to their Churches, for the which cause I remember that besydes a great number of ecclesiastical and temporal persons, some of my owne kindred and familie were called to London, and imprisoned in the second yeare of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties raigne, and so remayned prisoners many yeares after.</p>
                  <p>The third cause was the vayne hope that those polityks had that a religion so sensual, and ful of liberty as theirs, authorized with the power of the Prince, vpholden with lawes, promulgate with all artifice of writers preachers, and perswaders, would easely within a fewe yeares infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate

wherein yow may see a true pattron of your owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, for to exemplify the same with answere to the question yow aske concerning the temper of the lawes made in the 23. yere of her Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> raigne, what other cause had yow to make those lawes in that yeare, but that yow knew that Father Campian and diuers Seminary Priests were come into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d lately before, &amp; therfore to make the world beleue that their comming was to no other end but to sow sedition, and trouble the State, yow did not only make those lawes, but also shamfully mundered the same yeare thesaid famous man, and 11. godly innocent Priests with him for fayned conspiracies proued against no one of them, &amp; disauowed by them all at their deathes, which sufficient proof of their innocency, as before I haue declared at large in the 11. chapter, besydes many other since made away in lyke manner vpon lyke fals pretences, and especially in the yeare 88. after the Kinges Armada had past through the channel, in which yeare yow exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted aboue 40. Priests, and Catholykes in diuers partes of England, to make the world beleeue that they had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the Spaniards or had procured the comming of thesaid Armada, which could not bee proued, nor so much as iustly suspected of anyone of them.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer I dare boldly affirme, neyther shal yow euer be able with truth to controle me, that wheras our Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries haue yeilded within these 30. yeares 5. or 6. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth Priests that haue laboured in that vyneyard (wherof yow haue put to death more then a hundreth) yow could neuer iustly charge any one of them with sedition or matter of state except it were Ballard executed with Babington and the rest,<note place="margin">Of Ballard.</note> whom as I wil not excuse, (because I know not how farre he waded in those matters) so wil I not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him, considering the proceedings of yow and your fellowes with Catholykes in lyke cases, yet this I wil be bold to say that if he had any dealing therin, it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent or knowledg of any of his superiours, yea
<pb facs="tcp:2393:124"/>
or of any intrinsecal frend of theirs, wherof I could yeild a sufficient reason, if it were conuenient.</p>
                  <p>But let vs admit that he was as deep in those matters as any of the rest; haue yow therfore any reason to condemne all other Seminary Priests for his act, I do not blame yow heer for punishing any Catholyke that yow should fynd to be truly seditious, but I fynd it strange, &amp; against all reason and iustice, that yow do not only punish vs for fayned crymes, but also impute the doings of one or of a few to all, which was alwayes in my tyme, and I think it stil, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd dealing of your lawyers in the araignment of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lykes vrging against them the attemptes of Doctor Sanders in Ireland, and Feltons setting vp of the Bul, and such like, as though euery Catholyke were priuie to their doings, or thought himself bound in conscience to do as they did, which kynd of argument your lawyers would neuer vse, if they were not eyther most malitious or ignorant, or thought all their audience to be fooles: For what conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion can be drawne from one or some particuler to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as to say, Eaton the preacher did pennance on, the Pillery in cheapsyde and after at Paules Crosse for lying with his daughter, such a minister was hanged for a rape, such an other for sod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>my, such a one for a murder; ergo, all ministers are mnrderers, sodomites, rauishers of women, and incestuous persons.</p>
                  <p>Would your ministers allow this conclusion, or els that lawes should be made against them all for the offence of some of them? and yet to say truly there haue beene so many examples of ministers conuict &amp; executed for such crymes that yow might with more, reason exterminate the whole ministery, as a very sink of sinne, then condemne all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholykes as seditious, for Doctor Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, and Feltons cause, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> all Seminary Priests for Ballards.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude this point, it is euident ynough, that neyther Ballards offence (yf he committed any) nor theirs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2393:124"/>
that were executed with him could be any occasion of those rigorous lawes against Seminary Priests which were made some yeares before, when (as I haue said) yow had not any one example of a Seminary man, that had beene, or could be touched with any sedition, other then such as yow fayned of them your selues.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore what iust cause had yow to make the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction in your lawes betwixt Queene Marie Priests,<note place="margin">Q. Marie. Priests.</note> &amp; Seminary Priests? haue yow found any more in the one then in the other, but only that yow know the old Priests of Queene Martyrs tyme were so spent and wasted already that ther was not left of them perhaps half a score in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland (who also yow thought would be in a short tyme consumed) wheras of the others, yow saw a continual spring, that would flow perpetually, to the vndouted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of your heresy in tyme, if it were not stopped, in which respect, yow thought good to seeme to fauour the first, that yow might with more shew of reason persecute the later.</p>
                  <p>Neuerthelesse yow haue hanged some of those Q. Marie Priests as wel as the other, only for doing their function counting them therin no lesse seditious then the Seminary Priests, and yet yow say yow spare the one sort as only superstitious, and punish the other as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious.</p>
                  <p>But such seditious and superstitious Priests as these are, were the very Apostles and Disciples of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">2. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IN your 10. and 11. page yow make a digression to treat of the strange mysteries as yow cal them of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits doctrin, how they mingle heauen and hel, and lift vp the hands of the subiects against the anointed of God, yow wonder that Princes do not concurre in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing them, who yow say make traffyck of their sacred lyues; yow compare them to pirats that are publyke enemies to humayne society, and to the Templars that were all put downe throughout Christendome within a few weekes, and lastly yow fynd it strange that the Bishop of Rome doth not purge out a leuen as yow cal them, so strange and odious.</p>
                  <p>These in deed are very strange and odious speeches, and no maruayle for there can be no more sympathy betwixt the Iesuits and yow then betwixt good and bad, light and darknes, Christ and Belial; it is no maruaile, that the theef hateth the gallowes, the dog the whip or the woolf the mastif, that keepes the flock, neyther that yow and all other heretyks maligne those, whose schooles are your scourge,<note place="margin">Of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits.</note> whose bookes your bane, whose vertue is your confusion, whose vigilance and industry is the gard simple foules against the assaults

                  <p>Can any man that is not mad or drunken with heresy as you seeme to be, or ouercome with passion perswade himself that so many wise pious, and polityk kinges, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, councels, magistrates, and gouernours (whose domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions extending from one pole to the other, do conteyne the noblest, and worthyest parts of humain society among
