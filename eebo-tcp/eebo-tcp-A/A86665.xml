         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The immediate Call to the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, witneſſed by the Spirit.</head>
            <p>WIth a true Declaration of the perſecution and ſuffering for the Goſpel, under the tyranny of the Mayor of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> which Goſpel of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whereever it was made manifeſt, the teſtimony of it was ever ſealed with bloud, perſecution and ſufferings, and it is the ſame now, working the ſame effect, and bearing the ſame ſeal, as is witneſſed.</p>
            <p>And alſo an anſwer to ſeveral falſe reproaches given forth in writing, in three Letters under the hand of <hi>Will Pickering</hi> Mayor of <hi>Cambridge:</hi> which herein is diſcovered and laid open, that ſo the truth may be cleared, and all Magiſtrates, Prieſts and People may diſcern truth from ſcandals, and that all ſimple hearts and minds may be informed to receive the truth freely, without ſtumbling at reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, through which the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and Servants of Jeſus Chriſt did bear witneſſe to the truth, <hi>Iſai. 51. 7. Heb.</hi> 11. 26. eſteeming the reproaches of Chriſt greater riches than the pleaſures of the world, and the Apoſtles were to goe forth to him without the Camp, bearing his reproach, <hi>Heb. 13. 13. If ye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye, for the Spirit of God, and of glory, reſteth upon you,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 14.</p>
            <p>From one whom the Lord, by his eternal Spirit, hath called to bear witneſſe to his Truth, and to his Word, and Goſpel, made manifeſt in me by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe life and converſation hath been blameleſſe in the world, whom no outward Law did ever take hold upon for evill doing, but was ſtrict and zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in an outward profeſſion of God and Chriſt, exceeding many in wiſdome and knowledge in the letter of the Scripture, and had a form of godlineſſe, but the power of it I was ignorant of, and was a ſtranger to the life of God, which the Saints lived in, which ſpoke forth the Scripture according to their meaſure, and the Word of God, which the Saints ſpoke from, I was ignorant of, though I knew the letter, and was a Miniſter of the letter before I knew the power of the Word of God; but when the living powerful Word of God was made manifeſt in me by his mighty power, then I was made ſilent from ſpeaking any thing of God from that knowledge and wiſdom, which was natural, and did ariſe out of the earth, in which ſtood my zeal, and profeſſion, and form of godlineſſe, which was all without, in words, and outward appearance, and outward righteouſneſſe, and outward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; the earthly nature ſtanding, which all outward profeſſion and forms lodge in: but when the Word of God by his mighty power was made manifeſt within me, ſpoken from his own mouth, which word was in my heart as a fire which did burn up corruption and uncleanneſſe, and work out the defiled nature, and by it was all the powers of the earth brought down, and the earth it ſelf ſhaken, by it the deviſs were made to tremble, and were caſt out, and in that day did the keepers of the houſe tremble, and the ſtrong man cry bitterly, and the juſt Judgements of God
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:167936:3"/>
did fall upon that nature I lived in, and the terrors and wrath of the Lord took hold upon me, till the fleſh was waſted off the bones, that I could number my bones day and night, the terrors of the Lord was upon me, revealed from heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſſe, againſt all my own rightcouſneſſe, and all my familiars and acquaintaince ſtood afarre off me, for I was a wonder to all them who lived in that nature that I had lived in, for they knew not the judgements of God againſt ſin, which then was upon me, becauſe of diſobedience to the light which did make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſin and evill; but hearing the Word of the Lord in power ſpoken within me, did confound all my wiſdome and knowledge, and made me to be a fool to the wiſdome of the world, and to deny the wiſdome, and to deny my ſelf, and my own will, and by this Word was I called to come out of my own country, kindred, and fathers houſe, to doe the Lords work, in obedience to his command, and to ſtand in his will out of my own will, for I knew the voice of God which called me; and for this cauſe did I leave father and mother, lands and living, earthly honour, and earthly riches, which I had, and might have lived in, if I had been diſobedient to the command of God, but the Lord called me forth by his mighty power to bear witneſſe to him in the world, and to declare and preach forth the Goſpel of the Son of God, according to my meaſure, as it was made manifeſt within me, and by his Word to declare againſt all ſin, and iniquity, and unrighteouſneſs of men, and in obedience to him who called me did I goe, as I was moved by his eternal Spirit, into ſeverall parts of this Nation, Townes, and Cities, and Countries, in the North and Weſt part of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> bearing teſtimony to the truth, and in ſome parts ſealing the teſtimony with my bloud, and by impriſonments, in perſecution, in perils, often under tryals of cruel mockings, ſcourgings, and revilings, enduring the contradiction of ſinners, and doe not account my life dear unto my ſelf, that I may render to the Lord a good accompt of my faithfulneſſe, in obedience to him who hath called me into his work, and vineyard, and this is all the wages that the Miniſters of the Goſpel receive from the world, being accounted as deceivers, yet true, as having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things, as poor, yet making many rich, <hi>The ſervant is not greater than his Lord, John</hi> 15. 20. who hath ſuffered the ſame things, and hath left a good example, and if it be the will of God that we ſuffer with him in the obedience to him, are we made willing, not onely unto bonds, but unto death, who doe now bear his reproach; and by the Spirit of the Lord was I mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in obedience to him, to come to this Town, where ſome did receive the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the truth, where I ſtayed certain dayes, and we had certain meetings pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly from houſe to houſe, and the hands of the perſecutors was then bound by the mighty power of God, and they limited from acting the perſecution which was in their hearts, which now they have acted ſo farre as their power doth reach, but the Sea muſt keep its bounds, and cannot break them. Then I paſſed forth of the Town, as I was moved of the Lord, to another people, till again I was moved to come into the Town, not knowing when I came in whether I ſhould ſtay two dayes in the Town, but waiting in the will of God, out of my own will, I came, as I was moved, and laboured in travel night and day in the Lords work and ſervice, to make the Goſpel of Chriſt without charge: And coming into the Town upon the 21 day of the ſix moneth at night, and lay at a friends houſe in the Town, and in the morning, as I went into the ſtreet in the market place, two men followed me, and commanded me to goe with them two before the Mayor, who when I came before him, came unto me, &amp; violently took off my hat &amp; threw it upon the ground
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:167936:3"/>
and asked me whence I came, and where I had lived, and of what calling I was, and what I came thither for? unto which I gave an accompt, and ſaid, that if I had broken any Law, or if any man can lay any thing to my charge, let them prove it, and act the Law upon me according to the offence, but none could prove any thing. Then the Mayor asked me, if I would goe out of the Town, elſe I ſhould be whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out. Then I anſwered, when the Lord calls me out I ſhall goe, for I ſtand in obedience to the will of God, not to the will of man, and if thou canſt prove any thing againſt me worthy of ſtripes, prove it, and act it upon me, but I have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no man, nor am I guilty of the breach of any Law. Then the Mayor ſaid, I have a Law againſt thee, I will make thee a wandering perſon, and a rogue; which I denied. Then the Mayor wrote a paper to ſend me to priſon, and then read it unto me, which was full of lies; which I denied. Then he wrote another, which I denied like wiſe: Then I ſaid unto him, make not lies thy Law, but write that which is true; and then he threw by that, and wrote another. Then I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord to ſay theſe words unto him, Thou that makes lawes in thy own will, contrary to the Law of God, the plagues of God is thy portion. Then the Mayor anſwered, now I have a Law againſt thee, thou curſes me, and ſaid to them that ſtood by, if any of you will but take your oath that he hath curſed, we have a Law to puniſh him; but none took their oath. Then I anſwered and ſaid, look in the Law what curſing is, if thou canſt prove it to be a curſe by the Law, is the Scripture language a curſe? Then he bid me hold my tongue, for he could not endure to hear me, and ſaid, that I ſhould either pay 3 <hi>s. 4 d</hi> or ſit three houres in the ſtocks: I anſwered, firſt prove the Law broken; but he being in a rage, ſent me to the ſtocks for three houres, and then ſent me to the dungeon: And upon the next day, being the third day of the week, one friend coming out of the North, who came to ſee me, and had travelled 300 miles before he came to me, lying but one night in the Town at that time, as he was coming in the morning to the priſon to ſee me, one Conſtable took him in the ſtreet, and had him before the Mayor, he giving no offence at all, the Mayor fell a beating of him, calling him a wandering rogue, and preſently made a Mittimus and ſent him to the dungeon, commanding that none ſhould come at him, though no offence was proved againſt him, and there conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the ſeventh day of the week; then being ſet free by a Warrant, according to law, we came into the Town, and upon the firſt day of the week, being met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to wait upon the Lord, the Mayor ſent two Conſtables with a Warrant to bring us two before him, that we might be ſent out of the Town, as was expreſſed in the Warrant; the Conſtables having ſerved the Warrant, Juſtice <hi>Blackley</hi> coming in at the ſame time, did ſhow them an Act which they had broken, and ſo had broken the Law; and the Conſtables then went away, and did proſecute the Warrant no further at that time: the next day in the morning one Conſtable and the Jayler came to the houſe where I lay, and commanded me to goe with them to the Mayor; and when I came before him, having nothing againſt me, asked me, if I would goe out of the Town? I anſwered, when the Lord calls me out I ſhall go, for I ſtand in the will of God, not in the will of man. The Mayor ſaid, thou doſt not follow the examples of the Apoſtles, for when they were perſecuted in one City they fled into another, but we cannot get thee out by no meanes; and ſo owned himſelf to be of the ſame generation that perſecuted the Apoſtles. I anſwer, I have done no wrong, no guile, nor violence to any man, nor broken any Law, if thou haſt any Law againſt me, read the Law unto me, and if I have wronged any man, I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:167936:4"/>
ſhall make reſtitution four fold, according to the Law of God, but proving none. The Mayor ſaid, this is the Law, thou ſhalt chuſe three things: Firſt, whether thou wilt quietly depart out of the Town: Or ſecondly, go to priſon, and be kept cloſe, that none ſhall come at thee, nor have any thing but what thou earnes to lie upon: Or thirdly, to be whipped and ſent out of the Town.</p>
            <p>And here let all people conſider how contrary he acts to the Law of the Nation, for if by the Law he could prove me to be a rogue, or guilty of any other breach of the Law, then here he breaks the Law himſelf, in giving me liberty to goe away without any puniſhment according to the offence: and again, here he hath broken the Law, &amp; acts contrary to it, in impriſoning me, &amp; putting me in the dungeon, having no Law againſt me, but becauſe I will not goe away out of the Town when he doth command me to goe; and here all people may ſee, that he who pretends to be a Miniſter of the Law, hath impriſoned me contrary to the Law. And again, there is no Law in the Nation that offereth theſe three conditions unto rogues; as either to depart quietly out of the Town, or be impriſoned, or whipped; let all who know the Law judge: And ſo contrary to the Law of God, and the Law of the Nation, doe I, and others of the Servants of the Lord, ſuffer, under a law made in the will of man; as one <hi>Ann Blacklain</hi> hath been kept in priſon above three months for declaring againſt the deceipts of a Prieſt publickly in the Steeple-houſe: And <hi>James Parnell</hi> hath been kept in priſon almoſt three months, and is now put into the dungeon, for ſetting up of a paper publickly in the market place, that thereby both Prieſt and people might ſee the truth cleared, and their deceipts diſcovered, that ſo coming to own the truth of God, they might keep the peace, which all the world hath broken by diſobedience to the light of Chriſt, in the conſcience, and ſo for declaring the truth, and publiſhing it forth in writing publickly, is impriſoned, and no breach of the Law proved againſt him; and ſo they both remain in priſon under this pretence, of bringing in ſureties for good behaviour, when as they are not guilty, nor no miſ-behaviour proved againſt them, but all who ſuffer as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in the obedience to the will of God, need not be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>And under the ſame tyranny and law, made in the will of man, doe I now ſuffer, onely becauſe that at the command of <hi>Will. Pickering</hi> Mayor of <hi>Cambridge</hi> I did not goe out of the Town to fulfill his will, and ſo have diſobeyed the command of the Lord, did he ſend me to the dungeon, and commanded the Jaylor that none ſhould be ſuffered to come to me, nor bring any thing unto me, nor that I ſhould have any thing but what I earned: and ſince I was firſt caſt into this hole, there is ſeverall reproaches, and <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and falſe accuſations caſt upon me and the reſt of my brethren; and I am not ſuffered to have my accuſors face to face, that the law may take hold upon the guilty, and that the truth might be cleared, and my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſors known, for ſince I was firſt put into this place, there are three ſeveral papers of lies and ſlanders publiſhed forth by <hi>Will. Pickering</hi> Mayor, under his own hand, the firſt dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> 23. the ſecond <hi>Aug.</hi> 28. the third <hi>Aug.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>1. Accuſation. <hi>That we are idle wandering perſons, and rogues, living upon poor ſilly people, which ſome of them are now kept by the pariſh themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, this Accuſation is falſe, for from the Lord are we ſent, to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all deceipt and unrighteouſneſſe of men, and againſt all thoſe who lay heavie burthens upon the poor by deceipt and oppreſſion, and againſt all who live in pride, and idleneſſe and fulneſſe of bread, by whom the creation is devoured, and many made poor by your meanes, and you who are rich, who live at eaſe, and in pleaſure,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:167936:4"/>
you live upon the labours of the poor, and lay heavie burthens upon them, grievous to be born, and you may the poor complain of, but they who doe receive our teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony there is the heavie burthens taken off, and the poor is caſed, and whoſoever do receive the truth in the love of it, which we freely declare from the Lord, and hath this worlds good, he cannot ſee the poor in need, nor want, nor beg their bread, but the truth where it is received opens the bowels of compaſſion, and takes off oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and the heavie burthen which the poor groans under, but we are not chargeable, nor our Goſpel, not to the rich, nor to the poor, neither doth any who have received us complain, nor is chargeable to the pariſh, is neither kept nor maintained by it. Therefore in the preſence of the living God I doe charge thee to ceaſe from falſly accuſing the innocent, who can neither prove us to be rogues nor deceivers, as the fruit of our miniſtery ſhall bear witneſſe in them who have received it, who can witneſſe, that they are led out of much deceipt and ungodlineſſe which before they lived in, and we have not been burthenſome nor chargeable unto them through idleneſſe, God is our witneſſe, we have coveted no mans gold, nor ſilver, nor meat, nor drink, nor apparell; and here we are falſly accuſed for the Name of Chriſt, and for the Goſpel ſake, which we freely doe declare as we have freely received it.</p>
            <p>2. Accuſation. The Mayor ſaith, <hi>that the Law makes idle wandering perſons to be rogues, thoſe that will not work if they have not any thing of their own to live upon, thoſe that uſe deceipt full wayes to get maintenance by, theſe by the Laws of the Land are all rogues, and ſuch are theſe in my judgement, and in my ſoul and conſcience I am trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that I have done no more to them then I have done, to rid the Town of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, here thou haſt ſhewed thy judgement, and made it manifeſt, that this perſecuting will is thy law, and haſt acted contrary, which thou haſt here declared to be the Law of the Land concerning rogues, who doth keep us here in priſon, in the dungeon, under the pretence of rogues, and hath not proved any of theſe things againſt us, which thou ſayeſt makes rogues, not to be idle wandering perſons, nor haſt not proved us to have nothing of our own to live upon, nor haſt not proved that we have uſed any deceiptful wayes to get maintenance by, and here by the Lawes of the Land we are cleared, who are not guilty of any of thoſe things, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d ſo the Lawes of the Land will take hold upon thee and all our accuſers, who hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned us for rogues, when there is no witneſſe againſt us to prove the breach of any Law of the Land, for by the Law of juſtice and equity we deſire to be judged.</p>
            <p>And thou who ſayeſt, in thy ſoul and conſcience thou art troubled that thou haſt done no more to us then thou haſt done, that in thy conſcience ſhall witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee for what thou haſt already done, and will let thee ſee, that thou haſt acted contrary to that in the conſcience, the light of Chriſt, and that in thy conſcience will condemn thee, and haſt acted contrary to the Law of the Land, as by that in thy conſcience thou ſhalt be judged, which will let thee ſee, that thou art not a doer of the Law of God, nor a Miniſter of the Law of the Nation, but a maker of lawes according to thy judgements, and acting them upon the righteous, whom the Law was not made for, that thou mayeſt rid the Town of thoſe who come to witneſſe the Law of God to be fulfilled in them, and to eſtabliſh righteouſneſſe in the earth, and to bring people from under the tranſgreſſion of all Lawes, to witneſſe one Law giver, Jeſus Chriſt who is our Law giver.</p>
            <p>3 Accuſation. The Mayor ſaith, <hi>that one of us told him when he deſired him to goe out of the Town, that he would not, for he was ſent to deſtroy the Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, this Accuſation is falſe, for there was not ſuch a word ſpoken, neither
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:167936:5"/>
can any ſuch thing be proved, for we came not to deſtroy men lives, but to ſaye them, and to preach Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour of the world, and doe ſpeak from the Lord to that in the conſcience of every one, the light of Chriſt, which will let every one in particular ſee, that his deſtruction is of himſelf, and by the light of Chriſt, unto which we are made manifeſt in every mans conſcience, are we cleared from all ſuch ſlanders and reproaches, which are falſly caſt upon us for the Name of Chriſt, who was reproached as we are, and his reproaches we bear daily, and are not aſhamed of, as the Scripture ſaith, which by us is witneſſed daily; and the Laws of the Land, being executed in juſtice and equity, will take hold upon our accuſers, and clear us.</p>
            <p>4. Accuſation. <hi>That we have left our honeſt Callings, one being a Husbandman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant, and another a Shooemaker, and now living upon the labours of other men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, we are in our Callings whereunto the Lord hath called us, and doe abide in our Calling, and he that doth abide in his Calling abides with God, and this I witneſſe, who am called from father and mother, lands and livings, and from the cutward imployment which I lived honeſtly in, but was never ſervant to any man in that Calling, that accuſation is falſe; and my call is to the work of the Lord, to labour in his vineyard, who once had a vineyard without to labour in, as you have, who live in your earthly poſſeſſions and habitations, and that calling was lawfull in its place, and I did abide in it till the Word of the Lord came and called me from it into his work, who now cares for me, and provides for me, without taking thought or care what to eat, or what to drink, or wherewith to be clothed, for after all theſe things doe the heathens ſeek, who knowes not God, and my call is from God immediately, not from man, and in the Scripture I have a cloud of witneſſes: who were all called by God, and left their callings: <hi>Eliſha</hi> was called from the plough as he was following the plough, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 10. and <hi>David</hi> was called from keeping the ſheep, who was a Shepherd, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 11, 12. and by the Word of the Lord was <hi>Jeremiah</hi> called to be a Prophet, who ſaid, he was a child, and could not ſpeak, but the Lord ſaid, that he would put his Word in his mouth, and that he ſhould goe whitherſoever the Lord commanded him, and that he ſhould not fear the faces of men, for he would deliver him, and that he ſhould ſpeak whatſoever he commanded him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And by the ſame Word was <hi>Amos</hi> called, as he was following the flock, who was a herdſmand, and a gatherer of Sicamore fruit, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 14, 15, 16 And the Apoſtles were fiſher-men, and tradeſ-men, and <hi>Paul</hi> a Tentmaker, &amp; <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:167936:5"/>
by the Lord, and in obedience to him do come, them you command to goe cut of the Town to follow their callings again, and ſo by the ſame Law command the Prophets to their callings again, and the Apoſtles to their netts again, and <hi>Paul</hi> to make Tents again, and <hi>Mathew</hi> to the receipt of Cuſtomes again, which they were all called from; but <hi>Amos</hi> did not goe to <hi>Bethell</hi> to be a herdſman, but to declare the Word of the Lord; nor the Apoſtles did not goe to fiſh, and to their netts again to get their living, but they were made fiſhers of men: And were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted from City to City, and threatned, and ſtraitly charged to ſpeak no more in that Name, and to depart their Coaſts, as I am commanded to depart from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> to teach in my own Country; but they obeyed God rather than man, and were not idle wandering rogues, though they had left their lawfull callings, and had no certain dwelling place, but did goe whitherſoever the Lord commanded them, to preach the Goſpel to every creature, and to all nations, and took no thought what to eat, or what to drink, nor wherewith to be cloathed, and did eat no mans bread for nought; and the ſame I witneſſe; and the Prophets, nor the Apoſtles, when they were put into priſons and dungeons, you doe not read, that they were forced to work to fulfill the will of their perſecutors, nor that ever <hi>Paul,</hi> nor the reſt of the Apoſtles, nor Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, when they were caſt into priſon, or dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that for the teſtimony of Jeſus, that ever they were charged or commanded to beat hemp, or elſe not eat, as the Task-maſter of <hi>Cambridge</hi> doth command, but their labour and work was to beget into the truth, and ſome were begotten in their bonds, as <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſed in the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon, 10. verſ.</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffered trouble, as an evill doer, even unto bonds, but the Word of God was not bound, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. This is a faithful ſaying, <hi>If we ſuffer with him we ſhall alſo raign with him, if we deny him, he alſo will deny us:</hi> And for his ſake, who hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me, doe I ſuffer all things, and endure all things, and am not aſhamed of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but in obedience to the will of God, doe I deny the will of man, and ſuffer by the will of man, God is my witneſſe, and my conſcience alſo bearing me witneſſe in the preſence of God.</p>
            <p>And this of the Lord I was moved to publiſh forth, that the truth may be cleared from ſcandals, and the perſecution and tyranny of unreaſonable men made manifeſt to all ſorts of people, who come to ſee, and to read with underſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and here have cleared my conſcience, being free from the guilt of the bloud of all men, and have laid theſin to the charge, and to the door of thoſe who are guilty.</p>

               <p>AS for my coming before thee, it was by thy Authority, for I was in a friends houſe, called Juſtice <hi>Blackley,</hi> and there was a man, called a Conſtable, in a ſhop over againſt the houſe, waiting for my coming forth, and as I was going over the way, with ſome writings in my hand which concerned the truth of God, the Conſtable, ſo called, came and met me, and told me I muſt goe with him, and I ſaid, if he had authority I ſhould goe with him, and he ſaid he had; and ſo in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Authority I went along, and he brought me before thee, and thou came violently and took off my hat, and caſt it upon the earth, calling me rogue, and other ſuch like termes, which was in thy will, and not in thy law, and therefore thou art not fit to be a Magiſtrate, for he that is guided by his own will is not fit to be a Magiſtrate, for he makes his will a law, and the law is not to be made by the will of man; and then thou came and cauſed my pockets to be ſearched, and thou took my writings from me, and ſaid, there might be ſome treaſon in them, and I ſaid, if there was any thing under the Law, let me ſuffer by the Law; and thou came vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently once or twice as if thou wouldeſt have ſmote me, calling me rogue, and witch, and the like; and I ſaid, if thou couldeſt prove me either a rogue, or a witch, let me ſuffer as a rogue or a witch; but whether this be in thy law or no, I know not, ſo I ſhall leave it to thoſe who knowes the Law to judge of it; but I am ſure it is contrary to the Law of God, and ſo to that thou art a tranſgreſſour, and by him thou muſt be judged: And then thou asked me, why I came to the Town to make diviſion: And I ſaid, Chriſt came for the ſame, to ſet at variance father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſon, and ſon againſt father, as the Scripture makes it appear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 35. and I witneſſethe ſame fulfilled, and this thou ſets as an article againſt me. Now let any one conſider, if thou wouldeſt not impriſoned Chriſt if he was perſonally here, but in as much as thou doeſt it to one of his, thou doeſt it to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25, 45.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:167936:6"/>
and here thou haſt manifeſted thy ſelf to be a Tyrant, who impriſons the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt for confeſſing him, who begins the warre whereſoever he comes, his firſt appearance is with the ſword to that which is for the ſword, and bring peace and deliverance to the captives, and to lead captivity captive, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 8. and this we witneſſe fulfilled, and for this end are we come to the Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which is one of the devils ſtrongeſt holds, from whence he ſends forth his meſſengers into the world to deceive the Nations, but the Lord is come to beat up his quarters, and now the warre is begun, and the devil hath caſt ſome of us into priſon, but ſtill the warre goeth on, and the Lamb will get the victory, and the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, and all that have the mark of the Beaſt, muſt be caſt into the lake that burneth, &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 10, to the end. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20.</p>
