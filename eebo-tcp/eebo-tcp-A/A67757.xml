            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot to admonish our brother is to hate him,</hi> as the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>
witnesseth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. But to scorn our brother should
admonish us, is more to hate our selves. That little which
<hi>Cresus</hi> learned of <hi>Solon,</hi> saved his life. And had <hi>Pilate</hi>
taken that fair warning, his wife gave him: it might have
saved his soul; which once lost, cannot be redeemed
with ten thousand worlds: no not with the enduring of ten thousand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years torments in <hi>Hell.</hi> When a <hi>Dog</hi> flies in his masters face that
keeps him; we conclude he is mad; are they then rationall men, that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
never so little crost) will <hi>fly</hi> in their <hi>Makers face,</hi> and <hi>teare</hi> their <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
name</hi> in peeces, with oaths and execrations? which is worse then
Frenzie. Yea, this is to send challenges into Heaven, and make love to
destruction! And certainly it is <hi>Gods</hi> unspeakable mercy, that every such
oath &amp; blasphemy, proves not a <hi>Benoni,</hi> the death of the mother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 18.</p>
               <p>ยง. 2. Think me not too bold, or over harsh: for I speak to you both
<hi>for</hi> and <hi>from</hi> my <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Redeemer.</hi> Yea, be perswaded to hearken a
while unto me, as you would have <hi>God</hi> another day, hearken unto you.
Are you <hi>Christians,</hi> as you call your selves? if you be, you have at least
heard what <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> hath done for us. How when we were in a sad
<hi>condition;</hi> when by sin we had forfeited our selves and all we had, and
wilfully plunged our <hi>souls</hi> and <hi>bodyes</hi> into eternall torments: When nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>heaven, earth,</hi> nor <hi>hell</hi> could have yeelded any satisfactory thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<hi>Christ,</hi> that could have satisfied <hi>Gods</hi> justice, and merited <hi>heaven</hi> for
us; then, O then! The <hi>eternall God</hi> would dye, <hi>viz.</hi> so far as was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or necessary, that we might not dye eternally, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. A mercy
bestowed, and a way found out, that may astonish all the sons of <hi>men</hi> on
earth, and <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>heaven.</hi> And all this even against our wils, when we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41868:2"/>
were his enemies, mortally hating him, and to our utmost fighting against
him, and taking part with his only enemies (<hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi>) as now you
doe, not having the least thought, or desire of reconcilement: but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
and obstinate will, to resist all means tending thereunto.</p>
               <p>3. ยง O my brethren! bethink your selves; It is his <hi>maintenance</hi> we
take, and live on. The <hi>air</hi> we breath, the <hi>earth</hi> we tread on, the <hi>fire</hi> that
warms us, the <hi>water</hi> that cools and cleanseth us, the <hi>cloaths</hi> that cover
us, the <hi>food</hi> that does nourish us, the <hi>delights</hi> that cheer us, the <hi>beasts</hi> that
serve us, the <hi>Angels</hi> that attend us, even all are his. That we are not at
this present in <hi>hell,</hi> there to fry in flames, never to be freed. That we
have the free offer of <hi>grace</hi> here, and everlasting <hi>glory</hi> in heaven hereafter,
we are only beholding to him. And shall we deny this <hi>Lord</hi> that hath
bought us? shall we most spightfully and maliciously fight on <hi>Satans</hi> side
against him with all our might, and that against <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>conscience?</hi>
I wish you would a little think of it.</p>
               <p>4. ยง. For favours bestowed, and deliverances from danger, bind to
gratitude: or else the more bonds of duty, the more plagues for neglect.
The contribution of blessings, requires retribution of thanks; or
will bring distribution of judgments. And certainly, if a <hi>friend</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us but a thousand part of what <hi>God</hi> hath, we should heartily love him
all our lives, and think no thanks sufficient. And in reason, Hath <hi>God</hi> done
so much for us, and shall we denye him any thing he requireth of us?
though it were our lives, yea our souls; much more our <hi>sins;</hi> most of all
this sottish and damnable sin, in which there is neither <hi>profit,</hi> nor <hi>pleasure,</hi>
nor <hi>credit,</hi> nor any thing else to provoke, or intice us unto it, as in other
sins; for all you can expect by it is the suspicion of common <hi>Lyers,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
common <hi>Swearers:</hi> Or that you shall vex others and they shal hate you.
Whereas if we could give <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Bodyes,</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi> they should be saved
by it, but he were never the better for them. Yea <hi>swearing</hi> and <hi>cursing</hi> are
sins from which of all other sins we have the most power to abstain. For
were you forced to pay three shillings four pence for every <hi>oath</hi> and <hi>curse</hi>
you utter, as the Law enjoins: or if you were sure to have your tongue cut
out, which is too light a punishment for this sin, damnation being the
due penalty thereof, as the Apostle sets it down <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 12. you both <hi>could</hi>
and <hi>would</hi> leave it, which alone makes it altogether inexcusable. And this
know, that the <hi>easier</hi> the thing commanded is, the <hi>greater</hi> guilt in the
breach of it: and the <hi>lighter</hi> the injunction, the <hi>heavier</hi> the transgression,
as <hi>Austin</hi> speaks, and <hi>Adams</hi> eating the forbidden fruit, sufficiently proves.
So that it is evident you love this sin, meerly because it is a great sin, and
blaspheme out of meer malice to, and contempt of <hi>God,</hi> which is most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and (as a man would think) should make it unpardonable, I am sure
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> hath a terrible word for all such, if they would take notice of
it, <hi>Let them be confounded that transgresse without a cause,</hi> Psal. 25. 3.</p>
               <p>And no marvell that this fearfull imprecation should fall from the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
mouth; for that man is bottomlesly ill, who loves vice meerly because
it is a vice, and because <hi>God</hi> most strictly forbids it. He is a desperate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41868:2"/>
damnable wretch, who (rather then not die) will anger <hi>God</hi>
on set purpose. Wherefore looke to it, and think of it, you cursing, and
cursed Swearers; <hi>You swear away your salvation, curse away your blessing.
Howling</hi> and <hi>Cursing</hi> shall be your chief <hi>ease</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> to whom <hi>blasphemy</hi>
was an especiall <hi>recreation</hi> on <hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. ยง. Argue with all the world, and they will conclude, there is no <hi>vice</hi>
like <hi>ingratitude.</hi> And meer ingratitude returns nothing for good, but you
return evill; yea, the greatest and most malicious evill, for the greatest
and most admired love. It was horrible ingratitude for the <hi>Iewes</hi> to <hi>scourge</hi>
and <hi>crucifie Christ,</hi> who did them good every way: for he healed their <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,</hi>
fed their <hi>bodies,</hi> inlightned their <hi>mindes,</hi> of God became Man;
and lived miserably among them many years, that he might save their
souls: (though in killing him, they did their utmost to sinke the only ship
that could save them) but you are more ingratefull to God and Christ then
they were, or can be exprest by the best Oratour alive. For which read
more, in a Treatise intituled, <hi>Gods goodnesse, and Englands unthankfulnesse,</hi>
from Chapter 4. to Chapter 7.</p>

and beholds you in all places, and in every thing you <hi>think, speak,</hi> or do: who
is a <hi>just</hi> Judge, and will not let this cursed sin go unpunished: then would
you keep a narrower watch over your thoughts, then any other can do over
your actions; yea, you would assoon <hi>stab a dagger to your hearts,</hi> as let
such oaths and execrations drop from your mouths: whereas now you
swear and curse, as if he that made the ear could not hear, or as if he were
neither to be feared nor cared for, who for sin cast the <hi>Angels</hi> out of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Adam</hi> out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> drowned the <hi>old world,</hi> rained down fire and
brimstone upon <hi>Sodome,</hi> commanded the earth to open her mouth, and
swallow down quick <hi>Corah,</hi> and his companie; he who smote <hi>Egypt</hi> with
so many plagues, overthrew <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his host in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> destroyed
great and mighty Kings, giving their land for an inheritance to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
and can as easily with a word of his mouth strike you dead while
you are blaspheming him, and <hi>cast you body and soul into Hell,</hi> for your odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
unthankfulnesse: yea, it is a mercie beyond expression, that he hath
spared you so long. Consider of it I beseech you, lest you swear away your
part in that <hi>bloud</hi> which must save you, if ever you be saved; yea, take heed
lest you be plagued with a witnesse, and that both here and hereafter: for
God (who cannot lie) hath threatned that his <hi>curse shall never depart from
the house of the Swearer,</hi> as it is <hi>Zach.</hi> 5. 1. to 5. And I doubt not but you
are already cursed, though you know it not; That either he hath cursed
you in your bodie by sending some <hi>foul disease,</hi> or in your estate by sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
<hi>consuming it,</hi> or in your name by blemishing and <hi>blasting</hi> it, or in
your seed by not <hi>prospering</hi> it, or in your minde by <hi>darkning</hi> it, or in your
heart by <hi>hardning</hi> it, or in your conscience by <hi>terrifying</hi> it, or will in your
soul by everlastingly <hi>damning</hi> it, if you repent not. Wherefore take heed what
you do before it prove too late.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41868:3"/>7. ยง. Or if you regard not your self, or your own souls good, yet for

for in swearing by any creature whatsoever, we do invocate that creature,

invocate, both as our witnesse, surety, and judge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
deifie it, by ascribing and communicating unto it Gods incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable
