         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That it is vndertaken by me is the greatest disaduantage to this cause; that it is continued and daily receiueth strength from authority is amongst infinite blessings the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most vnspeakable of this Church. I haue dealt (as your Honour well knoweth) in this cause with a threefolde disaduantage, one, that it hath so fully beene handled by so many of great learning heretofore, so that at this time a defence was rather requisite to tell those that hope for alteration that our Church is still of the same iudgement, and spake not heretofore onely to please that State; a second is, that the things disliked are not differences of any great learning, seeing wee deale with aduersaries whose chiefest hope dependeth vpon the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of vnlearned followers; so that Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of reason are more requisite than proofes from authoritie.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Where right hath no other aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage but Fortune, and Weaknesse hath got strength from opinion of <hi>Zeale,</hi> there it is no lesse safe to maintaine error, than amongst bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dispositions to defend a trueth. The Circle of time, the best disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer of mens secret ends (and not the least, nor the least violent circumstance ouer the means) must at length make knowen to the weakest eye that is able to discerne least, who haue beene thought wicked and prophane in humilitie for maintayning a truth; and who proudly haue beene opposites to this end, that being ignorant and vnhonest, they might bee thought to bee learned, and seeme righteous. As there is not any one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion since the time that this Land first embraced true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, wherein more violent and vnnaturall dispositions, haue discouered themselues, than in, and for the <hi>Church gouernment</hi>; so is there nothing wherein the <hi>Wisedome, Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Souereigntie</hi> of Kings, doth and ought more to appeare, than in the well ordering of that Societie, where vnto the most vsuall and greatest harmes haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

proceeded from too much <hi>Zeale</hi>: For that which man once apprehendeth as vertuous to bee done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great iudgement and moderation, hee seldome tempereth himselfe from doing it eyther ouer-eagerly, or ouermuch. This as it swayeth with Inferior persons, (who for the most part haue no easier and speedier meanes to become eminent) so it is hardly tempered in those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being eminent alreadie, whose vertuous education hath made them religious; this being in one action to the people, the best assurance they can expect; for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, the best testimony of a good conscience; and toward God, a demeanour least vnthankfull for any straunge or miraculous deliuerance that they haue receiued. All these being made stronger, when a new people are become sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; when all men are disposed to giue strength to their hopes; and make collection from <hi>Signes</hi>; and when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances are seconded by the peaceable and happie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of a greater Kingdome. So that in this case (vnlesse to a minde that hath no Religion at all) it shall bee much harder to perswade a moderation than too little. For with righteous Kings, and of vnderstanding, as nothing is dearer than Religion; so in nothing they imploy their labour and authoritie more willingly, than for the preseruation, and honouring of the Church it selfe; all kingdomes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other safetie but this, Their <hi>prosperitie to flourish for no longer time, than the prosperitie of the Church is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned among est them.</hi> This being by all obseruation the truest signe of a decaying Kingdome, <hi>To haue a Cleargie vnhallowed, and the Church vnhonoured.</hi> But whilest all men are carefull that the <hi>Church</hi> may bee well gouerned, euerie man obtrudeth his owne fancy, and liketh best of those Rules, which haue neerest affinitie with his owne brayne. <hi>Hence commeth it to passe, that some men are not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolued, to whom especially belongeth the Authoritie to prescribe (with warr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is too plaine what opinion they had of <hi>Her</hi> Religion (liuing) whom so boldly they dare depraue being once dead: But flattery looketh no further, than eyther to escape punishment, or receiue a benefit; so that when the one is past feare, and the other past hope, wee dare then speake what wee thinke, and more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerently oftentimes of the same partie being a <hi>Saint</hi> in Heauen, than we durst being a Prince in earth. It were fit all men considered (but especially <hi>Kings,</hi> whose autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie it doth secretly vndermine) how farre the admission of a <hi>Consistoriall Gouernment</hi> in a kingdome may suddenly vsurpe vpon that right which <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Lawes</hi> haue ascribed to the <hi>King.</hi> That <hi>Kings</hi> ought to haue <hi>rule</hi> in all causes, ouerall persons, as it is warranted by the word,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9354:7"/>
so it is confirmed to the Princes of this Land by Act of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> This giueth vnto them <hi>Supremacy</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Gouernment,</hi> Exempteth from Inforcement of any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall or forreigne power, and freeth them from the penaltie of those lawes, both <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> and <hi>Ciuill,</hi> whereunto all inferiour persons in a Kingdome are tyed. And howsoeuer sinnes in Princes ought to be reprooued, and <hi>rights of Clayme</hi> may be recouered against <hi>Kings,</hi> yet in nothing are they liable to penall lawes, much lesse sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Iurisdiction of Elders, or Excommunication of this <hi>Tyrannous Consistorie.</hi> Vnhallowed blouldnesses at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in other Kingdomes, and Imperionsly affected and vrged by some amongst vs, nay the power to call <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi> (an Authoritie by <hi>Parliament</hi> graunted vnto the Prince) some violent spirits haue attempted with that bouldnesse, as if those only were Lawes, which were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by this <hi>Consistorie,</hi> (Princes being but to Execute what they appoint them out of Gods word,) whereof notwithstanding themselues must be only Iudges. Thus whilst the Prince, warranted by his owne <hi>Law,</hi> (which is the publike Act of his whole people) gaue Authority to some graue Commissioners for <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> disorders, They denie that any such ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Iudges and often both in priuate and publike, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued that honorable and high <hi>Commission</hi>; a thing, as it is vnseemely for them to controule, so if our late <hi>Souereigne</hi> in great Wisedome, and care of the Church, had not giuen it authoritie and strength, the bolddnesse of a great number, pretending a <hi>Zeale,</hi> had growen to bee so strong, that in all appearance, There had beene little like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of safety to the Queene her selfe. And seeing all attempts are most violent, that haue their beginning and strength from a <hi>Zeale</hi> to Religion, bee it neuer so false; there can be nothing (doubtles) of greater vse, either for the safetie of the <hi>Prince,</hi> the peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> or the quiet of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> than the seuere and Reuerend authoritie of this high <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission</hi>; without which assuredly long since we had miserably tasted of all those euilles,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9354:7"/>
which vncontrouled ignorance, <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and crueltie cculd haue brought amongst vs. It is small reason Princes should giue eare vnto these plots, which leaue them naked without meanes to defend themselues, or their Subiects in the time of danger; nay, those of the honorable and highe Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> are to thinke themselues (and I doubt not but will) iniured by such, who haue taken from them on of the three <hi>States</hi> (a <hi>State</hi> not of the least wisedome and grauitie) and from them all that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which they ascribe to a number of ignorant and sillie Artificers (for such some Consistories must needes bee) and guided by a youth sometimes, neither of wisedome nor vnderstanding. It is miserable where men are ruled by no lawes, seeing nothing is in man of greater daunger, (vnlimited) than his owne will, which imperiously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth ouer his fancie, that is able to corrupt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert all <hi>Rules of order.</hi> Thus they interprete <hi>Tell the Church, tell the Consistorie</hi>; Which because <hi>Iohn Morrell</hi> did expound otherwise, himselfe was excommunicated and his Booke burnt: there is nothing more vsull, than their pleasures to become Lawes; (A thing peraduenture men may affect, which either desire Change, or do hate gouernment, (but doubtles in it selfe Tyrannous and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable, and so much the more odious and daungerous, by how much the <hi>Rulers</hi> are base, there gouernment lesse equall, and once admitted, not easie to be shaked of. In on word, There is nothing in the <hi>Lawes</hi> of this whole Land, (nay not in the possession of any priuate perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) safe, if this <hi>Consistoriall Gouernment</hi> may take place; the benefit whereof as they magnifie (little weighing those yet vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Euils which must needes follow;) so the harmes of it are at large set downe by diuers others, who with learning and iudgment haue labored in this point. There is doublesse no <hi>Societie</hi> deerer vnto God than his <hi>Church</hi>; in the gouernment whereof he hath made choice of <hi>two sorts</hi> of men to be imployed vnder him; The <hi>first</hi> are <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> of his <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> whose calling is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and necessary in the <hi>Church</hi>; for so long as the <hi>Church</hi>

is in this world, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not possible be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued without these: of wihch we shall more fitly speake heereafter. <hi>The other</hi> are <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Magistrats</hi>: whom to the happy estate of the <hi>Church,</hi> we hold with all reuerence, of such vse, that those are worst that mislike their gouernment, &amp; that <hi>Church</hi> (in all reason) like to be most happy, which God, in his mercy, hath blessed with the best <hi>King.</hi> This appeareth in the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iuda,</hi> who being vertuous, <hi>Religion</hi> (that was decaied) was restored, and what the Idolatry of others had corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the vprightnes of some which followed did purifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; God in his loue performing that <hi>promise</hi> vnto his <hi>Church,</hi> that <hi>Kings should be her Nursings-fathers, and Queenes her Nursing-mothers.</hi> In this respect (more specially than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) they are called <hi>Gods seruants</hi>; not only because they serue him in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth (a thing common with them and the worst Princes) but because he vouchsafeth to vse their meanes, as the fittest <hi>Instruments</hi> to aduance his <hi>Church</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth. And surely a <hi>double seruice</hi> God expecteth from them; the <hi>one Common</hi> with all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; the <hi>other peculiar,</hi> to serue him in that place as Kings &amp; Princes. To haue performed <hi>the first</hi> is an action of praise and may giue great hope; but to faile in <hi>the second,</hi> is staynd with reproch, &amp; vsually accompained with much daunger: Euill Princes seruing oftentimes to Act but the ruines of that Kingdome by the fall of the <hi>Church,</hi> in whose misery theselues for the most part doe perish. In the <hi>first</hi> dutie (as Christians) they are not priuiledged aboue other men, they are tyed to same obedience, bound to as many vertues (nay moe for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple) &amp; must in the end (being called to the same account) be iudged with as much seuerite as the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest subiect. <hi>Be wise now therfore, O ye Kings, be learned ye that are Iudges of the Earth.</hi>

If man had no other light but the light of <hi>Nature,</hi> &amp; would not so willingly beleeue what were done with, as without the <hi>Scripture</hi>; yet euen <hi>this point</hi> will appeare to be most true, being the practise of those men, who had no other guide for their Actions, than the vnchangeable directions of the light of <hi>Nature</hi>; for whatsoeuer the <hi>Religion</hi> was, (as in most it was nothing but <hi>Idolatrous Superstition</hi>;) yet the transgression thereof was esteemed worthy to receaue pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and the appointment of this punishment was thought to be peculiar to those, who had <hi>principall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> to gouern the Comonwealth.

Inwardly the strongest mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue is <hi>Religion,</hi> and they are most (for the most part) Religious, who are Religious for conscience; but there is a feare from the hand of the Maiestrate, able to restraine those (at least from outwarde being euill) whom neither <hi>Conscience,</hi> nor <hi>Religion</hi> could make honest. <hi>Christian Emperours</hi> haue with their <hi>Zeale</hi> gained much honor for this in the eye and Iudgement of Gods <hi>Church.</hi> This made them when contentions arose, to call <hi>Councells</hi> as that of <hi>Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> to purge the Temples both from <hi>Heathenish Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Christian superstition</hi>; to make lawes, the better to keepe men in obedience towardes God; the irreligious contempt of whose worshippe (though in the Subiects themselues) haue brough a iust ruine, euen for not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, both vpon the Prince and the Commonwealth.

For where humors are infected a little, it is like that the maners are first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered a great deale, the most of the Fathers are plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in this point. This made Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> learnedly to confute the Donatists whose Haerecy was like the error of some in our days, holding that Princes ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit euery man to enioy, what <hi>Religion</hi> he likes, and to persecute no man for Religion at all; this serueth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the two great Errors of our time; the one of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi> the other of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; The first hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it vnlawfull for a Christian to be a Magistrate, much lesse to vse his authority in matters that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne <hi>Religion</hi>; the other that the care of Princes to maintaine <hi>Religion,</hi> ought only to be with these word; but to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute errors, to reforme Churches, to call <hi>Synods,</hi> These they thinke to be

peculiar to the Pope himselfe. The contrary to both these, wee are taugh by Scriptures, by Historie, by Fathers, and by Testimonie of some of the Popes themselues; who haue earnestly intreated the Christian Emperours to call Councels. This then being in the opinion of all that are of sound iudgement, both the greatest care and honor to a Christian prince, let vs consider a little those pointes that are absolutely requisite for the Religious performing of this duty; the person whom wee call the Prince, is hee that hath supreame authoritie according to the forme of that kingdome wherein he ruleth. In humane actions that they may be performed aright, it is requisite, that we are willing, that we haue knowledg, that we haue power; with out the first our knowledge &amp; abilitie do want motion; without the second our motion &amp; ability shal want skill; without the third our motion and skil shal want strength. The first is an vnestimable benefit bestowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religious princes from the powerfull Author of all pietie; in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect all men are bound to commend them to God more especially in their prayers, assuring our selues, that vnlesse wee or they faile, hee that hath giuen them to will shall inhable them at length to performe it likewise. The best assurance to discerne the Author of this wil, is the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ends which are only two; <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and the good of others, which being not the scope of their actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is no more possible that God should bee the Author of that will, than that goodnes is possible to bee the Author of much euill; Ends of doing which lye in the hart of man, and are onely discerned by God himselfe, are the true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerers what is the originall fountain of that we doo. For the same things are not alwaies of the same nature, though the maner of performing be all one, if the ends be diuers. The second thing is knowledge, not of much lesse neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie than the former, wherby hee may bee truely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, what things are vnfit, and what are warrantable to bee reformed; neither this onely in general, and by others, but if it bee possible in euery particular, and of himselfe; A happines wheresoeuer it is, neither least worth, nor least

power, to make happy both the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth. This only was thought to bring greatnes, &amp; ruine, both at once into the Church of Rome; whilst Emperors being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied with other affairs, left the gouernment to the Bishops; the Bishops to the <hi>Suffragans</hi>; these to the Monks; whose authority &amp; knowledge, being much lesse, all things were ruled, with greater corruption &amp; lesse truth. To auod this, <hi>Moses,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth the Princes, day &amp; night to be exercised in reading the holy Scripture; next, to haue those about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who are lerned, &amp; honest; it is a maime to a Prince to be assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by any that do want either. For to be learned without <hi>Zeal,</hi> is to make adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues by a publick losse, &amp; to be <hi>Zealous</hi> without skil, is to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times to matters that do much hurt. As the former maketh a King co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly to be ouer dissolute, so these other do make him to be too rigorous; it is a memorable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Ioas</hi> the King of <hi>Iuda,</hi> whilst he had <hi>Ieboida</hi> the priest assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to him, al things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily succeeded to him, &amp; to his whole Realme; but with his death (the King being destitute of such) all things as spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily came to great ruine. To further the Kings knowledge, it is a means neither of least honor nor vse to call <hi>Synods,</hi> of those <hi>Churches</hi> that imbrace the truth; and in them to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emble men of best learning, moderation, and least partiall, whose consultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a means both to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious &amp; insolent to finde a truth) may serue for resolution of such points, as weaknes in humility would be glad to learn. It is lost labour in any, &amp; farre vnbefitting the honour of Kings, to vndertake with Curiositie &amp; pride to get know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, seeing the one is not desirous to learne, &amp; the other desirous for to learne too much. This hath bin the Care of all religious <hi>Emperors; Constantine</hi> the great, in the case of <hi>Arrius</hi> called the Councell of <hi>Nice.</hi> Thus <hi>Theodosius</hi> the great, in the case of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> the Councel of <hi>Ephesus, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> and <hi>Martian,</hi> the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> against <hi>Eutiches, Iustinian</hi> the Councell of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> against <hi>Seuerus,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> which renued the error of <hi>Eutyches, Constantine</hi> the fift, The sixt <hi>Synod</hi> against the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelyts, George</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople, Macharius</hi>

The first being the effect of too much flattery, and self loue: the latter, the daungerous attempt of an insolent presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; both hazardous to that holy Societie, whom either they thinke for gouernment to be absolute, or absolutely to be gouerned by their owne fancies.

of those naturall, and Ciuill Societies, to which the Church is compared, and by the perfection of that fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowshippe, which the Saints in all ages, and places, where the true worship of GOD hath preuailed, haue had from the foundation of the worlde, amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
            <p>The first roote of humane Societie (as being impossible to continue without order) is distinguisht by God himselfe into seuerall degrees and prerogatiues of <hi>Husbands, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Maisters,</hi> aboue <hi>Wife, Children,</hi> and <hi>Seruants</hi>; and yet all linked in the mutuall agreement of like dueties. <hi>The greater Branches</hi> that rise out of these rootes; Cities, countries and kingdomes are neither destitute of lawes, to prescribe, nor Magistrats to execute for the common good; all receiuing dignitie, and strength, from this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <hi>that by the benefit of Good lawes, they are well gouerned.</hi> If men were of themselues either willing, or constant in that which were good, It were needles to haue a discipline for all, where euery mans vertue were a lawe to himselfe; but seeing our corruption is such, that we are easily decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by our selues, more easily seduced by others, but most and most daungerously peruerted through feare, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire (the one to spurn vs that we goe not too flowe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bridle vs that we runne not too fast) there is a line, both to direct, and to amend, necessarily limited to all sorts; and this, in due season, lest disorder indured, bread confusion, the fore-runner of all ruine. Seeing then the Church of Christ is the house of God, the Citty of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. Hebr. 12.

               <hi>This</hi> Regiment of the Church, is as well Extel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, as Internall; The latter is that gouernment which God hath by his holy Spirit, and truth, in the hearts of the faithfull; which as it is neuer varied, so it is not questioned amongest vs in the Church of Englande. By this which is the Kingdome of his Sonne, all men confesse, that GOD inwardly, and effectually worketh in his Saintes the Faith of his truth; the feeling of his grace; and other spirituall blessinges according to the purpose of his will, for the praise of his owne Glorie, in which no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creature is able to ioyne or to concurre with him; sauing only in this, that the Word and the Sacraments being left as externall meanes, there must be fitte per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for both, and a power in them to admitte, and reiect, lest happily, holy thinges be defiled, whilst Pearles are cast vnto Dogges and Swine.<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> From hence ariseth a necessitie of externall Gouernment in Gods Church; which respecteth the appointing of meete men, and the due approbation of such, as are to be credited with the free dispensation of such inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treasures committed to their Charge. In this, whilst all men agree that it ought, and many that are religious are desirous that the Church should be rightly orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; many Intemperat men, without any learning, or care, haue offred vnto vs that kinde of gouernment, which had it beene once admitted, could not choose but

Doubtlesse if you had perused with any indifferency, all the learned discourses, of those that haue laboured in this, you should easily haue found that most things demaunded, and so much desired, are new, and that wee are not now absolutely tied, to all these things that were in vse in the Apostles time.

And if wee looke further to that which seemed to bee most solemne, the <hi>Senedrin</hi> and great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is no where extant.

no man, could looke for other, than difference to arise where trueth hath not laid the foundation of what they holde; yet this is most straunge, that they are so firme for Doctors, to bee distinguisht from Pastors, for seuerall Consistories for euerie parish; widowes, and such like; whereas <hi>Geneua</hi> hath but one Consistorie for diuers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes; no Doctors, distinct from Pastors, no widowes, and in <hi>Fraunce</hi> onely Pastors, and Elders, are thought necessarie; yea besides this, there were many things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably, in vse in the former times, which as the Church hath power to remooue,<note place="margin">Iohn. 13. <hi>Cyprian de ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutione pedum.</hi>
               </note> so likewise hath she authoritie to appoint new; our Sauiour instituted a Ceremonie which hee inioyned his Disciples to obserue, of <hi>washing of feete</hi>; the same continued long in the Church as may appeare by a Treatise attributed to Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but now out of vse, and vtterly ceased.

That all the lawes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church are not durable appeareth, by ceasing of the Ceremoniall law, and the <hi>Iewish pollicie,</hi> so that the obseruation of the Morall, and whatsoeuer hath depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon that, is the true rule of discipline for maners; other things are but the violent fancies of some weak men, who haue abused their <hi>Zeale</hi> to doe much hurt. Neither neede wee stand to prooue much the alteration of this gouernment, seeing themselues haue varied in the deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it. In the yeare 1572. the first admonition (which the late most <hi>Reuerend Lord Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> did after confute) was offered to the Parliament, as contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a perfect platforme of the discipline they desired to be established in this Realme.

which seemed to haue receiued as much perfection, as they could desire; but presently after the Parliament this was found amongst them to haue some thing amisse, and the correcting being referred to one, who had trauersed the matter a new, it came out more perfect in the yeare 1586, an other in the yeare 1588; and it is like, as most of these were, against Parliaments, so some thing now is to bee performed for this, if their cause can haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, or the patrons can finde hope; but I hope by this time, our Gouernours are more wise, and hee who is able to discerne these plots, hath found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence their desires to bee too proud, and in reason not likely to benefit this Church, with a better peace; so that wee may safely conclude this point; <hi>That though the Church of all Societies bee fittest to bee Gouerned with an auncient and veriuous discipline, yet that discipline is farre differing from the same that they doo require.</hi>

And although euerie man in reason is tyed, to bee cerefull of his good name, yet see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that both euerie harde Censure, is not a proofe to continue errour, nor euerie errour an imputation to a man that deserues well; It is not all one to say such a Booke is euill written, and to say such a one is not an honest man; The first is allowed in the warrantable liberty of all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but the latter, Charitie, and Humilitie, do both forbid, as being but the daungerous effect of too much pride. Things that are euill in manners, are euill in that they are done, and are a iust imputation to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in that they are knowne; but writings that are Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, carry not euer that sentence among them, which some ignorant, or partiall opposite, shall impose vpon them; nor euer doo men censure, as some enemies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture would make them speake.

Their arc few Kingdoms which haue not found this to be true, both in the Church and the Commonwealth. For as in all States the lowest are aptest to reeciue harme, and so euer to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they receiue wrong, and hauing least iudgment to moderate the sence of euill, are most impatient to suffer euill; so whilst they become vnskilfull Phisitions to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <hi>like sicknesse, they make vsually the remedie worse than the</hi> disease it selfe; that there is any kingdome gouerned with so much happinesse, wherein the hand of authoritie is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that equal tenor, that either rewards or punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are not, or are not thought to bee bestowed by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, as we scarcely read of any that haue beene before vs so neither can we hope for a better fortune, to those that are present or shall succeed heereafter. For where true causes of Complaint are wanting, vnnecessarie discontentments are readie to make them to seeme true, nay the Church it

selfe (a Societie that hath farre better lawes to gouerne it than any Kingdome) seldome gaineth this opinion from all, but that some viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t spirits, dare vndertake by orders de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued out of their owne fancies, to frame a gouernment that should be more holy, and more excellent. So that whilst they are earnest conceitours of this forme, (a forme peraduenture without warrant and therefore in the ende not likely to proue safe) they fall (a thing vsuall) into so great an admiration of their owne creature, that any other gouernment (be it neuer so profitable and vertuous) is despised, and in the ende, nothing is of power to hinder the building of this <hi>Babell,</hi> but the confusion of tongues. So that <hi>Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> (by a long continued diste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per) which ought to be the care and the conscionable desire of all, commeth at the length to be the preposterous and violent misshapen disorder of some few; all men hauing this defect by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that where they haue power to discerne an euill, they haue not the vnderstanding to finde out the meanes for to make it lesse, the consideration of this as it ought to make those in Authoritie to haue more care and digli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; so vndoubtedly it serueth to restraine the vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble constructions of priuat men, who must not thinke all men to be Hypocrites that are in this case carried with lesse learning, and more Zeale; for doubtlesse in our Church, a great number haue vnfeinedly though without discretion wasted their Zeale, and their labour, in that cause with much hurt, which if they could haue beene so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, might haue serued the Church to a better vse. But seeing that cause (how euill soeuer handled) hath found so much fauour euen at their hands who in reason had least cause to allow disorder; and that nothing is to be more suspected as euill to be don than that which we finde to be euill donne, we will make a short but a true narration of this course, which hath beene held from the beginning for the establishment of this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. Neither is it fit that the particular ouersigts of some fewe, and peraduenture of such as either were, or were thought least fit to be imployed in a matter of that mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, should be any iust exception to that proceeding, if men of

greater learning, and cheefest in that action, it had beene car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried without violence, with much grauitie, moderation, and Zeale, but if we finde both the words, and the deedes of the best amongst them, to haue been such as no man hath reason to allow, it cannot choose but seeme strange, that any one (carefull of what he vttereth) should become a patron to that proceeding, which is no sooner barely rehearsed, but must vnto all men of necessitie, appeare to be without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. For iffailing in Cmilitie of tearmes, their actions, had beene more milde; or if ouer seene in their Actions, their words had beene of a better temper; some colorable snow might haue been their excuse,<note place="margin">

in opposition to all the rest, onely misunderstanding the time of Grace, are desirous to haue Religion, without any Ceremonies at all. As if the same God who seeing the weakenesse of his owne people, and therefore ledd them as if it were by Ceremonies to that worship which was fittest for them, and for that time; and who euer since hath beene the Author, and approouer of <hi>solemne order,</hi> especially in the <hi>publike action of Religion,</hi> did now eyther see vs to bee so absolute, as that these outward helpes were of no vse, or that all Ceremonies were but shadowes of things to come, not ornaments and helpes to things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, did meerely with the passion of his Sonne, cancell all kinde of worship that had any solemnities or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies (how vertuous soeuer) annexed to it. But as to think that Ceremonies without true and inward holinesse, could cleanse them from their sinne were to erre, and to be Iewish and superstitious, so to account them of no vse, were to be meerely prophane. Wee call them <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly all such thinges as are the externall act of Religion, which haue their commendation and alowance, from no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause but onely that in Gods worship they are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous furtherances of his honour. For Religion which is the height and perfection of all <hi>Morall</hi> vertues, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in it three actes as all other vertues doo; the first the Internall, which is the willing desire to giue vnto God his due worship and honour; secondly, the externall, aunswering to this, which is no otherwise good, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable than that it vertuously serueth to this end; thirdly, the commaunded act, that is the act of euery ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ordained by religion to Gods honour; so fasting, almes, and such like are tearmed the Actes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they are done for Gods worship, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> of these <hi>three the first is no</hi> way Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9354:33"/>
The third likewise is no Ceremonie, but as it is an act inioyned by Religion; <hi>but the second is properly</hi> that which concerneth the Ceremoniall part of Gods worship. All antiquitie was euer so farre from misliking of those, that they had almost placed Religion in them onely. The name which the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> gaue vnto Ceremonies sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth not so much the externall act, as the law and the precept by which is was commaunded; so that in the new Testament euen those which had no longer continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce but vntill <hi>Iohn,</hi> (for then began the Iewish Ceremonies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline) are tearmed by our Sauiour by the name of the Law and the Prophets.<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> Saint <hi>Paule</hi> calleth them Iustifications, because they were Rites instituted &amp; ordayned to that end.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> With them they were the Images of heauenly things oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the Images of the Heathen; &amp; howsoeuer we follow neither of them in the particular, the one being the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous prophanation of an Heathenish superstition, the other but the externall seruice appropriate to that people, and to that time: yet wee dare not, seeing no Religion can want all Ceremonies, fall so headlong to the error on eyther side, as to embrace or refuse, all those Ceremonies that the Church hath. Now as it is the vnhappinesse of Religion to bee ouerloaden with Ceremonies, so in those that haue authoritie, not to establish by law such as are needefull, is a defect; to neglect them in those that ought to bee obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, is a fault; but to contemne them in any that liue in the bosome of the same Church, must needs bee the manifest argument of their pride, and in the end the vtter ruine of Religion it selfe.<note place="margin">

               </note> For in the Ceremonies of the Law, there were three things to bee obserued; first, that they were all ordayned <hi>for the expressing of the inward and morall worship,</hi> to serue to true holinesse, <hi>Fayth, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all the rest were reiected (euen as a burthen) by him that commaunded them;<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15.22.</note> saying, <hi>I will haue mercy but not sacrifice: for obedience is better than sacrifice, and to hearken is better than the fat of Rammes.</hi> Secondly, if Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies be contrarie to true holines, they were to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (for their end was to further deuotion, not to hinder it)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9354:34"/>
In this respect they were dispensable, when eyther by the place or time, (two violent circumstances of all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) or for some impediments they could not well be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;<note place="margin">Ios. 5.</note> in this respect <hi>Circumcision</hi> was omitted for those that were borne in the desart, as being vnfit to moue immediatly after that wound, and being vncertaine to rest, seeing they must follow the fire, or the cloud when they moued. Thus in persecution we are content rather to exercise Religion without Ceremonies, than to want it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in peace to neglect, or contemne, must needs be a great offence. Those times being fittest to serue God with greater reuerence and holier solemnities, which are compassed about with greater rest and more happie blessings. Lastly, when Ceremonies are requisite to testifie our faith; (as doubtlesse they are then when they are through misunderstanding oppugned) wee may not in conscience remit any part of them; for the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

This vnkinde separation, (one of the sower fruits that haue growen in this latter age) is a great wound giuen vnto Religion, doubtlesse in many (for I will not excuse all) only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the abundance of too much loue. Al <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Ceremonies may be deuided thus.

For in the vse of Ceremonies at this day our Church doth not so farre differ from the endes of the first institution of them, that though her reasons be not the same, yet shee retaineth nothing, that in substance &amp; truth, is directly opposite. The first end of the Iewish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, was that by them as by certaine elements the people might be retained in the seruice of God, as a childe vnder the gouernment and discipline of his father; for where men are not restained within some bounds &amp; limits for external worship, discentions through affectation of singularitie, serue as wel by a general contempt to make men prophane, as continuall new and vnlimited additions of Ceremonies doe make them superstitious. Those rites then to them (and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o in proportion to vs) serued as sinewes to hold all and euery seuerall member of the Church, in Religious inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and worship of the true God. A second end was, that they might haue a worshipp, neither outwardly ouer naked, nor apparelled like that which the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles had; a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son doubtlesse to vs, not lesse forcible than to them, who haue in our eye neere at hand, such as are richly attired in this kinde, with whom we shall ouer easily fall in loue, and dislik our own seruice of God, if we haue not some external Ceremonies, which we are able to defende both to be as fit for Gods seruice, as naturall and comely warranted by Gods word, and seruing as wel to that end, namely his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as all the Ceremonies either of Heathens, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> doe.</p>
            <p>And surely whilst some honest mindes, for profitable ends haue laboured to vnburthen the Church of many Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9354:35"/>
they haue done nothing els, but vntyle the house, that the Rafters the Beames &amp; the maine timber might with the violence of tempests more speedily perish. The third end was, to make knowne vnto men by an externall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that holinesse which in hart they professed vnto him; that man hauing two parts, and he the Author of both, it might not be his fault, to be defectiue in either of them. Yet as wholy to depend vpon outward Ceremonies is but Hypocrisie, so altogether to neglect them vnder pretence to worshippe him in spirit, is but to sinne with more libertie vnpunished, and vncontrouled. Lastly, the comlinesse of order, and the preseruation of humane Societie, are not the contemptiblest ends for the vse of Ceremonies. For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order is the ornament of all Societies, and seeing the Church, of all Societies is most excellent, it must needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that those things which (Ciuilie done) doe adorne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vnciuilly neglected, or continued, doe disgrace the Church. And I am sorrie that in the earnest contention for Church gouernment men are so backeward in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of Church Ceremonies,<note place="margin">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, not to inuent a peculiar worship of our owne, a thing neither safe to be done, nor easily without bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> directions to be left vndone. Thirdly, to remoue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, for weakenesse not able to discerne, that the meanes often are diuers where the end is but one, from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Ceremonies, haue thought a contrarietie and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be in Religion it selfe. Lastly, to let vs know that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> God will be worshipped externally, and with order; this being the best witnesse, and nourishing of that worshipp which is within. And doublesse the Ceremoniall worship in generall is from the lawe of nature, although some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials doe proceede from the lawe positiue; so that both respecting the vse, which is manifolde, &amp; the practise both before the lawe, vnder the law, and since, (for the Church of God vpon earth did neuer want Ceremonies) it must needes seeme strange that the peeuishnesse of some few, and they none of the greatest vnderstanding, should preuaile so far, that things of more necessarie vse (as the word of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) should be amongst the people distasted, only for the obseruation of some few Ceremonies, and yet these neither many, <hi>nor the fancies of priuate men</hi>; as if the obedience of inferiours with humilitie in this case, were like the sinne of the sonnes of <hi>Elie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2.17.</note> for which men abhorred the offerings of the Lord. All men confesse that the Ceremonies of the <hi>Iewes, (prefiguring)</hi> are to be remoued, but not those in the Church which established by Authoritie, serue onely for <hi>order,</hi> and the <hi>better worship.</hi> Yet all men of sound iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must needs graunt, that for their vertue, they are all inferior to the word and the Sacraments; &amp; for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

they ought to be so limited, that with their vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable multitude, they ouerwhelme not that worshippe, which with their <hi>order</hi> and <hi>comlinesse</hi> they ought to further.

            <p>But if any man thinke (as surely it is the opinion of some) that those Ceremonies ordained by Christ or his Apostles, are fit inought to be retained in the Church, but the rest as being made without warrant haue no warrant to remaine still, we answere that of all which Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (how much soeuer corrupted doe, or shal vse) there is by vs noe defence vndertaken for them; yet wee doubt not that euery particular Church, may &amp; our Church hath, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ordained some Ceremonies, which ought religiously to be obserued, &amp; more also if the church so thought fit; not hereby to iustifie any &amp; to make him righteous, but for ends that are spiritual, and many waies behouefull to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.

fallen to despise the persons, the place, the times, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most that dutie, which we would honor; and all onely through the neglect of some due Ceremonies. Secondly, to stirr vp deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a thing apt inough through our vanities to become small, vnlesse some externall helps may be added for to make it greater. Neither can the accesse of Coremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the consecration of new times, or new places, be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise vnderstood, than the faithfull acknowledgment of special new, &amp; extraordinary fauours, that we haue receiued.

Vnlike in this to that maister, whose schollers they desire to seeme, who chose rather to loose his life, then to disobey. We had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all of vs <hi>inuent, and teach, then heare and follow; for our reason is but an euill lackey, but our will is worse.</hi> Seeing we want not reasons (as we think) to warrant vs in that we do; accounting the commaundements of others to be against right, and what wee will our selues that to be most holy. Whereas true obedience hath nothing of his owne, but is wholy anothers; it is daungerous when we say despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, <hi>surely we will walke after our owne imaginations, and doe euery man after the stubbornes of his wicked heart.</hi> This vertue of <hi>obedience</hi> maketh good things vnlawfull as the eating of the forbidden tree to <hi>Adam</hi>; and euill things to be good and lawfull, as to smite the Prophet; the one because he did what he was forbidden was punished with death, and the other was deuoured of a Lyon because he did it not. That which at another time ought to haue been omitted and could not be done without a great sin, now (being commaunded) without a great sinne could not be omitted. Neither is the fault much lesse (though the parties be diuers) so long as the authoritie that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth is all one; nor can we (vnlesse we flatter our
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9354:44"/>
selues ouer much) thinke that we are obedient to God, whilest we are willing to disobey those whom he in his wisedome hath placed ouer vs. Neither are we so much to waie (in things not simply vnlawfull) what that is that is commaunded,<note place="margin">

               </note> as with this to be content, that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. This if it had been duely considered by some in our Church, they had neither gloried so much that in not yeelding to order they were vnlike others, neither had they with such showe of reason, labored to make the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant beleeue, that the <hi>lawfull, wise, and religious</hi> exacting, of <hi>subscription,</hi> was like vnto an <hi>inquisition</hi> and the tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous requiring of an vnlawfull thing. But in this fact wherein the wisdome of authoritie was thought too cruell, they are able to answere why they did refuse. For what men being inioyned by order doe not, doubtlesse of that (in equitie) they are bound to giue a reason: which whilest some haue laboured to performe in this kinde, the world hath seene what small and weake excuses they haue had to refuse obedience; a thing which must in the end lie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie vpon them, that haue made resistance without cause, or else vpon them that without warrant, did exact it from them. Neither haue these refusers of subscription, been onely actors themselues in this disobedience, but the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors by their example haue thrust with violence, men of lesse learning and greater moderation, into the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. This being as one noteth the principall vnhappines of those men, <hi>that they had the authoritie of the aged, and the faults of youth.</hi> Who being in this (as they thought) to publish their vertue; were supposed not without cause, in the opinion of wise men, that they affected glorie. The Church hath found the example of these to be very daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, who were thought in that wherein they did amisse to be very holy. For such a one few are willing to reproue; and example doth inlarge the fault when the sinner is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored for the reuerence of his person. Doubtles there was no act since the death of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> either of greater wisedome to preserue the peace of the Church in those that were first authors of it, or of more daungerous disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9354:44"/>
in the refusers, then the act of subscription was. A practise not first inuented by vs, but arising of it selfe, euen from that naturall care, which ought to be in all of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to take securitie (as it were) for the good behauiour, of all such as are admitted to teach others. By this one act both binding their hands and tongues from any way dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the Churches orders, and testifying to the world, the vnitie of that Church where all of one calling, haue giuen their approbation, to those lawfull ordinations, which authoritie in wisdome, moderation, and vertue haue set downe. Whereby it appeareth, as their grieuance to be lesse, so their fault to be much greater then they thinke, who haue refused to subscribe, and haue labored with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to doe the like;<note place="margin">A thousand of them.</note> whilest notwithstanding they haue giuen their hands (and doe daily) not onely to their owne dicipline (wherein the best amongst themselues agree not and the meaner haue not knowledge toexamine) but also to false suggestions, intemperate petitions, vniust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, lawes and ordinances of their owne. For all which they haue (by many degrees) lesse warrant, than to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, to that which they doe refuse. This onely being the difference, that they distaste any thing that is not new, and their hands are ruled by <hi>example, and fancie,</hi> in that they doe. Wherein if they had well considered in humilitie, that obedience which the Church might exact of them, as also (without preiudice) the lawfulnes of those things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they were required to set their hands; doubtles the vrging would not haue been thought a matter of so much rigor, nor the refusing be so much defended, as a thing law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For what indifferent man can thinke it vnmeete, that when the Prince, and the Parliament haue made orders, Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ons, Iniunctions, Articles, or any thing of that kinde, for the vniformitie in the Church gouernment, that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop hauing authoritie to institute into spirituall liuings with cure, should require by subscription a consent vnto these things, before he be admitted in to that charge? A thing if by his owne authoritie for the peace of that dioces committed to his care the Bishop had done, surely the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9354:45"/>
fault had been much lesse, then in any that had refused to performe obedience. But seeing the law doth inioyne <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi> and that they (howsoeuer wronged by the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous complaints of some) are but ministers to see the due execution of the law, for the peace of the Church, they haue as little reason to lay the burthen of this vpon the Bishops shoulders, as a robber by the high way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, arrainment, and execution to the iustice charge. The law in them both hauing made that prouision, that they which doe what the law forbids, or doe not what the law commaunds, must be content (for their owne fault) willingly to suffer what the law inflicts. And therefore it must needes be by so much the more strange, that men who are content to flatter the Prince, the Parliament, and those that doe make lawes, can thinke themselues warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to refuse obedience, and reuile those honorable and reuerend persons to whom onely is committed the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. Besides, places, times, and persons, orderly with iudgement and conscience concurring to make lawes, euery person in the land hauing resigned his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intrest to those, who are assembled to that end, all after examination is debarred, to all how wise so euer, who are not admitted to that, and at that time; much more to the rest, whose weakenes of iudgement cannot without apparant suspition of intollerable pride, take vpon them the examination of those lawes, before they can easily be drawne to subscribe vnto them. The particular excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are made by them (although seuerally answered by sundrie most learned and graue men heretofore) yet then we shall better examine when we come to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Communion booke.<note place="margin">Chap. 13.</note> Onely we say now, that the vrging of subscription, so farre as the Bishops doe, and ought, is warranted by lawe from man, and the disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of those who refuse to doe it, is no way warranted by the lawes of God. So that both the tumultuous and clamorous outcries, which they haue raised, onely for this, and the slender excuses pretended for so foule a fact, are but like the coullerable rebellions, which for inlarging of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9354:45"/>
commons, the basest of the people haue stirred vp. But least peraduenture I should doe them wrong, I am willing that the reader should heare them speake. And herein I will make choyse of him, who comming later then the rest, vndertaking from the writings of others to pleade the cause, hath labored to free them from this great fault, and to iustifie that they haue performed so much as the statute required in this kinde. It is like he rather desired to tell the world that he was an actor in the troubles of that time, then to giue reasons, for that which he and they did, or to craue with submission, pardon of the Church, for that which they did not.

But in the middest of these fiery contentions, a goodly space of quietnes about the time that the <hi>reuerend father Maister Grindall was Archbishop of Canterburie, &amp;c.</hi> after the said archbishops death there came forth a new &amp; fresh assault of subscription, vniuersally imposed, and againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, vpon all the ministers in three articles; first of the Queenes maiesties soueraigne authoritie ouer all persons, &amp;c. secondly that the booke of common prayer, and of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayning Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, containe in it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrarie to the word of God, &amp;c. thirdly to allowe and approue all the articles of religion, agreed vpon by the Archbishop and Bishops, &amp;c, 1562, and to beleeue all therein contained to be agreeable to God.

But seeing the tenor of them all is all one (an vnreuerent estimation and speaking of men in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and lawes that are made by them) a fault surely not small nor easily forgiuen, if the cause were vertuous; I must needes before I answere them, giue them this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, which I hope some will follow, they that do as <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadius</hi> reporteth of one <hi>Seuerus</hi> seduced to bee a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian, acknowledge their loquacitie with him and keepe silence vnto death; that they may recompence by their silence what they haue offended in speaking. Now before we answere this, which they haue alleadged against sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription; the consideration of the nature of that, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les must be fittest which in all reason ought to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the best warrant to excuse them, both in this and the rest which they doe refuse; a reason which cannot be the same to all, and in those in whom it is found, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, they are rather to be pittied and instructed, then to be vrged to that (which how lawfull so euer) (their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence gainesaying) they doe make a sinne. For though the conscience of man allowing cannot make that to be no sinne, which the lawe doth, yet the conscience forbidding, may make that to be a sinne, which the lawe doth not. And therefore amongst men of wisedome, and vertue, there is no Plea that ought to be heard with so much attention, as when men for that which they doe, or doe not, truely and sincerely doe alleadge their conscience. Now as the coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorable excuse for refusing to subscribe, must be the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of such mens conscience, who were perswaded in themselues, the things to be vnlawfull whereunto they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9354:47"/>
were required to giue allowance; so surely a double fault must lie vpon them (if there be any such) who making no conscience of those things, pretend only the greatest bond vpon earth, to be the lawfull warrant of refusing of that which they would not doe. And surely where feare and humilitie are both wanting, there it is ouer much charity to thinke that they make a conscience. All men vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not aright, what that is which they alledge for themselues, when they say (<hi>their conscience.</hi>) There is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ingrafted in the heart of man, that light of <hi>nature</hi> which neuer can be put out, that telleth him that no euill is to be done. Now <hi>reason</hi> according to the knowledge that it hath (which in some is more, and in some lesse) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth his iudgement of particulars, that they are euill or good; from whence the conclusion followeth, they are to be done being good, or omitted being euill. And this is our conscience;<note place="margin">

               </note> as if he that had made time, the pretiousest circumstance of all our actions, had set our conscience as the seuere and diligent watchman of all our times. Thus seeing the vse of conscience; the next consideration is for the originall of the errors in it: these are two, a false assumption, and a false application. In the first we take those things to be good or true, which indeede directly are euill, and false; (an error peraduenture that misleadeth a number in this point;) so those that put the Apostles to death, did thinke in that action that they pleased God; for the time was come that our Sauiour foretold, <hi>whosoeuer killeth you, will thinke that hee doth God seruice.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 16.2.</note> In the second a false application, arising out of a true ground; because hee heareth that God is to bee loued aboue all things, thinketh it vnlawfull to loue any thing except God. Both these erre not alike, but the error of conscience doth infect both. Neither ought a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that thus erreth to binde, seeing the force and strength of conscience, is not built vpon himselfe, but vpon some precept (<hi>seeming so vnto it selfe,</hi> being no good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) but either because it is commanded, or els forbidden. Al the actions of man are of three sorts; <hi>good, euill, and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi> If our conscience say that is to be done, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally good,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eadem ratione prohibentur mala qua prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiuntur bona.</hi>
               </note> it is no error. If it deny that to be done which is euill it is no error; for by the same reason, euill is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden which commaundeth good. But if on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, it say that is to be done which is naturally euill, or not to be done which is good (a thing fit to be considered in this case) it is doubtles a conscience which doth erre in both. Likewise in indifferent things (as the remouing of a strawe) (and yet some wise men haue made these things refused by them, of that nature) to make them of necessitie, on either part where authoritie hath not determined, is a conscience without doubt that doth much erre. For euery will that disagreeth from reason,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> either true, or false, directly sinneth; for whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne: and yet euery thing which is done by the will, giuen assent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reason, is not voyde of sinne, because that ignorance

               </note> cannot possible make the action to be without fault. The conscience as it includeth knowledge and is conioyned with the light of nature is euer right, yet as it is ioyned to reason, and about particulars it often er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; the light of nature maketh the first proposition that it is not lawfull to doe euill; our reason (which often er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth either through ignorance or the strength of fancie) saith this is euill; whereupon the conscience being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, maketh a firme and a strong conclusion, therefore by no meanes I ought to doe it. In the first proposition there can be no error;<note place="margin">Esa. 5 10.</note> sometimes there is in the second (as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture in this act of subscription whilest we call good euill and euill good) and so a falsehoode in the conclusion; which as the logicians say, euer followeth the weaker part. The errors on both hands are, when it is either too large tending to presumption, making euill good; or to strait tending to despaire; making good euill; whereas the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet pronounceth a woe to both. Now because euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that would not erre, ought to be grounded vpon the commaundement that God giueth, doubtles it is more safe to obey a conscience that erreth not, then the commaundement of any who is but a mortall creature. But those who wilfully suffered martirdome, for opinions which they fancied,<note place="margin">

               </note> and willingly should haue disclaimed, were not commended for that they did, being but the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres of foolish phylosophy, and no way to be praised for that they suffered. But in things which are indifferent (as many things misliked peraduenture are) the precept of the superior doth binde more,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aquinas in disput. de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritat. quest.</hi> 17. <hi>art.</hi> 5.</note> then the conscience of the inferior can; for though the conscience be iudge, yet the other is more immediate vnder God; and this is but in those things, which either directly are commaunded, or els forbidden. For the subiect hath the commaundement of the superior for his warrant,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alex.</hi> 2 <hi>part. Summae. quest.</hi> 35 <hi>art.</hi> 2.</note> and in things of this nature, his dutie is not to examine; but onely to performe what he seeth commaunded. Wherein surely the consideration ought to be greatest of those in authoritie what they doe commaund; but to determine this point (which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9354:48"/>
is the case in question) according to that which the schoolemen say; we answere that the bond of an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring conscience is greater, because it is more vehement, and bindeth longer, then in things of this nature the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of a superior doth; but directly it is lesse on the other side, because it is fitter to bee vnloosed; for both the bond, and the conscience are to be reformed, where as the obedience to the superior in this, can admit no dispensation (things now ceasing to be what they were by nature) and this being no part of the inferiors dutie, to examine the lawfull ordinations that superiors make. Now whether these men that in refusing to subscribe, say they follow their conscience, are ruled by that which is to be reformed, or directed by that which shall be their warrant, reason and time will easily finde out, if due examination be taken both of their refusing, and of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues which they doe refuse. The conscience which doth erre though it binde vntill it be reformed, ought notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to be reformed; because, either ignorance, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, pride, inordinate affection, faintnes, perplexitie, or selfe loue, are the corrupt and originall causes of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of it. So that if none of these haue ouerruled the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of these men, but that knowledge with due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hath directed them in that they did, we haue great reason to harken to their excuse, and to regarde them with more attention, whilest with reuerence and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie they alleage their conscience. In the meane time for remedie against these errors, let them not disdaine the counsell which wise men haue found to be most safe, if it be of ignorance to say with <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi>

For whilest the conscience of man is troubled in this manner, grace repaireth in man the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent image of his first maker. Thus giuing our simple direction, and not daring to censure the consciences of such, as thinke their refusall to be warranted with pretence of conscience; we will examine a little what they haue said, and done, and whether the exacting or refusing of subscription, was a greater sinne. If the vrging of subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the law required, was the cause of those seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9354:49"/>
admonitions which the Parliament had, surely a worse effect could not haue proceeded from so good a cause, then that which was a vertuous inuention to make peace, by the vnquiet disposition of some few, should become the originall fountaine of so much warre. And surely that mildnes, which that reuerend Archbishop <hi>Grindall</hi> vsed in those times, little auailed with those men for to make them better; which in wisedome euer since, hath caused others in that place, for to vse the lesse. For experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (euen in them) findeth it to be most true, <hi>that fauour in that kinde they</hi> esteeme but desert, and the patience of others but their owne merit. Yet wise men in the same place, at diuers times, to the same persons, may vse direct contrarie courses and both well. The second inforcing of subscription in the three articles of supremacie, the booke of common prayer, with those things annexed, and the booke of articles made in the <hi>Synode</hi> 1562. the first they allowe, but as for both the other they esteeme them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,<note place="margin">Elizab. 13.</note> and such as the statute requireth not of them; where me thinkes it is strange that men which doe not so much as the lawe requires, will alleadge (notwithstanding) the lawe for their warrant, in that which they doe not. For if either the vrging of law, by the vertue of law, or not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst law, could in wisedome haue serued to make peace; those men had little reason to haue been against it, who were not able to proue that it was vnlawfull, and knew the authoritie to be lawfull that required it of them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any great reason, to hope for obedience in subscribing to the articles (if the lawe required it) seeing they are not willing towards the communion booke to affoord that allowance which the law required.<note place="margin">1. Elizab.</note> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer I take not vpon me to interpret the meaning of that statute, yet surely the pretended exception of law, is of little force, seeing both the Archbishops and Bishops and al the clergie in the conuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, subscribed vnto them; and that all Canons which the Church doth make, haue either confirmation vnder the great seale, or the parties that make them, haue warrant by the statute for that they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9354:50"/>
doe. And if it had not been, euer their practise to make a pretence of law, for that for which they haue no warrant, neither would they doe it if the law commaunded; it were better to be excused in that they refuse with pretence of law. With the same boldnes some haue affirmed that the present gouernment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by Archbishops and Bishops vnder the Prince is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted vnlawfull by the statutes of this land,<note place="margin">Martin Iunior Thes. 50.</note> and that to be a Lord Bishop is directly against the statute <hi>Eliz.</hi> 13. A practise like this some of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> haue lately vsed against vs,<note place="margin">Apologeticall epistle.</note> as though our oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against them, were beyond law; and the instruments made for our defence, and to cut them off, were intruth the safest protection their actions had. But haue these men that thus earnestly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend law, either neuer subscribed to any thing of their owne without law, or euer been obedient to the lawes of others? surely if they had, the contention in this kinde, had been buried that day when it was first borne. But the English when they came to <hi>Franckeford</hi> were tied to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the same confession of faith,<note place="margin">Discourse of the troubles. pag. 6.</note> which the French had: after they themselues enioyned all to subscribe to their discipline,<note place="margin">Ibid. pag 8.</note> that they might showe that they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and willing to be subiect to it.

So that herein if either their skill had been so great, or their moderation in that busines so much (as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture their desire was to doe good) doubtles the Church ought in all reason, to haue giuen great attention to these careful aduisers, and to haue showed her selfe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with thankfulnes, to make vse of those vertuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours, religiously imployed for her good. But now that they haue obtruded a discipline with that violence, and such a one as must quiet ouerthrow, both the practise of other Churches, and of this in al other ages that haue been before vs, nor this as the inuention of wise men, not against the word, but the expresse commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of God himself, accounting those to haue no Church (this being as essentiall as either the word or the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) where this is wanting; wee haue great cause both to examine the practises of these men, and to consider that discipline which they tender vnto vs, for that which we now haue; and what benefit by this exchange is likely to

This discipline of the Church ought to see the execution of those lawes, and ordinances, which God by his Apostles in their time, and daily since by the Church maketh; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we thinke that any in the bosome of the Church, after so long a time of knowledge, can now doubt, but that God hath left vnto his Church, an authoritie to make lawes, the execution whereof in reason is committed to those, who succeed in place and authoritie, the Apostles of Christ, that did plant the Church; whose dominion (notwithstanding) we make not so absolute,<note place="margin">1.

To this we referre, the time, and manner, of publike prayer, administring the Sacraments, ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call censures, apparell for diuine seruice, ornaments of Churches, and such like; all which as the Church fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ hath lawfull authoritie to ordaine, so it is peeuish disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in those men, who had rather without warrant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose vpon the Church lawes of their own making, then by commaundement obey the lawful ordinations that others make. Now because in no societie, al men will be obedient at all times, and that it is little auaileable to make lawes, and no way to see to the execution of them; as the Church hath left vnto her admonitions to warne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to restraine; so last of al she hath power to suspend, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the best things, that the church hath, because they haue refused to obey, the voyce of the Church, in those les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser ordinations that she made; the seueritie of the Church tending to this end, the amendment of such who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she doth correct, and the terrifying of others from the like offence; wherein if our Church, administer this discipline with two much lenitie (a fault surely if at all in inferior officers) we had rather aduenture the manifest inconuenience of that euill, then hazard by a new course, the certaine molestation of a farre greater. Now because all men will seeme to haue reason for that they doe, and no reasons are equall to those which the scripture yeeld, some wise men amongst them haue vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make proofes from hence, absolutely in their opinions sufficient, to establish this new discipline. The consideration of which weaknes, as also the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie vnto Gods word, must needes make, that their disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline doth want proofes, which themselues are rather desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> able to alledge for it.

So that all those scriptures out of the old testament by them alledged to this end (as they haue alledged many) are to small purpose;<note place="margin">Exod. 4 29. and 17 5. Deut. 1.15. and 17.12. 2. Chron. 19.8 Ierem. 19.1. Ezech. 8 1.</note> or if they were, that gouernment were needles, in a realme where there were a King. And that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrim or councell of the Iewes erected after their returne from <hi>Babilon</hi> being seuentie elders were of the stocke of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and of their former Kings; but to bring these into the Church by the mistaken example of those times, cannot but be daungerous; and the foundation being so weake, this building of theirs cannot long continew. Doubtles it is not safe in wresting of scriptures to follow the streme of their owne fancies, seeing he that held that all who would be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued must goe to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ket burnt at Norwich.</note> forced all places out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that gaue any testimonie to commend <hi>Ierusalem</hi> either litterall or otherwise, as apparant demonstration to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his error. As these men haue delt in the old testament, so in the new, what M. <hi>Caluin</hi> doth expound of pastors, and preachers only, some others do wrest for the establishing of these lay elders, in their Church discipline. I am sorie that men of learning that would seeme vertuous &amp; holy, should be charged so truely with so manifold wresting of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as in this whole matter of discipline they are by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie that doe write against them.<note place="margin">By D.

It had been doubtles a greater honour to them, much better dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the word of God, and a course of more reason in the opinion of wisemen, that this discipline, had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs, as a politike gouernment which they found safe; as the best deuise which necessitie in <hi>Geneua,</hi> betwixt the putting out of their Romish Bishop, &amp; the keeping out of the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> did inforce vpon them; as a platforme sutable enough for such a citie, at such a time. But to offer it to the greatest kingdomes that imbrace the truth, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily florish vnder the prosperous gouernment of vertuous princes; where all things are established in the Church with a <hi>most auncient, Apostolike, &amp; holy order,</hi> and al this vnder the name of Gods word; It is to poyson the world with much euill, and to couer the pollicie of their first teachers, with the vnhallowed contentions of all after times. And yet for all that we can neither mislike the gouernment of our Church, which alreadie we haue by Bishops, nor accept theirs by El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, vntill they haue answered all such as soundly and with iudgement doe write against them. Add surely I may make the same protestation which a wise man doth in this case, that if I were to leaue this life, and should speake what I thought of the present forme of Ecclesiasticall gouernment

at this time in the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Suruay. p. 80.</note> I would take it vpon my soule (so farre as my iudgement serueth) that it is much more <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> then the gouernment of any Church, that I reade of; and if it <hi>were not for Prohibitions</hi> (such peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as good intentions found out) (and some few hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the Common-law) a gouernment without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more holy and of greater peace.

            <head>CHAP. IX. Of Archbishops and Bishops.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F in the generall dislike which diuers not well aduised haue had toward the ecclesiasticall state in this kingdome, things of principall and chiefe vse might haue escaped the vnreasonable and intemperate reprehension of some mouthes, neither should a thing of so great necessitie, nor a condition and estate both by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and reason so much warranted, stand in neede of any defence at this time. But seeing amongst those ambitious humors (which vnder pretence of an equalitie more then is fit, aspire vnto a tyrannous authoritie more then is safe) there is nothing lesse willingly indured, then the title and authoritie of Bishops, which by establishing an order doth frame all parts of the Church to a due obedience and by making seuerall dignities (which for order are different) do impose a vertuous and humble obedience euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, whose ministerie and ordination is all one; we cannot but thinke it a thing vnreasonable in those which demaund it at our hands, and great folly in vs if we yeeld vnto it, that an office of that vse, of that lawfulnes and continuance, should be remoued as tyrannous and antichristian in Gods Church, onely because it pleaseth the wisedome and violence of some men, so to haue it. Now as to thinke that the state of the Church, might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continew better, or continew at all without these, is but the strong fancies of some, which ouerloue themselues; so to maintaine after so long practise of the most auncient
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9354:57"/>
Churches, that Archbishops and Bishops, both for name, title, and authoritie are lawfull, and to the well gouerning of the Church necessarie, is but to confesse that order, must as wel be a safegard to the church, as the common-wealth; and that <hi>subordination</hi> of men in authoritie, can be well wanting in neither; but if in either, surely in that societie farre lesse, where disorders in manners are not much few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (considering the number of persons) and the errors in opinion are more vsuall, and more daungerous; and none of these possible with any conuenience to bee remedied but by this meanes. In regard whereof being neither safe to trust all without rule, nor all with authoritie to rule, <hi>Apostolicall ordination, reason,</hi> the <hi>custome</hi> of all Churches auncient, and well gouernd, and lastly <hi>nature</hi> it selfe, doth ordaine Archbishops in their prouinces, as Bishops also in their dioces, and both in their places, and vnder the Prince, for to rule the Church. And herein, we may boldly say without offence, that the causes of displeasure conceiued against Bishops (how vehemently soeuer they are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) are surely lesse reasonable, then against any one thing which they doe mislike; seeing the vse of all other things may either be touched in show, with some coullerable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of fault, or the not vsing warranted with some likely excuse, whereas in this, the greeuances (if there be any) that are iust, are in the persons not in the office, and the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them away, must leaue a passage to a disorderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and possesse the Church with that fatall disease of all societies, want of order, whereby for the present she must needes doe many things confusedly, and doubtles in short time miserably perish. So that to make ambition, and couetousnes, the originall of this honor; and tyrannie ouer their brethren, to giue continuance vnto it; is to make the best things in the outward pollicies of the Church, to proceede from the worst authors, and to lay too great an imputation to their charge, whom in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by the benefit of this gouernment we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, as our spirituall fathers, for deriuing the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell vnto vs, and by a continuall succession euen from the

The best warrants that we haue for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of our spirituall functions, to vs the greatest cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon earth, and to the world the hallowed and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed instruments of all happines, which being imployed to that end, it must needes be an intollerable presumption in any to vndertake the same, but by authoritie and power giuen them in lawfull manner; for the same God which is no way deficient vnto man in things necessarie, and hath giuen vs to that end the light of his heauenly truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we must needes haue wandred in continuall darknes, hath in the like abundance of mercies, ordained certaine to attend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the due execution of requisit parts, and offices therein prescribed for the good of the whole world: which men thereunto assigned doe hold their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from him, whether they be such as himselfe imedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, or as the Church in his name, inuesteth: It being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther possible for all, nor for euery man without distinction conucnient, to take vpon him a charge of so great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The power of this ministerie translareth out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes into glorie; it raiseth men from the earth, and bringeth God himselfe downe from heauen; by blessing visible ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it maketh them inuisible grace. <hi>It giueth daily the holy Ghost.</hi> It hath to dispose of that flesh which was giuen for the life of the world; and that blood which was powred out to redeeme soules.

It is a power which alone ought to make the authors of it to man vnder God deare vnto vs; which neither Prince nor Potentate King nor Caesar on earth can giue. Yet neither is it being duly waied, in the Bishops suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors to the Apostles which bestow this, nor in those who are desirous to enter into that calling, any ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as some men surmise) seeing such reputation it hath in the eye of this present world, that both neede rather incoragement to beare contempt, then deserue blame as men desirous to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9354:58"/>
aspire higher. Now because men dying there must be a continuall supply into this calling, and that those who had first the authoritie to ordaine (I meane the Apostles) were mortall; their care doubtles must extend it selfe thus far, though they could not indew men with the same measure of grace which themselues had, yet they should (and so doubtles did) impart the same power to ordaine which was giuen to them; that neither men might rush into it without admission, nor the power of admission be granted to all, nor the Church bee left destitute of so great a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. And because in the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy things, where the persons put in trust are but men, discord &amp; disorder vsually doe breake in; the wisdome of God thought it necessarie, that amongst them who for their ministerie were equal, an inequalitie for order, and superioritie to command should be granted;<note place="margin">Order is the mother and preseruer of all things. <hi>Greg.

Which if it concerne all persons, and ages in the Church of Christ (as surely it doth) the gouernment must not cease with the Apostles, but so much of that authoritie must remaine to them, who fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, are to supply that charge, &amp; doubtles to that end haue succeeded in the apostles roomes.

For surely a multitude vngouerned, must needes be easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, and there cannot well be obedience, where all are equall; where shepheards leade sundrie waies, it is hard for the sheepe to know whom to follow; and if no man can serue two maisters, which haue equall authoritie ouer him, and perhaps command contrarie things (for whilest they agree, though diuers, they are but one) then surely the Church ought not to be put to this hazard, by multitudes

equally ruling in one place, seeing to dissent is vsuall in all places, and if not, yet in all persons it is casuall; whereas the wisedome of the Church in them that gouerne, must as wel looke vnto that which may happen, as vnto that which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie is. Now if this were the principal meanes to preuent schismes and dissentions in the primitiue Church, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the graces of God were far more aboundant &amp; eminent then now they are; nay if the twelue were not lik to agree except there had bin one chiefe amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for (saith S. <hi>Hierom</hi>) amongst the twelue one was therfore chosen,<note place="margin">

               </note> that a chiefe being appointed occasion of dissention might be preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and if euery presbytery by Gods ordinance must haue a ruler (as themselues confesse) how can they thinke that equalitie would keepe all the pastors of the world in peace and vnitie? or that the Bishops of a whole prouince or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, could meete, conferre, &amp; conclude, as often as neede requireth, vnlesse their assemblies were moderated, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by some one? For in all societies, authoritie (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be where all are equall) must procure vnitie, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, if vertue will not. Now seeing that all men may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily erre, &amp; that no errors are so daungerous as those which concerne religion, the Church should be in a far worse case then the meanest common-wealth (nay almost then a den of thieues) if it were left destitute of meanes, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince heresies, or to suppresse them; yea though there were neither helpe, nor assistance, of the christian magistrate; without which it were not possible for truth &amp; equitie any long time to harbour amongst the sons of men. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die which in these cases the primitiue Church had, &amp; when occasion was offered vsed against heresie and iniurie, she deriued as well from the promise made by Christs owne words, as from the Apostles example in the like case. Christ willing them that were grieued by their brethren, after the first and second admonition to tell it to the Church. And addeth for direction and confirmation of all religious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies and conferences;<note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> 
               <hi>where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middest of them; and whatsoever you shall binde on earth shall be bound in heauen,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9354:59"/>
and whatsoeuer ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heauen.</hi> Now whatsoeuer is ment here by the name of Church, in the reasonable exposition of any, to me it is all one, to prooue this order; that from priuate admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they went to witnesses, and from them to assemblies; and seeing there must be an end of controuersies amongst men (vnlesse we will plucke vp by the rootes all <hi>charitie and right</hi>) when neither priuate perswasion, not frendly mediation can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease parties that violently contend, what other order could be prescribed, but a iudicial hearing and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of things in question? Now because Christ did not set the sword to be the generall, and perpetuall rule to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne his Church (for then without a Prince there could be no Church, &amp; so consequently there was none either in the Apostles time or three hundred yeeres after) (though, where they beleeue, the defence and maintenance of the Church is committed to their charge) it must of necessitie follow that either there is no iudge (which were the vtter subuersion of all peace) when the christian magistrate is wanting, or els the pastors and stewards of Christs Church to whom this care is committed, must assemble together, and with mutuall conference performe those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Church in generall, which otherwise they are bound to do to each particular place and person. By Gods law what obedieuce and reuerence the father may expect from his owne childe, the same or greater, must all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers yeeld to the fathers of their faith; the one begetteth vs to this life, the other to a life that is much better. Those then whom Christ hath placed to be watchmen and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the light and salt of his Church, must not onely warne and guide, but also lighten and season in their measure that whole body; for when all other failes, this onely is left to clense the house of God from vessels of dishonour, yea when there were no beleeuing Magistrates to assist the Church, this onely was left, as the best meanes; and after when christian Princes began to protect the truth, they neuer had nor can haue safer direction amongst men, then by the Synods of wise and godly Bishops.

Christs Church; wherein if either their maintenance bee greater, or their outward honor more in these Christian times of peace, then could be expected amongst Pagans (and they tyrants) no man can in reason, or ought with out blame, to oppugne these, who will not be thought an enemie to the former; seeing the times and names being diuers, the authoritie notwithstanding is all one.

               <note place="margin">Math 25.</note> For as in distribution of gifts, God giueth not the same number of talents, to all, neither doth hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect equall proportion of increase, nor blameth him that had but one talent, that hee got not fiue, or two, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this that hee did not vse it. So that if those of the lowest sort of Clergie, who in the plentifull knowledge of this age, modestly content themselues onely to reade the Scriptures, and the profitable indeuours of other men (whilst some not much their betters for learning out of a bold presumption arising from a false opinion of equalitie in all degrees, dare approch the honorablest and grauest assemblies in this land) shall wee thinke their modestie deserueth so much blame, as that they are not worthy to bee tearmed ministers? and not rather blame the vnmodest presumption of others, who vnskilfully and boldly, haue taken vpon them, the dispatch of those duties, which doubtlesse by many hundreds, might haue beene performed much better. And I am sorie it fareth with vs in this case, worse then it doth in all other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses besides, seeing commodities, <hi>and seruices,</hi> are worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspected, onely in this respect that they are <hi>offered</hi>; and in these functions much holyer, and of more weight, they are thought by some to deserue better, in that they boldly and vnconscionably, outrun the rest. As if in the discharge of these sacred duties, an <hi>Vnhallowed Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> were the best vertue, or that a lawfull ordination to preach, were a warrant sufficient, allwaies to preach where it pleaseth them. This error to bold and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foule, if it were not the vsuall misdemeanor of those men, who to rigorously (beeing vnlearned themselues) call for a learned ministrie, wee could as easilie afford them
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:9354:69"/>
their desired happinesse, as wee are willing to craue pardon for others, that beeing better learned, are not indued with the like boldnesse. Wee doubt not but all men in this calling, haue great reason to vse, the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of their learning to the benefit of Gods Church, and that those who are not so well able to teach others, should indeuour themselues to bee more learned. Which vertuous trauells of theirs, so much deserueth the more fauour, in that there is no calling, which hath not more ease, and whose scope is not shorter, then the vnlimited, and endlesse desire to obtaine knowledge. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, men indued with greater gifts should receiue from the Church a better recompence; and where there wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynesse is farre vnequall, there both with Prince and people, (which is some mens error) their <hi>estimation and honor ought not to bee all one.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is of all vertuous considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a Prince not one of the lest moment, (if both for the safetie of his subiects, for remouing of scandall, and the discharge of his owne conscience in the day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it bee not the greatest) to prouide for a learned Ministerie in all parts of his kingdome; so it is not either of least difficultie or least vse, to ordaine a conuenient and bountifull allowance for them; neither can this (how wisely soeuer gouernd) bee <hi>a perpetuall mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> if it shall depend vpon the voluntary contribution of rich men; or to be thought an allowance fit and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for them, if it be not. So that the wisdome of deuout men in times past, from their religion, were as carefull to haue alotted a perpetuitie of liuing to them whose conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall successors could not dye, and were not lykely to be very euill; as naturall parents, for that race, which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of their owne bodies, (more subiect both to ende and miscarry) are notwithstanding desirous, that they may be richly furnished, and plentifully maintained for a long tyme. <hi>Vertue</hi> working as <hi>strongly and prouidently</hi> in the

one, as nature and <hi>affection</hi> in the other. So that what care those that were beefore vs, vertuously imployed in this kinde, by indowing both <hi>Churches,</hi> and other places, <note place="margin">1 Vniuersities</note> (both to furnish and giue rest to the Clergie) with honorable, <note place="margin">2 &amp; Cathedral Churches.</note> &amp; perpetuall alowance to this end, serueth both to make the labour now far easier, to prouide maintenance for a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ministrie, the greatest part whereof their religious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion hath performed vnto vs; as also to make vs, so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily to esteeme of those things which their wisedome did consecrate to this end; that pollicie cannot thinke alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or diminutions in this kind to bee safe, euen where vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed, <hi>Prophane,</hi> and cruell <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> were accounted to bee no sinne.</p>
            <p>For seeing the Chruch peraduenture doth now want, what authoritie thought fit, to take from her, because Superstition had made her too rich, and <hi>Alterations</hi> onely might haue giuen some hope, that time would haue brought those religious houses and lands into their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions againe, whose erronious blindnesse deserueth an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting banishment: it is wisedome rather to tollerate some things, for the maintenance of the Clergie, which a few wandring person (made rich by contributions, whilst a great number zealously blind are made poore to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them) think and write against with great bitternesse, (as the meanes of idlenesse and a superfluous pompe) then stirred vp by the inconsiderate enuie of these men, being vpon the Church such vnnecessarie want, that if the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostles time, wherein they sould their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and laid the price at their feete, faile, (as no doubt they doe) the Church must either bee desperately poore, or beg her reliefe from those kingdomes that are next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. Wherein besides the iniurie to God, which is no lesse then a boulde prophanation of holy things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Church receiueth at their hands a double wrong. First an apparant discouragement from entring into that calling, wherein how faithfully soeuer they imploy themselues, &amp; with how great sinceritie soeuer it be vndertaken by them, yet few or none (doubtles) wilbe willing to vndergoe either
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:9354:77"/>
the <hi>labour or the contempt,</hi> wher so slender recompence, &amp; so small rewards, are alotted to them. Both which of neces<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sity must be, seeing almes, seldom, when it is no matter of extraordinarie zeale, floweth with so great a streame from worldly men, that it hath or can haue, any possibility to effect either: the other is the intollerable burden of the poore, which now lieth vpon the shoulders of the laitie; in former times whilst the church was rich, beeing chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the humble almes-men of religious houses, and now because both the charity, and the meanes faile, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie (who for the most part are fitter to receiue then to giue reliefe) haue referred this waight to the laitie, which neither they can well beare, nor easely put off. And yet an extremitie in this kind, hath bene the originall of good lawes, for the redresse of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anno. 39. Elizab.</note> Now surelie all this must of necessitie bee more des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratlie euill, if either our owne couetousnesse, or the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous zeale of some inconsiderat men, cause vs to make a diuision, (as of pray) (whatsoeuer our pretences are) of that last, and least portion of the Churches wealth. Now because the first grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of that plentifull alowance, which the Church had, was the religious consecrating of a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our goods to his seruice, who had reserued a part of our time meerelie to that end: and seeing our liberall dealing with God, was the best and most thankfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, of his bountifull and liberall dealing with vs, holy men did confesse, (as well in the one as in the other) that in mercy, they did receiue both their time and their riches from his hand: so that by a part (and that small in comparison of what wee allot vnto other vses) we confesse his absolute dominion, by whose fatherlie good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wee receiue the whole. Wherein through couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or any other sinister occasion to bee defectiue, were to denie vnto God, that which belongs vnto him, seeing neuer any nation in the world did honour him, and not account it a speciall part of their dutie, to doe him honor with their verie goods. A part doubtlesse in christianitie of our Morall dutie, seeing for the sway riches carrie in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9354:77"/>
the world, and for that inclination which mens minds haue to cleaue fast vnto these things, wee are naturallie more apt, to honor our riches as God, then to honour as wee ought God with our riches. So that vnlesse this tribute (as it were) daylie put vs in minde whose subiects we bee, wee are apt to make our selues Kings, and the world to bee our owne free, and independant inheritance. Now seeing what wee offer vnto God, serueth vs well for the perpetuitie of religion, (which cannot possiblie continue without a conuenient alowance for such as are necessarilie to bee imployed in the Ministerie thereof) as it doth to expresse our thankfull acknowledgement, of his mercie from whence wee receiue all that wee haue, in all ages both the gift hath beene refused, and the giuers reproued, whensoeuer the coldnesse and want of deuotion in the people, made their oblations to bee sparing, and little worth: for there ought to be some proportion, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him whom wee desire and hope that he will accept our oblations, as likewise betwixt the principalest end, and the things themselues: wherein whatsoeuer either our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or defect bee, the burden of that euill, must in the end fall vpon our owne heads. In which respect, euen the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themselues: thought it vnmeete, to offer that vnto God,<note place="margin">Puru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, probu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, prophanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, suu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fest. lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</note> which was <hi>impure,</hi> or <hi>vnsound,</hi> or alreadie giuen, or else not truely their owne to bestow.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the vse of those riches, whether in moueables, or lands, which out of mens deuotions were consecrated to holy ends, their bestowing is not for God; who hath no neede of any thing that is ours, seeing <hi>the earth is the Lords,</hi>

and <hi>bare</hi> allowance to some inferiour, <hi>worthlesse men</hi> of the Clergie; to whom notwithstanding whilst neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie &amp; want of due prouision inforceth them to beg their maintenance from the Layetie, they vnproportionably commit the greatest &amp; weightiest authorities in the church, wholly or principally, to be ruled by them; as if naturall and politick wise men did not think that they might iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenge an ouerswaying of their Counsells, whose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie liuing, food, &amp; rayment, must be deducted out of their coffers; to whome they will be content, so long to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall and liberall, as nothing by the Clergie, either in doctrin, or discipline, shalbee performed contrary to the liking of these men. So that the complaint of the pride &amp; authoritie in church-men, is onely from hence, not that in deede their riches are too great, but that the maintenance which they haue alotted from antiquitie, (and happely by good lawes confirmed vnto them) is a free, and absolute right, and possession, no wayes depending vpon the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie and fauour of laye men; who for the most part expect obedience, and seruice, where they are voluntarily content, to afford alowance. Men seldome being willing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by those men, whose condition is absolutely, to depend vpon their maintenance. This being the ordinarie effect of liberalitie in this kinde, beesides that patrons to the Clergie may grow poore, &amp; that all men at the length become wearie to be <hi>continuall giuers.</hi> Seeing then we can haue no exemption from publishing of that gospel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>woe</hi>; by which the earth hath men vertuous, and the heauen glorious, and that without maintenance all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of opinion, it is lawfull to substract our labour; and that this maintenance can neither bee conuenient nor perpetual, if it be <hi>Almes</hi>; wisdom hath found it out, (which our Fathers beefore vs haue practised) that it was not (thought a great honor to those that did it) enough onely to build churches, &amp; to furnish them with rich ornaments, (not so much to further deuotion as to bee a treasurie for what want soeuer the church might haue) as also because these moueables, were subiect to casualtie, to prouide that

the church might haue for perpetuitie, a large indowment of inheritance,<note place="margin">1.

Colledges, which may breed deuines, as to Cathedrall Churches, where deuines after their paines may well rest, (both places beeing the rich storehouses of learned men seruiceable to the Church for many vses) it cannot bee but an intention of ouermuch enuie, and violence, to seeke inconsideratlie an alteration, and impouerishing of these honourable allowances for these places, by which in the end all feruent studie of deuinitie in the best disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions must needs perish, so that if men had as much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to alter, and diminish the liuing of the Church, as of other persons, yet no man can think it safe, nor pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a Ministrie to continue learned in that kingdome long, when other professions grow rich, and the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neues of the Church faile. <hi>Tithes</hi> then beeing a dutie wherevnto all men are now bound, both by law of nature, deuine positiue, and a vertuous voluntarie obligation to the Church, wee can see no great reason in the refusers of them, why they shoud either altogether bee kept back, or else bee alienated to other ends. For where the law of nature requireth a sufficient maintenance for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, the law positiue being a determination of the former, alloweth the tenth to bee the best proportion, wheerein if this bee remembred, that the maintenance bee suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, we doubt not but the prince may determine the tenth, or the fift, or any other number, to bee the measure.

And if the bond of allowance arise from the benefit which wee receiue at their hands, whom Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination for our good, imployeth in that kind, it must needs follow, that the tenth vnder the law, being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which the Clergie had, there is small reason why now, (their seruice being more honorable and the benefits

And wee know that the Clergie for manie yeeres after Christ, had no other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, but onely their <hi>Canonicall portions, or monethlie Diuidends,</hi> allowed vnto them according to their seuerall degrees, and qualities, out of the common stock of such guifts, oblations, and <hi>Tythes,</hi> as the feruor of christian pietie did then yeeld. In the Apostles time Churches were onelie in the cities, in regard whereof those that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:9354:86"/>
liued in villages, beeing without instruction, were called <hi>Pagans,</hi> which after by the example of others, both inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and giuing allowance, for the maintenance of the same truth, those to whom principall care was committed in this kind, appointed meaner men of lesse learning, and lower qualitie, to vndertake the instruction of those places, who were desirous and willing,<note place="margin">This the Lords did for which they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to bee patrons.</note> to yeelde after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others; oblations and tithes for maintenance of those, that were placed ouer them. Now to say that either seuerall parishes thus distinguished, might by no permission bee allotted to the care and instruction of one man, or that it were not lawfull for any reason, how bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall soeuer to Gods Church to bee absent from that particuler care committed to him, were in the former to denie all better trust, and reward to men of more worth and greater abilities and desert: and in the latter to bee ouer <hi>Tirannous</hi> in considering, and allowing the cause of absence, and peraduenture in a true construction, ouer ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouslie seuere in both. But seing all men know which wee doubt but our aduersaries in this cause will conffesse that this limitation of particuler parishes was meerlie positiue, and the inuentions of men, thought, and found better, for the better performance of the Clergies dutie, it cannot bee the absolute transgression of a deuine ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that sence, as if either to haue moe parishes then one, or from one to be absent at somtime, were a direct, &amp; vnexcusable breach of the morall law. For the duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to bee done in them, are by no meanes (not for a moment) euer allowed to be done at all: which thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome if in seueritie they bring vpon Gods church, let them take heede what dangers they fall into themselues, &amp; that by this meanes, the church receiue not a greater harme, whilst peraduenture in this case, their remedie is worse, then the disease is. Now to allow absence vpon reason, without appointing those causes, and such as must iudge which are reasonable, were to make all men to think that they had reason that were willing: neither is there any great force from the nature of <hi>Relatiues,</hi> (if that were all)
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:9354:87"/>
why one may not as well haue diuers parishes, as one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish haue diuers Pastors.

Doubtlesse neuer meere human law, was either made with that wisedome, or was in execution of so necessarie vse, but that sometimes, it was fitter to receiue Dispensation, then to stand in force; for seeing the best lawes of men are but the euidences of <hi>Humane reason,</hi> which wee finde by experience groweth from a weakenesse to bee more strong, and from imperfection to bee more absolute; wee cannot in reason (without inthralling our selues in too great a bondage) deny <hi>Abrogation</hi> and <hi>Dispensation</hi> to humane lawes, which are not to bee like those of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> that might not be changed.

            <p>Seeing then all humane lawes, are onely the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the law of nature, such as reason hath fitted for the benefit of some societie, either the church, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and that all these are and euer must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to dispensation, and priueledge, from those that haue supreame authoritie, and that (as wee think) limitation of <hi>Cures,</hi> either for many, or attendance vpon some one,

is meerlie a law positiue, wee hope, that what the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of some mens zeale accounteth a great offence, reason and deuinitie, will warrant to bee no sinne. For se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well in the Church as the common wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and rewards are to bee giuen, not by an Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, but a Geometricall proportion, and that honour and maintenance for the Clergie being from the law of God, <hi>Benefices</hi> and <hi>Cures</hi> are by the law positiue, surelie it cannot well bee denied, but that how much of either shall bee giuen to this, or that particuler person, must be in the Prince to dispose onely; now because lawes haue alreadie set downe how much may or ought to be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any one man, and what <hi>Residence</hi> and attendance hee ought to performe there if more then this, (for the good of the Church) by Priuiledge and Dispensation ouer and besides (not <hi>Contrarie</hi> or against the common right) be graunted to some one, can wee think it vnwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and to bee a fault? <hi>Dispensations</hi> for <hi>Pluralites</hi> haue bene in all times;<note place="margin">Abstract. pag. 128.</note> and the necessitie and vtilitie of the <hi>Church</hi> are confessed by themselues to bee the onely iust causes, to make them lawfull; neither doth our Church require other allowance at their hands, then that in these cases it would please them to think, and to write, that the dispensations which are giuen, are not contrarie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to common right. If any think or speake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, in cases dispensable, it is their error; for it is <hi>the voice of Equitie, &amp; Iustice, that a generall Law doth neuer derogate from a speciall Priuiledge</hi>: and that a Priuiledge is not opposit, vnto the principles of common right; because it dispenseth with that, which common right doth prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, for in the one it is respected by way of generalitie, in the other beset with limited and speciall circumstances, so that in the eie of law, and reason, they seeme to bee the same, though they bee not, wherein because men often times (as one noteth) waigh things stripped of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler circumstances, which add waight vnto them, they waigh them vneuenlie, and thereupon oftentimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that to bee to light, which is not in truth, if

they had skill to waigh it. Now seeing the absence of all Priuiledges <hi>Non Residencie and Pluralities,</hi> is in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendement of the law for the aduantage of the Church, whether it be by parties aboade in the Vniuersitie, to get more learning, or attendance in the families of noble men, in Princes Courts; or Cathedrall Churches: it ought not to seeme vnreasonable, that some part of the reuenues of the Church is allotted to their vse, who though yet in person they bring not that benefit to some particuler flock, which in time they may, yet the Church at their hands shall receiue no losse: for if the whole riches of the Church were a stock of monie (as some Deacons par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture desire it might bee) it can bee in reason no greater fault to giue maintenance now from some parish to some one absent for a time, and in that absence profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Church, then in their diuision to giue that allowance, which seldome they bestow for so good desert. Yet whatsoeuer vnder pretence of Priuiledge is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by any, for to wrong the Church, in a true construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is neither defended by vs at this time, nor fit to bee suffered in admitting (as I think it is not) often meane persons, to haue the benefit either of <hi>Non Residencie</hi> or <hi>Pluralities,</hi> which were in the first intendement, onely for men of better degree, of more worth, and of some speciall imployment in some other kind, for the singuler benefit and aduantage of the Church of Christ.</p>

Wee desire them without offence, who vrge so strictly the lawes of our land for both these, to consider this, which is not altogether impertinent to this cause: that if a strict law were made for a citie, that were beeseeged, that no man vpon any occasion might open the gates of the same citie, (whereby the keeping of them shut, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

of the superiour, and that such Dispensations are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant.</hi> But wee are and shall bee euer readie by the grace of him vpon whose mercie wee relie in all that wee doe, to iustifie and maintaine, the religious practise of our late Soueraigne in this, against those who are willing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfully, vnnaturallie, and irreligiouslie, to depraue and traduce her most vertuous, blessed, &amp; happy gouernment: For seeing that Dispensations are some meerely of grace, wherein the Prince may lawfully respect one aboue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as in <hi>Legitimations, Pardoning of heynous faults,</hi> and such like, in which for the dispensed, or the dispenser, ther is no other necessitie, either in the court of man, or the court of conscience, sauing onely grace; because (it is to be thought the people and the lawes of euery countrie in these and other such matters,<note place="margin">Arg. L. Scio. ff. de minoribus.</note> haue yeelded this power vnto their Soueraigne Princes, euen where they cannot by preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue as with vs challenge so much right) wee doubt not, but their assertion is to manacle the Kings hands, and to binde them in these chaines of their owne making, who teach the world that <hi>Lawes</hi> must haue that force, that all Dispensations, are vnlawfull, and transgressions of them. Now touching other dispensations which are called of iustice, they are conuersant either about the law of God and nature, or about the positiue law of man, in the first there is no dispensation from man, yet interpretations are allowed, to show that the generallitie of the words, do not indeede extend to some speciall cases, and that of those thinges which strong and manifest arguments teach vs that God himselfe would not haue included, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of his law, <hi>Interpretation, Declaration, and Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> may bee made, and this by the lawyers is called one kinde of dispensation of iustice, whereby the bond of the law is not released, but the law is interpreted in such case, not to haue force, according to the true mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing of it. Now in the other dispensations of Iustice, which are bestowed about the positiue lawes of man, we must obserue two things, first that the law remaining, yet the reason in some particuler case doth cease, which ought by the prince, or the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:9354:90"/>
inferiour Iudge, in dispensing to bee so declared: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is when the law is grounded vpon diuers reasons, whereof some ceasing, and some continuing, the law is notwithstanding in force, vnlesse a dispensation of Iustice, bee graunted to vs. There are also besides these dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions mixt partlie of grace and partlie of Iustice, because that he graunteth it, it is grace &amp; fauour, &amp; yet it is Iustice, because he granteth it to none but vpon iust cause; so that when a King dispenseth with any positiue law of man, the law teacheth vs to intend and presume both, that there is a cause why hee should so doe, and that the same cause is iust and sufficient, and doubtlesse hee that receiueth such dispensation sinneth not against the law, nor his own conscience, because hee is by the same authoritie deliuered from the bond of that law, by the which hee stood bound.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are few kingdomes in the world which haue not at some times diuersities of religion nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished and brought vp in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of them: for the enuious man whilst others sleep, is watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligent to sow Tares: &amp; these vsually either in mercie, or for their nearenesse, to that which is good, are suffered to grow, till the time of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest. If naturall bodies of men either had no diseases, or that rest were not sometimes auaileable to procure their health; <hi>Wisdome</hi> were a vertue in Phisitions of litle vse, and vndoubtedly <hi>patience</hi> would bee thought <hi>Sloth.</hi> But seeing the eyes of councell in all euills that are, looke not so much what they be, as what they may bee: and that the best perfection which humane indeuours doe, or can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, is from that leysurable maturitie, that times affoord, (moments and instants being onely fit either for powres infinit, or for weaknesse that is furthest from them) all
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:9354:103"/>
men haue as much reason not ouer hastely to censure what the wisest doe, as the wisest haue warrant and example, not ouer hastelie to performe what they doe intend. Few doe or can doubt, but that the foundation of all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to a realme is true religion: it is the wals of defence to the greatest kingdomes, <hi>Princes haue their best securitie</hi> from this, both for Crowne and Scepter, and their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries shall all faile, in the iustice of the highest, that doe rise against it. The power how to ordaine that worship which God requireth and man oweth (which wee call Religion) is neither in our weaknesse to inuent, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught and instructed in it, haue wee willingnesse or strength to yeeld an outward obedience without lawes. As the care then of this in all kingdomes chieffly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the Prince, so the best enterance and assurance to the well performing of this dutie, is the sanctification of of the Lords <hi>Rest.</hi> Without this, the slumber of peace shall bee no prosperitie, health shalbe but a sweet poison to make vs distaste what doubtlesse would be better for vs, and in the end, the felicitie of such states, shall but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the grasse vpon the house top which withereth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be pulled vp, and their faire day shalbee suddenlie ouer cast, or concluded and shut vp, with a blacke and a long night. Where it is easie to erre, seldome doe men looke at vices with so much seueritie, as where it is not: custome haueing both the Priuiledge of a multitude to bee without shame, and the lenitie of a pardon, because few men think it a dutie to bee honest, where the most are not, or that to bee an offence in one, which is the fault of all.</p>
            <p>Now the persons of men being swaied many times to error, by lighter occasions then meere fancie, and all men des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

bee truelie taught, that they neither can with happinesse want this, nor without miserie think this to bee any other, sauing onelie one. But because all men traduse (euen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect of nature) that deuotion which they see in others, who looke not the same way that they doe, it shall not bee amisse, to consider, who, and what they are, that vsuallie dissent in religion in any kingdome. And from the Prince and the state, what <hi>fauour, tolleration, or respect</hi> is to bee had towards them: for seeing all men (though their <hi>Religion</hi> bee false) haue reason both to loue, and to bee earnest for the religion which they pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And because wee haue heard, the greatest Prince in the world tell vs, that Kings are <hi>Phisitions</hi> in this kind, wee may safely resolue that where <hi>Patients</hi> &amp; <hi>Diseases</hi> are not all one, ther the remedie &amp; the cure is not all alike.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> such as haue in doctrine and worship <hi>Superstitiously</hi> fallen backe, from the true Religion of <hi>Christ</hi>: in place wherof either <hi>Saints,</hi> or reliquies, haue a great part of that honor which is due vnto God onelie, such are a great number of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; these vsuallie wee call by the name of <hi>Papists,</hi> and so wee must tearme them in this Chapter. <hi>Hereticks</hi> are they who strike through the verie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> foundation of religion, and directlie gainsay some article of our faith, and are or haue beene condemned, by some generall councell, as <hi>Arrians, Eunomians, Seruetians, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi> and such like. Yet in these all are not alike, some beeing <hi>Seducers,</hi> and others by them simplie seduced. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> next are those that erre, beeing or seeming to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with some errour, but such a one as yet is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as an heresie: as betwixt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the Zwinglyans, about the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> both holding each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to erre, wheras neither sentence as yet hath bene law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie condemned. To these may bee referred all those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious opinions, which take not away the foundation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> faith. Lastlie those whom the Prince knoweth to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and sound: not infected with any heresie or error, a seuerall respect is fit to be carried toward all these.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Iewes</hi> a Prince may lawfullie permit them to dwell in his Kingdome, and to traffick in it, so that marriages with Christians, communicating with their religion and all nearer familiaritie betwixt such, bee denied vnto them: these were the limitations which were set betwixt them and the heathen, by the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the lawes of <hi>Emperours</hi> haue permited the like; some of the fathers but especiallie S. <hi>Austin,</hi> was so fauourable toward them, that hee alledgeth seuerall reasons, for the doeing of it; first that aboue others they had the promise of <hi>Saluation,</hi> and though their case bee lamentable, yet it is not desperate, for euen <hi>at this present, there is a remnant

according to the election of Grace; for God is able to graft them in againe. For I would not brethren that you should bee ignorant of this secret, least ye should bee arrogant in your selues, that partly obstinacie is come to Israell, vntill the fulnesse of the Gentils bee come in</hi>; for that prayer sayth <hi>Sainct Austin,</hi> was made for them: <hi>Slay them not least my people forget it, but scatter them abroad among the people, &amp; put them downe O Lord our defence.</hi>

But concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the permission of Sinagogues vnto them, all men are not of one minde: seeing dayly in them blasphemies are vttered against our sauiour Christ; yet wee doubt not to affirme, that these may be graunted with some cautions, as onely to reade the Scriptures, and to pray, but not to teach, where the reason for them, and the <hi>Turks</hi> to haue Temples, is not all one: seeing these both haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;<note place="margin">Concil 4.

            <p n="2">2 The next are Idolatours, to whom wee denie not, but permission if it please the state, may lawfullie bee graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to liue amongst vs. Yet euen these with the same li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation as the former were, neither that wee communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in their Idolatrie, nor bee of too great a familiaritie and nearnesse with them, nor bee suffered (as some think) with such to contract marriage, for seeing the Infection of Idolatrie creepeth as a contagious disease, and that all neere conuersing, must gaine at length, if wee cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, an approbation or tolleration of what they like, it is not euer safe (though to permit them in a kingdome) yet to conuerse any nearer with them, then with meere

In penall lawes surely there is the greatest wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, of those that make them, and the greatest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, of those that breake them; so that for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all states, but especially of the Church, there are few things of greater aduantage tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the seueritie of Iustice
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:9354:110"/>
in the strict execution of penall lawes; for it is straunge that some inconueniences should first cause them seeme fit to be made, and no disorder make them seeme necessarie to be obserued; I thinke no other reason can be giuen but this, that those lawes doe hire men with halfe the allowance to be informers, which makes that good seruice to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, only in that respect odious, as being not the effect of iustice, and zeale, but the vnconscionable desire of some couetous promoter, the best remedie in this, will be to referre the benefit of these, to some publike vse (for it is meete that vertue be maintained from the penaltie of vice) and that such be seruants to the state in the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these lawes, as are furthest from partialitie and pittie, &amp; yet least to be suspected for vnsatiable desiring of their own gaine. But there is a greater defect in most kingdomes, (wherein this Church is an humble suter to your <hi>Highnesse</hi>) that it would please your Grace (a thing absolutely hoped for at your Maiesties hands) as well to reward those that deserue well, as to punish those that are dangerous to the Church or the commonwealth; doubtlesse there is no politike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of greater vse, in a kingdome, that all parts of it may florish, than the iust bestowing of these two, <hi>reward and punishment</hi>; seeing they are the spurre and the bridle, absolutely requisit for the right commanding of a whole Realme. And surely it is a great question, whether to the happinesse of a state it be safer to want punishment for the euill, or rewards for the vertuous; But seeing all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes haue greater feeling, and can better iudge of what is euill than well done, therefore <hi>punishments</hi> are by the lawe due to the one, whereas the other is many times a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great suit, fauour, and sometimes of infinite corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the best and most worthy obseruing, they are in al likelihood furthest from being preferred, because least subiect to such corruption.
