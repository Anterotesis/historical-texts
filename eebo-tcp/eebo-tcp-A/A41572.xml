         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>COlonell <hi>Goring</hi> have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had a designe to ceize upon the Town of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and having admitted the number of 40. Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Carbines and Pistols into the Town, the better to accomplish and bring to passe his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded purpose, and having furnished him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with all kinde of necessary Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he Ordered to be brought into the Town, which being effected, he charged that all that bore Arms, which were about the number of three hundred, should appear in the afternoon, at whose appearance he made this Speech unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:112233:3"/>
               <hi>Gentlemen, and fellow Soldiers,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe occasion of calling you together, is to let you understand and know His Majesties pleasure, and your dutie concerning this Town and Fort, which His Majestie doth expect to finde a place of singular trust and fidelitie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath commanded me to put you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a posture, that we may be able and ready, not onely to maintain his Majesties right in this place against any that shall dare to attempt the contrary, but also that this place may be fit for the guard and safetie of His Majesties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and I hope that I shall not need to urge many reasons to perswade or win you to a cheerfull and willing obedience herein, if we do but call to minde His Majesties goodnesse and bounty to us, and also in how great and how many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations we stand bound unto his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
<pb facs="tcp:112233:3"/>
For we are not onely tied to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to His Majesties commands, as we are Subjects, but in a more particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as we are servants, and do receive a certain recompence or reward, for our Service from His Majestie.</p>
            <p>So that all those benefits and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that we or any one of us enjoy, is from His Majesties bounty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; For our bread and drink and all that we have, is derived, and commeth from him, and in his happinesse and welfare, our lives, liberties, and fortunes do consist.</p>
            <p>And for you that are behinde of your pay, although the Parliament hath made some promise to see you satisfied, yet such is the ease and goodnesse of His Majestie towards you, that He hath provided you money, which I have in my custody to distribute amongst you, so soon as you have subscribed to some few words and conditions in writing which I shall tender unto you, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying your religious, honest, faithfull,
<pb facs="tcp:112233:4"/>
and ready intention to serve His Majesty in this businesse. Neither will I constrain or force any to stay in the Town against their wils, or free pleasure, but every man of what condition soever, shall have free liberty to go and come, with his Wife and Children, servants and goods in safety and peace. And let every man assure himself, that for his faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice herein, his Majestie will not see him unrewarded. Having thus ended, some of the souldiers gave a great shout, the rest were discontented, and a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction was suddainly in the Town.</p>
            <p>Upon the 11. of <hi>August,</hi> a <hi>Hackney</hi>-Coachman came to the House of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and acquainted them that on the 9. of this Moneth, some Gentlemen came to him, and hired his Coach and sixe Horses, agreeing with him by the day, not telling of him whether he should go; And likewise three <hi>Hackny</hi> Coaches more with sixe Horses a piece, were hired at the same time; and he also informed the House, that two of the Coaches went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb facs="tcp:112233:4"/>
and the third went another way by it self, and that there were in every Coach two Gentlemen a peece carried. He also told the House, that he carried two of them to <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and that the one them was Mr. <hi>Weston,</hi> brother to the Earl of <hi>Portland.</hi> Also he further said, that when he came to <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> he understood that these Gentlemen carried down along with them nine thousand pounds in sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but before he came thither, he knew nothing thereof; but he said that one <hi>Welch</hi> another of those Coachmen, told him after he came to <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> that he knew of it, and did help to tell the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in <hi>London</hi>; He declared further, that he heard there were great store of <hi>Papists</hi> thereabouts, to the number of five or sixe hundred; and that the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> and Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> were expected to come to <hi>Portsmouth</hi> every hour, and that many of the Townsmen got forth of the Town as fast as possibly they could, and that all Officers and Soldiers that were there, who refused to take an Oath that
<pb facs="tcp:112233:5"/>
was tendered to them, were turned out of the Town as fast as possibly they could; and that they are very busie in making of Workes three miles out of the Town. And he also enformed them, that himself and the rest of the Coachmen, did very hardly get away from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeers, being very desirous to detain both them and their Horses, and that they proffered to make them Officers in their present Service and expedition, and to allow them what pay they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, but they durst not stand to their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, but made shift and got away.</p>
