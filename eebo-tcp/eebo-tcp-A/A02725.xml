         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

long Preface (too long I must needs confesse for so

my daily obseruation, during that my imployment:
with other accounts of my time not altogether idlie
spent there, hauing now but too good a leasure (since
the losse of so hopefull a Maister) for such a purpose,
God send vs an other comforter. And so once

comming within daunger, at <hi>Mulley Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans</hi>

both Moores and Christians that knew
how to mannage his ordnance.</p>
                  <p>So three peeces went off, and did no

tooke fire, and burnt out the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but shot no bullet that remained in,
so comming nearer, the Musketiers plaied
vpon them, with foure thousand shot, yet
hurt no man.</p>
                  <p>So then they came on, and <hi>Mulley Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans</hi>

                  <p>Hee hath not entered into Marocus,

                     <hi>Mulley Sidan</hi> fled &amp; came down to Saphia,<note place="margin">Hackam is a chiefe officer in a Citty.</note>

some mony, cloth, and linnens

his children, and wrote to him very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

So staied heere so long as he durst: for

Whereby hee was forced to fraight a ship

                  <p>Some fewe dayes after his departure,

peace in these countries, there must now
appeare a Bridge in the mouth of the

                     <hi>Mulley Sidan</hi> and his proceedings,

                     </gap>: So Morocus is
in peace and quietnes; and amongst the
Larbies he demands his due, either corne,
horse, cattell, or money; and tels them he
coms to put peace amongst them; neither to
rob the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor yet to lose his right; not to giue
them pay, but force them to serue him, as
need requireth, if they yeelded not to such
conditions, his sword should force them:
he came amongst them as a guest, and was
to be entertained by them, and not to giue
them to gaine their fauour. By which spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
myracles past, and policy, hee hath
made them all tremble; so he puts all to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
Som co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent themselues, of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
in former time, to heare and see, shew o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
and say nothing: others change
with the time, and haue great imploiments,
and professe loialty to him, and renounce
their old Master; what the euent may be I
know not: for, we haue learned, <hi>the hearts
of Kings are in the hands of the Lord, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
them as riuers of waters which way hee

But hauing beene in his Almahalla, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the manner of it, his plainnesse and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
mixt with a shew of mercy and a kind
of Saintish gouernment, I feare mee it will
come to passe, according to the Fable in
<hi>Aesop,</hi> when th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Frogs desired a King, a
blocke was throwne downe into the water,
which dash at the first made them feare
him, but lying still they grew familiar, and
sunned themselues vpon him, and grew in
dislike; so had the Storke: But it were to
be wished they would now content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
when peace and iustice is offered.
If he doe continue it is like to be with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and bloud-shed; for already the people
begin to disobey, and the Shabenites, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
Sidans<note n="*" place="margin">Or Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> 
                     <hi>Cast,</hi> are got to the Mountaines

ioine with them; and one <hi>Mulley Om Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
Bolassom,</hi> and these haue robbed to the
gate of Marocus; wherupon this King sent
forces to expell them, but found them so
strong that they durst not meddle with
them: whereupon was forced to rehale his
Almahalla some fifteen dayes since, and is
gone towards the Mountaines, where at
this present hee is neere frugo: and what
hath passed since we know not, only expect
<pb facs="tcp:16825:8"/>
euery howre to heare some good newes that
he may preuaile; but here it is greatly feared,
because many of his owne people be depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from him: and those Larbies he caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him out of these parts, run away
and returned, so if he lose, the other bee the
friends of <hi>Mulley Sidan,</hi> and he is expected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
But the beginning and rising of this
king and his procedings are very strange. He
is a great saint and learned in the lawe, and
was sought vnto by many the principallest of
the land for his blessings, and fauour, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their superstition; he findes it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
books writ of him by way of prophecy,
that such a man of that place named <hi>Messa</hi>

Abdela,</hi> should bee sent at this time, to put
peace in the country, and to reuiue their law,
and put out the race of <hi>Mulley Sidan,</hi> and
name of Xeriffes: and so to raigne forty yeers
till Christ come to iudgement: his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                     </gap> Missa, and then
should repaire vnto him people, to make him
king. The manner of his proceedings, and
what encounters hee should haue, and what
he found written, all the Talbies and learned
men now do confesse to find the same writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in their bookes. At his beginning he put
forth only <hi>one tent</hi> and <hi>a kitchen:</hi> so resorted
<pb facs="tcp:16825:9"/>
to him the Shrokies, a saintish people in
their lawe, but otherwise in behauiour very
Sauages. These without pay came to him, to
the number of 150. or 200. at most; and with
their helpe hee brake Alhadge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lemiere, and
his forces, seruants of <hi>Mulley Sidan,</hi> beeing
5000. strong; so more of the sayd Shrokies
came to him, to the number of 5000. &amp; with
them and such people as ioined with him in
the way, he ouerthrew <hi>Mulley Sidans</hi> forces
thrise before the battell.</p>
                  <p>And so came to some strong places in the
Mountaines, neuer brought to subiection in
the time of <hi>Mulley Sidan,</hi> nor his father:
Those with-stood him, but hee ouercame
them and made them pay him what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
serue and obey him; so forced the
principallest Shecks in the countrie to come
to him. After this marched towards Moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
and by the way was to pass a riuer; and
the daie before he warned his people, in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such a riuer no man to take vp water in
their hands to drinke, if he did he would die.
After comming to the riuer weary and hot,
many not remembred, or not regarded his
words, but tooke vp water in their hands,
drunk, and anon after dyed, the rest all esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
which strooke a feare into them to
breake his command, and a perswasion that
hee is more then a man: For they say hee
<pb facs="tcp:16825:9"/>
is their Fatamie, that is, a Sauiour. Next in
comming to Morocus, diuers great Saints
and Sheckes resorted together, and would
goe to visite him, that they might see what
hee was, and vnderstand whether that
which passed was true or not. So com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
after salutations, hee told them they
came to enquire and see what newes, and
what wonders hee did, and so meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, being men of account
and Talbies hee would satisfie them, that
they might satisfie others. So appointed
them a time to come againe, and to bring
such bookes, hee nominated, with them;
so they did: Then he willed them to turne
to such places, and reade what they found
written of him; so they did. To wit, both
his name, his beginning, and course he was
to take, and withall found written sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
speciall markes, or signes, hee must
haue vppon his bodie, a wart aboue his
right eie, a blacke tooth before, a bunch
of hayre growing betweene his shoulders,
a signe of a ring in the palme of his right
hand, the signe of a spurre vpon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of his right legge; the rest I remember
not.</p>
                  <p>But these and the rest hee shewed them
which seeing they did honor him and swore
<pb facs="tcp:16825:10"/>
to him to serue him, and to liue and die with
him, or in his cause.</p>
                  <p>Next comming to a place named Dets in
the mountains very strong, where much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were gathered together against him so
that some of his owne people began to faint
and be afraied: hee bad them feare nothing
for that before to morrow they should see
there was more with him then against him:
so that night, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to take vp his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahalla
&amp; march towards that place Dets:
so they did, and all night long to the think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of al his people, there marched another
Almahalla greater then theirs, and went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them: and comming to the place Dets
vannished away, and at sight of it his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
fled, leaft the place and goods, al to the
spoile, so comming thither had the spoile of
all without fighting. This our country man
M. W. affermeth with diuers others vpon
solemne oth to haue seene. At his being in
these parts, my selfe with others went to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him: he entertained vs very kindly, &amp;
told vs he would shew the English what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
he could, and permit them free trade,
willing vs to take knowledge that he was sent
by Gods appointment to releeue the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

and al sorts, and what we had seene and
heard to aduertise, saying wee should see yet
<pb facs="tcp:16825:10"/>
more strange matters come to passe, then
what had passed. His meaning as we gather
is, the conquering of Spaine, France and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
with which oppinion hee possesseth the
foolish and credulous Moores. Now hauing

For the state of this country, and of the wars
of this new King, I know Master S. hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged

for all this, and the troubles <hi>Mulley Sidan</hi>
hath had, it is thought he will be king again,
and that in short time: staying but for a new
Moone to giue battaile. This Saint or king
told his Shrokies which came with him at
first, his comming was to take Mazagant,
Sute and Tanger, not to sight against the
Moores vnlesse they would resist, and not let
him take the Christian townes. Hee said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
that <hi>Mulley Sidan</hi> and his followers
were Christians, one who robbed all men
without reason, killed and slue many men
vpon no occasions, but in his angry minde.
And withall said hee dranke wine, and eate
oppium, therefore said it could not bee but
<pb facs="tcp:16825:11"/>
that hee was an <hi>Vn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rony,</hi> which amongst
them they hold to bee an vniust, or vngodly
man as they say wee Christians are. His
Shrokies two thousand fiue hundreth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all footmen, with no peeces, but halfe
Launces: that was their weapons, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
men. Neuer in their liues they weare
shert, or cloth to their backes, but an Alheik.
Which Shrokies haue left this king, and are
all gonne for their country. This kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are of Larbies, which are horsemen: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
day they flee from him more and more.
As <hi>Alkaid Syde,</hi> whom you know <hi>Alkaid</hi> of
