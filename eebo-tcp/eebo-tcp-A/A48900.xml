            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Business which your Letter concerning Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on found me ingaged in, has taken up so much of the time my Health would allow me ever since, that I doubt whether I should now at all have troubled you or the World with an Answer, had not some of my Friends, sufficiently satisfied of the Weakness of your Arguments, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Instances, perswaded me it might be of use to Truth in a Point of so great Moment, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lear it from those Fallacies which might perhaps puzzle some unwary Readers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prevailed on me to shew the wrong Grounds and mistaken Reasonings you make use of to support your new way of <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi> Pardon me, Sir, that I use that Name, which you are so much offended at: for if Punishment be Punishment, though it come short of the Discipline of Fire and Faggot, 'tis as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Punishment for Religion is truly Persecution, though it be only such Punishment as you in your Clemency think fit to call <hi>moderate and convenient Penalties.</hi> But however you please to call them, I doubt not but to let you see, that if you will be true to your own Principles, and stand to what you have said, you must carry your <hi>some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>egrees of Force</hi> (as you phrase it) to all these Degrees which in Words you declare against.</p>
            <p>You have indeed in this last Letter of yours, altered the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; for <hi>pag.</hi> 26. you tell me the Question between us, is, <hi>Whether the Magistrate hath any Right to use Force to bring Men to the true Religion?</hi> Whereas you your self own the Question to be, <hi>Whether the Magistrate has a Right to use Force in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 76.</note> Whether this Alteration be at all to the Advantage of Truth or your Cause, we shall see. But hence you take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ll along to lay load on me for charging you with the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities of a Power in the Magistrates to punish Men, to bring them to their Religion: Whereas you here tell us they have a Right to use Force <hi>only to bring Men to the true.</hi> But whether I were more to blame to suppose you to talk coherently and mean
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49288:3"/>
Sense, or you in expressing your self so doubtfully and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, where you were concerned to be plain and direct, I shall leave to our Readers to judg; only here in the Beginning I shall endeavour to clear my self of that Imputation, I so often meet with, of charging on you Consequences you do not own, and arguing against an Opinion that is not yours, in those Places, where I shew how little Advantage it would be to Truth, or the Salvation of Mens Souls, that all Magistrates should have a Right to use Force to bring Men to imbrace their Religion. This I shall do by proving, that if upon your Grounds the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, as you pretend, be obliged to use Force to bring Men to the true Religion, it will necessarily follow, that every Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, who believes his Religion to be true, is obliged to use Force to bring Men to his.</p>
            <p>You tell us, <hi>That by the Law of Nature the Magistrate is invested <note place="margin">Pag. 31.</note> with coactive Power, and obliged to use it for all the good Purposes which it might serve, and for which it should be found needful, even for the restraining of false and corrupt Religion</hi>: And that it is the Magistrate's <hi>Duty,</hi> to which he is <hi> commissioned by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> but the Scipture does not properly give it him.</p>
            <p>I suppose you will grant me, that any thing laid upon the Magistrate as a Duty, is some way or other practicable. Now the <hi>Magistrate being obliged</hi> to use Force in Matters of Religion, but yet so as to bring Men only to the true Religion, he will not be in any Capacity to perform this part of his Duty, unless the Religion he is thus to <hi>promote,</hi> be what he can certainly know, or else what it is sufficient for him to believe to be the true: Either his Knowledg or his Opinion must point out that Religion to him, which he is by <hi>Force</hi> to <hi>promote;</hi> or else he may promiscuously and indifferently promote any Religion, and punish Men at a venture, to bring them from that they are in, to any other. This last I think no body has been so wild as to say.</p>
            <p>If therefore it must be either his Knowledg or his Perswasion that must guide the Magistrate herein, and keep him within the Bounds of his Duty; if the Magistrates of the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know, certainly know the true Religion to be the true Religion; but it be of a Nature to exercise their Faith, (for where Vision, Knowledg and Certainty is, there Faith is done away) then that which gives them the last Determination here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, must be their own Belief, their own Perswasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49288:3"/>
To you and me the Christian Religion is the true, and that is built (to mention no other Articles of it) on this, that Jesus Christ was put to Death at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and rose again from the Dead. Now do you or I know this, (I do not ask with what Assurance we believe it, for that in the highest Degree not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knowledg, is not what we now inquire a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ter) Can any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate demonstrate to himself (and if he can to himself, he does ill not to do it to others) not only all the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ticles of his Church, but the Fundamental ones of the Christian Religion? For whatever is not capable of Demonstration (as such remote Matters of Fact are not) is not, unless it be self-evident, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to produce Knowledg, how well grounded and great soever the Assurance of Faith may be wherewith it is received; but Faith it is still, and not Knowledg; Perswasion, and not Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This is the highest the Nature of the thing will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to go in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>atters of revealed Religion, which are therefore called Matters of Faith: A Perswasion of our own Minds, short of Knowledg, is the last Result that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines us in such Truths. 'Tis all God requires in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel for Men to be saved: and 'twould be strange if there were more required of the Magistrate for the Direction of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the way to Salvation, than is required of him for his own Salvation. Knowledg then, properly so called, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be had of the Truths necessary to Salvation, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate must be content with Faith and Perswasion for the Rule of that Truth he will recommend and inforce upon others; as well as of that whereon he will venture his own eternal Condition. If therefore it be the Magistrates Duty to <hi>use Force to bring Men to the true Religion,</hi> it can be only to that Religion which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves to be true: So that if Force be at all to be used by the Magistrate in Matters of Religion, it can only be for the <hi>promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> that Religion which he only believes to be true, or none at all. I grant that a strong Assurance of any Truth settled upon prevalent and well-grounded Arguments of Probability, is often called Knowledg in popular ways of Talking: but being here to distinguish between Knowledg and Belief, to what Degrees of Considence soever raised, their Boundaries must be kept, and their Names not confounded. I know not what greater Pledg a Man can give of a full Perswasion of the Truth of any thing, than his venturing his Soul upon it, as he does, who sincerely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49288:4"/>
any Religion, and receives it for true. But to what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree soever of Assurance his Faith may rise, it still comes short of Knowledg. Nor can any one now, I think, arrive to greater Evidence of the Truth of the Christian Religion, than the first Converts in the time of our Saviour and the Apostles had; of whom yet nothing more was required but to believe.</p>
            <p>But supposing all the Truths of the Christian Religion necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation could be so known to the Magistrate, that in his Use of Force for the bringing Men to imbrace these, he could be guided by infallible Certainty; yet I fear this would not serve your turn, nor authorize the Magistrate to use Force to bring Men in <hi>England,</hi> or any where else, into the Communion of the National Church, in which Ceremonies of humane Institution were imposed, which could not be known, nor (being confessed things in their own Nature indifferent) so much as thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>But of this I shall have occasion to speak in another Place: all the Use I make of it here, is to shew, that the Cross in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, kneeling at the Sacrament, and such like things, being impossible to be known necessary to Salvation, a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Truth of the Articles of Faith of any Church, could not authorize the Magistrate to compel Men to imbra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the Communion of that Church, wherein any thing were made necessary to Communion, which he did not know was necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>By what has been already said, I suppose it is evident, that if the Magistrate be to use Force only for promoting <hi>the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> he can have no other Guide but his own Perswasion of what is <hi>the true Religion,</hi> and must be led by that in his Use of Force, or else not use it at all in matters of Religion. If you take the latter of these Consequences, you and I are agreed: if the former, you must allow all Magistrates, of whatsoever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Use of Force to bring Men to theirs, and so be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in all those ill Consequences which you cannot it seems admit, and hoped to decline by your useless Distinction of Force to be us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d, not for any, but for the true Religion.</p>
            <p>

                  </gap>ing the true Religion.</hi> And in several Places you tell us, he is <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>liged</hi> to it. Perswade Magistrates in general of this, and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ll me how any Magistrate shall be restrained from the Use of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49288:4"/>
Force, for the promoting what he thinks to be the true? For he being perswaded that it is his Duty to use Force to promote the true Religion, and being also perswaded his is the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, What shall stop his Hand? Must he forbear the Use of Force till he be got beyond believing, into a certain Knowledg that all he requires Men to imbrace, is necessary to Salvation? If that be it you will stand to, you have my Consent, and I think there will be no need of any other Toleration. But if the believing his Religion to be the true, be sufficient for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to use Force for the promoting of it, will it be so only to the Magistrates of the Religion that you pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

If it be your Magistrate's Duty to use Force for the promoting the Religion he believes to be the true, it will be every Magistrate's Duty to use Force for the promoting what he believes to be the true, and he sins if he does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and promote it as if it were true. If you will not take this upon my Word, yet I desire you to do it upon the strong Reason of a very judicious and reverend Prelate of the present Church of <hi>England, In a discourse concerning Conscience,</hi> printed in 4to, 87. <hi>p.</hi> 18. You will find these following Words, and much more to this Purpose: <hi>Where a Man is mistaken in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even in that Case it is always a Sin to act against it. Though we should take that for a Duty which is really a Sin, yet so long as we are thus perswaded, it will be highly criminal in us to act in contradiction to this Perswasion: and the Reason of this is evident, because by so doing, we wilfully act against the best Light which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent we have for the Direction of our Actions. So that when all is done, the immediate Guide of our Actions can be nothing but our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, our Judgment and Perswasion. If a Man, for Instance, should of a Jew become a Christian, whilst yet in his Heart he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the Messiah is not yet come, and that our Lord Jesus was an Impostor: Or if a Papist should renounce the Communion of the Roman Church, and join with ours, whilst yet he is perswaded that the Roman Church is the only Catholick Church, and that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches are Heretical or Schismatical; though now there is none of us that will d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These things put together, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to consider whether <hi>if Magistrates are obliged to use Force to bring Men to the true Religion,</hi> every Magistrate is not oblig'd to use Force to bring Men to that Religion he believes to be true?</p>
            <p>This being so, I hope I have not argued so wholly besides the purpose, as you all through your Letter accuse me, for charging on your Doctrine all the ill Consequences, all the Prejudice it would be to the true Religion, that Magistrates should have Power, to use Force to bring Men to their Religions: and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume you will think your self concerned to give to all these Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the <hi>first and second Letter concerning Toleration,</hi> which shew the Inconveniences and Absurdities of such an use of Force, some other Answer, than that you <hi>are for punishing only such as reject the</hi>

               <hi>true Religion. That 'tis plain the Force you speak of is not Force,</hi> my <hi>way applied,</hi> i. e. <hi>applied to the promoting the true Religion only, but to the promoting all the National Religions in the World.</hi> And again, <note place="margin">P. 29.</note> to my arguing that Force your way applied, if it can propagate any Religion, it is likelier to be the false than the true, because few of the Magistrates of the World are in the right way. You reply, This <hi>would have been to the purpose, if</hi> you <hi>had asserted that every Magistrate may use Force</hi> your <hi>indirect way (or any way) to bring Men to his own Religion, whatever that be. But if</hi> you asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>no such thing, (as no Man</hi> you <hi>think but an Atheist will assert it) then this is quite besides the business.</hi> This is the great Strength <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> of your Answer, and your Refuge almost in every page. So that I presume it reasonable to expect that you should clearly and directly answer what I have here said, or else find some other Answer than what you have done to the <hi>second Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Toleration.</hi> However acute you are in your way in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places on this occasion, as <hi>p.</hi> 11, 12. for my Answer to which I shall refer you to another place.</p>

               <hi>I might have considered that this Argument concerns none but those who assert that every Magistrate has a right to use Force to promote his own Religion, whatever it be, which</hi> you <hi>think no Man that has</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 15.</note> 
               <hi>any Religion will assert.</hi> I suppose you may think now this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer will scarce serve, and you must assert either no Magistrate to have right to promote his Religion by Force, or else be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in the Condemnation you pass on those who ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And here I think, as to the decision of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion betwixt us, I might leave this Matter: but there being in your Letter a great many other gross Mistakes, wrong Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and fallacious Arguings, which in those general and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Terms you have made use of in several places, as best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your turn, may possibly have imposed on your self, as well as they are fitted to do so on others, and therefore will deserve to have some notice taken of them; I shall give my self the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of examining your Letter a little farther.</p>
            <p>To my saying, <q>It is not for the Magistrate, upon an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of its Usefulness, to make use of any other Means than what the Author and Finisher of our Faith had directed;</q> you reply, <hi>Which how true soever, is not, I think, very much to the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 31.</note> 
               <hi>purpose. For if the Magistrate does only assist that Ministry which our Lord has appointed, by using so much of his coactive Power for the furthering their Service, as common Experience discovers to be useful and necessary for that End; there is no manner of ground to say, that</hi> 
               <q>upon an Imagination of its Usefulness, <hi>he makes use</hi> of any other Means for the Salvation of Mens Souls, than what the Author and Finisher of our Faith has directed.</q> 
               <hi>'Tis true indeed</hi> the Author and Finisher of our Faith <hi>has given the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate no new Power or Commission, nor was there any need that he should, (if himself had had any Temporal Power to give:) for he found him already, even by the Law of Nature,</hi> the Minister of God to the People for Good, and bearing the Sword not in vain, <hi>i. e. invested with coactive Power, and obliged to use it for all the good Purposes which it might serve, and for which it should be found need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; even for the restraining of false and corrupt Religion; as</hi> Job <hi>long before (perhaps before any part of the Scriptures were written) acknowledged, when he said, that the worshipping the</hi> Sun <hi>or the</hi> Moon, <hi>was</hi> an Iniquity to be punished by the Judg. <hi>But though our Saviour has given the Magistrates no new Power, yet being</hi> King of Kings, <hi>he expects and requires that they should submit themselves</hi>

            <p>So far therefore is the Christian Magistrate, when he gives his helping Hand to the furtherance of the G spel, by laying convenient Penalties upon such as reject it, or any part of it, from <hi>using any other Means</hi> for the Salvation of Mens Souls, <hi>than what the Author and Finisher of our Faith has directed,</hi> that he does no more than his Duty to God, to his Redeemer, and to his Subjects, requires of him.</p>
            <p>The Sum of your Reply amounts to this, that <hi>by the Law of Nature</hi> the Magistrate may make use of his coactive Power where it is <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> for the Good of the People. If it be from the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> it must be to all Magistrates equally: And then I ask whether this Good they are to promote without any <hi>new Power or Commission</hi> from our Saviour, be what they think to be so, or what they certainly know to be so. If it be what they think to be so, then all Magistrates may use Force to bring Men to their Religion: and what Good this is like to be to Men, or of what use to the true Religion, we have elsewhere considered. If it be only that Good which they certainly know to be so, they will be very ill enabled to do what you require of them, which you here tell us is <hi>to assist that Ministry which our Lord has appointed.</hi> Which of the Magistrates of your time did you know to have so well studied the Controyersies about Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Church-Government, to be so well versed in Church-History and Succession, that you can undertake that he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew which was <hi>the Ministry which our Lord had appointed,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that of <hi>Sweden,</hi> whether the Episcopacy in one part of this Island, or the Presbytery in another, were <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry which our Lord had appointed?</hi> If you say, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And of what use such an exercise of the coactive Power of all Magistrates, is to the People, or to the true Religion, you are concerned to shew.

That there may be such Neglects in the best-constituted National Church in the World, the Complaints of a very knowing Bishop of our Church in a late <hi>Discourse of the PASTORAL CARE,</hi> is too plain an Evidence.</p>
            <p>Without so great an Authority I should scarce have ventured (though it lay just in my way) to have taken notice of what is so visible, that it is in every one's Mouth, for fear you should have told me again, that <hi>I made my self an occasion to shew my Good-will toward the Clergy.</hi> For you will not, I suppose, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that eminent Prelate to have any Ill-will to them.</p>
            <p>If this were not so, that some were negligent, I imagine the Preachers of the True Religion (which lies, as you tell us, so <hi>obvious</hi> and <hi>exposed,</hi> as to be easily distinguish'd from the False) would need or desire no other Assistance from the <hi>Magistrates co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active Power,</hi> but what should be directed against the Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mens Lives; <hi>their Lusts</hi> being that alone, as you tell us, that makes Force necessary to assist the true Religion; which were it not for our depraved Nature, would by its Light and Reasonableness have the advantage against all sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Indeed you telling us a little above in the same page, that it is a <hi>Vice not to worship God in Ways prescribed by those to whom God has left the ordering of such Matters;</hi> you seem to make other Judges of what is <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>decent,</hi> and the Magistrate but the Executor of their Decrees with the <hi>Assistance</hi> of his <hi>coactive Power.</hi> A pretty Foundation to establish <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> on, that God has lest the <hi>order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of them to those who cannot <hi>impose</hi> them, and the imposing of them to those who cannot order them. But still the same Difficulty returns; for after they have <hi>prescribed,</hi> must the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate judg them to be <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>decent,</hi> or must he impose them, though he judg them not <hi>sound or decent?</hi> If he must judg them so himself, we are but where we were: if he must impose them when prescribed, though he judg them not <hi>sound</hi> nor <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> 'tis a pretty sort of Drudgery is put on the Magistrate: And how far is this short of implicite Faith? But if he must not judg what is <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>decent,</hi> he must judg at least who <hi>are those to whom God has left the ordering of such Matters;</hi> and then the King of <hi>France</hi> is ready again with his Dragoons for the <hi>sound</hi> Doctrine, and <hi>decent</hi> Ceremonies of his Prescribers in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and that upon this ground, with as good right as any other has for the Prescriptions of any others. Do not mistake me again, Sir; I do not say, he judges as right; but I do say, that whilst he judges the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> to be those to <hi>whom God has left the ordering of those Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> he has as much right to follow their Decrees, as any other to sollow the Judgment of any other Set of mortal Men whom he believes to be so.</p>

1. Of what Use and Necessity is it among Christians that own the Scripture to be the Word of God and Rule os Faith, to make and impose a Creed? What Commission for this hath the Magistrate from the Law of Nature? God hath given a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation that contains in it all things necessary to Salvation, and of this his People are all perswad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d. What Necessity now is there? How does their Good require it, that the Magistrate should single out, as he thinks sit, any number of those Truths as more necessary to Salvation than the rest, if God himself has not done it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. But next, are these Creeds in the Words of the Scripture or not? If they are, they are certainly <hi>sound,</hi> as containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Truth in them: and so they were before as they lay in the Scripture. But thus though they contain nothing but sound Truths, yet they may be imperfect, and so <hi>unsound</hi> Rules of Faith, since they may require more or less than God requires to be believed as necessary to Salvation. For what greater ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity I pray is there that a Man should believe that Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> than that he was born at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Judah?</hi> Both are certainly true, and no Christian doubts of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But how comes one to be made an Article of Faith, and imposed by the Magistrate as necessary to Salvation, (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there can be no necessity of Imposition) and the other not?</p>
            <p>Do not mistake me here, as if I would lay by that Summary of the Christian Religion, which is contained in that which is called the Apostles Creed; which though no body who examines the Matter, will have reason to conclude of the Apostles compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet is certainly of reverend Antiquity, and ought still to be preserved in the Church. I mention it not to argue against it, but against your Imposition, and to shew that even that Creed, though of that Antiquity, though it contain in it all the <hi>Credenda</hi> necessary to Salvation, cannot yet upon your Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be imposed by the <hi>

            <p>But if the Creed to be imposed be not in the Words of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation; then it is in plainer, more clear and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expressions, or not: if no plainer, what necessity of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging those, which Men inspired by the Holy Ghost made use of? If you say, they are plainer; then they explain and determine
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49288:8"/>
the Sense of some obscure and dubious Places of Scripture, which Explication not being of divine Revelation, though <hi>sound</hi> to one Man, may be unsound to another, and cannot be imposed as Truths necessary to Salvation. Besides that, this destroys what you tell us of the <hi>Obviousness</hi> of all Truths necessary to <note place="margin">

            <p>And as to Rites and Ceremonies, are there any necessary to Salvation, which Christ has not instituted? if not, how can the Magistrate impose them? What Commission has he from the Care he ought to have <hi>for the Salvation of Mens Souls,</hi> to use his <hi>coactive</hi> Force for the Establishment of any new ones which our Lord and Saviour (with due Reverence be it spoken) had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten? He instituted two Rites in his Church; Can any one add any new one to them? Christ commanded simply to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; but the signing of the Cross, how came that necessary? <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority which is necessary to assist the Truth against the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humane Nature,</hi> has made it so. But 'tis a <hi>decent</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. I ask, Is it so decent that the Administration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, simply, as our Saviour instituted, would be indecent without it? If not, then there is no Reason to impose it for <hi>Decency's</hi> sake; for there can be no Reason to alter or add any thing to the Institution of Christ, or introduce any Ceremony or Circumstance into Religion for Decency, where the Action would be <hi>decent</hi> without it. The Command to do all things <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently</hi> and in Order, gave no Authority to add to Christ's Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution any new Ceremony, it only prescribed the manner how, what was necessary to be done in the Congregation, should be there done, (<hi>viz.</hi>) after such a manner, that if it were omitted, there would appear some Indecency, whereof the Congregation or collective Body was to be Judg, for to them that Rule was given: and if that Rule go beyond what I have said, and gives Power to Men to introduce into Religious Worship whatever they shall think decent, and impose the Use of it; I do not see how the greatest part of the infinite Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could be complained of, or refused, if introduced into another Church, and there imposed by the Magistrate. But if such a Power were given to the Magistrate, that whatever he thought a <hi>decent Ceremony,</hi> he might <hi>de novo</hi> impose, he would need some express Commission from God in Scripture, since the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49288:8"/>
Commission you say he has from the Law of Nature, will never give him a Power to institute new Ceremonies in the Christian Religion, which, be they <hi>decent,</hi> or what they will, can never be necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>The Gospel was to be preached in their Assemblies, the Rule then was that the Habit, Gesture, Voice, Language, &amp;c. of the Preacher (for these were necessary Circumstances of the Action) should have nothing ridiculous or indecent in it. The Praises of God were to be sung; it must be then in such Postures and Tunes as became the Solemnity of that Action. And so a Convert was to be baptized, Christ instituted the essential part of that Action, which was washing with Water in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; in which Care was also to be had, that in the doing this nothing should be omitted that preserved a Decency in all the Circumstances of the Action. But no Body will say that if the Cross were omitted, that upon that Account there would be any thing indecent in Baptism.</p>
            <p>What is to be done in the Assemblies of Christians for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls, is sufficiently prescribed in Scripture: But since the Circumstances of the Actions were so various, and might in several Countries and Ages have different Appearances (as that appears decent in one Country which is quite contrary in another) concerning them there could be no other Rule given than what is, <hi>viz. decently, in Order,</hi> and <hi>to Edification;</hi> and in avoiding Indecenci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

You say there, <hi>If such a Degree of outward Force as has been mentioned, be of great and even necessary Vse for the advancing those Ends, (as taking the World as we find it, I think it appears to be) then it must be acknowledged that there is a Right somewhere to use it for the advancing those Ends, unless we will say (what without Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety cannot be said) that the wise and benign Disposer and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of all things has not furnished Mankind with compe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>And if there be such a Right somewhere, where should it be, but where the Power of compelling resides? That is principally, and in reference to the Publick in the Civil Soveraign.</hi> Which Words, if they have any Argument in them, it in short stands thus. Force is <hi>useful and necessary:</hi> the good and wise God (who without Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety cannot be supposed not to have <hi>furnished</hi> Men with compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent means for their Salvation) has therefore given a Right to some Men to use it, and those Men are the Civil Soveraigns.</p>
            <p>To make this Argument of any Use to your Purpose, you must speak a little more distinctly, (for here you, according to your laudable and safe way of Writing, are wrapp'd up in the Uncertainty of general terms) and must tell us, besides the End for which it is <hi>useful and necessary,</hi> to whom it is <hi>useful and necessary.</hi> Is it <hi>useful and necessary</hi> to all Men? That you will not say, for many are brought to imbrace the true Religion by bare Preaching, without any Force. Is it then necessary to all those, and those only, who as you tell us, <hi>reject the true Religion tendered with sufficient Evidence, or at least so far manifested to them, as to oblige them to receive it, and to leave them without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse if they do not?</hi> To all therefore, who rejecting the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion so tendered, are without Excuse, your <hi>moderate Force is useful and necessary.</hi> But is it to all those <hi>competent,</hi> i. e. <hi>sufficient means?</hi> That 'tis evident in matter of Fact, it is not; for after all, many stand out. 'Tis like you will say, which is all you have to say, that those are such, who having resisted this last means, <hi>moderate Force,</hi> God always refuseth his Grace to, without which no means is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>fficacious. So that your <hi>Competent</hi> at last, are only such <hi>means</hi> as are the utmost that God has appointed, and will have used, and which when Men resist, they are without Excuse, and shall never after have the Assistance of his Grace to bring them to <hi>that Truth they have resisted,</hi> and so be as the Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> III. 8. calls such, <hi>Men of corrupt Minds, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate concerning the Faith.</hi> If then it shall be, that the Day of Grace shall be over to all those who <hi>reject the Truth manifested</hi> to them, with such Evidence, <hi>as leaves them without Excuse,</hi> and that bare Preaching and Exhortation shall be according to the good Pleasure of the benign Disposer of all things, enough (when neglected) <hi>to make their Hearts fat, their Ears heavy, and shut their Eyes that they should not perceive nor understand, nor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49288:9"/>
that <hi>God should heal them.</hi> I say, if this should be the Case, then your <hi>Force,</hi> whatever you imagine of it, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>petent, useful,</hi> nor <hi>necessary.</hi> So that it will rest upon you to prove that your <hi>moderate Degrees</hi> of Force are those means of Grace which God will have, as necessary to Salvation, tried upon every one before he will pass that Sentence in <hi>Isaiah, Make his Heart fat,</hi> &amp;c. and that your Degree of moderate Force is that beyond which God will have no other or more powerful means used, but that those whom that works not upon, shall be left <hi>reprobate concerning Faith.</hi> And till you have proved this, you will in vain pretend your <hi>moderate Force</hi> (whatever you might think of it, if you had the ordering of that Matter in the Place of God) to be <hi>useful, necessary,</hi> and <hi>competent</hi> means. For if Preaching, Exhortation, Instruction, &amp;c. as seems by the whole Current of the Scripture, (and it appears not that <hi>Isaiah</hi> in the Place above-cited, <hi>made their Hearts far</hi> with any thing but his Words) be that means, which when rejected to such a Degree, as he sees fit, God will punish with a <hi>Reprobate</hi> Mind, and that there be no other means of Grace to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; you must confess that whatever good Opinion you have of your moderate Force after this Sentence is passed, it can do no good, have no Efficacy neither <hi>directly</hi> nor <hi>indirectly,</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a Distance,</hi> towards the bringing Men to the Truth.</p>
            <p>If your moderate Force be not that precise utmost means of Grace, which when ineffectual, God will not afford his Grace to any other, then your moderate Force is not the <hi>comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tent means</hi> you talk of. This therefore you must prove that Preaching alone is not, but that your moderate Force join'd to it is that means of Grace, which when neglected or r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ted, God will assist no other means with his Grace to bring Men into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Truth; and this let me tell you, you must prove by Revelation. For it is impossible to know, but by Revelation, the just Measures of God's Long-suffering, and what those means are, which when Mens Corruptions have rendred ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, his Spirit shall no longer strive with them, nor his Grace assist any other means for their Conversion or Salvation. When you have done this, there will be some Ground for you to talk of your <hi>moderate Force,</hi> as the means which God's Wisdom and Goodness is ingaged to furnish Men with; but to speak of it, as you do now, as if it were that both <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>competent</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49288:10"/>
means, that it would be an Imputation to the Wisdom and Goodness of God, if Men were not furnished with it, when 'tis evident, that the greatest part of Mankind have always been destitute of it, will I fear be not easily cleared from that <hi>Impiety</hi> you mention; for though the Magistrate had the <hi>Right</hi> to use it, yet where-ever that <hi>moderate Force</hi> was not made use of, there Men were not furnished with your <hi>competent means</hi> of Salvation.</p>
            <p>'Tis necessary for the Vindication of God's Justice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that those who miscarry should do so by their own Fault, that their Destruction should be from themselves, and they be left inexcusable: But pray how will you shew us, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that any who have resisted the Truth tendered to them only by Preaching, should be saved, any more than it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that those who have resisted the Truth when moderate Force has been joined to the same Preaching, should be saved? They are inexcusable one as well as the other, and thereby have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the Wrath of God, under which he may justly leave the one as well as the other; and therefore he cannot be said not to have been furnished with competent means of Salvation, who having rejected the Truth preached to him, has never any Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties laid on him by the Magistrate to make him consider the Truths he before rejected.</p>
            <p>All the Stress of your <hi>Hypothesis</hi> for the Necessity of Force lies on this, That the Majority of Mankind are not prevailed on by Preaching, and therefore the Goodness and Wisdom of God is obliged to furnish them with some more effectual means, as you think. But who told you that the Majority of Mankind should ever be brought into the strait way, and narrow Gate? Or that Force in your moderate Degree was the <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>competent, i. e.</hi> the just sit means to do it, neither over nor under, but that that only, and nothing but that could do it? If to vindicate his Wisdom and Goodness, God must furnish Mankind with other means, as long as the Majority, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought upon, shall give any forward Demander occasion to ask, <hi>What other means is there left?</hi> He must also after your <hi>moderate Penalties</hi> have left the greater part of Mankind unprevailed on, be bound to furnish Mankind with higher Degrees of Force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Man's Demand: And those Degrees of Force proving ineffectual to the Majority to make them truly and sincerely Christians, God must be bound to furnish the World again with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49288:10"/>
a new Supply of Miracles upon the Demand of another wise Controuler, who having set his Heart upon Miracles, as you have yours on Force, will demand, what other means is there left but Miracles? for 'tis like this last Gent. would take it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much amiss of you, if you should not allow this to be a good and unquestionable way of arguing; or if you should deny that after the utmost Force had been used, Miracles might not do <hi>some Service</hi> at least, <hi>indirectly and at a Distance,</hi> towards the <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men to imbrace the Truth.</hi> And if you cannot <hi>prove</hi> that Mi-racles may not thus <hi>do some Service,</hi> he will conclude just as you do, that the Cause is his.</p>
            <p>Let us try your Method a little farther. Suppose that when <hi>neither the gentlest Admonitions, nor the most earnest Intreaties will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,</hi> something else is to be done as the only means left, What is it must be done? What is this <hi>necessary competent means</hi> that you tell us of? <hi>It is to lay Briars and Thorns in their way.</hi> This <note place="margin">P. 10</note> therefore being supposed necessary, you say, <hi>there must some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where be a Right to use it.</hi> Let it be so. Suppose I tell you that Right is in God, who certainly has a Power <hi>to lay Briars and Thorns in the way</hi> of those who <hi>are got into a wrong one,</hi> whenever he is graciously pleased that other Means besides Instructions and Admonitions should be used to <hi>reduce</hi> them. And we may as well expect that those <hi>Thorns and Briars</hi> laid in their way by God's Providence, without telling them for what End, should work upon them as effectually, <hi>though indirectly, and at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> as those laid in their way by the Magistrate, without telling them for what End. God alone knows where it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and on whom it will be useful, which no Man being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of knowing, no Man, though he has coercive Power in his Hand, can be supposed to be authorized to use it by the Commission he has to do Good, on whomsoever you shall judg it to be, <hi>of great and even necessary use:</hi> No more than your judging it to be of <hi>great and even necessary use,</hi> would authorize any one who had got one of the Incision-Knives of the Hospital in his Hand, to cut those for the Stone with it, whom he could not know needed cutting, or that cutting would do them any good, when the Master of the Hospital had given him no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Order to use his Incision-Knife in that Operation; nor was it known to any but the Master, who needed, and on whom it would be useful; nor would he fail to use it himself wherever he found it necessary.</p>

Be Force of as <hi>great and necessary use</hi> as you please; let it be so the <hi>competent Means for the promoting the Honour of God in the World, and the Good of Souls,</hi> that <hi>the right to use it</hi> must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>be somewhere.</hi> This <hi>Right</hi> cannot possibly be, where you would have it, in the <hi>Civil Soveraigns,</hi> and that for the very reason you give, <hi>viz.</hi> because it must be <hi>where the Power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling resides.</hi> For since <hi>Civil Soveraigns</hi> cannot compel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor can the <hi>compelling</hi> Power of one <hi>Civil Soveraign</hi> reach another Civil Soveraign, it will not in the hands of the <hi>Civil Soveraigns</hi> reach the most considerable part of Mankind, and those both for their own and their Subjects Good, have most need of it. Besides, if it go along with the <hi>Power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling,</hi> it must be in the hands of all <hi>Civil Soveraigns</hi> alike: which by this, as well as several other Reasons I have given, being unavoidable to be so, this Right will be so far from useful, that whatever efficacy Force has, it will be imployed to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Harm than Good; since the greatest part of <hi>Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns</hi> being of false Religions, Force will be imployed for the promoting of those.</p>
            <p>But let us grant what you can never prove, that though all <hi>Civil Soveraigns</hi> have <hi>compelling Power,</hi> yet only those of the true Religion have a right to use Force in Matters of Religion: your own Argument of <hi>Mankind being unfurnished</hi> (which is Impiety to say) <hi>with competent Means for the promoting the Honour of God, and the Good of Souls,</hi> still presses you. For the <hi>compelling Power</hi> of each <hi>Civil Soveraign</hi> not reaching beyond his own Dominions, <hi>the right of using Force</hi> in the hands only of the Orthodox <hi>Civil Soveraigns,</hi> leaves the rest, which is the far greater part of the World, destitute of this your necessary <hi>and competent Means for promoting the Honour of God in the World, and the Good of Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, I return you my Thanks for having given me this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to take a review of your Argument, which you told me I had mistaken; which I hope I now have not, and have answered to your Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>I confess I mistook when I said that cutting being judg'd use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, could not authorize even a skilful Surgeon to cut a Man without any farther Commission: for it should have been thus; That though a Man has the Instruments in his Hand, and Force enough to cut with; and cutting be judg'd by you <hi>of great and even necessary</hi> Use in the Stone; yet this, without any farther
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49288:11"/>
Commission, will not authorize any one to use his Strength and Knise in Cutting, who knows not who has the Stone, nor has any Light or Measures to judg to whom Cutting may be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or useful.</p>
            <p>But let us see what you say in answer to my Instance: 1. <hi>That</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 53.</note> 
               <hi>the Stone does not always kill, though it be not cured; but Men do often live to a great Age with it, and die at last of other Distempers. But Aversion to the true Religion is certainly and inevitably mortal to the Soul, if not cured, and so of absolute necessity to be cured. Is it of absolute necessity to be cured</hi> in all? Is so, will you not here again think it requisite that the <hi>wise and benign Disposer and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of all things,</hi> should <hi>furnish competent Means</hi> for what is of <hi>absolute necessity?</hi> For will it not be <hi>Impiety</hi> to say, that God hath left Mankind <hi>unfurnished of competent,</hi> i. e. <hi>sufficient Means</hi> for what is <hi>absolutely necessary?</hi> For it is plain in your Account Men have not been furnished with <hi>sufficient</hi> Means for what is of <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity</hi> to be cured in all, if in any of them it be left uncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For as you allow none to be <hi>sufficient</hi> Evidence, but what <note place="margin">P. 51.</note> certainly gains Assent; so by the same Rule you cannot call that <hi>sufficient</hi> Means which does not work the Cure. It is in vain to say, the Means were <hi>sufficient,</hi> had it not been for their own Fault, when that Fault of theirs is the very thing to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. You go on; <hi>And yet if we should suppose the</hi> Stone <hi>as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 53.</note> 
               <hi>destructive of this temporal Life, as that Aversion is of Mens Eternal Salvation: even so the necessity of curing it would be as much less than the necessity of curing that Aversion, as this temporal Life falls short in value of that which is Eternal.</hi> This is built upon a supposition, that the necessity of the Means is increased by the value of the End, which being in this case the Salvation of Mens Souls, that is of insinite concernment to them, you conclude Salvation <hi>absolutely necessary:</hi> which makes you say that <hi>Aversion,</hi> &amp;c. being <hi>inevitably mortai to the Soul,</hi> is of <hi>absolute necessity to be cured.</hi> Nothing <hi>is of absolute necessity</hi> but God: whatsoever else can be said to be of <hi>necessity,</hi> is so only relatively in respect to something else; and therefore nothing can indefinitely thus be said to be of <hi>absolute necessity,</hi> where the thing it relates to is not absolutely necessary. We may say, <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> in God are <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> because God himself is <hi>absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:</hi> but we cannot crudely say, the curing in Men their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to the true Religion, is <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> because it is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49288:12"/>
not <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> that Men should be saved. But this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper and true to be said, that curing this <hi>Aversion</hi> is <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary</hi> in all that shall be saved. But I fear that would not serve your turn, tho it be certain that your <hi>absolute Necessity</hi> in this case reaches no farther than this, that to be cured of this <hi>Aversion</hi> is <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to Salvation, and Salvation is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary to Happiness; but neither of them, nor the Happiness it self of any Man can be said to be <hi>absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Mistake makes you say, that supposing <hi>the Stone certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destructive of this temporal Life, yet the necessity of curing it would be as much less than the necessity of curing that Aversion, as this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Life falls short in value of that which is eternal.</hi> Which is quite otherwise: for if the Stone will certainly kill a Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cutting, it is as <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to cut a Man of the Stone for the saving of his Life, as it is to cure the Aversion for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his Soul. Nay, if you have but Eggs to fry, Fire is as absolutely necessary as either of the other, though the value of the End be in these Cases infinitely different; for in one of them you lose only your Dinner, in the other your Life, and in the other your Soul. But yet in these Cases, Fire, Cutting, and <hi>Curing that Aversion,</hi> are each of them absolutely and equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to their respective Ends, because those Ends cannot be attained without them.</p>
            <p>You say farther, <hi>Cutting for the Stone is not always necessary in order to the Cure: But the Penalties you speak of are altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 53.</note> 
               <hi>(without extraordinary Grace) to cure that pernicious and otherwise untractable Aversion.</hi> Let it be so; but do the Surgeons know who has this <hi>Stone,</hi> this <hi>Aversion</hi> so, that it will certainly destroy him unless he be cut? Will you undertake to tell when the <hi>Aversion</hi> is such in any Man, that it is incurable by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Exhortation and Intreaty, if his spiritual Physician will be instant with him in season, and out of season; but certainly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if moderate Force be made use of? Till you are sure of the former of these, you can never say, your moderate Force is <hi>necessary:</hi> Till you are sure of the latter, you can never say, it is <hi>competent</hi> Means. What you will determine concerning <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Grace,</hi> and when God bestows that, I leave you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, and speak clearly of it at your leisure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49288:12"/>
You add, That even where <hi>Cutting for the Stone is necessary, it is withal hazardous by my Confession. But your Penalties can no way endanger or hurt the Soul, but by the Fault of him that undergoes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 53.</note> 
               <hi>them.</hi> If the Magistrate use Force to bring Men to the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he must judg which is the true Religion; and he can judg no other to be it but that which he believes to be the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is his own Religion. But for the Magistrate to use Force to bring Men to his own Religion, has so much Danger in it to Mens Souls, that by your own confession, <hi>none but an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist</hi> will say that Magistrates may use Force to bring Men to their own Religion.</p>
            <p>This I suppose is enough to make good all that I aimed at in my Instance of Cutting for the Stone, which was, that though it were judg'd <hi>useful,</hi> and I add now <hi>necessary</hi> to cut Men for the Stone, yet that was not enough to authorize Chirurgions to cut a Man, but he must have besides that general one of doing good, some more special Commission; and that which I there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was the Patient's Consent. But you tell me, <hi>That though,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 54.</note> 
               <hi>as things now stand, no Surgeon has any right to cut his calculous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient without his Consent; yet if the Magistrate should by a publick Law appoint and authorize a competent number of the most skilful in that Art, to visit such as labour under that Disease, and to cut those (whether they consent or not) whose Lives they unanimously judg it impossible to save otherwise:</hi> you are <hi>apt to think</hi> I <hi>would find it hard to prove that in so doing he exceeded the Bounds of his Power: And</hi> you are <hi>sure it would be as hard to prove that those Artists would have no right in that case to cut such Persons.</hi> Shew such a Law from the great Governor of the Universe, and I shall yield that your Surgeons shall go to work as fast as you please. But where is the publick Law? Where is the <hi>competent Number of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates skilful in the Art, who must unanimously judg of the Disease and its Danger?</hi> You can shew nothing of all this, yet you are so liberal of this sort of Cure, that one cannot take you for less than cutting <hi>Morecraft</hi> himself. But, Sir, if there were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of skilful and impartial Men, who were to use the Incision-Knife on all in whom they found this Stone of <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to the true Religion; what do you think, would they sind no Work in your Hospital?</p>
            <p>Aversion to the true Religion you say is <hi>of absolute Necessity to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thirdly, How is your <hi>necessary</hi> Remedy to be applied? And that is in a way wherein it cannot work the Cure, though we should suppose the true Religion the National every where, and all the Magistrates in the World zealous for it. To this true Religion say you Men have a natural and great <hi>Aversion of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Necessity to be cured,</hi> and the only Cure for it is Force your way applied, <hi>i. e.</hi> Penalties must be laid upon all that dissent from the National Religion, till they conform. Why are Men averse to the true? Because it crosses the Profits and Pleasures of this Life; and for the same Reason they have an Aversion to Penalties: These therefore, if they be opposed one to another, and Penalties be so laid that Men must quit their Lusts, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily imbrace the true Religion or else indure the Penalties, there may be some Efficacy in Force towards bringing Men to the true Religion: But if there be no Opposition between an outward Profession of the true Religion, and Mens Lusts; Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties laid on Men till they outwardly conform, are not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy laid to the Disease. Punishments so applied have no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to Mens Lusts, nor from thence can be expected any Cure. Men must be driven from their Aversion to the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by Penalties they have a greater Aversion to. This is all the Operation of Force. But if by getting into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the National Church they can avoid the Penalties, and yet retain their natural Corruption and Aversion to the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, what Remedy is there to the Disease by Penalties so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied?

You would, you say, have Men made <hi>uneasy.</hi> This no doubt will work on Men, and make them indeavour to get out of this uneasy State as soon as they can. But it will always be by that way wherein they can be most easy; for 'tis the Uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness alone they fly from, and therefore they will not exchange one Uneasiness for another; not for a greater, nor an equal, nor any at all, if they can help it. If therefore it be so <hi>uneasy</hi> for Men to <hi>mortify</hi> their <hi>Lusts,</hi> as you tell us, <hi>which the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>

               <hi>requires of them,</hi> if they imbrace it in earnest: But which outward Conformity to the true Religion, or any National Church, does not require, what need or use is there of Force ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied so, that it meets not at all with Mens Lusts, or Aversion to the true Religion, but leaves them the liberty of a quiet Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, free from Force and Penalties in a legal and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Consormity? Is a Man negligent of his Soul, and will not be brought to consider? obstinate, and will not imbrace the Truth? Is he careless, and will not be at the Pains to examine Matters of Religion? corrupt, and will not part with his Lusts, which are dearer to him than his First-born? 'Tis but owning the National Profession, and he may be so still: If he conform, the Magistrate has done punishing, he is a Son of the Church, and need not consider any thing farther for fear of Penalties, they are removed, and all is well. So that at last there neither being an absolute Necessity that <hi>Aversion to the true Religion</hi> should in all Men be cured: nor the Magistrate being a competent Judg who have this Stone of <hi>Aversion,</hi> or who have it to that degree as to need Force to cure it, or in whom it is curable, were Force a proper Remedy as it is not: nor having any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to use it, notwithstanding what you have answered: It is still not only <hi>as,</hi> but <hi>more</hi> reasonable for the Magistrate, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of its Usefulness or Necessity, to cut any one for the Stone without his own Consent, than to use Force your way to cure him of Aversion to the true Religion.</p>

Right of using Force into a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> Prince's Hand, for the promoting of Christianity? which of my Pagans or Mahumetans would have done otherwise?</p>
            <p>But God, you say, has done it, and you make it good by telling me in the following Words, <hi>If this startle me, then you must tell me farther, that you look upon the supream Power to be the same all the World over, in what Hands soever it is placed; and this Right to be contained in it: And if those that have it do not use it as they ought, but instead of promoting true Religion by proper Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, set themselves to enforce</hi> Mahumetanism <hi>or</hi> Paganism, <hi>or any other false Religion: All that can or that needs be said to the matter, is, that God will one Day call them to an Account for the Neglect of their Duty, for the Dishonour they do to him, and for the Souls that perish by their Fault.</hi> Your taking this <hi>Right</hi> to be a part of <hi>the supream Power</hi> of all <hi>Civil Sovereigns,</hi> (which is the thing in Question) is not, as I take it, proving it to be so. But let us take it so for once, what then is your Answer? <hi>God will one Day call those Sovereigns to an Account for the Neglect of their Duty.</hi> The Question is not, What God will do with the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns</hi> who have neglected their Duty; but how <hi>Mankind</hi> is <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished</hi> with your <hi>competent Means for the promoting of God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the World, and the good of Souls</hi> in Countries where the <hi>Soveraign</hi> is of a wrong Religion? For there, how clearly soever the Right of using it be in the <hi>Soveraign,</hi> yet as long as he uses not Force to bring his Subjects to the true Religion, they are destitute of your <hi>competent</hi> means. For I imagine you do not make the <hi>Right</hi> to use that Force, but the actual Application of it by Penal Laws to be your <hi>useful and necessary Means.</hi> For if you think the bare having that <hi>Right</hi> be enough, if that be your <hi>sufficient Means</hi> without the actual Use of Force, we readily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it you. And (as I tell you elsewhere) I see not then what need you had of Miracles to <hi>supply the Want of the Magistrates Assistance, till Christianity was supported and incouraged by the Laws of the Empire:</hi> For, by your own Rule, the Magistrates of the World, during the three first Centuries after the publishing the Christian Religion, had the same <hi>Right,</hi> if that had been enough, that they have now in <hi>Turkey, Persia,</hi> or <hi>China.</hi> That this <hi>is all that can be said in this matter,</hi> I easily grant you; but that <hi>it is all that needs be said</hi> to make good your Doctrine, I must beg your Pardon.</p>

And do not you own that those who have that Power, ought to punish those who offend in rejecting the true Religion? As to the remaining Part of that Paragraph, I shall leave the Reader to judg whether <hi>I sought any occasion</hi> so much as to name the <hi>Clergy;</hi> or whether the itching of your Fingers to be handling the Rod, guided not your Pen to what was nothing to the Purpose: For the Author had not said any thing so much as tending to exclude the Clergy from secular Imployments, but only (if you will take your own Report of it) that no Ecclesiastical Officer, as such, has any externally coactive Power; whereupon you cry out, that <hi>you do not yet understand why Ecclesiasticks or Clergymen are not as capable of such Power as other Men.</hi> Had you stood to be Constable of your Parish, or of the Hundred, you might have had Cause to vindicate thus your Capacity, if Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had been objected to you; or if your Aim be at a Justice of the Peace, or Lord Chief Justice of <hi>England,</hi> much more.

               <hi>the Magistrate knows the Truth, though he has no Authority to judg of Truth for another Man; yet he may be Judg whether other Men be alienated from the Truth or no; and so may have Authority to lay some Penalties upon those whom he sees to be so, to bring them to judg more sincerely for themselves.</hi> For Example, <hi>The Doctrine of the proper Ministers of Religion</hi> is, that the three Creeds, <hi>Nice, Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>'s, and that commonly call'd the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> ought to be thorowly received and believed: As also that the Old and New Testament contain all things necessary to Salvation. The one of these <hi>Doctrines</hi> a <hi>Papist</hi> Subject <hi>imbraces not;</hi> and a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> the other. What now is the Magistrate by your Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do? He is to lay Penalties upon them, and continue them: How long? Only till they conform, <hi>i. e.</hi> till they profess they imbrace these Doctrines for true. In which Case he does <hi>not judg of the Truth for other Men:</hi> he only <hi>judges</hi> that other Men are <hi>alienated from the Truth.</hi> Do you not now admire your own Subtilty and Acuteness? I that cannot comprehend this, tell you my dull Sense in the Case. He that thinks another Man in an Error, judges him, as you phrase it, <hi>alienated</hi> from the Truth, and then judges of Truth and Falshood only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But if he lays any Penalty upon others, which they are to lie under till they embrace for a Truth what he judges to be so, he is then so far <hi>a Judg of Truth</hi> for those others. This is what I think to <hi>judg of Truth for another,</hi> means: If you will tell me what else it signifies, I am ready to learn.</p>
            <p>You <hi>grant,</hi> you say, <hi>God never gave the Magistrate any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be Judg of Truth for another Man:</hi> and then add, <hi>But how does it follow from thence that he cannot be Judg, whether any Man be alienated from the Truth or no?</hi> And I ask you, Who ever said any such thing did follow from thence? That which I say, and which you ought to disprove, is, That whoever punishes others for not being of the Religion he judges to be true, judges of Truth for others. But you prove that a <hi>Man</hi> may <hi>be Judg of</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49288:16"/>
               <hi>Truth,</hi> without having <hi>Authority to judg of it for other Men, or to prescribe to them what they shall believe;</hi> which you might have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, till you meet with some body that denies it. But yet your proof of it is worth remembring: <hi>Rectum</hi> (say you) <hi>est Index sui &amp; obliqui. And certainly whoever does but know the Truth, may easily judg whether other Men be alienated from it or no.</hi> But tho <hi>Rectum</hi> be <hi>Index sui &amp; obliqui;</hi> yet a Man may be ignorant of that which is the right, and may take Error for Truth. The Truth of Religion when known, shews what contradicts it, is false: but yet that Truth may be unknown to the Magistrate, as well as to any other Man. But you conclude (I know not upon what ground) as if the Magistrate could not miss it, or were surer to find it than other Men. I suppose you are thus favourable only to the Magistrate of your own Profession, as no doubt in Civility a Papist or a Presbyterian would be to those of his. And then infer; <hi>And therefore if the Magistrate knows the Truth, though he has no Authority to judg of Truth for other Men, yet he may be Judg whether other Men be alienated from the Truth or no.</hi> Without doubt! who denies it him? 'Tis a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege that he and all Men have, that when they know the Truth, or believe the Truth, or have embraced an Error for Truth, they may <hi>judg whether other Men are alienated from it or no,</hi> if those other Men own their Opinions in that matter.</p>
            <p>You go on with your Inference, <hi>And so may have Authority to lay some Penalties upon those whom he sees to be so.</hi> Now, Sir, you go a little too fast. This he cannot do without making himself Judg of Truth for them: The Magistrate, or any one may judg, as much as he pleases, of Mens Opinions and Errors; he in that judges only for himself: but as soon as he uses Force to bring them from their own to his Opinion, he makes himself <hi>Judg of Truth for them;</hi> let it be to <hi>bring them to judg more sincerely for themselves,</hi> as you here call it, or under what pretence or colour soever; for that, what you say, is but a Pretence, the very Expression discovers. For does any one ever judg insincerely <hi>for himself,</hi> that he needs Penalties to make him judg <hi>more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely for himself?</hi> A Man may judg wrong for himself, and may be known or thought to do so: But who can either know or suppose another is not <hi>sincere</hi> in the Judgment he makes for himself, or (which is the same thing) that any one knowingly puts a mixture of Falshood into the Judgment he makes? For as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49288:16"/>
speaking insincerely is to speak otherwise than one thinks, let what he says be true or false; so judging insincerely must be to judg otherwise than one thinks, which I imagine is not very fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. But how improper soever it be to talk of judging insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely for one's self, it was better for you in that Place to say, Penalties were <hi>to bring Men to judg more sincerely,</hi> rather than to say, more rightly, or more truly: for had you said, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate might use Penalties <hi>to bring Men to judg more</hi> truly, that very Word had plainly discovered, that he <hi>made</hi> himself <hi>a Judg of Truth for them.</hi> You therefore wisely chose to say what might best cover this Contradiction to your self, whether it were Sense or no, which perhaps whilst it sounded well, every one would not stand to examine.</p>
            <p>One thing give me leave here to observe to you, which is, That when you speak of the Entertainment Subjects are to give to Truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> the true Religion, you call it <hi>believing;</hi> but this in the Magistrate you call <hi>knowing.</hi> Now let me ask you, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Magistrate, who laid Penalties on any who dissented from what he judged the true Religion, or as you call it here, were <hi>alienated from the Truth,</hi> was or could be determined in his judging of that Truth by any Assurance greater than believing? When you have resolved that, you will then see to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is all you have said here concerning the Magistrate's <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Truth; which at last amounting to no more than the Assurance wherewith a Man certainly believes and receives a thing for true, will put every Magistrate under the same, if there be any Obligation to use Force, whilst he believes his own Religion. Besides, if a Magistrate <hi>knows</hi> his R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ligion to be true, he is to use means not to make his People believe, but know it also; Knowledg of them, if that be the way of entertaining the Truths of Religion, being as necessary to the Subjects as the Magistrate.

            <p>The Pleasantness of your Answer, notwithstanding what you say, doth remain still the same: for you making, (as is <note place="margin">P. 65.66.</note> to be seen) <hi>the Power of the Magistrate ORDAINED for</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Case in short is this; Men are apt to be misled by their <hi>Passions, Lusts,</hi> and <hi>other Men</hi> in the choice of their Religion. For this great Evil you propose a Remedy, which is, That Men (for you must remember you are here speaking of the People putting this Power into the Magistrate's hand) should chuse some of their Fellow-Men, and give them a Power by Force to guard them, that they might not be <hi>alienated from the Truth</hi> by their <hi>own Passions, Lusts,</hi> or by <hi>other Men.</hi> So it was in the first Scheme; or, as you have it now, to punish them, whenever they <hi>rejected the true Religion, and that proposed with sufficient Evidence of the Truth of it.</hi> A pretty Remedy, and manifestly effectual at first sight: That because Men were all promiscuously apt to be misled in their Judgment, or choice of their Reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ion, by <hi>Passion, Lust,</hi> and <hi>other Men,</hi> therefore they should chuse some amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who might, they and their Successors, Men made just like themselves, <hi>punish them when they rejected the true Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Blind lead the Blind, both shall fall into the Ditch,</hi> says our Saviour. If Men apt to be misled by their <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Lusts,</hi> will guard themselves from falling into Error, by Punishments laid on them, by Men as apt to be misled by Passions and Lusts as themselves, how are they the safer from falling into Error? Now hear the insallible Remedy for this Inconvenience, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire: the Men to whom they have given this Power, must not use it, till they find those who gave it them in an Error. A Friend, to whom I shewed this Expedient, answered, This is none: For why is not a Man as fit to judg for himself when he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49288:18"/>
is in an Error, as another to judg for him, who is as liable to Error himself? I answered, This Power however in the other can do him no harm, but may <hi>indirectly, and at a distance,</hi> do him good; because the Magistrate who has this Power to punish him, must never use it but when he is in the right, and he that is punish'd is in the wrong. But, said my Friend, who shall be Judg whether he be in the right or no? for Men in an Error think themselves in the right, and that as confidently as those who are most so. To which I replied, No body must be Judg; but the Magistrate <hi>may know</hi> when he is in the right. And so may the Subject too (said my Friend) as well as the Magistrate, and therefore it was as good still be free from a Punishment, that gives a Man no more Security from Error than he had without it. Besides, said he, who must be Judg whether the Magistrate knows or no? for he may mistake, and think it to be Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Certainty, when it is but Opinion and Belief. It is no matter, for that in this Scheme, replied I, the Magistrate we are told <hi>may know</hi> which is the true Religion, and he must not use Force but to bring Men to the true Religion; and if he does, God will one day call him to an Account for it, and so all is safe. As safe as beating the Air can make a thing, replied my Friend: for if believing, being assured, confidently being perswaded that they know that the Religion they prosess is true, or any thing else short of true Knowledg will serve the turn, all Magistrates will have this Power alike, and so Men will be well guarded, or recovered from false Religions; by putting it into the Magistrate's Hand to punish them <hi>when they have alienated themselves from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Magistrate be not to punish Men but when he <hi>knows, i. e.</hi> is infallibly certain (for so is a Man in what he knows) that his National Religion is all true, and <hi>knows</hi> also, that it has been <hi>proposed</hi> to those he punishes <hi>with sufficient Evidence of the Truth of it:</hi> 'Twould have been as good this Power had never been given him, since he will never be in a Condition to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it; and at best it was given him to no Purpose, since those who gave it him were one with another as little indisposed to consider impartially, examine diligently, study, find, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly know the Truth as he. But, said he at parting, to talk thus of the Magistrates punishing Men that <hi>reject the true Religion,</hi> without telling us, who those Magistrates are, who have a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to judg which is the <hi>true Religion,</hi> is to put this Power in all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49288:18"/>
Magistrates Hands alike, or none. For to say he only is to be Judg which is the true Religion, who is of it, is but to begin the round of Enquiries again, which can at last end no where but in every one's supposing his own to be it. But, said he, if you will continue to talk on thus, there is nothing more to be done with you, but to pity or laugh at you, and so he left me.</p>
            <p>I assure you, Sir, I urged this part of your Hypothesis, with all the Advantage I thought your Answer afforded me: and if I have erred in it, or there be any way to get out of the Strait (if Force must in your way be used) either of the Magistrates punishing Men for rejecting the true Religion, without judging which is the true Religion; or else that the Magistrate should judg which is the true Religion; which way ever of the two you shall determine it; I see not of what Advantage it can be to the People (to keep them from chusing amiss) that this Power of punishing them should be put into the Magistrate's Hands.</p>
            <p>And then, if the Magistrate must judg which is the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (as how he should without judging, punish any one who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it, is hard to find) and punish Men who reject it till they do imbrace it, (let it be to make them consider, or what you please) he does, I think, chuse their Religion for them. And if you have not the Dexterity to chuse the National Religion, where-ever you are, I doubt not but you would think so too if you were in <hi>France,</hi> though there were none but moderate Penalties laid on you to <hi>bring</hi> you <hi>even against your own Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to act according</hi> to what they there call <hi>Reason and sound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

            <p>The Beginning of this Answer is part of the old Song of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; <hi>What! Reasons and Arguments proper and sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men of the Truth of Falshood?</hi> Yes, Sir, the Magistrate may use Force to make Men consider those Reasons and Arguments, which he thinks proper and sufficient to convince Men of the Truth of his Religion, though his Religion be a false one. And this is as possible for him to do, as for a Man, as learned as your self, to write a Book, and use Arguments, as he thinks proper and sufficient to convince Men of the Truth of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, though it be a Falshood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49288:20"/>
As to the remaining part of your Answer, the Question is not, Whether <hi>the Magistrate's Opinion can change the Nature of things, or the Power</hi> he has, or <hi>excuse</hi> him <hi>to his Judg</hi> for misusing of it? But this, that since all Magistrates in your Opinion have Commission, and are obliged to promote the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Force, and they can be guided in the Discharge of this Duty by nothing but their own Opinion of the true Religion, What Advantage can this be to the true Religion, what Benefit to their Subjects, or whether it amounts to any more than a Commission to every Magistrate to use Force for the promoting his own Religion? To this Question therefore you will do well to apply your Answer, which a Man of less Skill than you will be scarce able to do.</p>
            <p>You tell us indeed, that <hi>whatever the Magistrate's Opinion be, his Power was given him (as the Apostles Power was to them) for Edification only, and not for Destruction.</hi> But if the Apostles Power had been given them for one End, and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and nine others of the twelve had had nothing to guide them but their own Opinion, which led them to another End; I ask you whether the Edification of the Church could have been carried on as it was?</p>
            <p>You tell us farther, that <hi>it may always be said of the Magistrate, (what St.</hi> Paul <hi>said of himself) that he can do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth.</hi> Witness the K. of <hi>France.</hi> If you say this in the same Sense that St. <hi>Paul</hi> said it of himself, who in all things requisite for <hi>Edification,</hi> had the immediate Direction and Guidance of the unerring Spirit of God, and so was infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, we need not go to <hi>Rome</hi> for an <hi>infallible</hi> Guide, every Country has one in their Magistrate. If you apply these Words to the Magistrate in another Sense, than what St. <hi>Paul</hi> spoke them in of himself, sober Men will be apt to think, you have a great Care to insinuate into others a high Veneration for the Magistrate; but that you your self have no over-great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the Scripture, which you thus use; nor for Truth, which you thus defend.</p>
            <p>To deny the Magistrate to have a Power to <hi>compel Men to his Religion:</hi> But yet to say the <hi>Magistrate</hi> has a <hi>Power,</hi> and is <hi>bound to punish Men</hi> to make them <hi>consider</hi> till they cease to <hi>reject</hi> the <hi>true Religion,</hi> of which true Religion he must be Judg, or else nothing can be done in Discharge of this his Duty, is so like
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49288:20"/>
going round about to come to the same place, that it will always be a Circle in mine and other Peoples Imagination, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there, but in your Hypothesis.</p>
            <p>All that you say turns upon the Truth or Falshood of this <note place="margin">P. 76.</note> Proposition; <hi>That whoever punishes any one in Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ters of Religion to make him consider, takes upon him to be Judg for another what is right in Matters of Religion.</hi> This you think plainly involves a Contradiction; and so it would, if these general Terms had in your use of them their ordinary and usual meaning. But, Sir, be but pleased to take along with you, That <hi>whoever punishes any Man</hi> your way <hi>in Matters of Religion, to make him consider,</hi> as you use the word <hi>consider, takes upon him to be Judg for another what is right in Matters of Religion:</hi> and you will find it so far from a Contradiction, that it is a plain Truth. For your way of punishing is a peculiar way, and is this; That the Magistrate, where the National Religion is the true Religion, should punish those who dissent from it, to <hi>make them consider as they ought,</hi> i. e. till they cease <hi>to reject,</hi> or, in other words, till they conform to it. If therefore he punishes none but those who dissent from, and punishes them till they conform to that which he judges the true Religion, does he not take on him to judg for them what is the true Religion?</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed what you say, there is no other reason to <hi>punish another to make him consider, but that he should judg for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:</hi> and this will always hold true amongst those, who when they speak of <hi>considering,</hi> mean <hi>considering,</hi> and nothing else. But then these things will follow from thence: 1. That in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of Penalties to make Men <hi>consider,</hi> the Magistrate of a Country, where the National Religion is false, no more misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his Power, than he whose Religion is true; for one has as much right to punish the Negligent to make them <hi>consider, study</hi> and <hi>examine</hi> Matters of Religion, as the other. 2. If the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate punishes Men in Matters of Religion, truly to make them <hi>consider,</hi> he will punish all that do not <hi>consider,</hi> whether Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists or Nonconformists. 3. If the Magistrate punishes in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion to make Men <hi>consider,</hi> it is, as you say, <hi>to make Men judg for themselves:</hi> for <hi>there is no use of considering, but in order to judging.</hi> But then when a Man has judg'd for himself, the Penalties for not <hi>considering</hi> are to be taken off: for else your saying that a Man is punished <hi>to make him consider, that he may</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:49288:21"/>
               <hi>judg for himself,</hi> is plain Mockery. So that either you must reform your Scheme, or allow this Proposition to be true, <hi>viz. Whoever punishes any Man in Matters of Religion, to make him</hi> in your sense <hi>consider, takes upon him to judg for another what is right in Matters of Religion:</hi> and with it the Conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>whoever punishes any one in Matters of Religion, to make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, takes upon him to do what no Man can do, and consequently mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applies his Power of punishing, if he has that Power.</hi> Which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi> you say you <hi>should readily admit as sufficiently demonstrated, if the Proposition</hi> before mentioned were true.</p>
            <p>But further, if it could enter into the Head of any Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker but you, to punish Men for the omission of, or to make them perform any internal Act of the Mind, such as is Consideration. Whoever in matter of Religion would lay an Injunction on Men to make them consider, could not do it without judging for them <hi>in Matters of Religion,</hi> unless they had no Religion at all, and then they come not within our Author's Toleration, which is a Toleration only of Men of different Religions, or of different Opinions in Religion. For supposing you the Magistrate with full Power and (as you imagin'd) Right of <hi>punishing any one in Matters of Religion,</hi> how could you possibly punish any one <hi>to make him consider,</hi> without judging for him what is right in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion? I will suppose my self brought before your Worship, under what Character you please, and then I desire to know what one or more Questions you would ask me, upon my Answer to which you could judg me fit to be punished to make me consider, without taking upon you to judg f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>r me what is right in Matters of Religion? for I conclude from the Fashion of my Coat, or the Colour of my Eyes, you would not judg that I ought to be <hi>punished in Matters of Religion to make me consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> If you could, I should allow you not only as capable, but much more <hi>capable of coactive Power than other Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But since you could not judg me to need Punishment in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, to make me consider, without knowing my Thoughts concerning Religion, we will suppose you (being of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) would examine me in the Catechism and Liturgy of that Church, which possibly I could neither say nor answer right to 'Tis like, upon this you would judg me fit to be pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ished to make me consider. Wherein, 'tis evident, you judg'd for me, that the Religion of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:49288:21"/>
was right; for without that Judgment of yours you would not have punished me. We will suppose you to go yet farther, and examine me concerning the Gospel, and the Truth of the Principles of the Christian Religion, and you find me answer therein not to your liking: here again no doubt you will p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nish me to make me consider; but is it not because you judg for me, that the Christian Religion is the right? Go on thus as far as you will, and till you find I had no Religion at all, you could not punish me to make me to consider, without taking upon you to judg for me what is right in Matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>To punish without a Fault, is Injustice; and to punish a Man without judging him guilty of that Fault, is also Injustice; and to punish a Man who has any Religion to make him consider, or, which is the same thing, for not having sufficiently considered, is no more nor less, but punishing him for not being of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion you think best for him; that is the Fault, and that is the Fault you judg him guilty of, call it <hi>considering</hi> as you please: for let him fall into the Hands of a Magistrate of whose Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he is, he judgeth him to have considered sufficiently. From whence 'tis plain, 'tis Religion is judg'd of, and not Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or want of Consideration. And 'tis in vain to pretend that he is punish'd <hi>to make him judg for himself:</hi> for he that is of any Religion, has already judg'd for himself; and if you punish him after that, under pretence to make him consider that he may judg for himself, 'tis plain you punish him to make him judg otherwise than he has already judg'd, and to judg as you have judg'd for him.</p>
            <p>Your next Paragraph complains of my not having contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the following Words of yours, which I had cited out of your <hi>A.</hi> p. 26. which that the Reader may judg of, I shall here set down again. <hi>And all the Hurt that comes to them by it, is only the suffering some tolerable Inconveniences, for their following the Light of their own Reason, and the Dictates of their own Consciences: which certainly is no such Mischief to Mankind, as to make it more eligible, that there should be no such Power vested in the Magistrate; but the Care of every Man's Soul should be left to him alone, (as this Author demands it should be:) that is, that every Man should be suffered qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and without the least molestation, either to take no care at all of his Soul, if he be so pleased; or in doing it, to follow his own ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Prejudices, or unaccountable Humour, or any crafty Seducer,</hi>

Is the Magistrate like to take more care of it? &amp;c. <hi>As if not to leave the Care of every Man's Soul to</hi> himself alone, <hi>were, as you express it afterwards, to</hi> take the Care of Mens Souls from themselves: <hi>Or as if to vest a Power in the Magistrate, to procure as much as in him lies</hi> (i. e. <hi>as far as it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by convenient Penalties) that Men take such Care of their Souls as they ought to do, were to leave the Care of their Souls</hi> to the Magistrate rather than to themselves: <hi>Which no Man but your self will imagine. I acknowledg as freely as you can do, that as every Man is more concern'd than any Man else can be, so he is likewise more obliged to take care of his Soul; and that no Man can by any means be discharged of the Care of his Soul; which, when all is done, will never be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but by his own Care of it. But do I contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict any thing of this, when I say, that the Care of every Man's Soul ought not to be left to</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone? <hi>or, that it is the Interest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that the</hi> Magistrate <hi>be entrusted and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to take care, as far as lies in him, that no Man neglect his own Soul? I thought, I confess, that every Man was i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap> some sort charged with the Care of his</hi> Neighbour's <hi>Soul. But in your way of reasoning, he that affirms this, takes away the Care of every Man's Soul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           </hi> himself, <hi>and leaves it to his</hi> Neighbour <hi>rather than to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But if this be plainly absurd, as every one<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49288:22"/>sees it is, then so it must be likewise to say, that he that vests such a Power as we here speak of in the Magistrate,</hi>  takes away the Care of Mens Souls from themselves, <hi>and places it in the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, rather than in themselves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>What trisling then is it to say here,</hi> If you cannot lay your Hand upon your Heart, and say all this, (viz. <hi>that the Magistrate is</hi> like to be more concerned for other Mens Souls than themselves, &amp;c.) What then will be got by the Change? <hi>For 'tis plain, here is no such</hi> Change <hi>as you would insinuate: but the Care of Souls which I assert to the Magistrate, is so far from discharging any Man of the Care of his own Soul, or lessening his Obligation to it, that it serves to no other Purpose in the World, but to bring Men, who otherwise would not, to consider and do what the Interest of their Souls obliges them to.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>'Tis therefore manifest, that the thing here to be consider'd, is not, Whether the Magistrate be</hi> like to be more concern'd for other Mens Souls, <hi>or</hi> to take more care of them than themselves: <hi>nor, Whether he be</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more careful of his own Soul, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men are of theirs: <hi>nor, Whether he be</hi> less exposed, <hi>in Matters of Religion,</hi> to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, Humours, and crafty Seducers, than other Men: <hi>nor yet, Whether he be not</hi> more in danger to be in the wrong than other Men, in regard that he never meets with that great and only Antidote of <hi>mine (as you call it)</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Error, which <hi>I</hi> here call Molestation. <hi>But the Point upon which this matter turns, is only this, Whether the Salvation of Souls be not better provided for, if the Magistrate be obliged to procure, as much as in him lies, that every Man take such care as he ought of his Soul, than if he be not so obliged, but the Care of every Man's<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49288:23"/>Soul be left to himself alone: Which certainly any Man of common Sense may easily determine. For as you will not, I suppose, deny but God has more amply provided for the Salvation of your own Soul, by obliging your Neighbour, as well as your self, to take care of it; tho 'tis possible your Neighbour may not be</hi>  more concern'd <hi>for it, than your self; or may not be more careful of his own Soul, than you are of yours; or may be no less</hi> exposed, <hi>in Matters of Religion, to</hi> Prejudices, &amp;c. <hi>than you are; because if you are your self wanting to your own Soul, it is more likely that you will be brought to take care of it, if your Neighbour be obliged to admonish and exhort you to it, than if he be not; tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              </gap>h it may fall out that he will not do what he is obliged to do in that case: So I think it cannot be denied, but the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all Mens Souls is better provided for, if besides the Obligation which every Man has to take care of his own Soul, (and that which every Man's Neighbour has likewise to do it) the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate also be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              </gap>trusted his Soul, than it would be, if every Man were left to himself in this matter: Because though we should admit that the Magistrate is not</hi> like to be, <hi>or is not ordinarily</hi> more concern'd for other Mens Souls, than they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are, &amp;c. <hi>it is nevertheless undeni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              </gap>bly true still, that whoever neglects his Soul, is more likely to be brought to take care of it, if the Magistrate be obliged to do what lies in him to bring him to do it, than if he be not. Which is enough to shew, that it is every Man's</hi> true Interest, <hi>that the Care of his Soul should not be left to himself alone, but that the</hi> Magistrate <hi>should be so far entrusted with it as I contend that he is.</hi>

Another Set of good Words we have here, which at first hearing are apt to ingage Mens Concern, as if too much could not be done to recover Men from so perilous a State as they seem to describe; and those are Men <hi>following</hi> their own <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Prejudices, unaccountable Humours, or crafty Seducers.</hi> Are not these Expressions to set forth a deplorable Condition, and to move Pity in all that hear them? Enough to make the unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Reader ready to cry out, Help for the Lord's sake; do any thing rather than suffer such poor prejudiced seduced Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be eternally lost. Whereas he that examines what Persons these Words can in your Scheme describe, will find they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such as any where dissent from those Articles of Faith and Ceremonies of outward Worship, which the Magistrate, or at least you his Director approve of. For whilst you talk thus of the true Religion in general, (and that so general, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow your self to descend so near to Particulars, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the Searching and Study of the Scriptures to find it) and that the Power in the Magistrates Hands to use Force, is to bring Men to the true Religion; I ask, whether you do not think, either he or you must be Judg, which is the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before he can exercise that Power? and then he must use his Force upon all those who dissent from it, who are then the <hi>prejudiced, humoursom,</hi> and <hi>seduced</hi> you here speak of.

                  </gap>y Seducers,</hi> when in the same Sentence you suppose the Magistrate who is vested with this Power, may inslict those Penalties on Men, <hi>for their following the Light of their own Reason, and the Dictates of their own Consciences;</hi> which when you have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, perhaps you will not think my Answer so wholly besides the matter, though it shewed you but that one Absurdity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a formal Contradiction to so loose and undetermin'd a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that it required more Pains to unravel the Sense of what was covered under deceitful Expressions, than the Weight of the Matter contained in them was worth.</p>
            <p>For besides what is already said to it: How is it possible for any one (who had the greatest Mind in the World to Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction) to deny it to be <hi>more eligible</hi> that such a Power should be vested in the Magistrate, till he knows, to whom you affirm it to be <hi>more eligible?</hi> Is it <hi>more eligible</hi> to those who suffer by it, <hi>for following the Light of their own Reason, and the Dictates of their own Consciences?</hi> for these you know are <hi>Gainers</hi> by it, <hi>for they know better than they did before where the Truth does lie.</hi> Is it <hi>more eligible</hi> to those who have no other Thoughts of Religion, but to be of that of their Country without any farther Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or is it <hi>more eligible</hi> to those who think it their Duty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Matters of Religion, and to follow that which upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination appears to them the Truth? The former of these two make, I think, the greater part of Mankind, though the latter be the better advised: but upon what Grounds it should be more eligible to either of them, that the Magistrate should, than that he should not have a <hi>Power vested</hi> in him to use Force
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49288:25"/>
to bring Men to the true Religion, when it cannot be imployed but to bring Men to that which he thinks the true, <hi>i. e.</hi> to his own Religion, is not easy to guess. Or is it more <hi>eligible</hi> to the Priests and Ministers of National Religions every-where, that the Magistrate should be vested with this Power? who being sure to be Orthodox, will have Right to claim the Assistance of the Magistrate's Power to bring those whom their Arguments, or no Arguments can prevail on, to <hi>imbrace</hi> their <hi>true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>to worship God in decent ways prese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d by those to whom God has left the ordering of such Matters.</hi> Or last of all, Is it more <hi>eligible</hi> to all Mankind? And are the Magistrates of the World so careful or so lucky in the choice of their Reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ion, that it would be an Advantage to Mankind, that they should have a Right to <hi>do what in them lies,</hi> i. e. to use all the Force they have, if they think convenient, to bring Men to the Religion they think true? When you have told us to which of these or what other, <hi>it is more eligible;</hi> I suppose the Reader will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my contradicting it, see how little Truth there is in it, or how little to your Purpose.</p>
            <p>If you will pardon me for not having contradicted that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of yours we have been considering, I will indeavour to make you amends in what you say in Reply to my Answer to it, and tell you that, notwithstanding all you say to the contrary, such a Power as you would have to be <hi>vested in the Magistrate,</hi> takes away the Care of Mens Souls from themselves, and places it in the Magistrate, rather than in themselves. For if when Men have examined, and upon Examination imbrace what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to them the true Religion, the Magistrate has a Right to treat them as misled by <hi>Prejudice, Humour,</hi> or <hi>Seducers;</hi> if he may use what Force, and inslict what Punishments he shall think <hi>convenient</hi> till they conform to the Religion the Magistrate judges the true; I think you will scarce deny, but that the Care of their Souls is by such a Power placed rather in the Magistrate than in themselves, and taken as much from them as by Force and Authority it can be. This, whatever you pretend, is the Power which your System places in the Magistrate. Nor can he upon your Principles exercise it otherwise, as I imagine I have shewed.</p>
            <p>You speak here, as if this <hi>Power,</hi> which you would have to be <hi>vested</hi> in the Magistrate, did not at all <hi>discharge,</hi> but assist the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49288:25"/>
Care every one has or ought to have of his own Soul. I grant, were the Power you would place in the Magistrate such as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man has to take Care of his Neighbour's Soul, which is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it self only by Counsel, Arguments and Perswasion; it left him still the free Liberty of judging for himself; and so the Care of his Soul remained still in his own Hands. But if Men be perswaded, that the wise and good God has <hi>vested a Power in the Magistrate,</hi> to be so far Judg for them, what is the <hi>true Religion,</hi> as to punish them for <hi>rejecting</hi> the Religion which the Magistrate thinks the true, when offer'd with such <hi>Evidence</hi> as he judges <hi>sufficient</hi> to convince them; and to punish them on till they consider so as to imbrace it; what remains, but that they render themselves to the Care and Conduct of a Guide that God in his Goodness has appointed them, who having Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Commission from God to be Judg for them, which is the true Religion, and what are Arguments proper and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince any one of it; and he himself being convinc'd of it, why should they be so foolish, as to suffer Punishments in Opposition to a Power which is in the right, and they ought to submit to? To what Purpose should they, under the Weight of Penalties waste Time and Pains in examining, since whatever they should judg upon Examination, the Magistrate judging the Arguments and Reasons he offers for the Truth of his Religion, <hi>proper and sufficient to convince</hi> them, they must still lie under the Punishment the Magistrate shall think <hi>convenient</hi> till they do comply?</p>
            <p>Besides, when they are thus punished by their Magistrate for not conforming, what need they examine? Since you tell them, <hi>It is not strictly necessary to Salvation, that all that are of the true Religion should understand the Grounds of it.</hi> The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate being of the one only true Religion, <hi>knows</hi> it to be so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> and he <hi>knows</hi> that that Religion was <hi>tender'd</hi> to them with <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidence,</hi> and therefore is obliged to punish them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting it. This is that which Men must upon your Scheme sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for it is, what you your self must suppose, before the Magistrate can exercise that Power you contend to be <hi>vested</hi> in him, as is evident to any one, who will put your System toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">P. 48.</note> and particularly weigh what you say.</p>
            <p>When therefore Men are put into such a State as this, that the Magistrate may judg which <hi>is the true Religion;</hi> the Magistrate
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49288:26"/>
may judg what is <hi>sufficient Evidence</hi> of its Truth; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate may be Judg to whom it is tender'd with <hi>sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> them that <hi>reject it so proposed</hi> with such Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as he also shall judg <hi>convenient,</hi> and all this by God's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and an Authority received from the <hi>wise and benign Governor of all things,</hi> I ask, whether the Care of Mens Souls are not taken out of their own Hands, and put into the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates? Whether in such a State they can or will think there is any need, or that it is to any purpose for them to examine? And whether this be a Cure for the natural Aversion that is in Men to consider and weigh Matters of Religion; and the way to force, or so much as incourage them to examine?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> say you, <hi>the Salvation of all Mens Souls is better provided</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 78.</note> 
               <hi>for, if besides the Obligation that every Man has to take Care of his own Soul, the Magistrate also be intrusted and obliged to see that no Man neglect his own Soul, than it would be if every Man were left to himself in that matter.</hi> Whatever Ground another may have to say this, you can have none: You who give so good Reason <note place="margin">P. 64.</note> why Conformists, though never so ignorant and negligent in examining Matters of Religion, cannot yet be punished to make them consider, must acknowledg that <hi>ALL Mens Salvation is not the better provided for by a Power</hi> vested in the Magistrate, which cannot reach the far greatest part of Men, which are every-where the Conformist to the National Religion. You that plead so well for the Magistrates not examining whether <note place="margin">P. 22.</note> those that conform, do it upon <hi>Reason and Conviction,</hi> but say it is <hi>ordinary presumable</hi> they do so; Wherein I beseech you do you put this Care of Mens Salvation that is placed in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate? even in bringing them to outward Conformity to the National Religion, and there leaving them. And are the Souls of all Mankind the <hi>better provided for,</hi> if the Magistrates of the World are vested with a Power to use Force to bring Men to an outward Profession of what they think the true Religion, without any other Care of their Salvation? For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hither, and no farther, reaches their Use of Force in your way of applying it.</p>
            <p>Give me leave therefore to <hi>trifle</hi> with you once again, and to desire you to lay your Hand upon your Heart, and tell me what Mankind shall gain by the Change? For I hope by this time it is not so much a Paradox to you, that if the Magistrate be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49288:26"/>
by God to take Care of Mens Souls, in your way it takes away the Care of Mens Souls from themselves in all those who have need of this Assistance of the Magistrate, <hi>i. e.</hi> all those who neglect to consider, and are averse to Examination.</p>
            <p>One thing more give me leave to observe to you, and that is, that <hi>taking Care of Mens Souls</hi> or <hi>taking Care that they neglect not their Souls,</hi> and laying Penalties on them to bring them in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profession to the National Religion are two very different things, though in this Place and elsewhere you confound them, and would have Penal Laws, requiring Church-Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, pass under the Name of <hi>Care of Mens Souls,</hi> for that is the utmost your way of applying Force does or can reach to; and what <hi>Care</hi> is therein taken <hi>of Mens Souls,</hi> may be seen by the Lives and Knowledg observable in not a few Conformists. This is not said to lay any Blame on Conformity, but to shew how improperly you speak, when you call Penal Laws made to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Conformity, and Force used to bring Men to it, a <hi>Care of Mens Souls;</hi> when even the exactest Observers, and most zealous Advancers of Conformity may be as irreligious, ignorant, and vicious as any other Men.</p>
            <p>In the first Treatise we heard not a Syllable of any other Use or End of Force in Matters of Religion, but only to make Men consider. But in your second, being forced to own bare-faced the punishing of Men for their Religion, you call it, a <hi>Vice</hi> to <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> 
               <hi>reject the true Faith,</hi> and to <hi>refuse to worship God in decent ways prescribed by those to whom God has left the ordering of it;</hi> and tell us, that it is a <hi>Fault</hi> which <hi>may justly be punished</hi> by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, <note place="margin">P. 20.</note>

               </gap> leave him as free to punish all Dissenters from his own Religion, as any Persecutor can wish: For what he will think <hi>sufficient Means of Instruction,</hi> it will be hard for you to say.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:49288:27"/>
In the mean time, as far as may be gathered from what you say in another Place, we will examine what you think <hi>sufficient Provision for instructing Men,</hi> which you have expressed in these Words; <hi>For if the Magistrate provides sufficiently for the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 63.</note> 
               <hi>of all his Subjects in the true Religion, and then requires them all under convenient Penalties to hearken to the Teachers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of it, and to profess and exercise it with one Accord under their Direction in publick Assemblies.</hi> That which stumbles one at the first View of this your Method of Instruction is, that you leave it uncertain, whether Dissenters must first be instructed, and then profess; or else first profess, and then be instructed in the National Religion. This you will do well to be a little more clear in the next time; for you mentioning no Instruction but in publick Assemblies, and perhaps meaning it for a Country where there is little other Pains taken with Dissenters but the Confutation and Condemnation of them in Assemblies, where they are not, they must cease to be Dissenters before they can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this sufficient means of Instruction.</p>
            <p>And now for those who do <hi>with one Accord</hi> put themselves <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Direction of the Ministers of</hi> the National, and <hi>hearken to</hi> these <hi>Teachers</hi> of the true Religion. I ask whether one half of those whereof most of the Assemblies are made up, do or can (so ignorant as they are) understand what they hear from the Pulpit? And then whether if a Man did understand, what in many Assemblies ordinarily is delivered once a Week there for his Instruction, he might not yet at threescore Years End be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Grounds and Principles of the Christian Religion? Your having so often in your Letter mentioned <hi>sufficient Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Instruction,</hi> has forced these two short Questions from me. But I forbear to tell you what I have heard very sober People, even of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> say upon this Occasion: For you have warned me already, that it shall be interpreted to be a Quarrel to the Clergy in general, if any thing shall be taken notice of in any of them worthy to be mended. I leave it to those whose Profession it is to judg, whether Divinity be a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wherein Men may be instructed by an Harangue or two on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e a Week, upon any Subject at a Venture, which has no Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with that which preceded, or that which is to follow, and this made to People that are ignorant of the first Principles of it, and are not capable of understanding such ways of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49288:27"/>
I am sure he that should think this a <hi>sufficient Means of instructing</hi> People in any other Science, would at the End of seven or twenty Years find them very little advanced in it. And bating perhaps some Terms and Phrases belonging to it, would be as far from all true and useful Knowledg of it as when they first began. Whether it be so in Matter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of Religion, those who have the Oportunity to observe must judg. And if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that amongst those of the National Church there be very many so ignorant, that there is nothing more frequent than for the Ministers themselves to complain of it, it is manifest from those of the National Church (whatever may be concluded from Dissenters) that the <hi>Means of Instruction</hi> provided by the Law, are not sufficient, unless that be sufficient Means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, which Men of sufficient Capacity for other things, may live under many Years, and yet know very little by. If you say it is for want of Consideration, must not your Remedy of Force be used to bring them to it? Or how will the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate answer for it, if he use Force to make Dissenters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, and let those of his own Church perish for want of it?</p>
            <p>This being all one can well understand by your <hi>sufficient Means of Instruction,</hi> as you there explain it, I do not see but Men who have no Aversion to be instructed, may yet fail of it, notwithstanding such a Provision. Perhaps by <hi>exercising the true Religion with one Accord under the Direction of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of it in publick Assemblies,</hi> you mean something farther; but that not being an ordinary Phrase, will need your Explication to make it understood. <note place="margin">

            </head>
            <p>THough in the foregoing Chapter our examining your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning the Magistrates who may or may not use Force in Matters of Religion, we have in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces happened to take notice of the Commission whereby you au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize Magistrates to act; yet we shall in this Chapter more particularly consider that Commission. You tell us, <hi>To use Force</hi> in Matters of Religion, <hi>is a Duty</hi> of the Magistrate <hi>as old as</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 35.</note> 
               <hi>the Law of Nature, in which the Magistrate's Commission lies: for the Scripture does not properly give it him, but supposes it.</hi> And more <note place="margin">P. 31.</note> at large you give us an account of the Magistrate's Commission in these Words: <hi>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>is true indeed,</hi> the Author and Finisher of our Faith <hi>has given the Magistrate no new Power or Commission: nor was there any need that he should, (if himself had any Temporal Power to give:) For he found him already, even by the Law of Nature, the Minister of God to the People for Good, and bearing the Sword not in vain,</hi> i. e. <hi>invested with coactive Power, and obliged to use it for all the good Purposes which it might serve, and for which it should be found needful; even for the restraining of false and corrupt Religion: as</hi> Job <hi>long before (perhaps before any part of the Scriptures were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) acknowledged, when he said, that the worshipping</hi> the Sun or <note place="margin">Job XXI. 26, 27, 28.</note> the Moon, was an Iniquity to be punished by the Judg. <hi>But though our Saviour has given the Magistrates no new Power, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> King of Kings, <hi>he expects and requires that they should submit themselves to his Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>pter, and use the Power which always belonged to them, for his Service, and for the advancing his spiritual Kingdom in the World. And even that</hi> Charity <hi>which our great Master so earnestly recommends, and so strictly requires of all his Disciples, as it obliges all Men to seck and promote the Good of others, as well as their own, especially their spiritual and eternal Good, by such Means as their several Places and Relations enable them to use; so does it especially oblige the Magistrate to do it</hi> as a Magistrate, i. e. <hi>by that Power which enables him to do it above the rate of other Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:49288:28"/>
So far therefore is the Christian Magistrate, when he gives his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Hand to the furtherance of the Gospel, by laying convenient Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties upon such as reject it, or any part of it, from using any other means for the Salvation of Mens Souls, than what the Author and Finisher of our Faith has directed, that he does no more than his Duty to God, to his Redeemer, and to his Subjects, requires of him.</p>
            <p>Christ, you say, <hi>has given. no new Power or Commission to the Magistrate:</hi> and for this you give several Reasons. 1. <hi>There was no need that he should;</hi> yet it seems strange that the <hi>Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi> alone should have an exercise of <hi>coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ve Power</hi> in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and yet our Saviour should say nothing of it, but leave them to that Commission which was common to them with all other Magistrates. The Christian Religion in cases of less moment is not wanting in its Rules; and I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will not charge the New Testament with a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if that Law alone which teaches the only true Religion, that Law which all Magistrates who are of the true Religion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and embrace, should say nothing at all of so necessary and important a Duty to those who alone are in a Capacity to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it, but leave them only to that general Law of Nature, which others who are not qualified to use this Force, have in common with them.</p>
            <p>This at least seems <hi>needful,</hi> if a new Commission does not, that the <hi>Christian Magistrates</hi> should have been instructed what Degree of Force they should use, and been limited to your <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Penalties;</hi> since for above these 1200 Years, though they have readily enough found out your Commission to use Force, they never found out your <hi>moderate</hi> use of it, which is that alone which you assure us is <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. You say, <hi>If our Saviour had any Temporal Power to give;</hi> whereby you seem to give this as a reason why he gave not the Civil Magistrate Power to use Force in Matters of Religion, that he had it not to give. You tell us in the same Paragraph, that he is <hi>King of Kings;</hi> and he tells us himself, <hi>That all Power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. XXVIII. 18.</note> 
               <hi>unto him in Heaven and in Earth:</hi> So that he could have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven what Power, to whom, and to what Purpose he had pleased: and concerning this there needs no <hi>if.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For he found him already by the Law of Nature invested with coactive Power, and obliged to use it for all the good Purposes which it might serve, and for which it should be found needful. <hi>He found</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49288:29"/>
also Fathers, Husbands, Masters, invested with their distinct Powers by the same Law, and under the same Obligation; and yet he thought it needsul to prescribe to them in the use of those Powers: But <hi>there was no need he should</hi> do so to the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in the use of their Power in Matters of Religion; because tho Fathers, Husbands, Masters, were liable to Excess in the use of theirs, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> Christian Magistrates were not, as appears by their having always kept to those <hi>moderate</hi> Measures, which you assure us to be the only <hi>necessary and useful.</hi>

            <p>And what at last is their Commission? Even that <hi>of Charity, which obliges all Men to seek and promote the Good of others, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally their spiritual and eternal Good, by such means as their several Places and Relations enable them to use, especially Magistrates as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.</hi> This Duty of Charity is well discharged by the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate as Magistrate,</hi> is it not? in bringing Men to an outward Profession of any, even of the true Religion, and leaving them there? But, Sir, I ask you who must be Judg, what is for the <hi>spiritual and eternal Good</hi> of his Subjects, the Magistrate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or no? If not he himself, who for him? Or can it be done without any one's judging at all? If he, the Magistrate, must judg every-where himself what is <hi>for the spiritual and eternal Good</hi> of his Subjects, as I see no help for it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> if the Magistrate be every-where by the <hi>Law of Nature obliged to promote their spiritual and eternal Good,</hi> is not the true Religion like to find great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the World by the use of Force in the Magistrates Hands? And is not this a plain demonstration that God has by the Law of Nature given Commission to the Magistrate to use Force for the promoting the true Religion, since (as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) the execution of such a Commission will do so much more Harm than Good?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To shew that your</hi> indirect and at a distance Vsefulness, <hi>with</hi> a general necessity of Force, authorizes the Civil Power in the use of it, <hi>you use the following Words;</hi> That Force does some service <note place="margin">P. 17.</note> towards the making of Scholars and Artists, I suppose you will easily grant. Give me leave therefore to ask, how it does it? I suppose you will say, not by its direct and proper Efficacy, (for Force is no more capable to work Learning or Arts, than the belief of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Men by its direct and proper Efficacy;) but by prevailing upon those who are designed for Scholars or Artists, to receive Instruction, and to apply themselves to the use of those Means and Helps which are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49288:29"/>
               <hi>proper to make them what they are designed to be: that is, it does it indirectly, and at a distance. Well then, if all the Vsefulness of the Force towards the bringing Scholars or Apprentices to the Learning or Skill they are designed to attain, be only an</hi> indirect and at a distance Usefulness; <hi>I pray what is it that warrants and authorizes School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters, Tutors or Masters, to use Force upon their Scholars or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, to bring them to Learning, or the Skill of their Arts and Trades, if such an</hi> indirect and at a distance Usefulness <hi>of Force, together with that</hi> Necessity <hi>of it which Experience discovers, will not do it? I believe you will acknowledg that even such an Vsefulness, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that Necessity, will serve the turn in these cases. But then I would fain know, why the same kind of Vsefulness, joined with the like Necessity, will not as well do it in the case before us? I confess I see no reason why it should not; nor do I believe you can assign any.</hi> You ask here, <hi>what authorizes Schoolmasters or Masters to use Force on their Scholars and Apprentices, if such an</hi> indirect and at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance Usefulness, <hi>together with</hi> Necessity, <hi>does not do it?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, neither your <hi>indirect and at a distance Vsefulness,</hi> nor the <hi>Necessity</hi> you suppose of it. For I do not think you will say, that any Schoolmaster has a power to teach, much less to use Force on any one's Child, without the Consent and Authority of the Father: but a Father, you will say, has a power to use Force to correct his Child to bring him to <hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Skill in that Trade he is designed to;</hi> and to this the Father is authorized by the Usefulness and Necessity of Force. This I deny, that the meer-supposed Usefulness and Necessity of Force authorizes the Father to use it; for then whenever he judg'd it useful and necessary for his Son, to prevail with him to apply himself to any <hi>Trade,</hi> he might use Force upon him to that purpose; which I think neither you nor any body else will say, a Father has a right to do on his idle and perhaps married Son at 30 or 40 Years old.</p>
            <p>There is then something else in the case; and whatever it be that authorizes the Father to use Force upon his Child, to make him a Prosicient in it, authorizes him also to chuse that <hi>Trade, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi> or Science he would have him a Proficient in: for the Father can no longer use Force upon his Son, to make him attain any <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Trade,</hi> than he can pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ribe to him the Art or Trade he is to attain. Put your Parallel now if you please: The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Usefulness and N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sity of Force is authorized to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49288:30"/>
use it upon his Child, to make him attain any <hi>Art</hi> or Science; therefore the Magistrate is authorized to use Force to bring Men to the true Religion, because it is useful and necessary. Thus far you have used it, and you think it does well. But let us go on with the Parallel: This Usefulness and Necessity of Force authorizes the Father to use it, to make his Son apply himself to the use of the Means and Helps which are proper to make him <hi>what he is designed to be,</hi> no longer than it authorizes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to design what his Son shall be, and to chuse for him the <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Trade</hi> he shall be of: and so the Usefulness and Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you suppose in Force to bring Men to any Church, cannot authorize the Magistrate to use Force any farther, than he has a right to chuse for any one what Church or Religion he shall be of. So that if you will stick to this Argument, and allow the Parallel between a Magistrate and a Father, and the right they have to use Force for the instructing of their Subjects in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Children in Arts, you must either allow the Magistrate to have power to chuse what Religion his Subjects shall be of, which you have denied, or else that he has no power to use Force to make them use Means to be of it.</p>
            <p>A Father being entrusted with the Care and Provision for his Child, is as well bound in Duty, as fitted by natural Love and Tenderness, to supply the Defects of his tender Age. When it is born, the Child cannot move it self for the ease and help of natural Necessities, the Parents Hands must supply that Inability, and feed, cleanse and swaddle it. Age having given more Strength, and the exercise of the Limbs, the Parents are discharged from the trouble of putting Meat into the Mouth of the Child, clothing or unclothing, or carrying him in their Arms. The same Duty and Affection which required such kind of Helps to the Infant, makes them extend their Thoughts to other Cares for him when he is grown a little bigger; 'tis not only a present Support, but a future comfortable Subsistence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be thought on: to this some Art or Science is necessary, but the Child's Ignorance and want of Prospect makes him una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to chuse. And hence the Father has a power to chuse for him, that the flexible and docile part of Life may not be squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred away, and the time of Instruction and Improvement be lost for want of Direction. The Trade or Art being chosen by the Father, 'tis the Exercise and Industry of the Child must
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49288:30"/>
acquire it to himself: but Industry usually wanting in Children, the Spur which Reason and Fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ght gives to the Endeavours of grown Men, the Father's Rod and Correction is fain to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that Want, to make him <hi>apply himself to the use of those Means and Helps which are proper to make him what he is designed to be.</hi> But when the Child is once come to the State of Manhood, and to be the Possessor and free Disposer of his Goods and Estate, he is then discharged from this Discipline of his Parents, and they have no longer any right to chuse any Art, Science, or Course of Life for him, or by Force to make him apply himself to the use of those Means which are proper to make him be <hi>what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to be.</hi> Thus the want of knowledg to chuse a sit Calling, and want of knowledg of the necessity of Pains and Industry to attain Skill in it, puts a Power into the Parents hands to use Force where it is necessary to procure the Application and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their Children in that, which their Parents have thought fit to set them to; but it gives this Power to the Parents only, and to no other whilst they live; and if they die whilst their Children need it, to their Substitutes; and there it is safely pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: for since their want of Knowledg during their Non-age, makes them want Direction; and want of Reason often makes them need Punishment and Force to excite their Endeavours, and keep them intent to the use of those Means that lead to the End they are directed to, the Tenderness and Love of Parents will engage them to use it only for their Good, and generally to quit it too, when by the Title of Manhood they come to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Direction and Discipline of Children. But how does this prove that the Magistrate has any right to force Men to <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to the use of those Means and Helps which are proper to make them of any Religion,</hi> more than it proves that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate has a right to chuse for them what Religion they shall be of?</p>
            <p>To your Question therefore, <hi>What is it that warrants and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizes Schoolmasters, Tutors and Masters to use Force upon their Scholars or Apprentices?</hi> I answer, A Commission from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother, or those who supply their Places; for without that no <hi>indirect or at a distance Vsefulness,</hi> or supposed <hi>Necessity,</hi> could authorize them.</p>
            <p>But then you will ask, Is it not this <hi>Vsefulness</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> that gives this Power to the Father and Mother? I grant it. <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49288:31"/>
               <hi>would fain know then,</hi> say you, <hi>why the same Vsefulness joined wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the like Necessity, will as well do in the Case before us?</hi> And I, Sir, will as readily tell you: Because the Understanding of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is to supply the want of it in the Minority of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and therefore they have a right not only to use Force to make their Children apply themselves to the means of acquiring any <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Trade,</hi> but to chuse also the Trade or Calling they shall be of. But when being come out of the State of Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are supposed of Years of Discretion to chuse what they will design themselves to be, they are also at liberty to judg what Application and Industry they will use for the attaining of it; and then how negligent soever they are in the use of the Means, how averse soever to Instruction or Application, they are past the Correction of a Schoolmaster, and their Parents can no longer chuse or <hi>design</hi> for them what they shall be, nor use Force <hi>to prevail with them to apply themselves to the use of those Means and Helps which are proper to make them what they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be.</hi> He that imagines a Father or Tutor may send his Son to School at thirty or forty Years old, and order him to be whipp'd there, or that any <hi>indirect and at a distance</hi> Usefulness will <hi>authorize</hi> him to be so used, will be thought fitter to be sent thither himself, and there to receive due Correction.</p>
            <p>When you have consider'd 'tis otherwise in the case of the Magistrate using Force your way in Matters of Religion; that there his Understanding is not to supply the defect of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in his Subjects, and that only for a time; that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse for any of his Subjects what Religion he shall be of, as you your self confess; and that this Power of the Magistrate, if it be (as is claimed by you) over Men of all Ages, Parts and Endowments, you will perhaps <hi>see some reason why it should not do in the Case before us, as well</hi> as <hi>in that of Schoolmasters and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> though you <hi>believe</hi> I <hi>cannot assign any.</hi> But, Sir, will your <hi>indirect and at a distance Vsefulness,</hi> together with your supposed <hi>Necessity,</hi> authorize the Master of the Shoe-makers Company to take any one who comes in his Hands, and punish him for not being of the Shoe-makers Company, and not coming to their Guild, when he, who has a right to chuse of what Trade and Company he will be, thinks it not his Interest to be a Shoe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker? Nor can he or any body else imagine that this Force, this Punishment is used to make him a good Shoe-maker, when it is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49288:31"/>
seen and avowed that the Punishments cease, and they are free from it who enter themselves of the Company, whether they are really Shoe-makers, or in earnest apply themselves to be so or no. How much it differs from this, that the Magistrate should punish Men for not being of his Church, who chuse not to be of it, and when they are once entred into the Communion of it, are punished no more, though they are as ignorant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful, and unpractised in the Religion of it as before: how much, I say, this differs from the Case I proposed, I leave you to consider. For after all your Pretences of using Force <hi>for the Salvation of Souls,</hi> and consequently <hi>to make Men really Christians,</hi> you are fain to allow, and you give Reasons for it, that Force is used only to those who are out of your Church: but whoever are once in it, are free from Force, whether they be <hi>really Christians,</hi> and apply themselves to those things which are <hi>for the Salvation of their Souls,</hi> or no.</p>
            <p>As to what you say, That whether they chuse it or no, they ought to chuse it; for your Magistrate's Religion is the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that is the Question between you and them: but be that as it will, if Force be to be used in the case, I have proved that be the Magistrate's Religion true or false, he, whilst he believes it to be true, is under an obligation to use Force, as if it were true.</p>
            <p>But since you think your Instance of Children so weighty and pressing, give me leave to return you your Question: I ask you then, Are not Parents as much <hi>authorized</hi> to teach their Children their Religion, as they are to teach them their Trade, when they have <hi>designed</hi> them to it? May they not as lawfully correct them to make them learn their Catechise, or the Principles of their Religion, as they may to make them learn <hi>Clenard</hi>'s Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar? Or may they not use Force to make them go to Mass, or whatever they believe to be the Worship of the true Religion, as to go to School, or to learn any Art or Trade? If they may, as I think you will not deny, unless you will say, that none but Orthodox Parents may teach their Children any Religion: If they may, I say then, pray tell me a Reason (if your Argumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> from the Discipline of Children be good) why the Magistrate may not use Force to bring Men to his Religion, as well as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may use Force to instruct Children, and bring them up in theirs? When you have considered this, you will perhaps find
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49288:32"/>
some difference between the State of Children and grown Men, betwixt those under Tutelage, and those who are free and at their own disposal; and be inclined to think that those Reasons which subject Children in their Non-age to the use of Force, may not, nor do concern Men at Years of Discretion.</p>
            <p>You tell us farther, That <hi>Commonwealths are instituted for the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> 
               <hi>attaining of all the Benefits which Political Government can yield: and therefore if the spiritual and eternal Interests of Men may any way be procured or advanced by Political Government, the procuring and advancing those Interests must in all reason be received amongst the Ends of Civil Society, and so consequently fall within the compass of the Magistrate's Jurisdiction.</hi> Concerning the extent of the Magistrate's Jurisdiction, and the Ends of Civil Society, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Author or you have begg'd the Question, which is the chief business of your 56th, and two or three following Pages, I shall leave it to the Readers to judg, and bring the matter, if you please, to a shorter I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ue. The Question is, Whether the Magistrate has any Power to interpose Force in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or for the Salvation of Souls? The Argument against it is, That Civil Societies are not constituted for that End, and the Magistrate cannot use Force for Ends for which the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was not constituted.</p>
            <p>The End of a Commonwealth constituted can be supposed no other, than what Men in the Constitution of, and entring into it propos'd; and that could be nothing but Protection from such Injuries from other Men, which they desiring to avoid, nothing but Force could prevent or remedy: all things but this being as well attainable by Men living in Neighbourhood without the Bonds of a Commonwealth, they could propose to themselves no other thing but this in quitting their Natural Liberty, and putting themselves under the Umpirage of a <hi>Civil Soveraign,</hi> who therefore had the Force of all the Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth put into his Hands, to make his Decrees to this end be obeyed. Now since no Man, or Society of Men can by their Opinions in Religion, or Ways of Worship, do any Man who differed from them any Injury, which he could not avoid or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, if he desired it, without the help of Force; the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Opinion in Religion, or Ways of Worship by the Force given the Magistrate, could not be intended by those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, or entred into the Commonwealth, and so could be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49288:32"/>
no End of it, but quite the contrary. For Force from a strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Hand to bring a Man to a Religion, which another thinks the true, being an Injury which in the State of Nature every one would avoid, Protection from such Injury is one of the Ends of a Commonwealth, and so every Man has a right to Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If you will say, that Commonwealths are not voluntary Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties constituted by Men, and by Men freely entred into, I shall desire you to prove it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time allowing it you for good, that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths are constituted by God for Ends which he has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without the consent and contrivance of Men. If you say, that one of those Ends is the Propagation of the true Religion, and the Salvation of Mens Souls; I shall desire you to shew me any such End expresly appointed by God in Revelation; which since, as you confess, you cannot do, you have recourse to the general Law of Nature, and what is that? The Law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whereby every one is commissioned to do Good. And the propagating the true Religion for the Salvation of Mens Souls, being doing Good, you say, the <hi>Civil Soveraigns</hi> are commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and required by that Law to use their Force for those Ends. But since by this Law all <hi>Civil Soveraigns</hi> are commissioned and obliged alike to use their <hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ive Power</hi> for the propagating the true Religion, and the Salvation of Souls; and it is not possible for them to execute such a Commission, or obey that Law, but by using Force to bring Men to that Religion which they judg the true; by which use of Force much more Harm than Good would be done towards the propagating the true Religion in the World, as I have shewed elsewhere: therefore no such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, whose Execution would do more Harm than Good, more hinder than promote the End for which it is supposed gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, can be a Commission from God by the Law of Nature. And this I suppose may satisfy you about the End of Civil Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties or Commonwealths, and answer what you say concerning the Ends attainable by them.</p>
            <p>But that you may not think the great Position of yours, which is so often usher'd in with <hi>doubtless,</hi> (for which you imagine you have sufficient Warrant in a misapplied School-Maxim) is past over too slightly, and is not sufficiently answered; I shall give you that farther Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49288:33"/>
You say, <hi>Civil Societies are instituted for the attaining all the Benefits which Civil Society or Political Government can yield;</hi> and <note place="margin">p. 58.</note> the Reason you give for it, because <hi>it has hitherto been universally acknowledged that no Power is given in vain:</hi> and therefore if I <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept any of those Benefits,</hi> I shall <hi>be obliged to admit that the Power of attaining them was given in vain.</hi> And if I do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, no harm will follow in humane Affairs: or if I may bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row an elegant Expression of yours out of the foregoing Leaf, <hi>The Fortune of</hi> Europe <hi>does not turn upon it.</hi> In the voluntary Institution and bestowing of Power, there is no Absurdity or Inconvenience at all, that Power, sufficient for several Ends, should be limited by those that give the Power only to one or some part of them. The Power which a General, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a potent Army, has, may be enough to take more Towns than one from the Enemy; or to suppress a domestick Sedition, and yet the Power of attaining those Benefits, which is in his Hand, will not authorize him to imploy the Force of the Army therein, if he be commission'd only to besiege and take one certain Place. So it is in a Commonwealth. The Power that is in the Civil Soveraign is the Force of all the Subjects of the Commonwealth, which supposing it sufficient for other Ends, then the preserving the Members of the Commonwealth in Peace from Injury and Violence: yet if those who gave him that Power, limited the Application of it to that sole End, no Opinion of any other Benefits attainable by it can authorize him to use it otherwise.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour tells us expresly, that <hi>all Power was given him in</hi>

               <hi>Doubtless Commonwealths are instituted for the attaining all those Benefits which Political Government can yield; therefore if the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal Interests of Men may any way be procured or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by Political Government, the procuring and advancing those Interests must in all Reason be reckoned among the Ends of Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and so consequently fall within the Compass of the Magistrate's Jurisdiction.</hi> For granting it true <hi>that Commonwealths are insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the attaining all those Benefits which Political Government can yield,</hi> it does not follow that <hi>the procuring and advancing the spiritual and eternal Interest</hi> of some few Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth by an Application of Power, which <hi>indirectly and at a Distance,</hi> or by Accident may do some Service that way, whilst at the same time it prejudices a far greater Number in their Civil Interests, can with Reason <hi>be reckon'd amongst the Ends of Civil Society.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>My Argument is as good against your Tenet in your own Words, as in mine, which you except against: your Words are,</hi> Doubtless Commonwealths are instituted for the attaining all the <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> Benefits which Political Government can yield; and therefore if the spiritual and eternal Interest of Men may any way be procured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>To which I answer'd, That if this be so, <q>Then this Position <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 51.</note> must be true, <hi>viz. That all Societies whatsoever are instituted for the attaining all the Benefits that they may any way yield;</hi> there being nothing peculiar to Civil Society in the case, why that Society should be <hi>instituted for the attaining all the Benefits it can any way yield,</hi> and other Societies not.

               </gap>ason you give to destroy my Inference, I am to thank you for, if you understood the Force of it, it being the very same I bring to shew that my Inference from your way of arguing is good. I say, that from your way of reasonings about the Ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, `It would follow that all Societies were instituted for one and the same End; unless you take want of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission ` and Authority to be a sufficient Imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>diment. And you tell me here it will not follow, <hi>unless I suppose all Societies enabled by the Powers they are indued with, to attain the same End;</hi> which in other Words is, unless I suppose all who have in their Hands the Force of any Society, to have all of them the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
            <p>The natural Force of all the Members of any Society, or of those who by the Society can be procured to assist it, is in one Sense called the Power of that Society. This Power or Force is generally put into some one or few Persons Hands with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Authority how to use it, and this in another Sense is called also the Power of the Society: And this is the Power you here speak of, and in these following Words, <hi>viz. Several Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties as they are instituted for different Ends; so likewise are they furnished with different Powers proportionate to their respective Ends.</hi> The Power therefore of any Society in this Sense, is nothing but the Authority and Direction given to those that have the Management of the Force or natural Power of the Society, how and to what Ends to use it, by which Commission the Ends of Societies are known and distinguished: so that all Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherein those who are intrusted with the Management of the Force or natural Power of the Society, have Commission and Authority to use the Force or natural Power of the Society to attain the same Benefits, are instituted for the same End. And therefore if in all Societies those who have the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Force or natural Power of the Society, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission'd or authorized to use that Force to attain all the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits attainable by it, all Societies are instituted to the same End: And so what I said will still be true, <hi>viz.</hi> `That a Family and <note place="margin">P. 51.</note> an Army, a Commonwealth and a Church, have all the same End. And if your Hypothesis hold good, one of the Ends of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49288:35"/>
a Family must be to preach the Gospel, and administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; and one Business of an Army to teach Languages, and propagate Religion because these are Benefits <hi>some way or other</hi> attainable by those Societies; unless you take want of Commission and Authority to be a sufficient Impediment: And ` that will be so too in other Cases. To which you have said nothing but what does confirm it, which you will a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter see, when you have considered that any Benefit attainable by Force or natural Power of a Society, does not pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And therefore to your next Paragraph, I shall think it Answer <note place="margin">P. 58.</note> enough to print here Side by Side with it, that Paragraph of mine to which you intended it as an Answer.</p>

            <p>You tell us, <hi>the true Religion is undoubtedly true.</hi> If you had told us too, who is undoubtedly Judg of it, you had put all past doubt: but till you will be pleased to determine that, it will be undoubtedly true, that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Judg of it at <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> and the Emperor at <hi>Vienna,</hi> as the King of <hi>England</hi> in this Island: I do not say they judg as right, but they are by as much Right Judges, and therefore have as much Right to punish those who dissent from Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism and Popery in those Countries, as any other Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate has to punish any Dissenters from the National Religion any where else. And who can deny but these <hi>Briars and Thorns</hi> laid in their way by the Penal Laws of those Countries, may <hi>do some Service indirectly and at a Distance,</hi> to bring Men there severely and <hi>impartially to examine</hi> Matters of Religion, and so <hi>to imbrace the Truth that must save them,</hi> which the bare outward Profession of any Religion in the World will not do?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> true Religion which is undoubtedly true, <hi>you tell us too,</hi> never any body studied with such Care and Diligence as he might and ought to use, and with an honest Mind, but he was convinced of the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>If you will resolve it in your short circular way, and tell me <hi>such Diligence as one ought to use,</hi> is such Diligence as brings one <hi>to be convinced,</hi> it is a Question too easy to be asked. If I should desire to know plainly what is to be understood by it, it would be a Question too hard for you to answer, and therefore I shall not trouble you with demanding what this <hi>Diligence</hi> which a Man <hi>may and ought to use,</hi> is; nor what you mean by an <hi>honest Mind.</hi> I only ask you, whether Force, your way applied, be able to produce them? that so the Commonwealth may have the <hi>Benefits</hi> you propose from Mens being convinced of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently imbracing <hi>the true Religion,</hi> which you say no Body
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49288:36"/>
can miss, who is brought to that <hi>Diligence,</hi> and that <hi>honest Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Benefits to the Commonwealth are, 1. That <hi>the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that this Method propagates, makes good Men, and good Men are always the best Subjects, and often procure the Favour of God to the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety they are Members of.</hi> Being forward enough to grant that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contributes so much to the Benefit of a Society, as that it be made up of good Men, I began presently to give into your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which promises so sure a way to make Men so <hi>study</hi> the true Religion, that they cannot miss the being <hi>convinced</hi> of the Truth of it, and so hardly avoid being really of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and consequently good Men. But that I might not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in a thing of that consequence, I began to look about in those Countries where Force had been made use of to propagate what you allowed to be the true Religion, and found Complaints of as great a Scarcity of good Men there, as in other places. A Friend whom I discoursed on this Point, said, It might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be that the World had not yet had the benefit of your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: because Law-makers had not yet been able to find that just Temper of Penalties on which your Propagation of the true Religion was built; and that therefore it was great pity you had not yet discovered this great Secret, but 'twas to be hoped you would. Another, who stood by, said, he did not see how your Method could make Men it wrought on, and brought to Conformity, better than others, unless corrupt Nature with Impunity were like to produce better Men in one outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession than in another. To which I replied, That we did not look on Conformists through a due Medium; for if we did with you allow it <hi>presumable</hi> that all who consormed did it upon <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> there could be no just Complaint of the Scarcity of good Men: And so we got over that Difficulty.</p>
            <p>The second Benefit you say your use of Force brings to the Commonwealth, is, That <hi>this Care in any Commonwealth of God's Honour and Mens Salvation, entitles it to his special Protection and Blessing.</hi> Then certainly all <hi>Commonwealths</hi> that have any regard to the <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Blessing</hi> of God, will not neglect to <hi>intitle themselves</hi> to it, by using of Force to promote that Religion they believe to be true. But I beseech you what Care is this <hi>of the Honour of God, and Mens Salvation,</hi> you speak of? Is it, as you have owned it, a Care by Penalties to make Men outwardly

                  </gap>r, Sir, you forget your self. The Author was not writing against your new Hypothesis, before it was known in the World. He may be excused, if he had not the Gift of Prophecy, to argue against a Notion which was not yet started. He had in view only the Laws hitherto made, and the Punishments (in Matters of Religion) in use in the World. The Penalties, as I take it, are laid on Men for being of different Ways of Religion: which, what is it other but to <hi>compel</hi> them to relinquish their own, and to conform themselves to that from which they differ? If this be not to <hi>compel them to the Magistrate's Religion,</hi> pray tell us what is? This must be necessarily so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; unless it can be supposed that the Law intends not to have that done, which with Penalties it commands to be done; or that Punishments are not Compulsion, not that Compulsion the Author complains of. The Law says, <hi>Do this, and live;</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this Doctrine, conform to this way of Worship, and be at ease, and free; or else be fined, imprisoned, banished, burnt. If you can shew among the Laws that have been made in <hi>England</hi> concerning Religion, (and I think I may say any where else) any one that punishes Men for not having <hi>imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally examined the Religion they have embraced or refused,</hi> I think I may yield you the Cause. Law-makers have been generally wiser than to make Laws that could not be executed: and therefore their Laws were against Nonconformists, which could be known; and not for <hi>impartial Examination,</hi> which could not. 'Twas not then <hi>besides</hi> the Author's <hi>Business,</hi> to bring an Argument against the Persecutions here in fashion. He did not know that any one, who was so free as to acknowledg that the <hi>Magistrate has not an Authority to compel any one to his Religion,</hi> and thereby at once (as you have done) give up all the Laws now in force against Dissenters, had yet Rods in store
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49288:39"/>
for them, and by a new Trick would bring them under the lash of the Law, when the old Pretences were too much explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to serve any longer. Have you never heard of such a thing as the <hi>Religion establish'd by Law?</hi> which is it seems the Lawful Religion of a Country, and to be complied with as such. There being such Things, such Notions yet in the World, it was not <hi>quite besides the Author's business</hi> to alledg, that <hi>God never gave such Authority to one Man over another, as to compel any one to his Religion.</hi> I will grant, if you please, <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion establish'd by Law</hi> is a pretty odd way of speaking in the Mouth of a Christian, (and yet it is much in fashion) as if the Magistrate's Authority could add any Force or Sanction to any Religion, whether true or false. I am glad to find you have so far considered <hi>the Magistrate's Authority,</hi> that you agree with the Author, that he <hi>hath none to compel Men to his Religion:</hi> Much less can he, by any Establishment of Law, add any thing to the Truth or Validity of his own, or any Religion whatsoever.</p>
            </q>
            <p>That above-annexed is all the Answer you think this Paragraph of mine deserves. But yet in that little you say, you must give me leave to take notice, <hi>that if,</hi> as you say, <hi>the Magistrate's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may do much towards the upholding and preserving the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion within his Jurisdiction;</hi> so also may it do much towards the upholding and preserving of a false Religion, <hi>and in that respect,</hi> if you say true, <hi>may be said to establish it.</hi> For I think I need not mind you here again, that it must unavoidably depend upon his Opinion, what shall be established for true, or rejected as false.</p>
            <p>And thus you have my Thoughts concerning the most mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of what you say touching the Magistrate's Commission to use Force in Matters of Religion, together with some incident Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in your Answer, which I have taken notice of as they have come in my way.</p>

               <hi>quietly enough among us, and enjoy the Protection of the Government against all Violence and Injuries, without being</hi> endenizon'd, <hi>or made Members of the</hi> Commonwealth; <hi>which alone can entitle them to the</hi> Civil Rights <hi>and Privileges of it. But as to</hi> Jews, Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans <hi>and</hi> Pagans, <hi>if any of them do not care to live among us, unless they may be admitted to the</hi> Rights <hi>and Privileges of the</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; <hi>the refusing them that Favour is not, I suppose, to be looked upon as</hi> driving them from us, <hi>or</hi> excluding them from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and probable Means of Conversion; <hi>but as a just and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Caution in a Christian Commonwealth, in respect to the Members of it: Who, if such as profess</hi> Judaism, <hi>or</hi> Mahometanism, <hi>or</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism, <hi>were permitted to enjoy the same Rights with them, would be much the more in danger to be seduced by them; seeing they would lose no worldly Advantage by such a Change of their Religion: Whereas if they could not turn to any of those Religions, without forfeiting the</hi> Civil Rights of the Commonwealth <hi>by doing it, 'tis likely they would consider well before they did it, what ground there was to expect that they should get any thing by the Exchange, which would counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the Loss they should sustain by it.</hi> I thought Protection and Impunity of Men, not offending in Civil Things, might have been accounted the Civil Rights of the Commonwealth, which the Author meant: but you, to make it seem more, add the word <hi>Privileges.</hi> Let it be so. Live amongst you then <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> may; but <hi>endenizon'd</hi> they must not be.

Or if some that are in the way to Perdition, may be Members of the Commonwealth, why must these be excluded upon the account of Religion?

Whatever it was that so disposed the Jews to Idolatry before the Captivity, sure it is, they firmly resisted it, and refused to change, not only where they might have done it on equal terms, but have had great Advantage to boot; and therefore 'tis possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that there is something in this matter, which neither you nor I do fully comprehend, and may with a becoming Humility sit down and confess, that in this, as well as other Parts of his Providence, God's Ways are past finding out. But this we may be certain from this Instance of the Jews, that it is not reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to conclude, that because they were once inclin'd to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, that therefore they, or any other People are in <hi>Danger</hi> to turn Pagans, whenever they <hi>shall lose no worldly Advantage by such a Change.</hi> But if we may oppose nearer and known In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to more remote and uncertain, look into the World, and tell me, since Jesus Christ brought Life and Immortality to light through the Gospel, where the Christian Religion meeting Judaism, Mahometism or Paganism upon equal terms, lost so plainly by it, that you have Reason to suspect the Members of a Christian Commonwealth would <hi>be in Danger to be seduced</hi> to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>them,</hi> if <hi>they should lose no worldly Advantage by such a Change of their Religion,</hi> rather than likely to increase among them? Till you can find then some better Reason for excluding Jews, &amp;c. from <hi>the Rights of the Commonwealth,</hi> you must give us leave to look on this as a bare Pretence. Besides, I think you are under a Mistake, which shews your Pretence against ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Jews, Mahometans and Pagans, to the Civil Rights of the Commonwealth, is ill grounded; for what Law I pray is there in <hi>England,</hi> that they <hi>who turn to any of those Religions, forfeit the Civil Rights of the Commonwealth by doing it?</hi> Such a Law I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to shew me; and if you cannot, all this Pretence is out of doors, and Men of your Church, since on that Account <hi>they would lose no worldly Advantage by the Change, are in as much Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be seduced,</hi> whether Jews, Mahometans and Pagans, are indenizon'd or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that you may not be thought too gracious, you tell us, That</hi> as to Pagans particularly <hi>you</hi> are so far from thinking that they <note place="margin">P. 3.</note> ought not to be excluded from the Civil Rights of the Commonwealth, because of their Religion, that <hi>you</hi> cannot see how their Religion can be suffered by any Commonwealth that knows and worships the only true God, if they would be thought to retain any Jealousy for his Honour,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49288:41"/>
               <hi>or even for that of humane Nature.</hi> Thus then you order the matter; <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> may be permitted to live in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Commonwealth with the Exercise of their Religion, but not be endenizon'd: <hi>Pagans</hi> may also be permitted to live there, but not to have the Exercise of their Religion, nor be endenizon'd.</p>
            <p>This according to the best of my Apprehension is the Sense of your Words; for the Clearness of your Thoughts, or your Cause does not always suffer you to speak plainly and directly; as here, having been speaking a whole Page before what Usage the Persons of Jews, Mahometans and Pagans were to have, you on a sudden tell us their Religion is not to be suffered, but say not what must be done with their Persons. For do you think it reasonable that Men who have any Religion, should live amongst you without the Exercise of that Religion, in order to their Conversion? which is no other but to make them down-right irreligious, and render the very Notion of a Deity insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and of no Influence to them in order to their Conversion: It being less dangerous to Religion in general, to have Men ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of a Deity, and so without any Religion; than to have them acknowledg a superiour Being, but yet to teach or allow them to neglect or refuse worshipping him in that way, that they believe he requires, to render them acceptable to him: It being a great deal less Fault (and that which we were every one of us once guilty of) to be ignorant of him, than acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a God, and not to pay him the Honour which we think due to him. <hi>I do not see</hi> therefore how those <hi>who retain any Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy for the Honour of God,</hi> can permit Men to live amongst them in order to their Conversion, and require of them not to honour God according to the best of their Knowledg: unless you think it a Preparation to your true Religion, to require Men sensibly <note place="margin">P. 62.</note> and knowingly to affront the Deity; and to perswade them that the Religion you would bring them to, can allow Men to make bold with the Sense they have of him, and to refuse him the Honour which in their Consciences they are perswaded is due to him, which must to them and every Body else appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with all Religion. Since therefore to admit their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons without the Exercise of their Religion, cannot be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor conducing to their Conversion; if the Exercise of their Religion, as you say, be not to be <hi>suffered among us till they are converted,</hi> I do not see how their Persons can be suffered
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49288:42"/>
among us, if that Exception must be added, <hi>till they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;</hi> and whether then they are not <hi>excluded from the ordinary means of Conversion,</hi> I leave you to consider.</p>
            <p>I wonder this Necessity had not made you think on another way of their having the ordinary means of Conversion, without their living amongst us, that way by which in the beginning of Christianity it was brought to the Heathen World by the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and Preaching of the Apostles. But the Successors of the Apostles are not, it seems, Successors to this part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, <hi>Go and teach all Nations.</hi> And indeed it is one thing to be an Ambassador from God to People that are already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and have provided good Benefices, another to be an Ambassador from Heaven in a Country where you have neither the Countenance of the Magistrate, nor the devout Obedience of the People. And who sees not how one is bound to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the propagating of the true Religion, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, converting and saving of Souls, in a Country where it is establish'd by Law? who can doubt but that there those who talk so much of it, are in earnest? Though yet some Men will hardly forbear doubting, that those Men, however they pray for it, are not much concerned for the Conversion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, who will neither go to them to instruct them, nor suffer them to come to us for the means of Conversion.</p>
            <p>'Tis true what you say, <hi>what Pagans call Religion is Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Almighty.</hi> But if that requires any thing from those <hi>who retain any Jealousy for the Honour of God,</hi> it is something more than barely about the Place where those Abominations shall be <hi>committed.</hi> The true Concern <hi>for the Honour of God</hi> is not, that Idolatry should be shut out of <hi>England,</hi> but that it should be lessen'd every where, and by the Light and Preaching of the Gospel be banished out of the World. If Pagans and Idolaters are, as you say, the <hi>greatest Dishonour conceivable to God Almighty,</hi> they are as much so on t'other side of <hi>Tweed,</hi> or the Sea, as on this; for he from his Throne equally beholds all the Dwellers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>on Earth. Those therefore who are truly <hi>jealous for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God</hi> will not, upon the Account of his <hi>Honour,</hi> be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their being in this or in that Place, while there are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the World; but that the Number of those who are such a <hi>Dishonour</hi> to him, should every Day be as much as possible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished, and they be brought to give him his due Tribute of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49288:42"/>
Honour and Praise in a right way of Worship. 'Tis in this that a <hi>Jealousy,</hi> which is in earnest for <hi>God's Honour,</hi> truly shews it self, in wishing and indeavouring to abate the <hi>Abomination,</hi> and drive <hi>Idolatry</hi> out of the World, not in driving Idolaters out of any one Country, or sending them away to Places and Company, where they shall find more Incouragement to it. 'Tis a strange <hi>Jealousy for the Honour of God,</hi> that looks not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond such a Mountain or River as divides a Christian and Pagan Country. Where-ever Idolatry is committed, there God's <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> is concerned; and thither Mens <hi>Jealousy for his Honour,</hi> if it be sincere indeed, will extend, and be in Pain to lessen and take away the Provocation. But the Place God is provoked and dishonoured in, which is a narrow Consideration in respect of the Lord of all the Earth, will no otherwise imploy their Zeal, who are in earnest, than as it may more or less conduce to the Conversion of the Offenders.</p>
            <p>But if your <hi>Jealousy for the Honour of God,</hi> ingages you so far against Mens committing Idolatry in certain Places, that you think those ought to be excluded from the Rights of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and not to be suffered to be Denizons, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Place in the <hi>Romans</hi> brought by you, <hi>are without Excuse, because when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, but became vain in their Imaginations, and changed the Glory of the incorruptible God into an Image made like to corruptible Man.</hi> I shall only change some of the Words in the Text you cite out of <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah; I have baked part thereof on the Coals, and eaten it, and shall I make the residue thereof a God? shall I fall down to that which comes of a Plant?</hi> And so leave them with you to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Jealousy in earnest carries you so far as you talk of; and whether when you have looked about you, you are still of the Mind, that those who do such things should be disfranchised and sent away, and the Exercise of no such Religion be any where permitted amongst us? for those things are no less an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination to God under a Christian than Pagan Name. One Word more I have to say to your <hi>Jealousy for the Honour of God,</hi> that if it be any thing more than in Talk, it will set it self no less earnestly against other <hi>Abominations,</hi> and the Practisers of them than against that of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>As to that in <hi>Job</hi> XXXI. 26, 27, 28. where he says Idolatry <hi>is to be punished by the Judg;</hi> this Place alone, were there no
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49288:43"/>
other, is sufficient to confirm their Opinion, who conclude that Book to be writ by a Jew. And how little the punishing of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in that Commonwealth concerns our present Case, I refer you for Information to the Author's Letter. But how does your Jealousy for the Honour of God, carry you to an Exclusion of the Pagan Religion from amongst you, but yet admit of the Jewish and Mahometan? Or is not the Honour of God concern'd in their denying our Saviour?</p>

This being a Contest only about the signification of a short Syllable in the English Tongue, we must leave to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of that Language to judg which of these two is the proper use of it.

               </gap>nse you please, what I said will be nevertheless true, (<hi>viz.</hi>) `That to punish Dissenters, as Dissenters, to make them consider, has something impracticable in it, unless not to be of the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ` Religion, and not to consider, be the same thing.

            <p>The Law punishes all Dissenters: For what? To make them all conform, that's evident; To what end? To make them all <hi>consider,</hi> say you: That cannot be, for it says nothing of it; nor
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49288:46"/>
is it certain that all Dissenters have not considered; nor is there any care taken by the Law to enquire whether they have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, when they do conform; yet this was the End intended by the Magistrate. So then with you it is practicable and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable in making Laws, for the Legislator to lay Punishments by Law on Men, for an End which they may be ignorant of, for he says nothing of it; on Men, whom he never takes care to enquire, whether they have done it or no, before he relax the Punishment, which had no other <hi>next End,</hi> but to make them do it. But though he says nothing of considering in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Penalties, nor asks any thing about it, when he takes them off; yet every body must understand that he so meant it. Sir, <hi>Sancho Pancha</hi> in the Government of his Island, did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that Men should understand his meaning by his gaping: but in another Island it seems, if you had the Management, you would not think it to have any thing of Impracticable or Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick in it. For how far the provision of Means of Instruction takes this off, we shall see in another place. And lastly, to lay Punishments on Men for an End which is already attained, (for some among the Dissenters may have considered) is what other Law-makers look on as impracticable, or at least unjust. But to this you answer in your usual way of Circle, That <hi>if</hi> I <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 24:</note> you <hi>are for punishing Dissenters whether they consider or no,</hi> I am <hi>in a great mistake; for the Dissenters (which is</hi> my <hi>Word, not</hi> yours) <hi>whom</hi> you <hi>are for punishing, are only such as reject the true Religion proposed to them with Reasons and Arguments sufficient to convince them of the Truth of it, who therefore can never be supposed to consider those Reasons and Arguments as they ought, whilst they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in rejecting that Religion, or (in</hi> my <hi>Language)</hi> continue Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters; <hi>for if they did so consider them, they would not continue Dissenters.</hi> Of the Fault for which Men were to be punished, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the <hi>End</hi> for which they were to be punished, we heard nothing, as I remember, in the first Draught of your Scheme, which we had in <hi>The Argument considered,</hi> &amp;c.

Make that practicable by your Scheme, and you have done something to perswade us that your <hi>End</hi> in earnest in the Use of Force, is to make Men <hi>consider,</hi> understand, and be of the True Religion; and that the <hi>rejecting the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion tender'd with sufficient Evidence,</hi> is the Crime which <hi>bonâ fide</hi> you would have punished; and till you do this, all that you may say concerning punishing Men to make them <hi>consider as they ought, to make them receive the true Religion, to make them imbrace the Truth that must save them,</hi> &amp;c. will with all sober, judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unbiassed Readers, pass only for the Mark of great Zeal, if it scape amongst Men as warm and as sagacious as you are, a harsher Name: whilst those Conformists who neglect Matters of Religion, who <hi>reject</hi> the saving Truths of the Gospel, as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly and as certainly as any Dissenters, have yet no Penalties laid upon them.</p>
            <p>You talk much of <hi>considering</hi> and <hi>not considering as one ought; of imbracing and rejecting the true Religion,</hi> and abundance more to this purpose, which all, however very good and savoury Words, that look very well, when you come to the Application of Force, to procure that End expressed in them, amount to no more but Conformity and Non-conformity. If you see not this, I pity you; for I would fain think you a fair Man, who means well, though you have not light upon the right way to the End you propose: But if you see it, and persist in your Use of these good Expressions to lead Men into a Mistake in this Matter; consider what my <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> could do worse to <hi>serve a bad Cause.</hi>

            <p>Whether all you say have any thing more in it than this, I appeal to my Readers; and should willingly do it to you, did not I fear, that the jumbling of those good and plausible Words in your Head, of <hi>sufficient Evidence, consider as one ought,</hi> &amp;c. might a little jargogle your Thoughts, and lead you hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd the round of your own beaten Circle. This is a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger those are much exposed to, who accustom themselves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and doubtful terms, and so put together, that though asunder they signify something, yet when their meaning comes to be cast up as they are placed, it amounts to just nothing.</p>

               <hi>that Religion;</hi> you <hi>think the most natural Construction of those Laws is, that they require Men to imbrace it upon Instruction and Conviction, as it cannot be expected they should do without examining the Grounds upon which it stands.</hi> Your Answer were very true, if they could not imbrace without examining and Conviction. But since there is a shorter way to imbracing, which cost no more Pains than walking as far as the Church, your Answer no more proves, that the Law requires examining, than if a Man at <hi>Harwich</hi> being subpena'd to appear in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> next Term, you should say the Subpena required him to come by Sea, because there was sufficient means provided for his Passage in the ordinary Boat that by Appointment goes constantly from <hi>Harwich</hi> to <hi>London:</hi> But he taking it to be more for his Ease and Dispatch, goes the shorter way by Land, and finds that having made his Appearance in Court as was required, the Law is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and there is no Inquiry made, what way he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>If therefore Men can imbrace so as to satisfy the Law without examining, and it be true that they so <hi>fly from the means of right Information,</hi> are so <hi>negligent</hi> in, and <hi>averse to examining,</hi> that there is need of Penalties to make them do it, as you tell us at large; <note place="margin">A. <hi>p</hi> 6, &amp;c</note> How is it a <hi>natural Construction</hi> of those Laws, that they require Men to examine, which having provided sufficient means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, require Men only to conform, without saying any thing of examining? especially when the Cause assigned by you of Mens neglecting to examine, is not want of <hi>means of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but want of <hi>Penalties</hi> to <hi>over-ballance</hi> their <hi>Aversion</hi> to the <note place="margin">P. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>To avoid these Absurdities, you have reformed your Scheme, and now in your Reply own with the frankest Persecutors, that you punish Men downright for their Religion, and that to be a Dissenter from the true Religion, is a <hi>Fault</hi> to be punished by the Magistrate. This indeed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>To what I said <hi>L.</hi> 2. from <hi>p.</hi> 25, to <hi>p.</hi> 32. concerning those who by your Scheme are to be punished, you having thought sit not to answer any thing, I shall here again offer it to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Let us inquire, First, Who it is you would have be punished. In the Place above cited, they are <hi>those who are got into a wrong way, and are deaf to all Perswasions.</hi> If these are the Men to be punished, let a Law be made against them: you have my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; and that is the proper Course to have Offenders punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For you do not, I hope, intend to punish any Fault by a Law, which you do not name in the Law; nor make a Law against any Fault you would not have punished. And now, if you are sincere, and in earnest, and are (as a fair Man should be) for what your Words plainly signify, and nothing else; what will such a Law serve for? <hi>Men in the wrong Way are to be punished:</hi> but who are <hi>in the wrong Way,</hi> is the Question. You
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49288:49"/>
have no more reason to determine it against one, who differs from you, than he has to conclude against you, who differ from him: No, not tho you have the Magistrate and the National Church on your side. For if to differ from them be to be <hi>in the wrong Way;</hi> you who are <hi>in the right Way</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> will be <hi>in the wrong Way</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Every one here must be Judg for himself: And your Law will reach no body, till you have convinced him he is <hi>in the wrong Way:</hi> and then there will be no need of Punishment to make him consider; unless you will affirm again what you have denied, and have Men punished for imbracing the Religion they believe to be true, when it differs from yours or the Publick.</p>
               <p>Besides being <hi>in the wrong Way,</hi> those who you would have punished, must be such as are <hi>deaf to all Perswasions.</hi> But any such, I suppose, you will hardly sind, who hearken to no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not to those of their own Way. If you mean by <hi>deaf to all Perswasions,</hi> all Perswasions of a contrary Party, or of a different Church; such, I suppose, you may abundantly find in your own Church, as well as else-where; and I presume to them you are so charitable, that you would not have them punished for not lending an Ear to Seducers. For Constancy in the Truth, and Perseverance in the Faith, is (I hope) rather to be incouraged, than by any Penalties check'd in the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox. And your Church doubtless, as well as all others, is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox to it self in all its Tenets. If you mean by <hi>all Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> all your Perswasion, or all Perswasion of those of your Communion; you do but beg the Question, and suppose you have a right to punish those who differ from, and will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your next Words are,</hi> When Men fly from the means of a right Information, and will not so much as consider how reasonable it is throughly and impartially to examine a Religion, which they embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon such Inducements as ought to have no sway at all in the matter, and therefore with little or no Examination of the proper Grounds of it; What humane Method can be used to bring them to act like Men, in an Affair of such consequence, and to make a wiser and more rational Choice, but that of laying such Penalties upon them, as may ballance the weight of those Prejudices which inclined them to prefer a false Way before the true, and recover them to so much Sobriety and Ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ction, as seriously to put the question to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49288:50"/>
                  <hi>Whether it be really worth the while to undergo such Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences for adhering to a Religion, which, for any thing they know, may be false, or for rejecting another (if that be the case) which, for any thing they know, may be true, till they have brought it to the Bar of Reason, and given it a fair trial there?</hi> Here you again bring in such as <hi>prefer a false Way before a true:</hi> to which having answered already, I shall here say no more, but, That since our Church will not allow those to be in a <hi>false Way</hi> who are out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which pretends Infallibility) declares hers to be the <hi>only true Way;</hi> certainly no one of our Church (nor any other, which claims not Infallibility) can require any one to take the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of any Church, as a sufficient Proof of the Truth of her own Doctrine. So that <hi>true and false</hi> (as it commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, when we suppose them for our selves, or our Party) in effect, signify just nothing, or nothing to the purpose; unless we can think that <hi>true or false</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which will not be so at <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Geneva;</hi> and <hi>Vice versâ.</hi> As for the rest of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of those, <hi>on whom</hi> you are here <hi>laying Penalties;</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you consider whether it will not belong to any of your Church, let it be what it will. Consider, I say, if there be none in your Church <hi>who have imbraced her Religion upon such Inducements as ought to have no sway at all in the matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with little or no Examination of the proper Grounds of it;</hi> who <hi>have not been inclined by Prejudices;</hi> who do not <hi>adhere to a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which for any thing they know may be false;</hi> and who have <hi>rejected another, which for any thing they know may be true.</hi> If you have any such in your Communion, (and 'twill be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, though I fear but a little Flock that has none such in it) consider well what you have done. You have prepared Rods for them, for which I imagine they will con you no thanks. For to make any tolerable Sense of what you here propose, it must be understood that you would have Men of all Religions punished, to make them consider <hi>whether it be really worth the while to undergo such Inconveniences for adhering to a Religion, which for any thing they know may be false.</hi> If you hope to avoid that, by what you have said of <hi>true and false;</hi> and pretend that the supposed <hi>Preference of the true Way</hi> in your Church, ought to preserve its Members from your Punishment; you manifestly trifle. For every Church's Testimony, that it has chosen the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49288:50"/>
                  <hi>true Way,</hi> must be taken for it self; and then none will be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and your new Invention of Punishment is come to nothing: Or else the differing Churches Testimonies must be taken one for another; and then they will be all out of the <hi>true Way,</hi> and your Church <hi>need</hi> Penalties as well as the rest. So that, upon your Principles, they must all or none be punished. Chuse which you please; one of them, I think, you cannot escape.</p>
               <p>What you say in the next Words; <hi>Where Instruction is stifly refused, and all Admonitions and Perswasions prove vain and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual;</hi> differs nothing but in the way of expressing, from <hi>Deaf to all Perswasions:</hi> And so that is answered already.</p>
               <p>In another place, you give us another description of those you think ought to be punished, in these Words; <hi>Those who refuse to embrace the Doctrine, and submit to the Spiritual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the proper Ministers of Religion, who by special Designati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are appointed to Exhort, Admonish, Reprove,</hi> &amp;c. Here then, those to be punished, <hi>are such who refuse to imbrace the Doctrine, and submit to the Government of the proper Ministers of Religion.</hi> Whereby we are as much still at uncertainty as we were before, who those are who (by your Scheme, and Laws sutable to it) are to be punished; since every Church has, as it thinks, its <hi>proper Ministers of Religion:</hi> And if you mean <hi>those that refuse to imbrace the Doctrine, and submit to the Government of the Ministers of another Church;</hi> then all Men will be guilty, and must be punished, even those of your own Church as well as others. If you mean <hi>those who refuse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Ministers of their own Church,</hi> very few will incur your Penalties: But if by these <hi>proper Ministers of Religion,</hi> the Ministers of some particular Church are intended, why do you not name it? Why are you so reserved in a Matter, wherein, if you speak not out, all the rest that you say will be to no purpose? Are Men to be punished for <hi>refusing to imbrace the Doctrine, and submit to the Government of the proper Ministers of the Church of</hi> Geneva? For this time (since you have declared nothing to the contrary) let me sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you of that Church; and then I am sure, that is it that you would name: for of whatever Church you are, if you think the Ministers of any one Church ought to be hear kned to, and obeyed, it must be those of your own. There are Persons to be punished, you say: This you contend for all through your Book, and lay so much stress on it, that you make the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49288:51"/>
Preservation and Propagation of Religion, and the Salvation of Souls, to depend on it: and yet you describe them by so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and equivocal Marks, that, unless it be upon Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which no body will grant you, I dare say, neither you nor any body else will be able to find one guilty. Pray find me, if you can, a Man whom you can judicially prove (for he that is to be punished by Law, must be fairly tried) <hi>is in a wrong way,</hi> in respect of his Faith; I mean, who is <hi>deaf to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, who flies from all means of a right Information, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses to imbrace the Doctrine, and submit to the Government of the Spiritual Pastors.</hi> And when you have done that, I think I may allow you what Power you please to punish him, without any prejudice to the Toleration the Author of the Letter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
               <p>But why, I pray, all this boggling, all this loose talking, as if you knew not what you meant, or durst not speak it out? Would you be for punishing some body, you know not whom? I do not think so ill of you. Let me then speak out for you. The Evidence of the Argument has convinced you that Men ought not to be persecuted for their Religion; That the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in use amongst Christians cannot be defended; That the Magistrate has not Authority to compel any one to his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This you are forced to yield. But you would fain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain some Power in the Magistrate's Hands to punish Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, upon a new Pretence, <hi>viz.</hi> not for having imbraced the Doctrine and Worship they believe to be True and Right, but for not having well considered their own and the Magistrate's Religion. To shew you that I do not speak wholly without book, give me leave to mind you of one Passage of yours: the Words are, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to put them upon a serious and impartial exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Controversy between the Magistrate and them.</hi> Though these Words be not intended to tell us who you would have punished, yet it may be plainly inferr'd from them. And they more clearly point out whom you aim at, than all the foregoing Places, where you seem to (and should) describe them. For they are such as <hi>between whom and the Magistrate there is a Controversy;</hi> that is, in short, who differ from the Magistrate in Religion. And now indeed you have given us a Note by which these you would have punished may be known. We have, with much ado, found at last whom it is we may
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49288:51"/>
presume you would have punished. Which in other Cases is usually not very difficult: because there the Faults to be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, easily design the Persons to be corrected. But yours is a new Method, and unlike all that ever went before it.</p>
               <p>In the next place, let us see for what you would have them punished. You tell us, and it will easily be granted you, that not to <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>weigh impartially, and without Prejudice or Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> (all which, for shortness sake, we will express by this one word <hi>Consider) the Religion one embraces or refuses,</hi> is a Fault very common, and very prejudicial to true Religion, and the Salvation of Mens Souls. But Penalties and Punishments are very necessary, say you, to remedy this Evil.</p>
               <p>Let us now see how you apply this Remedy. Therefore, say you, let all Dissenters be punished. Why? Have no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters considered of Religion? Or have all Conformists consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? That you your self will not say. Your Project there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is just as reasonable, as if a Lethargy growing Epidemical in <hi>England,</hi> you should propose to have a Law made to blister and scarify and shave the Heads of all who wear Gowns; tho it be certain that neither all who wear Gowns are Lethargick, nor all who are Lethargick wear Gowns.</p>

               <p>For there could not be certainly a more Learned Advice, than that one Man should be pull'd by the Ears, because another is asleep. This, when you have consider'd of it again, (for I find, according to your Principle, all Men have now and then need to be jogg'd) you will, I guess, be convinced is not like a fair Physician, to apply a Remedy to a Disease; but, like an engaged Enemy, to 'vent one's Spleen upon a Party. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense, as well as Common Justice, requires, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of Laws and Penalties should be directed against the Evil that is to be removed, where-ever it be found. And if the Punishment you think so necessary, be (as you pretend) to cure the Mischief you complain of, you must let it pursue, and fall on the Guilty, and those only, in what Company soever they are; and not, as you here propose, and is the highest Injustice, punish the innocent <hi>considering</hi> Dissenter, with the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49288:52"/>
Guilty; and, on the other side, let the <hi>inconsiderate</hi> guilty Conformist scape, with the Innocent. For one may rationally presume that the National Church has some, nay more, in proportion of those who little consider or concern themselves about Religion, than any Congregation of Dissenters. For Conscience, or the Care of their Souls, being once laid aside; Interest, of course, leads Men into that Society, where the Protection and Countenance of the Government, and hopes of Preferment, bid fairest to all their remaining Desires. So that if careless, negligent, inconsiderate Men in Matters of Religion, <hi>who, without being forced, would not consider,</hi> are to be rouzed into a Care of their Souls, and a Search after Truth, by Punishments; the National Religion, in all Countries, will certainly have a right to the greatest share of those Punishments, at least, not to be wholly exempt from them.</p>
               <p>This is that which the Author of the Letter, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, complains of, and that justly, <hi>viz. That the pretended Care of Mens Souls always expresses it self, in those who would have Force any way made use of to that End, in very unequal Methods; some Persons being to be treated with Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whilst others, guilty of the same Faults, are not to be so much as touched.</hi> Though you are got pretty well out of the deep Mud, and renounce Punishments directly for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; yet you stick still in this part of the Mire; whilst you would have Dissenters punished to make them <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> but would not have any thing done to Conformists, though never so negligent in this point of <hi>considering.</hi> The Author's Letter pleased me, because it is equal to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is direct, and will, I think, hold every-where; which I take to be a good Mark of Truth. For I shall always suspect that neither to comport with the Truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or the Design of the Gospel, which is suted to on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some one Country or Party.

where you suppose the Magistrate to be in the right, judg you. Pray, Sir, consider a little, whether Prejudice has not some share in your way of arguing.

If you think of any other, pray tell us. Next there seems some <hi>Difficulty</hi> to know, who shall be Judg what is <hi>sufficient Evidence.</hi> For where a Man is to be punished by Law, he must be convicted of being guilty; which since in this Case he cannot be, unless it be proved he has had the <hi>true Religion tender'd to him with sufficient Evidence,</hi> it is necessary that some body there must be Judg what is <hi>the true Religion,</hi> and what is <hi>sufficient Evidence;</hi> and others to prove it has been so <hi>tender'd.</hi> If you were to be of the Jury, we know what would be your Verdict concerning <hi>sufficient Evidence,</hi> by these Words of yours, <hi>To say that a Man who has the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

               <hi>Evidence, but such as will certainly win Assent where-ever it is duly considered?</hi> Upon which his conforming, or not conforming, would without any farther Questions determine the Point. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the rest of the Jury could upon this be able ever to bring in any Man guilty, and so liable to Punishment, is a Question. <hi>For if sufficient Evidence be</hi> only that <hi>which certainly wins Assent,</hi> where-ever a Man <hi>does his utmost in considering,</hi> 'twill be very hard to prove that a Man who rejects the <hi>true Religion,</hi> has had it tender'd with <hi>sufficient Evidence,</hi> because it will be very hard to prove he has not <hi>done his utmost in considering it.</hi> So that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all you have here said, to punish any Man by your Method is not yet so very practicable.</p>
            <p>But you clear all in your following Words, which say, <hi>There is nothing more evident than that those who reject the true Religion, are culpable, and deserve to be punished.</hi> By whom? By Men: That's so far from being evident, as you talk, that it will require bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Proofs than I have yet seen for it. Next you say, <hi>'Tis easy enough to know when Men reject the true Religion.</hi> Yes, when the true Religion is known, and agreed on what shall be taken to be so in Judicial Proceedings, which can scarce be till 'tis agreed who shall determine what is <hi>true Religion,</hi> and what not. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Penalty should in the University be laid on those who rejected the <hi>true Peripatetick</hi> Doctrine, could that Law be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on any one, unless it were agreed who should be Judg what was the <hi>true Peripatetick</hi> Doctrine? If you say it may be known out of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Writings: then I answer, that it would be a more reasonable Law to lay the Penalty on any one, who reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doctrine contained in the Books allowed to be <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s, and printed under his Name. You may apply this to the <hi>true Religion,</hi> and the Books of the Scripture, if you please: though after all there must be a Judg agreed on, to determine what Doctrines are contained in either of those Writings, before the Law can be practicable.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. What Degrees of Punishment.</head>
            <p>HOW much soever you have endeavoured to reform the Doctrine of Persecution to make it serve your turn, and give it the Colour of Care and Zeal for the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Country where alone you are concern'd it should be made use of; yet you have laboured in vain, and done no more, but given the old Engine a new Varnish to set it off the better, and make it look less frightful: For by what has been said in the foregoing Chapters, I think it will appear, that if any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate have Power to punish. Men in Matters of Religion, all have; and that Dissenters from the National Religion must be punished every where or no where. The horrid Cruelties that in all Ages, and of late in our View, have been committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name, and upon the Account of Religion, give so just an Offence and Abhorrence to all who have any remains, not only of Religion, but Humanity left, that the World is ashamed to own it. This Objection therefore, as much as Words or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions can do, you have laboured to fence against; and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt your Design from the Suspition of any Severities, you take Care in every Page almost to let us hear of <hi>moderate</hi> Force, <hi>moderate</hi> Penalties; but all in vain: and I doubt not but when this part too is examined, it will appear, that as you neither have, nor can limit the Power of punishing to any distinct sort of Magistrates, nor exempt from Punishment the Dissenters from any National Religion: So neither have, nor can you limit the Punishment to any Degree short of the highest, if you will use Punishments at all in matters of Religion. What you have done in this Point besides giving us good Words, I will now examine.</p>
            <p>You tell me, I <hi>have taken a Liberty which will need Pardon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">P. 1.</note> I say, `You have plainly yielded the Question by owning `those greater Severities to be improper and unsit. But if I shall make it out, that those are as proper and sit as your <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:49288:54"/>
               <hi>Penalties;</hi> and that if you will use one, you must come to the other, as will appear from what you your self say: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may think, I shall not imagine other Readers will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude I have <hi>taken</hi> too great a <hi>Liberty,</hi> or shall much <hi>need Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> For if as you say in the next Page, <hi>Authority may</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 2.</note> 
               <hi>reasonably and justly use some Degrees of Force where it is needful;</hi> I say they may also use any Degree of Force where it is <hi>needful.</hi> Now upon your Grounds, Fire and Sword, tormenting and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, and those other Punishments which you <hi>condemn,</hi> will be needful, even to Torments of the highest Severity, and be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary as those moderate Penalties which you will not name. For I ask you, to what Purpose do you use any Degree of Force? Is it to prevail with Men to do something that is in their Power, or that is not? The latter I suppose you will not say, till your Love of Force is so increased, that you shall think it necessary to be made use of to produce Impossibilities: If Force then be to be used only to bring Men to do what is in their Power, what is the Necessity you assign of it? only this, as I remember, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>when gentle Admonitions and earnest Intreaties will not prevail, what other means is there left but Force?</hi> And I upon the same Ground reply; If lesser Degrees of Force will not prevail, what other means is there left but greater? If the lowest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Force be necessary where gentler means will not prevail, because there is no other means left; higher Degrees of Force are necessary where lower will not prevail, for the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Unless you will say all Degrees of Force work alike; and that lower Penalties prevail as much on Men as greater, and will equally bring them to do what is in their Power. If so a Phlip on the Forehead, or a Farthing Mulct, may be Penalty enough to bring Men to what you propose. But if you shall laugh at these, as being for their Smalness insufficient, and therefore will think it necessary to increase them, I say, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Experience shews any Degree of Force to be insufficient to prevail, there will be still the same necessity to increase it. For where-ever the End is <hi>necessary,</hi> and Force is the means, <hi>the only means left</hi> to procure it, both which you suppose in our Case, there it will be found always necessary to increase the Degrees of Force, where the lower prove ineffectual, as well till you come to the highest, as when you begin with the lowest. So that in your present Case I do not wonder you use so many
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49288:55"/>
Shifts, as I shall shew by and by you do, to decline naming the highest Degree of what you call <hi>moderate.</hi> If any Degree be <hi>necessary,</hi> you cannot assign any one (<hi>condemn</hi> it in Words as much as you please) which may not be so, and which you must not come to the Use of. If there be no such Necessity of Force as will justify those higher Degrees of it, which are <hi>Severities</hi> you <hi>condemn,</hi> neither will it justify the Use of your lower De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
            <p>If, as you tell us, <hi>false Religions prevail against the true, merely</hi>

If one Man will not be wrought on by as little Force as another, must not greater Degrees of Force be used to him? Shall the Magistrate who is <hi>obliged to do what lies in him,</hi> be exeused, for letting him be damn'd, without the Use of all the means was in his Power? And will it be sufficient for him to plead, that though he did not <hi>all what lay in him,</hi> yet he did what <hi>ordinarily prevailed,</hi> or what prevailed on several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Force, if that be the Remedy, must be proportion'd to the Opposition. If the Dose that has frequently wrought on others, will not purge a Man whose Life lies on it, must it not therefore be made sufficient and effectual, because it will be more than what is called <hi>ordinary?</hi> Or can any one say the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician has done his Duty, who lets his Patient in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Case perish in the Use of only moderate Remedies, and pronounces him incurable, before he has tried the utmost he can with the powerfullest Remedies which are in his reach?</p>

'Tis strange you should be able to name the Degrees of Severity that will <hi>hinder</hi> more than <hi>promote</hi> the Progress of Religion, and cannot name those Degrees that will <hi>promote</hi> rather than <hi>hinder</hi> it; that those who would take their Measures by you, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your Scheme, might know how to proceed so, as not to do more Harm than Good: for since you are so certain, that there are Degrees of <hi>Punishments</hi> or <hi>Penalties</hi> that will do Good, and other Degrees of them that will do Harm; ought you not to have told us, what that true Degree is, or how it may be known, without which all your goodly Scheme is of no use? For allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all you have said to be as true as you would have it, no Good can be done without shewing the just Measure of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be used.</p>
            <p>If the Degree be too great, it will, you confess, do Harm: Can one then not err on the other hand, by using too little? If you say so, we are agreed, and I desire no better <hi>Tolera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <q>
               <p>There is a third Thing, that you are as tender and reserv'd <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 40.</note> in, as either naming the Criminals to be punished, or positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly telling us the End for which they should be punished; and that is, with what sort of Penalties, what degree of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they should be forced. You are indeed so gracious to them, that you renounce the <hi>Severities</hi> and Penalties hitherto made use of.

                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 24.</note> But if we ask you what are moderate Penalties, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess you cannot tell us: so that by <hi>Moderate</hi> here, you yet mean nothing. You tell us, The <hi>outward Force to be applied,</hi>

                  <hi>should be duly tempered.</hi> But what that due Temper is, you do not, or cannot say; and so in effect, it signifies just nothing. Yet if in this you are not plain and direct, all the rest of your Design will signify nothing. For it being to have some Men, and to some End, punished; yet if it cannot be found what Punishment is to be used, it is (notwithstanding all you have said) utterly useless. You tell us modestly, <hi>That to determine precisely the just measure of the Punishment, will require some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> If the Faults were precisely determined, and could be proved, it would require no more Consideration to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Measure of the Punishment in this, than it would in any other Case, where those were known. But where the Fault is undesined, and the Guilt not to be proved, (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it will be found in this present business of <hi>examining</hi>) it will without doubt <hi>require Consideration</hi> to proportion the Force to the Design: just so much Consideration as it will require to fit a Coat to the Moon, or proportion a Shoe to the Feet of those who inhabit her. For to proportion a Punishment to a Fault that you do not name, (and so we in Charity ought to think you do not yet know) and a Fault that when you have named it, will be impossible to be proved who are or are not guilty, of it; will I suppose <hi>require as much Consideration</hi> as to fit a Shoe to Feet whose Size and Shape are not known.</p>
               <p>However, you offer some Measures whereby to regulate your Punishments; which when they are looked into, will be found to be just as good as none, they being impossible to be any Rule in the case. The first is, <hi>So much Force, or such Penalties</hi>

Many Men of <hi>common Discretion</hi> in their Callings, are not able to judg when an Argument is conclusive or no; much less to trace it through a long Train of Consequences. <hi>What Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties shall be sufficient to prevail</hi> with such (who upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I fear, will not be found to make the least part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) <hi>to examine and weigh Matters of Religion carefully and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially?</hi> The Law allows all to have <hi>common Discretion,</hi> for whom it has not provided Guardians or <hi>Bedlam.</hi> So that, in effect, your Men of <hi>common Discretion,</hi> are all Men, not judg'd Idiots or Mad-men: And <hi>Penalties sufficient to prevail with Men of common Discretion,</hi> are Penalties sufficient to prevail with all Men but Idiots and Mad-men. Which what a Measure it is to regulate Penalties by, let all Men of common Discretion judg.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You may be pleased to consider, that all Men of the same degree of <hi>Discretion,</hi> are not apt to be moved by the same degree of Penalties. Some are of a more yielding, some of a more stiff Temper; and what is sufficient to prevail on one, is not half enough to move the other; though both Men of <hi>common Discretion.</hi> So that <hi>common Discretion</hi> will be here of no use to determine the Measure of Punishment: especially, when in the same Clause you except Men <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate;</hi> who are as hard to be known, as what you seek, <hi>viz.</hi> the just Proportions of Punishments necessary <hi>to prevail with Men to consider, examine, and weigh Matters of Religion;</hi> wherein, if a Man tells you he has <hi>considered,</hi> he has <hi>weighed,</hi> he

has <hi>examined,</hi> and so goes on in his former Course, 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you ever to know whether he has done his Duty, or whether he be <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate.</hi> So that this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception signifies just nothing.</p>
               <p>There are many things in your use of Force and Penalties, different from any I ever met with elsewhere. One of them, this Clause of yours concerning the Measure of Punishments, now under consideration, offers me; wherein you proportion your Punishments only to the Yielding and Corrigible, not to the Perverse and Obstinate; contrary to the common Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which has hitherto made Laws in other cases, which le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels the Punishments against refractory Offenders, and never spares them because they are obstinate. This however I will not blame as an Over-sight in you. Your new Method, which aims at such impracticable and inconsistent things as Laws can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear, nor Penalties be useful to, forced you to it.

For I will be answerable to you, that you cannot name any Degree of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which will not be either so great, as to come amongst those you condemn, and shew what your Moderation, what your Aversion to Persecution is; or else too little to attain those Ends for which you propose it.

            <p>But if by <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate,</hi> you will tell us, you meant those, that are not wrought upon by your moderate Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, as you seem to intimate in your Reason why the <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately perverse and obstinate</hi> are not to be <hi>regarded in measuring these Penalties: For,</hi> say you, <hi>as Remedies are not provided for the</hi>

of what are <hi>moderate Penalties;</hi> just such an one, as if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Soveraign Universal Medicine put into your Hand, which will never fail, if you can hit the right Dose, which the Inventer tells you must be <hi>moderate:</hi> You should ask him what was the <hi>moderate</hi> Quantity it is to be given in? and he should answer, In such a Quantity as was <hi>ordinarily sufficient</hi> to work on common Constitutions, and not <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate.</hi> And to you asking again, who were of <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate</hi> Constitutions? It should be answered, Those that were <hi>incurable.</hi> And who were <hi>incurable?</hi> Those whom a <hi>moderate</hi> Quantity would not work on. And thus to your Satisfaction, you know the <hi>moderate</hi> Dose by the <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate;</hi> and the <hi>desperately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and obstinate</hi> by <hi>being incurable;</hi> and the <hi>Incurable</hi> by the <hi>moderate</hi> Dose. For if, as you say, <hi>Remedies are not provided for the incurable,</hi> and none but <hi>moderate Penalties</hi> are to be provided, is it not plain, that you mean, that all that will not be wrought on by your <hi>moderate Penalties,</hi> are in your Sense <hi>incurable?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ease you, Sir, of justifying your self, and shewing that I have mistaken you, do but tell us positively what in Penalties is the highest Degree of <hi>moderate;</hi> who are <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate;</hi> or who are <hi>incurable,</hi> without this relative and circular way of defining one by the other; and I will yield my self to have mistaken you, as much as you please.</p>
            <p>If by <hi>incurable</hi> you mean such as no Penalties, no Punishments, no Force is sufficient to work on; then your Measure of <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> Penalties will be this, that they are such, as are sufficient to prevail with Men not <hi>incurable, i. e.</hi> who cannot be prevailed on by any Punishments, any Force whatsoever; which will be a Measure of <hi>moderate Punishments,</hi> which (whatsoever you do) some will be very apt to approve of.</p>

               <p>One thing I cannot but take notice of in this Passage before <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 43.</note> I leave it: and that is, that you say here, <hi>Those who have no Concern for their Salvation, deserve not to be considered.</hi> In other Parts of your Letter you pretend to have Compassion on the careless, and provide Remedies for them: But here of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den your Charity fails you, and you give them up to eternal Perdition, without the least Regard, the least Pity, and say, <hi>They deserve not to be considered.</hi> Our Saviour's Rule was, the sick and not the whole need a Physician: Your Rule here is; <hi>Those that are careless, are not to be considered, but are to be lest to themselves.</hi> This, would seem strange, if one did not observe what drew you to it. You perceiv'd that if the Magistrate was to use no Punishments, but such as would make no body change their Religion, he was to use none at all: For the careless would be brought to the National Church with any slight Punishments; and when they are once there, you are it seems satisfied, and look no farther after them. So that by your own Measu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
            </q>
            <p>What you have said is so far from spoiling that Harangue, as you are pleased to call it, that you having nothing else to say to it, allows what is laid to your Charge in it.</p>

You wind up all concerning the Measures of your Force in these Words; <hi>And as those Medicines are thought safe and advisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which do ordinarily cure, though not always (as none do;) so those</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 50.</note> 
               <hi>Penalties or Punishments, which are ordinarily found sufficient (as well as necessary) for the Ends for which they are designed, may fitly and reasonably be used for the compassing these Ends.</hi> Here your <hi>ordinarily</hi> comes to your Help again; and here one would think that you meant such as cure sometimes, <hi>not always;</hi> some, though not all: And in this Sense will not the utmost <hi>Severities</hi> come within your Rule? For can you say, if Punishments are to be used to prevail on any, that the greater will (where lower fail) prevail on none? at least can you be sure of it till they have been tried for the <hi>compassing these End?</hi> which as we shall see in another Place, you have assigned various e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And now the Magistrate has all your Rules about the Measures of Punishments to be used, and may considently and safely go to work to establish it by a Law: for he having these Marks to guide him, that they must be great enough ordinarily to <hi>prevail with those who are not Idiots or Madmen, nor desperately perverse and obstinate,</hi> great enough <hi>ordinarily</hi> to prevail with Men to <hi>hear, consider</hi> and <hi>imbrace the true Religion,</hi> and yet not so great as <hi>might tempt Persons, who have any Concern for their eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to renounce a Religion which they believe to be true, or profess one which they do not believe to be so:</hi> Do you not think you have sufficiently inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But let us hear your Reason, <hi>For what Rule is there that expresses the Particulars that agree with it?</hi> And it is an admirable Rule with which one can find no Particulars that agree; for I challenge you to instance in one: <hi>A Rule,</hi> you say, <hi>is intended for a common Measure by which Particulars are to be examined, and therefore must necessarily be general.</hi> So general, loose, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent, that no Particulars can be examined by it: for again I challenge you, or any Man living, to measure out any Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by this your <hi>common Measure,</hi> and establish it by a Law. You go on; <hi>And those to whom it is given, are supposed to be able to apply it, and to judg of Particulars by it. Nay it is often seen that they are better able to do this than those who give it: and so it</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:49288:61"/>
               <hi>is in the present Case, the Rule hereby laid down is that by which</hi> you <hi>suppose Governors and Law-givers ought to examine the Penalties they use for the promoting the true Religion, and the Salvation of Souls.</hi> Such a Rule it ought to be I grant, and such an one is desired: but that yours is such a Rule as Magistrates can take any Measure by, for the Punishments they are to settle by Law, is denied, and you are again desired to shew. You proceed; <note place="margin">P. 50.</note> 
               <hi>But certainly no Man doubts but their Prudence and Experience ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them to use and apply it better than other Men, and to judg more exactly what Penalties do agree with it, and what do not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> you <hi>think</hi> I <hi>must excuse</hi> you <hi>if</hi> you <hi>do not take upon</hi> you <hi>to teach them what it becomes</hi> you <hi>rather to learn for them.</hi> If we are not to <hi>doubt but their Prudence and Experience inables Magistrates to judg best what Penalties are fit.</hi> You have indeed given us at last a way to know the Measure of Punishments to be used: but it is such an one as puts an End to your Distinction of <hi>moderate Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties:</hi> For no Magistrates that I know, when they once began to use Force to bring Men to their Religion, ever stopp'd till they came to some of those Severities you condemn; and if you pretend to teach them Moderation for the future, with Hopes to succeed, you ought to have shewed them the just Bounds, beyond which they ought not to go, in a Model so wholly new, and besides all Experience. But if it be to be determined by their <hi>Prudence and Experience,</hi> whatever Degrees of Force they shall use, will always be the right.</p>
            <p>

The other part of your Complement will be suspected not to be so much out of your ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ndant Respect to <hi>Law-makers and Governors,</hi> as out of the great Regard you have to your self; for you in vain pretend you forbear to name any particular Punishments, because you will <hi>not take upon you to teach Governors and Law-makers,</hi> when you your self own in the same Breath, that you are laying down <hi>Rules by which</hi> they are to proceed in the Use of Penalties for promoting Religion, which is little different from <hi>teaching:</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:49288:62"/>
and your whole Book is nothing else but about the Magistrate's Power and Duty. I <hi>excuse</hi> you therefore for your own sake from naming any particular Punishments by your Rules: for you have a right to it, as all Men have a right to be ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Since therefore you grant that those Severities y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>As oddly as it sounds to you, it will be evidently true, as long as that which <hi>authorizes</hi> one, <hi>authorizes</hi> all Magistrates of any Religion, which they believe to be true, to use Force to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it; and as long as you cannot assign any Bounds to your <hi>moderate</hi> Punishments, short of those great ones; which you therefore are not able to do, because your Principles, whatever your Words deny, will carry you to those Degrees of Severity, which in Profession you <hi>condemn:</hi> and this, whatever you do, I dare say every considering Reader besides you will plainly see. So that this Imputation is not so unreasonable, since it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that you must either renounce all Punishments whatsoever in Religion, or make use of those you <hi>condemn:</hi> for in the next Page you tell us, That <hi>all who have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:49288:62"/>
and a <hi>Fault to be punished</hi> by the Magistrate. The Magistrate, to cure this Fault, lays, on those who dissent, a lower degree of Penalties, a Fine of 1 <hi>d. per</hi> Month. This proving insufficient, what is the Magistrate to do? If he be <hi>obliged,</hi> as you say, to amend this Fault by Penalties, and that low one of 1 <hi>d. per</hi> Month be not sufficient to procure its Amendment, is he not to increase the Penalty? He therefore doubles the Fine to 2 <hi>d. per</hi> Month. This too proves ineffectual, and therefore 'tis still for the same reason doubled, till it come to 1 <hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>l.</hi> 100 <hi>l.</hi> 1000 <hi>l.</hi> None of these Penalties working, but yet by being constantly levied, leaving the Delinquents no longer able to pay, Imprisonment and other corporal Punishments follow to inforce an Obedience, till at last this gradual Increase of Penalties and Force, each Degree whereof wrought on some few, rises to the highest Severities against those who stand out. For the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, who is <hi>obliged</hi> to correct this <hi>Vice,</hi> as you call it, and <hi>to do what in him lies</hi> to cure this <hi>Fault,</hi> which opposes their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and who (if I mistake not, you tell us) is <hi>answerable for</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 8.</note> 
               <hi>all that may follow from his neglect,</hi> had no reason to raise the Fine from 1 <hi>d.</hi> to 2 <hi>d.</hi> but because the first was ineffectual: and if that were a sufficient reason for raising from the first to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Degree, why is it not as sufficient to proceed from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the third, and so gradually on? I would fain have any one shew me, where, and upon what ground, such a gradual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Force can stop, till it come to the utmost Extremities. If therefore dissenting from the Church of <hi>England</hi> be a <hi>Fault to be punished by the Magistrate,</hi> I desire you to tell me, where he shall hold his Hand; to name the Sort or Degree of Punishment, beyond which he ought not to go in the use of Force, to cure them of that Fault, and bring them to Conformity. Till you have done that, you might have spared that Paragraph, where <note place="margin">P. 19.</note> you say, <hi>With what Ingenuity I draw</hi> you <hi>in to condemn Force in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, only because</hi> you <hi>acknowledg the ill Effects of prosecuting Men with Fire and Sword,</hi> &amp;c. you <hi>may leave every Man to judg.</hi> And I leave whom you will to judg, whether from your own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples it does not unavoidably follow, that if you <hi>condemn</hi> any <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,</hi> you must <hi>condemn</hi> all, as I have shewn; if you will retain any, you must retain all; you must either take or leave all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For, as I have said, and you deny not, `Where there <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> ` is no Fault, there no Punishment is moderate, so I add, Where
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49288:63"/>
there is a <hi>Fault</hi> to be corrected by the Magistrate's Force, there no Degree of Force, which is ineffectual, and not sufficient to amend it, can be immoderate; especially if it be a Fault of great moment in its Consequences, as certainly that must be, which draws after it the loss of Mens Eternal Happiness.</p>
            <p>You will, 'tis likely, be ready to say here again, (for a good Subterfuge is never to be forsaken) that you except the <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately perverse and obstinate.</hi> I desire to know for what reason you except them? Is it because they cease to be faulty? Next I ask you, Who are in your sense the <hi>desperately perverse and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?</hi> Those that 1 <hi>s.</hi> or 5 <hi>s.</hi> or 5 <hi>l.</hi> or 100 <hi>l.</hi> or no Fine will work upon? Those who can bear loss of Estate, but not loss of Liberty? or loss of Liberty and Estate, but not corporal Pains and Torments? or all this, but not loss of Life? For to these Degrees do Men differently stand out. And since there are Men wrought on by the Approaches of Fire and Faggot, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Degrees of Severity could not prevail with, where will you bound your <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate?</hi> The King of <hi>France,</hi> though you will allow him not to have Truth of his side, yet when he came to Dragooning, found sew so <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate,</hi> as not to be wrought on.

I desire you also to consider, if in Matters of Religion, Punishments are to be imployed, because they may be useful, whether you can stop at any Degree that is ineffectual to the End which you propose, let that End be what it will.

               <hi>moderate Penalties</hi> together. If it be to make Men consider, as in other places you speak, you cannot tell when you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that End. But if your End be, which you seem most to insist on, to <hi>make Men consider as they ought,</hi> i. e. <hi>till they imbrace,</hi> there are many on whom all your <hi>moderate</hi> Penalties, all under those <hi>Severities you condemn,</hi> are too weak to prevail. So that you must either consess, <hi>not considering so as to imbrace the true Religion,</hi> i. e. <hi>not considering as one ought,</hi> is no Fault to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the <hi>coactive Force of the Magistrate;</hi> or else you must resume those Severities which you have renounced: chuse you whether of the two you please.</p>
            <p>Therefore 'twas not so much at random that I said, That <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> thither at last Persecution must come.

               <hi>after this? For I beseech you, Sir, what Words could I have used more express or effectual to signify, that in my Opinion no Dissenters from the true Religion ought to be punished with the Sword, but such as choose rather to rebel against the Magistrate, than to submit to lesser Penalties? (For how any should refuse to submit to those Penalties, but by rebelling against the Magistrate, I suppose you will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to tell me.) 'Twas for this very purpose that I used those Words to prevent Cavils, (as I was then so simple as to think I might:) And I dare appeal to any Man of common Sense and common Honesty whether they are capable of any other meaning. And yet the very thing which I so plainly disclaim in them, you pretend (without so much as offering to shew how) to collect from them.</hi> 
               <q>Thither, <hi>you say,</hi> at last, (<hi>viz.</hi> to the taking away Mens Lives for the saving of their Souls) Persecution must come: As <hi>you</hi> fear, notwithstanding <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>serving it, as here (and not here only) you serve yours.</hi> Good Sir, be not so angry, lest to observing Men you increase the Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. One may, without forfeiture of <hi>Modesty</hi> or <hi>Conscience,</hi> fear what Mens Principles threaten, though their Words disclaim it. Nonconformity to the National, when it is the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in <hi>England,</hi> is a <hi>Fault,</hi> a <hi>Vice,</hi> say you, to be corrected by the <hi>coactive Power of the Magistrate.</hi> If so, and <hi>Force</hi> be the proper Remedy, he must increase it, till it be strong enough to work the Cure; and must not neglect his <hi>Duty</hi> (for so you make it) when he has Force enough in his Hand to make this Remedy more powerful. For where-ever Force is proper to work on Men, and bring them to a Compliance, it's not producing that Effect can only be imputed to its being too little: And if so, whither at last must it come, but to the late Methods of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Conformity (and as his most Christian Majesty called it, of saving of Souls) in <hi>France,</hi> or Severities like them, when more moderate ones cannot produce it? For to continue inefficacious Penalties, insufficient upon trial to master the Fault they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to, is unjustifiable Cruelty; and that which no body can have a right to use, it serving only to disease and harm People, <note place="margin">P. 44.</note> without amending them: for you tell us, they should be <hi>such Penalties as</hi> should <hi>make them uneasy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that should vex and pain a Sore you had, with frequent dressing it with some <hi>moderate,</hi> painful, but inefficacious Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that promoted not the Cure, would justly be thought, not only an ignorant, but a dishonest Surgeon. If you are in the Surgeon's hands, and his Help is requisite, and the Cure that way to be wrought, Corrosives and Fire are the most merciful, as well as only justifiable way of Cure, when the Case needs them. And therefore I hope I may still <hi>pretend to Modesty and Conscience,</hi> though I should have thought you so rational a Man, as to be led by your own Principles; and so honest, charitable, and zealous for the Salvation of Mens Souls, as not to vex and disease them with inefficacious Remedies to no purpose, and let them miss of Salvation, for want of more vigorous Prosecutions. For if Conformity to the Church of <hi>England</hi> be necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, (for elfe what Necessity can you pretend of punishing Men at all to bring them to it?) it is Cruelty to their Souls (if you have Authority for any such Means) to use some, and not to use sufficient Force to bring them to conform.

               </gap>side the matter, if I should have said, (which I did not) <hi>that I feared you had a Reserve for greater Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</hi> For I having brought the Instances of <hi>Ananias</hi> 
               <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</note> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> to shew that the Apostles wanted not Power to <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> punish, if they sound it necessary to use it; you inser, that therefore <hi>Punishment may be sometimes necessary.</hi> What Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I beseech you, for theirs cost them their Lives? He that, as you do, concludes from thence, that therefore <hi>Punishments may be sometimes necessary,</hi> will hardly avoid (whatever he says) to conclude capital <hi>Punishments necessary:</hi> And when they are <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> it is you know the Magistrate's <hi>Duty</hi> to use them. You see how natural it is for Men to go whither their Principles lead them, though at first Sight perhaps they thought it too far.</p>
            <p>If to avoid this, you now say you meant it of the Punishment of the incestuous Corinthian, whom I also mentioned in the same Place; I think, supposing your self to lie under the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a Reserve of greater Punishments; you ought in Prudence to have said so there. Next you know not what Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment it was the incestuous Corinthian under-went, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>for the Destruction of the Flesh,</hi> it seems to be no very light one: And if you will take your Friend St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Word for it, as he in the very Epistle you quote tells you, it was a very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere one, making as much Difference between it, and the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities Men usually suffer in Prison, as there is between the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the Devil, and that of the most barbarous Jaylor: so that if your <hi>moderate Punishments</hi> will reach to that laid on the incestuous Corinthian for the Destruction of the Flesh, we may presume them to be, what other People call <hi>Severities.</hi>

            <p>THE Measure of Punishments being to be estimated as well by the Length of their Duration, as the Intense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Degrees, 'tis fit we take a View also of your Scheme in this Part.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I told you that <hi>moderate Punishments</hi> that are continued, that <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 43.</note> Men find no End of, know no way out of, sit heavy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come immoderately uneasy. Dissenters you would have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, to make them <hi>consider.</hi> Your Penalties have had the Effect on them you intended; they have made them <hi>consider;</hi> and they have done their utmost in considering. What now must be done with them? They must be punished on, for they are still Dissenters. If it were just, and you had Reason at first to punish a Dissenter, to make him <hi>consider,</hi> when you did not know but that he had considered already; it is as just, and you have as much Reason to punish him on, even when he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what your Punishment was designed for, and has considered, but yet remains a Dissenter. For I may justly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and you must grant, that a Man may remain a Dissenter after all the Consideration your moderate Penalties can bring him to; when we see great Punishments, even those Severities you disown as too great, are not able to make Men <hi>consider</hi> so far as to be convinced, and brought over to the National Church. If your Punishments may not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> on Men, to make them <hi>consider,</hi> who have or may have considered already, for ought you know; then Dissenters are never to be once punished, no more than any other sort of Men. If Dissenters are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, to make them <hi>consider,</hi> whether they have considered or no; then their Punishments, though they do <hi>consider,</hi> must never cease as long as they are Dissenters, which whether it be to punish them only to bring them to <hi>consider,</hi> let all Men judg. This I am sure; Punishments in your Method, must either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver begin upon Dissenters, or never cease.</q> And so pretend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49288:68"/>
if you please, the Punishments which your Method requires, must be either very immoderate, or none at all. But to this you say nothing, only for the adjusting the Length of your Punishments, and therein vindicating the Consistency and Practicableness of your Scheme, you tell us, <hi>That as long as Men</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 51.</note> 
               <hi>reject the true Religion duly proposed to them, so long they offend and deserve Punishment, and therefore it is but just that so long they should be left liable to it.</hi> You promised to answer to this Question, <note place="margin">P. 46.</note> amongst others, <hi>plainly and directly.</hi> The Question is, How long they are to be punished? And your Answer is, <hi>It is but just that so long they should be liable to Punishment.</hi> This extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Caution in speaking out, if it were not very natural to you, would be apt to make one suspect, it was accommodated more to some Difficulties of your Scheme, than to your Promise of answering <hi>plainly and directly;</hi> or possibly you thought, it would not agree to that Character of Moderation you assume, to own, that all the Penal Laws which were lately here in Force, and whose Relaxation you bemoan, should be constantly put in Execution. But your Moderation in this Point comes too late. For as your Charity, as you tell us in the next Paragraph, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that they be kept subject to Penalties:</hi> So the watchful <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of others in this Age hath found out ways to incourage In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and put it out of the Magistrate's Moderation to stop the Execution of the Law against Dissenters, if he should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to it.</p>
            <p>We will therefore take it for granted, that if Penal Laws be made concerning Religion, (for more Zeal usually animates them than others) they will be put in Execution: and indeed I have heard it argued to be very absurd, to make or continue Laws, that are not constantly put in Execution. And now to shew you how well your Answer <hi>consists</hi> with other Parts of your Scheme, I shall need only to mind you, that if Men must be <hi>punished as long as they reject the true Religion,</hi> those who punish them, must be Judges what is the true Religion. But this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, with some other, to which this P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rt of your Answer is obnoxious, having been made to you more at large elsewhere, I shall here omit, and proceed to other Parts of your Answer.</p>
            <p>You begin with your Reason for the Answer you afterwards <note place="margin">P. 50.</note> give us in the Words I last quoted: Your Reason runs thus; <hi>For certainly nothing is more reasonable than that Men should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:49288:68"/>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nd. And as long as Men reject the true Religion tender'd them with sufficient Evidence of the Truth of it, so long 'tis certain they offend.</hi> It is certainly very <hi>reasonable,</hi> that Men should <hi>be subject to Punishment</hi> from those they <hi>offend as long as</hi> they continue to offend: But it will not from hence follow, that those who offend God, are always <hi>subject to Punishment</hi> from Men. For if they be, why does not the Magistrate punish Envy, Hatred, and Malice, and all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness? If you answer, because they are not capable of Judicial Proofs: I think I may say 'tis as easy to prove a Man guilty of Envy, Hatred or Uncharitableness, as it is to prove him guilty of <hi>rejecting the true Religion tender'd him with sufficient Evidence of the Truth of it.</hi> But if it be his Duty to punish all <hi>Offences</hi> against God, why does the Magistrate never punish Lying, which is an Offence against God, and is an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence capable of being judicially proved? It is plain therefore that it is not the Sense of all Mankind, that it is the Magistrate's Duty to punish all Offences against God; and where it is not his Duty to use Force, you will grant the Magistrate is not to use it in Matters of Religion, because where it is necessary, it is his Duty to use it; but where it is not necessary, you your self say it is not lawful. It would be convenient therefore for you to reform your Proposition from that loose Generality it now is in, and then prove it before it can be allowed you to be to your Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; though it be never so true, that <hi>you know not a greater Crime a Man can be guilty of, than rejecting the true Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You go on with your Proof, that so long as Men reject the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 51.</note> 
               <hi>true Religion, &amp;c. so long they offend, and consequently may justly be punished;</hi> Because, <hi>say you,</hi> it is impossible for any Man, innocently to reject the true Religion, so tender'd to him. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rejects that Religion so tender'd, does either apprehend and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Truth of it, or he does not. If he does, I know not what greater Crime any Man can be guilty of. If he does not perceive the Truth of it, there is no Account to be given of that, but either that he shuts his Eyes against the Evidence which is offer'd him, and will not at all consider it; or that he does not consider it as he ought, <hi>viz.</hi> with such Care as is requisite, and with a sincere Desire to learn the Truth; either of which does manifestly involve him in Guilt.</p>
            <p>To say here that a Man who has the true Religion proposed to him with sufficient Evidence of its Truth, may consider it as he ought, <hi>or</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:49288:69"/>
               <hi>do his utmost in considering,</hi> and yet not perceive the Truth of it; is neither more nor less, than to say, that sufficient Evidence is not sufficient Evidence. For what does any Man mean by sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but such as will certainly win Assent where-ever it is duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered?</p>
            <p>I shall not trouble my self here to examine when <hi>requisite care, duly considered,</hi> and such other Words, which bring one back to the same Place from whence one set out, are cast up, whether all this fine Reasoning will amount to any thing, but begging what is in the Question: But shall only tell you, that what you say here and in other Places about <hi>sufficient Evidence,</hi> is built upon this, that the Evidence wherewith a Man proposes the true Religion, he may know to be such, as will not fail to gain the Assent of whosoever does what lies in him in consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. This is the Supposition, without which all your Talk of <hi>sufficient Evidence</hi> will do you no Service, try it where you will. But it is a Supposition that is far enough from carrying with it sufficient Evidence to make it be admitted without Proof.</p>
            <p>Whatever <hi>gains</hi> any Man's <hi>Assent,</hi> one may be sure had <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Evidence</hi> in respect of that Man: But that is far enough from proving it <hi>Evidence sufficient</hi> to prevail on another, let him consider it as long and as much as he can. The Tempers of Mens Minds; the Principles setled there by Time and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, beyond the Power of the Man himself to alter them; the different Capacities of Mens Understandings; and the strange Ideas they are often silled with, are so various and uncertain, that it is impossible to find that <hi>Evidence</hi> (especially in things of a mixed Disquisition, depending on so long a T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ain of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, as some Points of the true Religion may) which one can considently say will be <hi>sufficient</hi> for all Men. '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>is Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that 3 1876 is the Product of 9467172 divided by 297, and yet I challenge you to find one Man of a thousand, to whom you can tender this Proposition with demonstrative or <hi>sufficient Evidence</hi> to convince him of the Truth of it in a dark Room; or ever to make this <hi>Evidence</hi> appear to a Man, that cannot write and read, so as to make him imbrace it as a Truth, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom he hath more Confidence in, tells him it is not so. All the demonstrative <hi>Evidence</hi> the thing has, all the <hi>Tender</hi> you can make of it, all the <hi>Consideration</hi> he can imploy about it, will never be able to discover to him that Evidence which small
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49288:69"/>
convince him it is true, unless you will at threescore and ten (for that may be the Case) have him neglect his Calling, go to School, and learn to write and read, and cast Account, which he may never be able to attain to.</p>
            <p>You speak more than once of Mens being brought to lay aside their <hi>Prejudices</hi> to make them consider as they ought, and judg right of Matters in Religion; and I grant without doing so they cannot: But it is impossible for Force to make them do it, unless it could shew them, which are Prejudices in their Minds, and distinguish them from the Truths there. Who is there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most that has not <hi>Prejudices,</hi> that he does not know to be so; and what can Force do in that Case? It can no more remove them, to make way for Truth, than it can remove one Truth to make way for another; or rather remove an establish'd Truth, or that which is look'd on as an unquestionable Principle (for so are often Mens Prejudices) to make way for a Truth not yet known, nor appearing to be one. 'Tis not every one knows, or can bring himself to <hi>Des Carte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> way of doubting, and strip his Thoughts of all Opinions, till he brings them to self-evident Principles, and then upon them builds all his future Tenents.</p>
            <p>Do not think all the World, who are not of your Church, abandon themselves to an utter Carelesness of their future State. You cannot but allow there are many Turks who sincerely seek Truth, to whom yet you could never bring <hi>Evidence sufficient</hi> to convince them of the Truth of the Christian Religion, whilst they looked on it as a Principle not to be question'd, that the Alcoran was of Divine Revelation. This possibly you will tell me is a <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and so it is; but yet if this Man shall tell you 'tis no more a <hi>Prejudice</hi> in him, than it is a <hi>Prejudice</hi> in any one amongst Christians, who having not examin'd it, lays it down as an unquestionable Principle of his Religion, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Word of God; what will you answer to him? And yet it would shake a great many Christians in their Religion, if they should lay by that Prejudice, and suspend their Judgment of it, until they had made it out to themselves with <hi>Evidence sufficient</hi> to convince one who is not prejudiced in Favour of it; and it would require more Time, Books, Languages, Learning and Skill, than falls to most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

of some <hi>Persons</hi> whom they have in <hi>Reverence</hi> or <hi>Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This though you blame it as an ill way, yet you can allow in one of your own Religion, even to that Degree, that he may <note place="margin">P. 42.</note> be ignorant of <hi>the Grounds</hi> of his Religion. And why then may you not allow it to a Turk, not as a good way, or as having led him to the Truth; but as a way, as sit for him, as for one of your Church to acquiesce in; and as sit to exempt him from your Force, as to exempt any one of your Church from it?</p>
            <p>To prevent your commenting on this, in which you have shewn so much Dexterity, give me leave to tell you, that for all this I do not think all <hi>Religions equally true or equally certain.</hi> But this, I say, is impossible for you, or me, or any Man, to know, whether another has done his Duty in examining the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence on both sides, when he imbraces that side of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we (perhaps upon other Views) judg false: and therefore we can have no Right to punish or persecute him for it. In this, whether and how far any one is faulty, must be left to the Searcher of Hearts? the great and righteous Judg of all Men, who knows all their Circumstances, all the Powers and Workings of their Minds; where 'tis they sincerely follow, and by what Default they at any time miss Truth: And he, we are sure, will judg uprightly.</p>
            <p>But when one Man shall think himself a competent Judg, that the true Religion is proposed with <hi>Evidence sufficient</hi> for another; and thence shall take upon him to punish him as an Offender, because he imbraces not (upon Evidence that he the Proposer judges sufficient) the Religion that he judges true, had need be able to look into the Thoughts of Men, and know their several Abilities: unless he will make his own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and Faculties to be the Measure of those of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which if they be no higher elevated, no larger in their Comprehension, no more discerning, than those of some Men, he will not only be unsit to be a Judg in that, but in almost any Case what soever.</p>
            <p>But since, 1. You make it a Condition to the making a Man an Offender in not being of the true Religion, that it has been <hi>tendred him with sufficient Evidence.</hi> 2. Since you think it so easy for Men to determine when the true Religion has been tender'd to any one <hi>with sufficient Evidence.</hi> And, 3. Since you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49288:70"/>
               <hi>it Impiety to say, that God hath not furnished Mankind with competent Means for the promoting his own Honour in the World, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>the Good of Souls.</hi> Give me leave to ask you a Question or two. 1. Can any one be saved without <hi>imbracing</hi> the one only true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? 2. Were any of the <hi>Americans</hi> of that <hi>one only true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> when the <hi>Europeans</hi> first came amongst them? 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of the <hi>Americans,</hi> before the Christians came amongst them, had <hi>offended</hi> in rejecting the true Religion tendred with sufficient Evidence? When you have thought upon, and fairly answered these Questions, you will be sitter to determine, how competent a Judg Man is, what is sufficient Evidence; who do offend in not being of the true Religion; and what Punishments they are liable to for it.</p>
            <p>But me-thinks here, where you spend almost a whole Page upon the <hi>Crime</hi> of rejecting the true Religion duly tendred, and the Punishment that is justly due to it from the Magistrate, you forget your self, and the Foundation of your Plea for Force; which is, that it is <hi>necessary:</hi> which you are so far from proving it to be in this case of punishing the <hi>Offence</hi> of rejecting the true Religion, that in this very page you distinguished it from what is <hi>necessary;</hi> where you tell us, Your <hi>Design does rather oblige</hi> you <hi>to consider how long Men may need Punishment, than how long it may be just to punish them.</hi> So that though they offend, yet if they do not <hi>need</hi> Punishment, the Magistrate cannot use it, if you <hi>ground,</hi> as you say you do, the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of Force for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the true Religion upon the <hi>Necessity</hi> of it. Nor can you say, that by his Commission, from the Law of Nature, of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good, the Magistrate, besides reducing his wandring Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects out of the wrong into the right Way, is appointed also to be the Avenger of God's Wrath on Unbelievers, or those that err in Matters of Religion. This at least you thought not fit to own in the first Draught of your Scheme; for I do not remember in all your <hi>Argument considered,</hi> one word of <hi>Crime</hi> or <hi>Punishment:</hi> nay, in writing this second Treatise, you were so shy of owning any thing of <hi>Punishment,</hi> that to my remembrance, you scrupulous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoided the use of that word, till you came to this place; and always where the repeating my Words did not oblige you to it, carefully used the term of <hi>Penalties</hi> for it, as any one may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, who reads the preceding part of this Letter of yours, which I am now examining. And you were so nice in the point,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49288:71"/>
that three or four Leaves backwards, where I say, By your Rule Dissenters must be punished, you mend it, and say, <hi>Or if</hi> I <hi>please, subjected to moderate Penalties.</hi> But here when the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, How long Force was to be continued on Men, shewed the Absurdity of that Pretence, that they were to be punished on without end, to make them consider; rather than part with your beloved Force, you open the matter a little father, and profess directly the <hi>punishing</hi> Men for their Religion. For tho you do all you can to cover it under the name of <hi>rejecting the true Religion duly proposed;</hi> yet it is in truth no more but being of a Religion different from yours, that you would have them pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for: for all that the Author pleads for, and you can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in writing against him, is Toleration of Religion. Your Scheme therefore being thus mended, your Hypothesis enlarged, being of a different Religion from the National found criminal, and Punishments found justly to belong to it, it is to be hoped, that in good time your Punishments may grow too, and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to all those Degrees you in the beginning <hi>condemned;</hi> when having considered a little farther, you cannot miss find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Obstinacy of the Criminals does not lessen their Crime, and therefore Justice will require severer Execution to be done upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you tell us here,</hi> Because <hi>your</hi> Design does rather oblige <hi>you</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 51.</note> to consider how long Men may need Punishment, than how long it may be just to punish them; therefore <hi>you</hi> shall add, That as long as Men refuse to imbrace the true Religion, so long Penalties are necessary for them to dispose them to consider and imbrace it: And that therefore as Justice allows, so Charity requires, that they be kept subject to Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, till they imbrace the true Religion. <hi>Let us therefore see the</hi> Consistency <hi>of this with other parts of your Hypothesis, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it a little by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Doctrine is, That where <hi>Intreaties</hi> and <hi>Admonitions</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trial do not prevail, Punishments are to be used; but they must be <hi>moderate.</hi> Moderate Punishments have been tried, and they prevail not; What now is to be done? Are not greater to be used? No: For what reason? Because those whom <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Penalties</hi> will not prevail on, being <hi>desperately perverse and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate,</hi> Remedies are not to be <hi>provided for the Incurable,</hi> as you tell us in the Page immediately preceding.</p>

               <hi>Moderate</hi> Punishments have been tried upon a Man once, and again, and a third time, but prevail not at all, make no Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; they are repeated as many times more, but are still found ineffectual: Pray tell me a reason why such a Man is concluded so <hi>desperately perverse and obstinate,</hi> that greater Degrees will not work upon him, but yet not so <hi>desperately perverse and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> but that the same Degrees repeated may work upon him? I will not urge here, that this is to pretend to know the just De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Punishment that will or will not work on any one, which I should imagine a pretty intricate Business: But this I have to say, that if you can think it reasonable and useful to continue a Man several Years, nay his whole Life, under the same repeated Punishments, without going any higher, though they work not at all; because 'tis possible sometime or other they may work on him; why is it not as reasonable and useful (I am sure it is much more justifiable and <hi>charitable</hi>) to leave him all his Life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Means, which all agree God has appointed, without going any higher, because 'tis not impossible that some time or other Preaching, and a Word spoken in due season, may work upon him? For why you should despair of the Success of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Perswasion upon a fruitless Trial, and thereupon think your self authorized to use Force; and yet not so despair of the Success of moderate Force, as after Years of fruitless Trial, to continue it on, and not to proceed to higher Degrees of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you are concerned for the vindication of your System to shew a Reason.</p>
            <p>I mention the Trial of Preaching and Perswasion, to shew the Unreasonableness of your Hypothesis, supposing such a Trial made: not that in yours, or the common Method, there is or can be a fair Trial made what Preaching and Perswasion can do. For care is taken by Punishments and ill Treatment, to indispose and turn away Mens Minds, and to add Aversion to their Scruples; an excellent way to soften Mens Inclinations, and temper them for the Impression of Arguments and Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; though these too are only talked of: For I cannot but wonder to find you mention, as you do, giving ear to <hi>Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Intreaties</hi> and <hi>Perswasions,</hi> when these are seldom, if ever made use of, but in Places, where those, who are to be wrought on by them, are known to be out of hearing; nor can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come there, till by such Means they have been wrought on.</p>

'Tis not without reason therefore you cannot part with your <note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> Penalties, and would have no end put to your Punishments, but continue them on; since you leave so much to their Operation, and make so little use of other Means to work upon Dissenters.</p>

            <p>HE that should read the beginning of your <hi>Argument consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> would think it in earnest to be your Design to have Force employed to make Men seriously consider, and nothing else: but he that shall look a little farther into it, and to that add also your defence of it, will find by the variety of Ends you design your Force for, that either you know not well what you would have it for, or else, whatever 'twas you aimed at, you called it still by that Name which best fitted the Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and would serve best in that place to recommend the Use of it.</p>
            <p>You ask me, <hi>Whether the Mildness and Gentleness of the Gospel</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> 
               <hi>destroys the coactive Power of the Magistrate?</hi> I answer, as you supposed, No: upon which you infer, <hi>Then it seems the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate may use his coactive Power, without offending against the Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Gentleness of the Gospel.</hi> Yes, where he has Commission and Authority to use it. <hi>And so,</hi> say you, <hi>it will consist well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with the Mildness and Gentleness of the Gospel for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to use his coactive Power to procure them</hi> [I suppose you mean the Ministers and Preachers of the National Religion] <hi>a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where their Prayers and Intreaties will not do it.</hi> No, it will not consist with the gentle and mild Method of the Gospel, unless the Gospel has directed it, or something else to supply its want, till it could be had. As for Miracles, which you pretend to have supplied the want of Force in the first Ages of Christianity, you will find that considered in another place. But, Sir, shew me a Country where the Ministers and Teachers of the National and True Religion go about with <hi>Prayers and Intreaties to procure a Hearing,</hi> and cannot obtain it, and there I think I need not stand

with you for the Magistrate to use Force to procure it them; but that I fear will not serve your turn.</p>
            <p>To shew the Inconsistency and Unpracticableness of your Method, I had said, </p>

               <p>Let us now see to what end they must be <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note> punished: Sometimes it is, <hi>To bring them to consider those Reasons</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and Arguments which are proper and sufficient to convince them:</hi> Of what? That it is not easy to set <hi>Grant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ani</hi> Steeple upon <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church? Whatever it be you would have them convinced of, you are not willing to tell us; and so it may be any thing. Sometimes it is, <hi>To incline them to lend an Ear to those who tell</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>them they have mistaken their Way, and offer to shew them the right.</hi> Which is, to lend an Ear to all who differ from them in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as well <hi>crafty Seducers,</hi> as others. Whether this be for <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 27.</note> 
                  <hi>the procuring the Salvation of their Souls,</hi> the End for which you <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 23.</note> say this Force is to be used, judg you. But this I am sure, Whoever will <hi>lend an Ear to all who will tell them they are out of the Way,</hi> will not have much time for any other Business.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is, <hi>To recover Men to so much Sobriety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>as seriously to put the Question to themselves, Whether it be really worth their while to undergo such Inconveniences, for adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a Religion which, for any thing they know, may be false; or for rejecting another (if that be the case) which, for ought they know, may be true, till they have brought it to the Bar of Reason, and given it a fair Trial there.</hi> Which in short amounts to thus much, <hi>viz. To make them examine whether their Religion be true, and so worth the holding, under those Penalties that are annexed to it.</hi> Dissenters are indebted to you for your great care of their Souls. But what, I beseech you, shall become of those of the National Church, every where (which make far the greater part of Mankind) who have no such Punishments to make them <hi>consider;</hi> who have not this <hi>only Remedy</hi> provided for them, but are left in that deplorable Condition, you mention, of <hi>being suffered quietly, and without molestation, to take no care at</hi>

                  <hi>all of their Souls, or in doing of it to follow their own Prejudices, Humours, or some crafty Seducers?</hi> Need not those of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, as well as others, <hi>bring their Religion to the Bar of Reason, and give it a fair Trial there?</hi> And if they need to do so, (as they must, if all National Religions cannot be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed true) they will always need that which you say is the <hi>only</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Means</hi> to make them do so. So that <hi>if you are sure,</hi> as you tell
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49288:73"/>
us, that <hi>there is need of your Method;</hi> I am sure, there is as much need of it in National Churches, as any other. And so, for ought I can see, you must either punish them, or let others alone; unless you think it reasonable that the far greater part of Mankind should constantly be without that Soveraign and only Remedy, which they stand in need of equally with other People.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the End for which Men must be punished is, <hi>to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>dispose them to submit to Instruction, and to give a fair hearing to the Reasons are offer'd for the inlightning their Minds, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Truth to them.</hi> If their own Words may be taken for it, there are as few Dissenters as Conformists, in any Country, who will not profess they have done, and do this. And if their own Words may not be taken; who, I pray must be Judg? you and your Magistrates? If so, then it is plain you punish them not to <hi>dispose them to submit to Instruction,</hi> but <hi>to</hi> your <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; not to dispose them to give a fair hearing to Reasons offer'd for the inlightning their Minds,</hi> but to give an obedient <hi>hearing</hi> to your <hi>Reasons.</hi> If you mean this, it had been fairer and shorter to have spoken out plainly, than thus in fair Words, of indefinite Signification, to say that which amounts to nothing. For what Sense is it, to punish a Man <hi>to dispose him to submit to Instruction, and give a fair hearing to Reasons offer'd for the inlightning his Mind, and discovering Truth to him,</hi> who goes two or three times a Week several Miles on purpose to do it, and that with the Hazard of his Liberty or Purse; unless you mean your <hi>Instructions,</hi> your <hi>Reasons,</hi> your <hi>Truth?</hi> Which brings us but back to what you have disclaimed, plain Persecution for differing in Religion.</p>
               <p>Sometimes this is to be done, <hi>To prevail with Men to weigh</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Matters of Religion carefully and impartially.</hi> Discountenance and Punishment put into one Scale, with Impunity and Hopes of Preferment put into the other, is as sure a way to make a Man <hi>weigh impartially,</hi> as it would be for a Prince to bribe and threaten a Judg to make him judg uprightly.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is, <hi>To make Men bethink themselves, and put it</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>out of the Power of any foolish Humour, or unreasonable Prejudice, to alienate them from Truth and their own Happiness.</hi> Add but this, <hi>to put it out of the Power of any Humour or Prejudice</hi> of their own, or other Mens; and I grant the End is good, if
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49288:73"/>
you can find the means to procure it. But why it should not be put out of the Power of other Mens <hi>Humour</hi> or <hi>Prejudice,</hi> as well as their own, wants (and will always want) a Reason to prove. Would it not, I beseech you, to an indifferent By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stander, appear <hi>Humour</hi> or <hi>Prejudice,</hi> or something as bad; to see Men, who profess a Religion reveal'd from Heaven, and which they own contains all in it necessary to Salvation, exclude Men from their Communion, and persecute them with the Penalties of the Civil Law, for not joining in the Use of Ceremonies which are no where to be found in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion? Would it not appear <hi>Humour</hi> or <hi>Prejudice,</hi> or some such thing, to a sober impartial Heathen; to see Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians exclude and persecute one of the same Faith, for things which they themselves confess to be indifferent, and not worth the contending for? <hi>Prejudice, Humour, Passion, Lusts, Impressions</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>of Education, Reverence and Admiration of Persons, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Respects, Love of their own Choice, and the like,</hi> (to which you justly impute many Mens taking up and persisting in their Religion) are indeed good Words; and so, on the other side, are these following, <hi>Truth, the right Way, Inlightning, Reason, sound Judgment;</hi> but they signify nothing at all to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, till you can evidently and unquestionably shew the World that the latter (viz. <hi>Truth and the right way,</hi> &amp;c.) are always, and in all Countries, to be found only in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church; and the former (viz. <hi>Passion and Prejudice,</hi> &amp;c.) only amongst the Dissenters. But to go on:</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is, <hi>To bring Men to take such Care as they ought</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>of their Salvation.</hi> What <hi>Care is such as Men ought to take,</hi> whilst they are out of your Church, will be hard for you to tell me. But you indeavour to explain your self, in the following words; <hi>that they may not blindly leave it to the choice neither of any other Person, nor yet of their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and Passions, to prescribe to them what Faith or Worship they shall imb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ce.</hi> You do well to make use of Punishment to shut <hi>Passion</hi> out of the choice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you know fear of suffering is no <hi>Passion.</hi> But let that pass. You would have Men punished, <hi>to bring them to take such Care of their Salvation, that they may not blindly leave it to the Choice of any other Person to prescribe to them.</hi> Are you sincere? Are you in earnest? Tell me then truly: Did the Magistrate or the National Church, any where, or yours in particular, ever
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49288:74"/>
punish any Man, to bring him to <hi>have this Care,</hi> which you say, <hi>he ought to take of his Salvation?</hi> Did you ever punish any Man, that he might not <hi>blindly leave it to the choice</hi> of his Parish-Priest, or Bishop, or the Convocation, <hi>what Faith or Worship he should imbrace?</hi> 'Twill be suspected Care of a Party, or any thing else rather than <hi>Care of the Salvation of Mens Souls;</hi> if, having found out so <hi>useful,</hi> so <hi>necessary</hi> a Remedy, <hi>the only Method there is Room left for,</hi> you will apply it but partially, <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> and make Trial of it only on those who you have truly least Kindness for. This will, unavoidably, give one Reason to imagine, you do not think so well of your Remedy as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, who are so sparing of it to your Friends; but are very free of it to Strangers, who in other things are used very much like Enemies. But your Remedy is like the <hi>Helleboraster,</hi> that grew in the Woman's Garden, for the Cure of Worms in her Neighbours Children: For truly it wrought too rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to give it to any of her own. Methinks your Charity, in your present Persecution, is much-what as prudent, as justifiable, as that good Woman's. I hope I have done you no Injury, that I here suppose you of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> If I have, I beg your Pardon. It is no Offence of Malice, I assure you: For I suppose no worse of you, than I confess of my self.</p>
               <p>Sometimes this Punishment that you contend for, is, <hi>to bring</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Men to act according to Reason and sound Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Tertius è Coelo cecidit Cato.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This is Reformation indeed. If you can help us to it, you will deserve Statues to be erected to you, as to the Restorer of decay'd Religion. But if all Men have not <hi>Reason and sound Judgment,</hi> will Punishment put it into them? Besides, concerning this matter Mankind is so divided, that he <hi>acts according to Reason and sound Judgment</hi> at <hi>Auspurg,</hi> who would be judged to do the quite contrary at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Will Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment make Men know what is <hi>Reason and sound Judgment?</hi> If it will not, 'tis impossible it should make them <hi>act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. Reason and sound Judgment</hi> are the <hi>Elixir</hi> it self, the universal Remedy: And you may as reasonably punish Men to bring them to have the Philosopher's Stone, as to <hi>bring them, to act according to Reason and sound Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:49288:74"/>
Sometimes it is, <hi>To put Men upon a serious and impartial Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Controversy between the Magistrate and them, which is the way sor them to come to the Knowledg of the Truth.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 26.</note> But what if the Truth be on neither side (as I am apt to imagine you will think it is not, where neither the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate nor the Dissenter is either of them of your Church) how will the <hi>examining the Controversy between the Magistrate and him be the way to come to the Knowledg of the Truth?</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Controversy between a Lutheran and a Papist; or, if you please, between a Presbyterian Magistrate and a Quaker Subject. <hi>Will the examining the Controversy between the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate and the Dissenting Subject,</hi> in this case, <hi>bring him to the Knowledg of the Truth?</hi> If you say, Yes, then you grant one of these to have the Truth on his side. For the examining the Controversy between a Presbyterian and a Quaker, leaves the Controversy either of them has with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or any other Church, untouched. And so one, at least, of those being already <hi>come to the Knowledg of the Truth,</hi> ought not to be put under your Discipline of Punishment; which is only to <hi>bring him to the Truth.</hi> If you say, No, and that <hi>the examining the Controversy between the Magistrate and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter,</hi> in this case, will not <hi>bring him to the Knowledg of the Truth;</hi> you consess your Rule to be false, and your Method to no purpose.</p>
               <p>To conclude, your System is, in short, this. You would have all Men (laying aside <hi>Prejudice, Humour, Passion,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>examine the Grounds of their Religion, and search for the Truth.</hi> This, I consess, is heartily to be wish'd. The means that you propose to make Men do this, is, that Dissenters should be punished, to make them do so. It is as if you had said, Men generally are guilty of a Fault; therefore let one Sect, who have the ill luck to be of an Opinion different from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, be punished. This at first Sight shocks any one who has the least Spark of Sense, Reason, or Justice. But having spoken of this already, and concluding that upon second Thoughts, you your self will be ashamed of it; let us consider it put so as to be consistent with common Sense, and with all the Advantage it can bear; and then let us see what you can make of it. <hi>Men</hi> are <hi>negligent in examining the Religions they imbrace, refuse, or persist in; therefore it is fit they should be punished to make them</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:49288:75"/>
                  <hi>do it.</hi> This is a Consequence indeed which may, without Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to common Sense, be drawn from it. This is the Use, the only Use, which you think Punishment can <hi>indirectly and at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> have in matters of Religion. You would have Men by Punishments driven to examine. What? <hi>Religion.</hi> To what end? <hi>To bring them to the Knowledg of the Truth.</hi> But I answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Every one has not the Ability to do this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Every one has not the Opportunity to do it.</p>
               <p>Would you have every poor Protestant, for example, in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate, examine throughly</hi> whether the Pope be infallible, or Head of the Church; whether there be a Purgatory; whether Saints are to be pray'd to, or the Dead pray'd for; whether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be the only Rule of Faith; whether there be no Salvation out of the Church; and whether there be no Church without Bishops; and an hundred other Questions in Controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Papists and those Protestants: and when he had master'd these, go on to fortify himself against the Opinions and Objections of other Churches he differs from? This, which is no small Task, must be done, before a Man can have <hi>brought his Religion to the Bar of Reason, and given it fair Trial there.</hi> And if you will punish Men till this be done, the Country-man must leave off plowing and sowing, and betake himself to the Study of Greek and Latin; and the Artisan must sell his Tools, to buy Fathers and School-men, and leave his Family to starve. If something less than this will satisfy you, pray tell me what is enough. Have they considered and examined enough, if they are satisfied themselves where the Truth lies? If this be the Limits of their Examination, you will find few to punish; unless you will punish them to make them do what they have done already. For, however he came by his Religion, there is scarce any one to be found who does not own himself satisfied that he is in the right. Or else, must they be punished to make them consider and examine till they imbrace that which you chuse for Truth? If this be so, what do you but in effect chuse for them, when yet you would have Men punished, <hi>To bring them to such a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Care of their Souls that no other Person might chuse for them?</hi> If it be Truth in general you would have them by Punishments driven to seek; that is to offer matter of Dispute, and not a Rule of Discipline. For to punish any one to make him
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49288:75"/>
seek till he find Truth, without a Judg of Truth, is to punish for you know not what; and is all one as if you should whip a Scholar to make him find out the square Root of a Number you do not know. I wonder not therefore that you could not resolve with your self what degree of Severity you would have used, nor how long continued; when you dare not speak out directly whom you would have punished, and are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear to what end they should be under Penalties.</p>
               <p>Consonant to this Uncertainty, of whom, or what, to be punished; you tell us, <hi>That there is no Question of the Success of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>this Method. Force will certainly do, if duly proportioned to the Design of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What, I pray, is the <hi>Design of it?</hi> I challenge you, or any Man living, out of what you have said in your Book, to tell me directly what it is. In all other Punishments that ever I heard of yet, till now that you have taught the World a new Method, the Design of them has been to cure the Crime they are denounced against; and so I think it ought to be here. What I beseech you is the Crime here? Dissenting? That you say not, any where, is a Fault. Besides you tell us, <hi>That the Magistrate hath not an Authority to compel any one</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</note> 
                  <hi>to his Religion:</hi> And that <hi>you do not require that Men should</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note> 
                  <hi>have no Rule but the Religion of the Country.</hi> And the <hi>Power you ascribe to the Magistrate is given him to bring Men, not to</hi>

Is that the Crime your Punishments are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to cure? Neither that dare you say, lest you displease more than you satisfy with your new Discipline. And then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, (as I said before) you must tell us how far you would have them examine, before you punish them for not doing it. And I imagine, if that were all we required of you, it would be long enough before you would trouble us with a Law, that should prescribe to every one how far he was to examine Matters of Religion; wherein if he fail'd and came short, he was to be punished; if he perform'd and went in his Examination to the Bounds set by the Law, he was acquitted and free. Sir, when you consider it again, you will perhaps think this a Case reserv'd to the Great Day, when the Secrets of all Hearts shall be laid open. For I imagine it is beyond the Power

               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:49288:76"/>
               <hi>such as do reject the True Religion, are to be punished;</hi> you <hi>say, To bring them to imbrace the True Religion; and in order to that to bring them to consider, and that carefully and impartially, the Evidence which is offered to convince them of the Truth of it: Which are unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably just and excellent Ends; and which, through God's Blessing, have often been procured, and may yet be procured by convenient Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties inflicted for that purpose. Nor do</hi> you <hi>know of any thing</hi> I <hi>say against any part of this, which is not already answered.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I in this <hi>confound</hi> two things distinct, or you distinguish where there is no difference, the Reader may judg by what I have said elsewhere.

            <p>Sometimes you speak of this End, as if it were barely <hi>to gain</hi>

When a Man conforms to the National Church. And who then is Judg of what is the Truth to be imbraced, but the Magistrate?</p>
            <p>It <hi>is to bring Men to consider those Reasons and Arguments which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 26:</note> 
               <hi>are proper and sufficient to convince them; but which, without being forced, they would not consider.</hi> And when have they done this? When they have once conformed: for after that there is no Force used to make them consider farther.</p>
            <p>It is to make Men <hi>consider as they ought;</hi> and that you tell us, <note place="margin">P. 40.</note> is so to consider, as <hi>to be moved heartily to imbrace, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>

               <hi>true Religion, and in order to that to bring them to consider, and that carefully and impartially, the Evidence which is offered to convince them of the Truth of it, which,</hi> as you say, <hi>are undeniable, just and excellent Ends;</hi> but yet such as Force in your Method can never practically be made a Means to, without supposing what you say <note place="margin">P. 47.</note> you <hi>have no need</hi> to suppose, <hi>viz.</hi> that your Religion is the true; unless you had rather every where to leave it to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate to judg which is the right Way, what is the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; which Supposition I imagine will less accommodate you than the other. But take which of them you will, you must add this other Supposition to it, harder to be granted you than either of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> That those who conform to your Church here, (if you make your self the Judg) or to the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church any where, (if you make the Magistrate Judg of <hi>the Truth that must save Men)</hi> and those only have attained these Ends.</p>
            <p>The Magistrate, you say, is obliged to do what in him lies to bring <hi>all</hi> his Subjects <hi>to examine carefully and impartially Matters of Religion,</hi> and <hi>to consider them as they ought,</hi> i. e. so as to <hi>imbroce</hi>

               <hi>the Truth that must save them.</hi> The proper and necessary Means, <note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> you say, to attain these Ends is Force.

Make this practicable now in any Country in the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowing the Magistrate to be Judg <hi>what is the Truth that must save them,</hi> and without supposing also, that whoever do imbrace the outward Profession of the National Religion, do in their Hearts <hi>imbrace,</hi> i. e. believe and obey <hi>the Truth that must save them;</hi> and then I think nothing in Government can be too hard for your undertaking.</p>
            <p>You conclude this Paragraph in telling me, You <hi>do not know</hi>

               <hi>of any thing</hi> I <hi>say against any part of this, which is not already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</hi> Pray tell me where 'tis you have answered those Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections I made to those several Ends which you assigned in your <hi>Argument considered,</hi> and for which you would have Force used, and which I have here reprinted again, because I do not find you so much as take notice of them: and therefore the Reader must judg whether they needed any Answer or no.</p>
            <p>But to shew that you have not here, where you promise and pretend to do it, <hi>clearly and directly</hi> told us <hi>for what</hi> Force and Penalties are to be used, I shall in the next Chapter examine what you mean by <hi>bringing Men to imbrace the True Religion.</hi>

            <p>TRue Religion is on all hands acknowledged to be so much the Concern and Interest of all Mankind, that nothing can be named, which so much effectually bespeak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Who dares que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion such a Cause, or oppose what is offered for the promoting the True Religion? This Advantage you have secured to your self from unattentive Readers, as much as by the often-repeated mention of the True Religion, is possible, there being scarce a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49288:78"/>
Page wherein <hi>the True Religion</hi> does not appear, as if you had nothing else in your Thoughts, but the bringing Men to it for the Salvation of their Souls. Whether it be so in earnest, we will now see.</p>
            <p>You tell us, <hi>Whatever Hardships some false Religions may impose,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 7.</note> 
               <hi>it will however always be easier to carnal and worldly minded Men, to give even the first-born for their Transgressions, than to mortify the Lusts from which they spring, which no Religion but the True requires of them.</hi> Upon this you ground the Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>essity of Force to bring Men <hi>to the True Religion,</hi> and charge it on the Magistrate as his Duty to use it to that End. What now in appearance can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press greater Care to bring Men to the True Religion? But let us see what you say in <hi>p.</hi> 64. and we shall sind that in your Scheme nothing less is meant: there you tell us, <hi>The Magistrate inflicts the Penalties only upon them that break the Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> And that Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring nothing but Conformity to the National Religion, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> but Nonconformists are punished. So that unless an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profession of the National Religion be by the Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Mens Lusts harder than their <hi>giving their First-born for their Transgression,</hi> all the Penalties you contend sor concern not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nor can be intended to bring Men effectually to the True Religion; since they leave them before they come to the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which is <hi>to mortify their Lusts,</hi> as <hi>the True Religion requires.</hi> So that your bringing Men to the True Religion, being to bring them to Conformity to the National, for then you have done with Force, how far that outward Consormity is from being heartily of the True Religion, may be known by the distance there is between the easiest and the hardest thing in the World. For there is nothing easier, than to profess in Words; nothing harder, than to subdue the Heart, and bring Thoughts and Deeds into Obedience of the Truth: The latter is what is required to be of the True Religion; the other all that is required by Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties your way applied. If you say, Conformists to the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Religion are required by the Law Civil and Ecclesiastical, to lead good Lives, which is the difficult part of the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: I answer, These are not the Laws we are here speaking of, nor those which the Defenders of Toleration complain of, but the Laws that put a distinction between outward Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists and Nonconformists: and those they say, whatever may be talked <hi>of the True Religion,</hi> can never be meant to bring Men
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49288:78"/>
really to the True Religion, as long as the True Religion is, and is confessed to be a thing of so much greater difficulty than out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Conformity.</p>
            <p>Miracles, say you, supplied the want of Force in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Christianity; and therefore so far as they supplied that Want, they must be subservient to the same End. The End then was to bring Men into the Christian Church, into which they were admitted and received as Brethren, when they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God. Will that serve the turn? No: Force must be used to make Men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> i. e. outwardly conform to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worship of your Church. Nothing more than that is required by your Penalties; nothing less than that will excuse from Punishment; that, and nothing but that, will serve the turn; that therefore, and only that, is what you mean by <hi>the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> you would have Force used to bring Men to.</p>
            <p>When I tell you,<q>You have a very ill Opinion of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p</hi> 4.</note> on of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and must own it can only be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated and supported by Force, if you do not think it would be a Gainer by a general Toleration all the World over</q>: You ask, <hi>Why</hi> you <hi>may not have as good an Opinion of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's, <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> 
               <hi>as</hi> you <hi>have of</hi> Noah's <hi>Religion, notwithstanding</hi> you <hi>think it cannot now be propagated or supported without using some kinds or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Force.</hi> When you have proved that <hi>Noah</hi>'s Religion, that from eight Persons spread and continued in the World till the Apostles Times, as I have proved in another place, <hi>was propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and supported</hi> all that while by <hi>your kinds or degrees of Force,</hi> you may have some reason to think <hi>as well of the Religion of the Church of</hi> England, as you <hi>have of</hi> Noah's <hi>Religion,</hi> though you <hi>think it cannot be propagated and supported without some kinds or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Force.</hi> But till you can prove that, you cannot upon that ground say you have reason to <hi>have so good an Opinion</hi> of it.</p>

               <hi>think there are many other Countries in the World</hi> besides England, <hi>where</hi> my <hi>Toleration would be as little useful to Truth as in</hi> England. If you will name those Countries, which will be no great pains, I will take your word for it, that you believe Toleration there would be prejudicial to Truth: but if you will not do that, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I nor any body else can believe you.

upon your Principles, you can allow any National Religion, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be true; and where the National Reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ion is not true, we have already your Consent, as in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp;c. for Toleration. Now that you cannot, without renouncing your own Principles, allow any National Religion, differing from that establish'd here by Law, to be true, is evident: For why do you punish Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists here? <hi>To bring</hi> them, say you, <hi>to the True Religion.</hi> But what if they hold nothing, but what that other differing National Church does, shall they be nevertheless punished if they conform not? You will certainly say, Yes: and if so, then you must either say, they are not of <hi>the True Religion,</hi> or else you must own you punish those, <hi>to bring them to the True Religion,</hi> whom you allow to be of the True Religion already.</p>
            <p>You tell me, <hi>If</hi> I <hi>own with our Author, that there is but one True</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Religion, and</hi> I <hi>owning my self to be of the Church of</hi> England, you <hi>cannot see how</hi> I <hi>can avoid supposing, that the National Religion now in</hi> England, <hi>back'd by the publick Authority of the Law, is the only True Religion.</hi> If I own, as I do, all that you here expect from me, yet it will not serve to draw that Conclusion from it, which you do, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the National Religion now in</hi> England <hi>is the only True Religion;</hi> taking the True Religion in the Sense that I do, and you ought to take it. I grant that there is but one True Religion in the World, which is that whose Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worship are necessary to Salvation. I grant too that the True Religion, necessary to Salvation, is taught and professed in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and yet it will not follow from hence, that the Religion of the Church of <hi>England, as esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Law,</hi> is <hi>the only True Religion;</hi> if there be any thing established in the Church of <hi>England</hi> by Law, and made part of its Religion, which is not necessary to Salvation, and which any other Church, teaching and professing all that is necessary to Salvation, does not receive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the National Religion now in</hi> England, <hi>back'd by the Authority of the Law,</hi> be, as you would have it, <hi>the only true Religion;</hi> so the only true Religion, that a Man cannot be saved without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Pray reconcile this, with what you say in the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding Paragraph, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>there are many other Countries in the World where</hi> my <hi>Toleration would be as little useful as in</hi> England. For if there be other National Religions differing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49288:79"/>
from that of <hi>England,</hi> which you allow to be true, and wherein Men may be saved, the National Religion of <hi>England,</hi> as now <hi>established by Law,</hi> is not the <hi>only true Religion,</hi> and Men may be saved without being of it. And then the Magistrate can upon your Principles have no Authority to use Force to bring Men to be of it. For you tell us, Force is not lawful, unless it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; and therefore the Magistrate can never lawfully use it, but to bring Men to believe and practise what is necessary to Salvation. You must therefore either hold, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Doctrine, Discipline and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is established by Law, but what is necessary to Salvation: Or else you must reform your Terms of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before the Magistrate upon your Principles can use Penalties to make Men consider till they conform; or you can say that the National Religion of <hi>England</hi> is the <hi>only true Religion,</hi> though it contain the only true Religion in it; as possibly most, if not all, the differing Christian Churches now in the World do.</p>
            <p>You tell us farther in the next Paragraph, <hi>That where-ever this</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 11.</note> 
               <hi>only true Religion,</hi> i. e. the National Religion now in <hi>England, is received, all other Religions ought to be discouraged.</hi> Why I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you discourag'd, if they be true any of them?

But you only say, <hi>where-ever</hi> it is preach'd, it ought to be received; and <hi>where-ever</hi> it is received, other Religions ought to be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, which is well suted to your Scheme for inforcing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

            <p>Force then must be used in <hi>England,</hi> and Penalties laid on Dissenters there. For what? <hi>to bring them to the true Religion,</hi> whereby it is plain you mean not only the Doctrine but Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and make them a part of the only true Religion: Why else do you punish all Dissenters for rejecting the true Religion, and use Force to bring them to it? When yet a great, if not the greatest part of Dissenters in <hi>England</hi> own and profess the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as firmly as those in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> They therefore, though they believe the same Religion with you, are excluded from the true Church of God, that you would have Men brought to, and are amongst those who <hi>reject the true Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ask whether they are not in your Opinion out of the <hi>way of Salvation,</hi> who are not joined in Communion with the true Church? and whether there can be any true Church without Bishops? If so, all but Conformists in <hi>England</hi> that are of any Church in <hi>Europe</hi> besides the Lutherans and Papists, are out of the <hi>way of Salvation,</hi> and so according to your System have need of Force to be brought into it: and these too, one for their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Transubstantiation, the other for that of Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, (to omit other things vastly differing from the Church of <hi>England</hi>) you will not, I suppose, allow to be of the true Religion: And who then are left of the true Religion but the Church of <hi>England?</hi> For the <hi>Abyssines</hi> have too wide a Difference in many Points for me to imagine, that is one of those Places you mean where <hi>Toleration would do harm as well as in England.</hi> And I think the Religion of the Greek Church can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>carce be supposed by you to be the true. For if it should, it would be a strong Instance against your Assertion, that the true Religion cannot subsist, but would quickly be effectually extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated without the Assistance of Authority, since this has sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted without any such Assistance now above 200 Years. I take it then for granted, (and others with me cannot but do the same, till you tell us, what other Religion there is of any Church, but that of <hi>England,</hi> which you allow to be the true Religion) that all you say of bringing Men to the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49288:80"/>
is only bringing them to the Religion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> If I do you an Injury in this, it will be capable of a very easy Vindication: for it is but naming that other Church dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from that of <hi>England,</hi> which you allow to have the true Religion, and I shall yield my self convinc'd, and shall allow these Words, <hi>viz. The National Religion now in</hi> England, <hi>back'd by</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> 
               <hi>the publick Authority of Law, being the only true Religion,</hi> only as a little hasty Sally of your Zeal. In the mean time I shall argue with you about the Use of Force to bring Men to the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as established by Law: since it is more easy to know what that is, than what you mean by the <hi>true Religion,</hi> if you mean any thing else.</p>
            <p>To proceed therefore; in the next place I tell you, by using Force your way to bring Men to the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you mean only to bring them to an outward Profession of that Religion; and that, as I have told you elsewhere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Force used your way, being applied only to Dissenters, and ceasing as soon as they conform, (whether it be intended by the Law-maker for any thing more or no, which we have examined in another Place) cannot be to bring Men to any thing mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e than outward Conformity. For if Force be used to Dissenters, and them only, to bring Men to the true Religion, and always as soon as it has brought Men to Conformity, it be taken off, and laid aside, as having done all is expected fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> it; 'tis plain, that by <hi>bringing Men to the true Religion,</hi> and bringing them to outward Conformity, you mean the same thing. You use and continue Force upon Dissenters, because you expect some Effect from it: when you take it off, it has wrought that Effect, or else being in your Power, why do you not continue it on? The Effect then that you talk of, being the <hi>imbracing the true Religion,</hi> and the thing you are satisfied with without any farther Punishment, Expectation, or Inquiry, being outward Conformity, 'tis plain <hi>imbracing the true Religion</hi> and outward Conformity with you, are the same things.</p>
            <p>Neither can you say it is <hi>presumable</hi> that those who outwardly conform do really understand, and inwardly in their Hearts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with a lively Faith and a sincere Obedience, the Truth that must save them. 1. Because it being, as you tell us, the <hi>Magistrate's Duty</hi> to do all <hi>that in him lies</hi> for the Salvation of all his Subjects, and it being in his Power to examine, whether
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49288:81"/>
they know and live sutable to the Truth that must save them, as well as conform, he can or ought no more to presume, that they do so, without taking an Account of their Knowledg and Lives, than he can or ought to presume that they conform, without taking any Account of their Coming to Church. Would you think that Physician discharged his Duty, and had (as was pretended) a Care of Mens Lives, who having got them into his Hands, and knowing no more of them, but that they come once or twice a Week to the Apothecary's Shop, to hear what is prescribed them, and sit there a while, should say it was <hi>presumable</hi> they were recovered, without ever examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Prescriptions had any Effect, or what Estate their Health was in?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It cannot be <hi>presumable,</hi> where there are so many visible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to the contrary. He must pass for an admirable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumer, who will seriously affirm that it is <hi>presumable</hi> that all those who conform to the National Religion where it is true, do so understand, believe and practise it, as to be in <hi>the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It cannot be <hi>presumable,</hi> that Men have parted with their <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Lusts</hi> to avoid Force, when they fly to Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which can shelter them from Force without quitting their Lusts. That which is dearer to Men than their First-born, is, you tell us, <hi>their Lusts;</hi> that which is harder than the <hi>Hardships</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 7.</note> of false Religions, is the <hi>mortifying</hi> those <hi>Lusts:</hi> here lies the Difficulty of the true Religion, that it requires the mortifying of those Lusts; and till that be done, Men are not of <hi>the true Religion, nor in the way of Salvation:</hi> And 'tis upon this Account only that you pretend Force to be needful. Force is used to make them <hi>hear;</hi> it prevails, Men hear: but that is not enough, because the Difficulty lies not in that; they may hear Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Truth, and yet retain their Corruption. They must do more, they must <hi>consider</hi> those Arguments. Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it of them? The Law that insticts the Punishment, does not; but this we may be sure their Love of their Lusts, and their Hatred of Punishment requires of them, and will bring them to, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>consider</hi> how to retain their beloved Lusts, and yet avoid the Uneasiness of the Punishment they lie under; this is <hi>presumable</hi> they do; therefore they go one easy Step farther, they conform, and then they are safe from Force, and may still
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49288:81"/>
retain their Corruption. Is it therefore <hi>presumable</hi> they have parted with their Corruption, because Force has driven them to take Sanctuary against Punishment in Conformity, where Force is no longer to molest them, or pull them from their darling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations? The Difficulty in Religion is, you say, for Men to part with their Lusts; this makes Force, necessary: Men find out a way by consorming to avoid Force without parting with their Lusts, therefore it is <hi>presumable</hi> when they con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>orm, that Force which they can avoid without quitting their Lusts, has made them part with them, which is indeed not to part with their Lusts, because of Force, but to part with them <hi>gratis;</hi> which if you can say is <hi>presumable,</hi> the Foundation of your need of Force (which you place in the Prevalency of Corruption, and Mens adhering to their Lusts) will be gone, and so there will be no need of Force at all. If the great Difficulty in Religion be for Men to part with or mortify their Lusts, and the only Counter-ballance in the other Scale, to assist the true Religion, to prevail against their Lusts, be Force; which I beseech you is <hi>presumable,</hi> if they can avoid Force, and retain their Lusts, that they should quit their Lusts, and heartily imbrace the true Religion, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> incompatible with them; or else that they should avoid the Force, and retain their Lusts? To say the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of these, is to say that it is <hi>presumable,</hi> that they will quit their Lusts, and heartily imbrace the true Religion for its own sake: for he that heartily imbraces the true Religion, because of a Force which he knows he can avoid at Pleasure, without quitting his Lusts, cannot be said so to imbrace it, because of that Force: Since a Force he can avoid without quitting his Lusts, cannot be said to assist Truth in making him quit them: For in this Truth has no Assistance from it at all. So that this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> to say there is no need of Force at all in the Case.</p>

               </gap>bt, and not to avoid the Force
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49288:82"/>
of the Law? The Lust of the Flesh and Pride of Life are as strong and prevalent as the Lust of the Eye: And if you will deliberately say again, that it is <hi>presumable,</hi> that Men are driven by Force to consider, so as to part with their Lusts, when no more is known of them, but that they do what discharges them from the Force, without any Necessity of parting with their Lusts; I think I shall have occasion to send you to my Pagans and Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, but shall have no need to say any thing more to you of this matter my self.</p>
            <p>I agree with you, that there is but one only true Religion; I agree too that that one only true Religion is professed and held in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and yet I deny, if Force may be used to bring Men to that true Religion, that upon your Principles it can lawfully be used to bring Men to the National Religion in <hi>England</hi> as established by Law; because Force, according to your own Rule, being only lawful because it is necessary, and <note place="margin">P. 30.</note> therefore unfit <hi>to be used where not necessary,</hi> i. e. necessary to bring Men to Salvation, it can never be lawful to be used to bring a Man to any thing, that is not necessary to Salvation, as I have more fully shewn in another Place. If therefore in the National Religion of <hi>England,</hi> there be any thing put in as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Communion, that is, though true, yet not necessary to Salvation, Force cannot be lawfully used to bring Men to that Communion, though the thing so required in it self may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be true.</p>
            <p>There be a great many Truths contained in Scripture, which a Man may be ignorant of, and consequently not believe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Danger to his Salvation, or else very few would be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Salvation: for I think I may truly say, there was never any one, but he that was the Wisdom of the Father, who was not ignorant of some, and mistaken in others of them. To bring Men therefore to imbrace such Truths, the Use of Force by your own Rule cannot be lawful: because the Belief or Knowledg of those Truths themselves not being necessary to Salvation, there can be no Necessity Men should be brought to imbrace them, and so no Necessity to use Force to bring Men to imbrace them.</p>
            <p>The only true Religion which is necessary to Salvation, may in one National Church have that joined with it, which in it self is manifestly false and repugnant to Salvation; in such a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49288:82"/>
no Man can join without quitting the way of Salvation. In another National Church, with this only true Religion may be joined, what is neither repugnant nor necessary to Salvation; and of such there may be several Churches differing one from another in Confessions, Ceremonies and Discipline, which are usually call'd different Religions, with either or each of which a good Man (if satisfied in his own Mind) may communicate without Danger, whilst another not satisfied in Conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning something in the Doctrine, Discipline or Worship, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not safely, nor without Sin, communicate with this or that of them. Nor can Force be lawfully used on your Principles to bring any Man to either of them, because such things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to their Communion, which not being requisite to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Men may seriously and conscientiously differ, and be in doubt about, without indangering their Souls.</p>
            <p>That which here raises a Noise, and gives a Credit to it, whereby many are misled into an unwarrantable Zeal, is, that these are called different Religions; and every one thinking his own the true, the only true, condemns all the rest as false Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. Whereas those who hold all things necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and add not thereto any thing in Doctrine, Discipline or Worship, inconsistent with Salvation, are of one and the same Religion, though divided into different Societies or Churches, under different Forms: which whether the Passion and Polity of designing; or the sober and pious Intention of well-meaning Men, set up, they are no other, than the Contrivances of Men, and such they ought to be esteemed in whatsoever is required in them, which God has not made necessary to Salvation, however in its own Nature it may be indifferent lawful or true. For none of the Articles or Confessions of any Church, that I know, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them all the Truths of Religion, though they contain some that are not necessary to Salvation, to garble thus the Truths of Religion, and by their own Authority take some not necessary to Salvation, and make them the terms of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and leave out others as necessary to be known and believed, is purely the Contrivance of Men: God never having appointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such distinguishing System; nor, as I have shew'd, can Force, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Principles, lawfully be used to bring Men to imbrace it.</p>
            <p>Concerning Ceremonies, I shall here only ask you whether you think Kneeling at the Lord's Supper, or the Cross in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,

               </gap>ple: if you will not say they are, how can you say that Force can be lawfully used to bring Men into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to which these are made necessary? If you say, Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is necessary to a decent Uniformity, (for of the Cross in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism I have spoken elsewhere) though that should be true yet 'tis an Argument you cannot use for it, if you are of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> for, if a decent Uniformity may be well enough pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served without kneeling at Prayer, where Decency requires it at least as much as at receiving the Sacrament, why may it not well enough be preserved without kneeling at the Sacrament? Now that Uniformity is thought sufficiently preserved without kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Prayer, is evident by the various Postures Men are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to use, and may be generally observed, in all our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, during the Minister's Prayer in the Pulpit before and after his Sermon, which it seems can consist well enough with Decency and Uniformity; tho it be at Prayer addressed to the great God of Heaven and Earth, to whose Majesty it is that the Reverence to be expressed in our Gestures is due, when we put up Petitions to him, who is invariably the same, in what or whose Words soever we address our selves to him.</p>
            <p>The Preface to the Book of Common-Prayer tells us, That <hi>the Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If it cannot, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any Humane Power be justified in the use of Force, to bring Men to Conformity in the use of such things. If you think Men have Authority to make any thing, in it self indifferent, a necessary part of God's Worship, I shall desire you to consider what our Author says of this Matter, which has not yet deserved your notice.</p>

Force, you say, may be used to punish those who dissent from the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Let us suppose now all its Doctrines not only true, but necessary to Salvation; but that there is put into
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49288:84"/>
the Terms of its Communion some indifferent Action which God has not enjoin'd, nor made a part of his Worship, which any Man is perswaded in his Conscience not to be lawful; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose kneeling at the Sacrament, which having been superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously used in Adoration of the Bread as the real Body of Christ, may give occasion of scruple to some now, as well as eating of Flesh offered to Idols did to others in the Apostles time; which though lawful in it self, yet the Apostle said, he would <hi>eat no</hi>

               <hi>Flesh while the World standeth,</hi> rather than make his weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offend. And if to lead, by Example, the Scrupulous into any Action, in it self indifferent, which they thought unlawful, be a Sin, as appears at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. how much more is it to add Force to our Example, and to compel Men by Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to that, which, though indifferent in it self, they cannot join in without sinning? I desire you to shew me how Force can be <hi>necessary</hi> in such a Case, without which you acknowledg it not to be lawful. Not to kneel at the Lord's Supper, God not having ordained it, is not a Sin; and the Apostles receiving it in the Posture of sitting or lying, which was then used at Meat, is an Evidence it may be received not kneeling. But to him that thinks Kneeling is unlawful, it is certainly a Sin. And for this you may take the Authority of a very Judicious and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelate of our Church, in these Words; <hi>Where a Man is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Discourse of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> 
               <hi>mistaken in his Judgment, even in that Case it is always a Sin to act against it; by so doing, he wilfully acts against the best Light which at present he has for the direction of his Actions.</hi> I need not here repeat his Reasons, having already quoted him above more at large; though the whole Passage, writ (as he uses) with great Strength and Clearness, deserves to be read and considered. If therefore the Magistrate enjoins such an unnecessary Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and uses Force to bring any Man to a sinful Communion with our Church in it, let me ask you, Doth he <hi>sin,</hi> or <hi>misapply</hi> his Power or no?</p>
            <p>True and false Religions are Names that easily engage Mens Affections on the hearing of them; the one being the Aversion, the other the Desire (at least as they perswade themselves) of all Mankind. This makes Men forwardly give into these Names, where-ever they meet with them; and when mention is made of bringing Men from false to the true Religion (very often without knowing what is meant by those Names) they think nothing can
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49288:85"/>
be done too much in such a Business, to which they intitle God's Honour, and the Salvation of Mens Souls.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore desire of you, if you are that fair and sincere Lover of Truth you profess, when you write again, to tell us what you mean by <hi>true,</hi> and what by a <hi>false Religion,</hi> that we may know which in your sense are so: for as you now have used these Words in your Treatise, one of them seems to stand only for the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the other for that of all other Churches. I expect here you should make the same Outcries against me, as you have in your former Letter, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing a Sense upon your Words contrary to your Meaning; and for this you will appeal to your own Words in some other Places: but of this I shall leave the Reader Judg, and tell him, this is a Way very easy and very usual for Men, who having not clear and consistent Notions, keep themselves as much as they can under the shelter of general and variously applicable Terms, that they may save themselves from the Absurdities or Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of one Place, by a help from some general or contrary Expression in another: Whether it be a desire of Victory, or a little too warm Zeal for a Cause you have been hitherto perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of, which hath led you into this way of writing; I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind you, that the Cause of God requires nothing, but what may be spoken out plainly in a clear determined Sense, without any reserve or cover. In the mean time this I shall leave with you as evident, That Force upon your ground cannot be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully used to bring Men to the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (that being all that I can find you clearly mean by <hi>the True Religion</hi>) till you have proved that all that is required of one in that Communion, is necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>However therefore you tell us, That <hi>convenient Force used to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 21.</note> 
               <hi>bring Men to the true Religion, is all that</hi> you <hi>contend for, and all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> you <hi>allow.</hi> That it is for <hi>promoting the true Religion.</hi> That <note place="margin">P. 28, 29.</note> it is <hi>to bring Men to consider, so as not to reject the Truth necessary to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Salvation....</hi> To <hi>bring Men to imbrace the Truth that must save them.</hi> And abundance more to this purpose. Yet all this Talk of the <hi>true Religion</hi> amounting to no more, but the National Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on established by Law in <hi>England;</hi> and your <hi>bringing Men to it,</hi> to no more than bringing them to an outward Profession of it; it would better have suted that Condition, (<hi>viz.</hi> without <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi> and <hi>with an honest Mind</hi>) which you require in others, to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49288:85"/>
have spoke plainly what you aimed at, rather than prepossess Mens Minds in favour of your Cause, by the Impressions of a Name that in truth did not properly belong to it.</p>
            <p>It was not therefore without ground that I said, <q>I suspected <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> you built all on this lurking Supposition, that the National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion now in <hi>England,</hi> back'd by the publick Authority of the Law, is the only true Religion, and therefore no other is to be tolerated: which being a Supposition equally unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and equally just in other Countries; unless that we can imagine that every-where but in <hi>England,</hi> Men believe what at the same time they think to be a Lie, &amp;c.</q> Here you erect your Plumes, and to this your triumphant Logick gives you not Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to answer, without an Air of Victory in the entrance: <note place="margin">P. 11.</note> 
               <hi>How, Sir, is this Supposition equally unavoidable, and equally just in other Countries, where false Religions are the National? (for that you must mean, or nothing to the purpose.)</hi> Hold, Sir, you go too fast; take your own System with you, and you will perceive it will be enough to my purpose, if I mean those Religions which you take to be false: for if there be any other National Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which agreeing with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation, yet have established Ceremonies different from those of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> should not any one who dissented here from the Church of <hi>England</hi> upon that account, as preferring that to our Way of Worship, be justly punished? If so, then Punishment in Matters of Religion being only to bring Men to the <hi>true Religion,</hi> you must suppose him not to be yet of it, and so the National Church he approves of, not to be of the <hi>true Religion.</hi> And yet is it not equally unavoidable, and equally just, that that Church should suppose its Religion the only true Religion, as it is that yours should do so, it agrecing with yours in things necessary to Salvation, and having made some things, in their own nature indifferent, requisite to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity for Decency and Order, as you have done? So that my saying, It is equally unavoidable, and equally just in <hi>other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> will hold good, without meaning what you charge on me, that that Supposition is equally unavoidable, and equally just, where the <hi>National Religion</hi> is absolutely <hi>false.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in that large Sense too, what I said will hold good; and you would have spared your useless Subtilties against it, if you had been as willing to take my Meaning, and answered my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49288:86"/>
as you were to turn what I said to a Sense which the Words themselves shew I never intended. My Argument in short was this, That granting Force to be useful to propagate and support Religion, yet it would be no Advantage to the true Religion, that you a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing yours to be the true Religion, should thereby claim a Right to use Force, since such a Supposition to those who were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of other Churches, and believed other Religions, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually unavoidable, and equally just. And the Reason I annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, shews both this to be my Meaning, and my Assertion to be true: My Words are,<q>Unless we can imagin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> that every-where but in <hi>England,</hi> Men believe what at the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> time they think to be a Lie.</q> Having therefore never said, nor thought that it is equally unavoidable, or equally just, that Men in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try should believe the National Religion of the Country; but that it is equally unavoidable, and equally just, that Men belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the National Religion of their Country, be it true or false, should suppose it to be true; and let me here add also, should endeavour to propagate it: you however go on thus to reply; <hi>If so, then I fear it will be equally true too, and equally rational: for otherwise I see not how it can be equally unavoidable, or equally just: for if it be not equally true, it cannot be equally just; and if it be not equally rational, it cannot be equally unavoidable. But if it be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, and equally rational, then either all Religions are true, or none is true: for if they be all equally true, and one of them be not true, then none of them can be true.</hi> I challenge any one to put these four good Words, <hi>unavoidable, just, rational</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> more <hi>equally</hi> together, or to make a better-wrought Deduction: but after all, my Argument will nevertheless be good, that it is no Advantage to your Cause, for you or any one of it, to suppose yours to be the only true Religion; since it is equally unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and equally just for any one, who believes any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to suppose the same thing. And this will always be so, till you can shew, that Men cannot receive false Religions upon Arguments that appear to them to be good; or that having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Falshood under the appearance of Truth, they can, whilst it so appears, do otherwise than value it, and be acted by it, as if it were true. For the <hi>Equality</hi> that is here in question, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon the Truth of the Opinion imbraced, but on this, that the Light and Perswasion a Man has at present, is the Guide
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49288:86"/>
which he ought to follow, and which in his Judgment of Truth he cannot avoid to be governed by. And therefore the terrible Consequences you dilate on in the following part of that Page, I leave you for your private Use on some sitter Occasion.</p>
            <p>You therefore who are so apt without cause to complain of want of Ingenuity in others, will do well hereafter to consult your own, and another time change your Stile; and not under the undesined Name of <hi>the true Religion,</hi> because that is of more Advantage to your Argument, mean only the Religion esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Law in <hi>England,</hi> shutting out all other Religions now professed in the World. Though when you have defined what is the true Religion, which you would have supported and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by Force; and have told us 'tis to be found in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and thirty nine Articles of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and it be agreed to you, that that is <hi>the only true Religion,</hi> your Argument (for Force as necessary to Mens Salvation) from the want of Light and Strength enough in the true Religion to prevail against Mens Lusts, and the Corruption of their Nature, will not hold; because your <hi>bringing</hi> Men by Force, your way applied, to the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be it what you will, is but bringing them to an outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the National Church. But the bringing them so far, and no farther, having no opposition to their Lusts, no Inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency with their corrupt Nature, is not on that account at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, nor does at all help, where only, on your grounds, you say, there is need of the Assistance of Force towards their Salvation.</p>

                  </gap>chlar Advantage, how easy it is for them to pretend Conviction, and to offer such Grounds (if that were required) as would become a Christian concerned for Religion, that is, what no Care of Man can certainly prevent.</hi> This is an admirable Justification of your Hypothesis. Men are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: To what end? To make them <hi>severely and impartially consider Matters of Religion,</hi> that they may be convinced, and thereupon sincerely imbrace the Truth. But what need of Force or Punishment for this? Because their Lusts and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will otherwise keep them both from <hi>considering as they ought,</hi> and imbracing the true Religion; and therefore they must lie under Penalties till they have <hi>considered as they ought,</hi> which is when they have upon Conviction imbraced. But how shall the Magistrate know when they upon Conviction <hi>imbrace,</hi> that he may then take off their Penalties? That indeed cannot be known, and ought not to be inquired after, because <hi>irreligious Persons who only seek their secular Advantage,</hi> or in other Words, all those who desire at their ease to retain their beloved Lusts
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49288:88"/>
and Corruptions, may <hi>easily pretend Conviction, and offer such Grounds (if it were required) as would become a Christian concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Religion: This is what no Care of Man can certainly prevent.</hi> Which is Reason enough, why no busy Forwardness in Man to disease his Brother should use Force upon Pretence of prevalling against Man's Corruptions, that hinder their considering and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Truth upon Conviction, when 'tis confessed, it cannot be known, whether they have <hi>considered,</hi> are <hi>convinced,</hi> or have really <hi>imbraced</hi> the true Religion or no? And thus you have shewn us your admirable Remedy, which is not it seems for the <hi>irreligious</hi> (for <hi>'tis easy,</hi> you say, <hi>for</hi> them <hi>to pretend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> and so avoid Punishment) but for those who would be religious without it.</p>
            <p>But here in this Case, as to the Intention of the Magistrate, how can it be said, that the Force he uses is designed by subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mens Corruptions, to make way for considering and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>th, when it is so applied, that it is confessed here, that a Man may get rid of the Penalties without parting with the Corruptions, they are pretended to be used against? But you have a ready Answer, <hi>This is what no Care of Man can certainly prevent;</hi> which is but in other Words to proclaim the Ridiculousness of your Use of Force, and to avow that your Method can do nothing. If by not <hi>certainly,</hi> you mean it may any way, or to any degree <hi>prevent,</hi> why is it not so done? If not, why is a Word that signifies nothing put in, unless it be for a Shelter on Occasion? A Benefit you know how to draw from this way of writing: But this here taken how you please, will only serve to lay Blame on the Magistrate, or your Hypothesis, chuse you whether. I for my part have a better Opinion of the Ability and Management of the Magistrate: What he aimed at in his Laws, that I believe he mentions in them, and as wise Men do in Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nes, fpoke out plainly what he had a Mind should be done. But <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>inly</hi> there cannot a more ridiculous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter be put on Law-makers, than to tell the World they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make Men <hi>consider, examine,</hi> &amp;c. but yet neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired nor named any thing in their Laws but Conformity. Though yet when Men are <hi>certainly</hi> to be punished for not really imbracing the true Religion, there ought to be <hi>certain</hi> Matters of Fact, whereby those that do, and those that do not so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Truth, should be distinguished; and for that you have, 'tis true, a clear and established Criterion, <hi>i. e.</hi> Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49288:89"/>
and Nonconformity: which do very certainly distinguish the Innocent from the Guilty; those that really and sincerely <hi>do imbrace the Truth that must save them,</hi> from those that do not.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, to resolve the Question, whether the Conviction of Mens Understandings, and the Salvation of their Souls, be the Business and Aim of those who use Force to bring Men into the Profession of the National Religion; I ask, whether if that were so, there could be so many as there are, not only in most Country-Parishes, but, I think I may say, may be found in all Parts of <hi>England,</hi> grosly ignorant in the Doctrines and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Christian Religion, if a strict Inquiry were made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it?

What is it? Let us hear it. Why, <hi>Dissenters must be punished.</hi> Can any body that hears you say so, believe you in earnest; and that want of Examination is the thing you would have amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when want of Examination is not the thing you would have punished? If want of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be the Fault, want of Examination must be punished; if you are, as you pretend, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied that Punishment is the proper and <hi>only Means</hi> to remedy it.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49288:91"/>
not, the World has reason to judg, that however want of Examination be a general Fault, which you with great Vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy have exaggerated; yet you use it only for a pretence to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Dissenters; and either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust your Remedy, that it will not cure this Evil, or else care not to have it generally cur'd. This evidently appears from your whole Management of the Argument.

And that you may not think I talk at random, when I say you dare not; I will, if you please, give you some Reasons for my saying so.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> Because if you propose that all should be punished, who are ignorant, who have not used <hi>such Consideration as is apt and proper to manifest the Truth;</hi> but <hi>have been determined in the choice</hi>
                           <pb n="179" facs="tcp:49288:92"/>
                           <hi>of their Religion by Impressions of Education, Admiration of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, worldly Respects, Prejudices, and the like incompetent Motives; and have taken up their Religion, without examining it as they ought;</hi> you will propose to have several of your own Church (be it what it will) punished; which would be a Proposition too apt to offend too many of it, for you to venture on. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever need there be of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every one will not thank you sor proposing such an one as must begin at (or at least reach to) the House of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because if you should propose that all those who are ignorant, careless, and negligent in examining, should be punished, you would have little to say in this Question of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration: For if the Laws of the State were made as they ought to be, equal to all the Subjects, without distinction of Men of different Professions in Religion; and the Faults to be amended by Punishments, were impartially punished in all who are guilty of them; this would immediately produce a perfect Toleration, or shew the Uselesness of Force in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Is therefore you think it so necessary, as you say, for the <hi>promoting of true Religion, and the Salvation of Souls, that Men should be punished to make them examine;</hi> do but sind a way to apply Force to all that have not <hi>throughly and impartially exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,</hi> and you have my Consent. For tho Force be not the proper means of promoting Religion; yet there is no better way to shew the Uselesness of it, than the applying it equally to Miscarriage, in whomsoever found, and not to distinct: Parties or Perswasions of Men, for the Reformation of them alone, when others are equally faulty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because without being sor as large a Toleration as the Author proposes, you cannot be truly and sincerely for a <hi>free and impartial Examination.</hi> For whoever examines, must have the Liberty to judg, and follow his Judgment; or else you
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49288:93"/>
put him upon Examination to no purpose. And whether that will not as well lead Men from, as to your Church, is so much a Venture, that by your way of Writing, 'tis evident enough you are loth to hazard it; and if you are of the National Church, 'tis plain your Brethren will not bear with you in the Allowance of such a Liberty. You must therefore either change your <hi>Method;</hi> and if the want of Examination be that great and dangerous Fault you would have corrected, you must equally punish all that are equally guilty of any Neglect in this Matter, and then take your <hi>only means,</hi> your beloved <hi>Force,</hi> and make the best of it; or else you must put off your Mask, and confess that you design not your Punishments to bring Men to <hi>Examination,</hi> but to <hi>Conformity.</hi> For the Fallacy you have used, is too gross to pass upon this Age.</p>

But then to let you see how little ground you have to say that I <hi>prevaricate</hi> in this matter, I shall only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to consider, what it is that the Author and my self were enquiring after: For it is not, What Course is to be taken to <hi>confirm</hi> and establish those in the Truth, who have already embraced it: nor, How they may be enabled to <hi>propagate</hi> it to others, (for both which Purposes I have already acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it very useful, and a thing much to be desired, that all such Persons should, as far as they are able, search into the Grounds upon which their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion stands, and challenges their Belief;) but the Subject of our Enquiry is only, What Method is to be used, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <hi>bring</hi> Men to the true Religion. Now if this be the only thing we were inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after, (as you cannot deny it to be) then every one sees that in speaking to this Point, I had nothing to do with any who have already imbraced the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; because they are not to be <hi>brought</hi> to that Religion, but only to be <hi>confirmed</hi> and <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> in it; but was only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how those who <hi>reject</hi> it,<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49288:91"/> may be brought to imbrace it. So that how much soever any of those who own the true Religion, may be guilty of neglect of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; 'tis evident, I was only concerned to shew how it may be <hi>cured</hi> in those, who by reason of it, reject the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, duly proposed or tender'd to them. And certainly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my self to this, is not to <hi>prevaricate,</hi> unless to keep within the Bounds which the Question under debate prescribes me, be to prevaricate.</p>
                        <p>In telling me therefore that I <hi>dare not say that the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the Careless, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate, the Negligent in examining,</hi> &amp;c. (i. e. <hi>all</hi> that are such) <hi>are to be punished,</hi> you only tell me that I <hi>dare</hi> not be impertinent. And therefore I hope you will excuse me, if I take no notice of the three <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> you offer in your next Page for your saying so. And yet if I had had a mind to talk im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently, I know not why I might not have <hi>dared</hi> to do so, as well as other Men.</p>
                        <p>There is one thing more in this Paragraph, which though nothing more pertinent than the rest, I shall not wholly pass over. It lies in these Words; <hi>He that reads your Treatise with At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, will be more confirm'd<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49288:92"/> in this Opinion,</hi> (viz. That I use want of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only for a Pretence to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Dissenters, <hi>&amp;c.) when he shall find that you (who are so earnest to have Men pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, to bring them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and examine, that so they may discover the Way of Salvation) have not said one Word of considering, searching, and hearkning to the Scripture; which had been as good a Rule for a Christian to have sent them to, as to Reasons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proper to convince them, of you know not what, &amp;c.</hi> How this <hi>confirms</hi> that <hi>Opinion,</hi> I do not see; nor have you thought fit to instruct me. But as to the thing it self, <hi>viz.</hi> my <hi>not saying one Word of considering, searching, and hearkning to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> whatever Advantage a captious Adversary may imagine he has in it, I hope it will not seem strange to any indifferent and judicious Person, who shall but consider that throughout my Treatise I speak of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion only in <hi>general,</hi> i. e. not as limited to any particular Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, or to the Times of the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> but as reaching from the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to the End of the World, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Times which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded the Scriptures; wherein<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49288:92"/> yet God <hi>left not himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Witness,</hi> but furnished Mankind with sufficient Means of knowing Him and his Will, in order to their eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For I appeal to all Men of Art, whether, speaking of the True Religion under this Generality, I could be allowed to descend to any such <hi>Rules</hi> of it, as belong only to some particular Times, or Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations; such as you cannot but acknowledg the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testaments</hi> to be.</p>

            <p>In this your Answer you say, <hi>the Subject of our Inquiry is only what Method is to be used to bring Men to the true Religion.</hi> He that reads what you say, again and again, That the <hi>Magistrate</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 76, 77, 78.</note> is impower'd and <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>procure as much as in him lies,</hi> i. e. <hi>as far as by Penalties it can be procured that NO MAN neglect his Soul,</hi> and shall remember how many Pages you imploy, <hi>A.</hi> p 6, &amp;c. And here <hi>p.</hi> 6, &amp;c. to shew that it is the Corruption of humane Nature which hinders Men from doing what they may and ought for the Salvation of their Souls, and that therefore Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, no other means being left, and Force were necessary to be used by the Magistrate to remove these great Obstacles of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>sts</hi> and <hi>Corruptions,</hi> that <hi>none of his Subjects might remain ignorant of the way of Salvation, or refuse to imbrace it.</hi> One would think your <hi>Inquiry</hi> had been after the means of <hi>CVRING MENS A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to the true Religion,</hi> (which you tell us, <hi>p.</hi> 53. <hi>if not cured, is certainly destructive of Mens Eternal Salvation</hi>) that so they might heartily imbrace it for their <hi>Salvation.</hi> But here you tell us, <hi>your Inquiry is only what Method is to be used to bring Men to the true Religion:</hi> whereby you evidently mean nothing but outward Conformity to that which you think the true Church, as appears by the next following Words; <hi>Now if this be the only thing we were inquiring after, then every one sees that in speaking to this Point, I had nothing to do with any who have already imbraced the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> And also every one sees that since amongst those with whom (having <hi>already imbraced the true Religion) you</hi> and your
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49288:93"/>
Penalties <hi>have nothing to do;</hi> there are those who have not <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and examined Matters of Religion as they ought,</hi> whose Lusts and corrupt Natures keep them as far alienated from believing, and as averse to a real obeying the Truth that must save them, as any other Men; it is manifest that <hi>imbracing the true Religion in your Sense</hi> is only imbracing the outward Profession of it, which is nothing but outward Conformity. And that being the furthest you would have your Penalties pursue Men, and there leave them with as much of their Ignorance of the Truth, and Carelesness of their Souls as they please, who can deny but that it would be <hi>impertinent</hi> in you to consider how want of <hi>impartial Examination,</hi> or <hi>Aversion</hi> to the true Religion should in them be cured? because they are none of those Subjects of the Commonwealth, whose <hi>spiritual and eternal Interests</hi> are by politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government to be <hi>procured or advanced,</hi> none of those Subjects whose <hi>Salvation</hi> the Magistrate is to <hi>take Care</hi> of.</p>
            <p>And therefore I <hi>excuse</hi> you, as you desire, <hi>for not taking notice of my three Reasons;</hi> but whether the Reader will do so or no, is more than I can undertake. I hope you too will excuse me for having used so harsh a Word as <hi>prevaricate,</hi> and impute it to my want of Skill in the English Tongue. But when I find a Man pretend to a great Concern for the Salvation of Mens Souls, and make it one of the great <hi>Ends</hi> of Civil Government, that the Magistrate should make use of Force to bring all his Subjects to <hi>consider, study</hi> and <hi>examine, believe</hi> and <hi>imbrace the Truth that must save them:</hi> when I shall have to do with a Man, who to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose hath writ two Books to find out and desend the proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for that general Backwardness and Aversion (which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved humane Nature keeps Men in) to an impartial Search after, and hearty imbracing the true Religion; and who talks of nothing less than Obligations on Soveraigns, both from their particular Duty, as well as from common Charity, to take Care that none of their Subjects should want the Assistance of this only means left for their Salvation; nay, who has made it so necessary to Mens Salvation, that he talks as if the Wisdom and Goodness of God would be brought in Question, if those who needed it should be destitute of it; and yet notwithstanding all this Shew of Concern for Mens Salvation, contrives the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this sole Remedy so, that a great many who lie under the Disease, should be out of the Reach and Benefit of his
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49288:94"/>
Cure, and never have this only Remedy applied to them: When this I say is so manifestly in his Thoughts all the while, that he is forced to confess <hi>that though Want or Neglect of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be a general Fault, yet the Method</hi> he <hi>proposes for curing it does not reach to all that are guilty of it;</hi> but frankly owns, that he was not <hi>concerned to shew</hi> how the Neglect of Examination might <hi>be cured</hi> in those who conform, but <hi>only in those who by reason of it reject the true Religion duly proposed to them:</hi> which rejecting the true Religion will require <hi>a Man of Art</hi> to shew to be here any thing but Nonconformity to the National Religion. When, I say, I meet with a Man another time that does this, who is so much a <hi>Man of Art,</hi> as to talk of all, and mean but some; talk of <hi>hearty imbracing the true Religion,</hi> and mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Conformity to the National; pretend one thing, and mean another; if you please to tell me what Name I shall give it, I shall not fail: for who knows how soon again I may have an occasion sor it.</p>
            <p>If I would punish Men for Nonconformity without owning of it, I could not use a better Pretence than to say it was to make them hearken <hi>to Reasons and Arguments proper to convince them,</hi> or to make them submit <hi>to the Instruction and Government of the proper Ministers of Religion,</hi> without any thing else, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing still at the bottom the <hi>Arguments</hi> for, and the <hi>Ministers</hi> of my Religion to be these, that till they outwardly complied with, they were to be punished. But if (instead of outward Conformity to my Religion covered under these indesinite terms) I should tell them, they were to examine the Scripture, which was the sixed Rule for them and me, not examining could not give me a Pretence to punish them, unless I would also pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Conformists as ignorant and unversed in the Scripture as they, which would not do my Business.</p>
            <p>But what need I use Arguments to shew, that your punishing to make Men examine is designed only against Dissenters, when in your Answer to this very Paragraph of mine, you in plain Words <hi>acknowledg, that though want of Examination be a general</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 68.</note> 
               <hi>Fault, yet the Method you propose for curing does not reach to all that are guilty of it?</hi> To which if you please to add what you tell us, That when <hi>Dissenters conform,</hi> the Magistrate cannot know, <note place="margin">P. 22.</note> and therefore never examins whether they do it <hi>upon Reason and Conviction</hi> or no, though it be certain that upon conforming,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49288:94"/>
Penalties, the necessary Means, cease, it will be obvious, that whatever be talked, Conformity is all that is aimed at, and that want of Examination is but the Pretence to punish Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters.</p>
            <p>And this I told you, any one must be convinced of, who <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 62.</note> observes that you (who are so earnest to have Men punished to bring them <hi>to consider and examine</hi> that so they may <hi>discover the way of Salvation</hi>) have not said one Word of considering, searching, and hearkning to the Scripture, which, you were told, was as good a Rule for a Christian to have sent Men to, as to <hi>the Instruction and Government of the proper Ministers of Religion,</hi> or to the <hi>Information of those who tell them they have mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken 'their way, and offer to shew them the right.</hi> For this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And then you <hi>appeal to all Men of Art, whether speaking of the true Religion under this Generality, you could be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to descend to any such Rules of it as belong only to some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Times or Dispensations, such as</hi> I <hi>cannot but acknowledg the Old and New Testaments to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author that you write against, making it his Business (as no body can doubt who reads but the first Page of his Letter) to shew that it is the Duty of Christians to tolerate both Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and others who differ from them in Religion, 'tis pretty strange (in asserting against him that the Magistrate might and ought to use Force to bring Men to the <hi>true Religion</hi>) you should mean any other Magistrate than the Christian Magistrate; or any other <hi>Religion</hi> than the Christian <hi>Religion.</hi> But it seems you took so little notice of the Design of your Adversary, which was to prove, that Christians were not to use Force to bring any one to the true Christian Religion; that you would prove, that Christians now were to use Force, not only to bring Men to the Christian, but also to the Jewish Religion; or that of the true Church before the Law, or to some <hi>true Religion</hi> so <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> that it is none of these. <hi>For,</hi> say you, <hi>throughout your Treatise you speak of the true Religion only in general,</hi> i. e. <hi>not as limited to any particular Dispensation:</hi> Though one that were <hi>not a Man of Art</hi> would suspect you to be of another Mind your self, when you told <note place="margin">P. 3.</note>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:49288:95"/>
us, the shuting out of the Jews from the Rights of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <hi>is a just and necessary Caution in a Christian Commonwealth;</hi> which you say to justify your Exception in the beginning of your <hi>A—</hi> against the Largeness of the Author's Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who would not have Jews excluded. But <hi>speak of the true Religion only in general</hi> as much as you please, if your <hi>true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> be that by which Men must be saved, can you send a Man to any better Guide to that <hi>true Religion</hi> now than the Scripture?</p>
            <p>If when you were in your Altitudes, writing the first Book, <hi>your Men of Art could</hi> not <hi>allow</hi> you to <hi>descend to any such Rule</hi> as the Scripture, (though even there you acknowledg the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 13.</note> spoken against, are such as are used to make Men Christians) because there (by an <hi>Art</hi> proper to your self) you were to <hi>speak of true Religion under a Generality,</hi> which had nothing to do with the Duty of Christians, in reference to Toleration. Yet when here in your second Book, where you condescend all along to speak of the <hi>CHRISTIAN RELIGION,</hi> and tell us, that the <hi>Magistrates have Authority to make Laws for promoting the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian RELIGION,</hi> and do by <hi>their Laws design to contribute what in them lies to make Men good CHRISTIANS;</hi> and complain of Toleration as the very Bane of <hi>the Life and Spirit of CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANITY,</hi> &amp;c. and have vouchsafed particularly to mention the <hi>Gospel;</hi> why here, having been call'd upon for it, you could not send Men to the Scriptures, and tell them directly, that those they were to <hi>study</hi> diligently, those they were <hi>impartially and carefully to examine,</hi> to bring them to the true Religion, and into the way of Salvation; rather than talk to them as you do, of <hi>receiving Instruction,</hi> and <hi>considering Reasons and Arguments proper and sufficient to convince them;</hi> rather than propose, as you do all along, such Objects of Examination and Enquiry in general terms, as are as hard to be found, as the thing it self, for which they are to be examined: Why I say you have here again avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sending Men to examine the Scriptures, is just matter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. And for this you must apply your self again to your <hi>Men of Art,</hi> to furnish you with some other Reason.</p>
            <p>If you will but cast your Eyes back to your next Page, you will there find that you build upon this, that <hi>the Subject of</hi> your and the Author's I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49288:95"/>
because you speak of the true Religion <hi>in general,</hi> i. e. <hi>not as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to any particular Dispensation, or to the times of the Scriptures,</hi> must allow, that you deserve to be Head of their Colledg; since you are so strict an Observer of their Rules, that though your Inquiry be, <hi>What Method is to be used to bring Men to the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> (now under the particular <hi>Dispensation</hi> of the Gospel, and <hi>under Scripture-times</hi>) you think it an unpardonable Fault to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede so far from your <hi>Generality,</hi> as to admit the Study and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the Scripture into your Method; for fear, 'tis like, your Method would be too <hi>particular,</hi> if it would not now serve to bring Men to the true Religion, who lived before the Flood. But had you had as good a Memory, as is generally thought needful to a <hi>Man of Art,</hi> it is believed you would have spared this Reason, for your being so backward in putting Men upon Examination of the Scripture. And any one, but <hi>a Man of Art,</hi> who shall read what you tell us the Magistrate's Duty is; and <note place="margin">P. 31.</note> will but consider how convenient it would be, that Men should receive no Instruction but from the <hi>Ministry,</hi> that you there tell us <hi>the Magistrate assists;</hi> examine no <hi>Arguments,</hi> hear nothing of the Gospel, receive no other Sense of the Scripture, but what that <hi>Ministry</hi> proposes; who if they had but the coactive Power, (you think them as capable of as other Men) might <hi>assist</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; He, I say, who reflects but on these things, may perhaps find a Reason that may better satisfy the Ignorant and Unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who have not had the good luck to arrive at being of the Number of these <hi>Men of Art,</hi> why you cannot descend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to Men the studying of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Let me for once suppose you in holy Orders, (for we that are not of the <hi>Adepti,</hi> may be allow'd to be ignorant of the Punctilio's in Writing observed by <hi>the Men of Art:</hi>) And let me then ask what <hi>Art</hi> is this, whose Rules are of that Authority; that One, who has received Commission from Heaven to preach the Gospel in Season and out of Season, for the Salvation of Souls, may not allow himself to propose the <hi>reading, studying, examining</hi> of the Scripture, which has for at least these sixteen hundred Years contained the only <hi>true Religion</hi> in the World; for fear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Proposal should offend against the Rules of this <hi>Art</hi> by being too <hi>particular</hi> and consined to the <hi>Gospel-Dispensation;</hi> And therefore could not pass muster, nor find Admittance, in a Treatise wherein the Author professes it his only Business to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:49288:96"/>
               <hi>what Method is to be used to bring Men to the true Religion?</hi> Do you expect any other <hi>Dispensation;</hi> that you are so afraid of being too particular, if you should recommend the Use and Study of the Scripture, to bring Men to the true Religion now in the times of the Gospel? Why might you not as well send them to the Scriptures, as to the <hi>Ministers and Teachers of the true Religion?</hi> Have those Ministers any other Religion to teach, than what is contained in the Scriptures? But perhaps you do this out of Kindness and Care, because possibly the Scriptures could not be found; but who were the <hi>Ministers of the true Religion,</hi> Men could not possibly miss. Indeed you have <hi>allowed</hi> your self to <hi>descend to what belongs only to some particular Times and Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> for their sakes, when you speak of the <hi>Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</hi> But whether it be as fully agreed on amongst Christians, who are the <hi>Ministers of the Gospel</hi> that Men must hearken to, and be guided by; as which are the Writings of the Apostles and Evangelists, that (if studied) will instruct them in the way to Heaven; is more than you or your <hi>Men of Art</hi> can be positive in. Where are the Canons of this over-ruling <hi>Art</hi> to be found, to which you pay such Reverence? May a Man of no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Character be admitted to the Privilege of them? For I see it may be of notable Use at a dead-lift, and bring a Man off with flying Colours, when Truth and Reason can do him but little Service. The strong Guard you have in the Powers you write for; And when you have engaged a little too far, the safe Retreat you have always at hand in an Appeal to these <hi>Men of Art,</hi> made me almost at a stand, whether I were not best make a Truce with one who had such Auxiliaries. A Friend of mine finding me talk thus, replied briskly; 'tis a Matter of Religion, which requires not <hi>Men of Art;</hi> and the Assistance of such <hi>Art</hi> as savours so little of the Simplicity of the Gospel, both shews and makes the Cause the weaker. And so I went on to your two next Paragraphs.</p>
            <p>In them, to vindicate a pretty strange Argument for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate's Use of Force, you think it convenient to repeat it out of your <hi>A.</hi> p. 26. And so, in Compliance with you, shall I do here again. There you tell us, <hi>The Power you ascribe to the Magistrate is given him to bring Men, not to his</hi> own, <hi>but to the</hi> true <hi>Religion: And though (as our Author puts us in mind) the Religion of every Prince is Orthodox to himself; yet if this Power keep within its bounds,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49288:96"/>
it can serve the Interest of no other Religion but the true, among such as have any Concern for their Eternal Salvation; (and those that have none, deserve not to be considered) because the Penalties it inables him that has it to instict, are not such as may tempt such Persons either to renounce a Religion which they believe to be true, or to profess one which they do not believe to be so; but only such as are apt to put them upon a serious and impartial Examination of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy between the Magistrate and them, which is the way for them to come to the Knowledg of the Truth. And if, upon such Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Matter, they chance to sind that the Truth does not lie on the Magistrate's side, they have gained thus much however, even by the Magistrate's misapplying his Power, that they know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they did before, where the Truth doth lie: And all the hurt that comes to them by it, is only the suffering some tolerable Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences for their following the Light of their own Reason, and the Dictates of their own Consciences; which, certainly, is no such Mischief to Mankind as to make it more eligible that there should be no such Power vested in the Magistrate, but the Care of every Man's Soul should be left to himself alone, (as this Author demands it should be.)</hi>

            <p>To this I tell you,<q>That here, out of abundant Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 64.</note> when Dissenters have their Heads (without any cause) broken, you provide them a Plaister. For, say you, <hi>if upon such Examination of the Matter</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> brought to it by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate's Punishment) <hi>they chance to find that the Truth doth not lie on the Magistrate's side; they have gain'd thus much how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, even by the Magistrate's misapplying his Power, that they know better than they did before, where the Truth does lie.</hi> Which is as true as if you should say; Upon Examination I find such an one is out of the way to <hi>York,</hi> therefore I know better than I did before that I am in the right. For neither of you may be in the right. This were true indeed, if there were but two ways in all, a Right and a Wrong.</q> To this you reply here; That <hi>whoever shall consider the Penalties,</hi> will, you <hi>perswade</hi> your <hi>self, find no Heads</hi> broken, and so but little need of a Plaister. <hi>The Penalties,</hi> as you say, <hi>are to be such</hi> as will <hi>not tempt such as have any concern for their Eternal Salvation, either to renounce a Religion which they believe to be true, or profess one which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not to be so, but only such as</hi> (being weigh'd in Gold-Scales) are just enough, or as you express it, <hi>are apt to put them upon a</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:49288:97"/>
               <hi>serious and impartial Examination of the Controversy between the Magistrate and them.</hi> If you had been pleased to have told us what Penalties those were, we might have been able to guess whether there would have been <hi>broken Heads</hi> or no. But since you have not vouchsafed to do it, and if I mistake not, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>appeal to your Men of Art</hi> for another Dispensation ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ever do it; I fear no body can be sure these Penalties will not reach to something worse than a <hi>broken Head:</hi> Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Magistrate shall observe that you impute the Rise <note place="margin">P. 7.</note> and Growth of <hi>salse Religions</hi> (which it is the Magistrate's Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to hinder) to the <hi>Pravity of humane Nature, unbridled by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> which, by what follows, he may have reason to think <note place="margin">P. 8.</note> is to use Force sufficient to counterballance the <hi>Folly, Perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Wickedness</hi> of Men: And whether then he may not lay on Penalties sufficient, if not to <hi>break</hi> Mens <hi>Heads,</hi> yet to ruin them in their Estates and Liberties, will be more than you can undertake. And since you acknowledg here, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate may err so far in the Use of this his Power, as to mistake the Persons that he lays his Penalties on; will you be Security that he shall not also mistake in the Proportion of them, and lay on such as Men would willingly exchange for a broken Head? All the Assurance you give us of this, is; <hi>If this Power keep within its bounds; i. e.</hi> as you here explain it, <hi>If the Penalties the Magistrate makes use of to promote a false Religion, do not exceed the Measure of those which he may warrantably use for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the True.</hi> The Magistrate may notwithstanding any thing you have said, or can say, use any sort of Penalties, any degree of Punishment; you having neither shew'd the Measure of them, nor will be ever able to shew the utmost Measure which may not be exceeded, if any may be used.</p>
            <p>But what is this I find here? <hi>If the Penalties the Magistrate makes use of to promote a FALSE RELIGION.</hi> Is it possible that the Magistrate can make use of Penalties to promote a <hi>false Religion;</hi> Of whom you told us but three Pages back, That <hi>it may always be said of him, (what St.</hi> Paul <hi>said of himself) that he can do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth?</hi> By that one would have thought you had undertaken to us, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate could no more use Force to promote a <hi>false Religion,</hi> than St. <hi>Paul</hi> could preach to promote a <hi>false Religion.</hi> If you say, the Magistrate has no Commission to promote a false Religion,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49288:97"/>
and therefore <hi>it may always be said of him, what St.</hi> Paul <hi>said of himself</hi> &amp;c. I say, no Minister was ever commissioned to preach Falshood; and therefore <hi>it may always be said of every Minister, (what St.</hi> Paul <hi>said of himself) that he can do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth:</hi> Whereby we shall very commodiously have an infallible Guide in every Parish, as well as one in every Commonwealth. But if you thus use Scripture, I imagine you will have reason to appeal again to your <hi>Men of Art;</hi> whether, though you may not be allowed to recommend to others the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination and Use of Scripture, to find the true Religion, yet you your self may not use the Scripture to what Purpose, and in what Sense you please, for the defence of your Cause.</p>
            <p>To the remainder of what I said in that Paragraph, your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is nothing but an Exception to an Inference I made. The Argument you were upon, was to justify the Magistrate's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Penalties to bring Men to a false Religion, by the Gain those that suffered them would receive.</p>
            <p>Their Gain was this; That <hi>they would know better than they did</hi> 
               <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 64.</note> 
               <hi>before, where the Truth does lie.</hi> To which I replied,<q>Which is as true, as if you should say, upon Examination I find such an one is out of the Way to <hi>York;</hi> therefore I know better than I did before, that I am in the right.</q> This Consequence you find fault with, and say it should be thus; <hi>Therefore I know better than I did before, where the right Way lies.</hi> This, you tell me, <hi>would have been true; which was not for</hi> my <hi>Purpose.</hi> These Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, one or t'other, are much-what alike <hi>true.</hi> For he that of an hundred Ways, amongst which there is but one right, shuts out one that he discovers certainly to be wrong, knows as much better than he did before, that he is in the right, as he knows better than before, <hi>where the right Way lies.</hi> For before 'twas 99 to one he was not in the right; and now he knows 'tis but 98 to one that he is not in the right; and therefore knows so much better than before, that he is in the right, just as much as he knows better than he did before, <hi>where the right Way lies.</hi> For let him, upon your Supposition, proceed on; and every Day, upon examination of a Controversy with some one in one of the remaining Ways, discover him to be in the wrong; he will every Day know better than he did before, equally, <hi>where the right Way lies,</hi> and that he is in it; till at last he will come to discover the right Way it self, and himself in it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49288:98"/>
your Inference, whatever you think, is as much as the other for my Purpose; which was to shew what a notable <hi>Gain</hi> a Man made in the variety of false Opinions and Religions in the World, by discovering that the Magistrate had not the Truth <hi>on his side;</hi> and what Thanks he owed the Magistrate, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slicting Penalties upon him so much for his Improvement, and for affording him so much Knowledg at so cheap a rate. And should not a Man have reason to boast of his Purchase, if he should by Penalties be driven to hear and examine all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can be proposed by those in Power for all their foolish and false Religions? And yet this <hi>Gain</hi> is what you propose, as a Justification of Magistrates inslicting Penalties for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their false Religions. And <hi>an impartial Examination of the Controversy between them and the Magistrate,</hi> you tell us here, <hi>is the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 70.</note> 
               <hi>way for such as have any concern for their eternal Salvation, to come to the knowledg of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To my saying, `He that is punished may have examined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ` and then I am sure he <hi>gains</hi> nothing: You reply, <hi>But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does he lose much, if it be true, which you there add, that all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 71.</note> 
               <hi>the Hurt that befalls him, is only the suffering some tolerable Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience for his following the Light of his own Reason, and the Dictates of his Conscience.</hi> So it is therefore you would have a Man rewarded for being an honest Man; (for so is he who <hi>follows the Light of his own Reason, and the Dictates of his Conscience;) only with the suffering some tolerable Inconveniences.</hi> And yet those <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Inconveniences</hi> are such as are to counterballance Mens <hi>Lusts,</hi> and <hi>the Corruption of depraved Nature;</hi> which you know any slight Penalty is sufficient to master. But that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate's Discipline shall stop at those your tolerable Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is what you are loth to be Guarantee for: For all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity you dare give of it, is, <hi>If it be true which you there add.</hi> But if it should be otherwise, the Hurt may be more I see than you are willing to answer for.</p>

            <p>Here your <hi>Men of Art</hi> will do well to be at hand again. For it may be seasonable for you to appeal to them, whether the nature of your Discourse will allow you to <hi>descend</hi> to shew ` the Magistrate the bounds of his Authority, and warn him of ` the Injury he does, if he misapplies his Power.</p>
            <p>You say, <hi>the Question there debated, is, Whether the Magistrate has any Right or Authority to use Force for promoting the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; which plainly supposes the Vnlawfulness and Injustice of using Force to promote a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Religion, as granted on both sides.</hi> Neither is that the Question in debate; nor if it were, does it suppose what you pretend. But the Question in debate is, as you put it, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any body <hi>has a Right to use Force in Matters of Religion?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 78.</note> You say indeed, <hi>The Magistrate has, to bring Men to the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> If thereupon, you think the Magistrate has none to bring Men to a false Religion, whatever your <hi>Men of Art</hi> may think, 'tis probable other Men would not have thought it to have been besides the nature of your Discourse, to have warn'd the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, that he should consider well, and impartially examine the Grounds of his Religion before he use any Force to bring Men to it. This is of such moment to Mens temporal and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Interests,</hi> that it might well deserve some particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> addressed to the Magistrate; who might as much need to be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49288:99"/>
put in mind of <hi>impartial Examination</hi> as other People. And it might, whatever your <hi>Men of Art</hi> may allow, be justly expected from you; who think it no Derivation from the Rules <hi>of Art,</hi> to tell the Subjects that they must submit to the Penalties laid on them, or else <hi>fall under the Sword</hi> of the Magistrate; which how true soever, will hardly by any body be sound to be much more to your purpose in this Discourse, than it would have been to have told the Magistrate of what ill consequence it would be to him and his People, if he misused his Power, and warn'd him to be cautious in the Use of it. But not a word that way. Nay even where you mention the account he shall give for so doing, it is still to satisfy the Subjects that they are well provided for, and not left unfurnish'd of the Means of Salvation, by the right God has put into the Magistrate's hands to use his Power to bring them to the True Religion; and therefore, they ought to be well content, because if the Magistrate misapply it, the <hi>Great Judg</hi> will punish him for it. Look, Sir, and see whether what you say, any where, of the Magistrate's misuse of his Power, have any other Tendency: And then I appeal to the sober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether if you had been as much concern'd for the Bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as for the Exercise of Force in the Magistrates hands, you would not have spoke of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> another manner.</p>
            <p>The next thing you say, is, that <hi>the Question (being, Whether the Magistrate has any Right to use Force to bring Men to the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,) supposes the Vnlawfulness of using Force to promote a False Religion as granted on both sides;</hi> which is so far from true, that I suppose quite the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Magistrate has a Right to use Force to promote the True, he must have a Right to use Force to promote his own Religion; and that for Reasons I have given you elsewhere. But the Supposition of a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition serves to excuse you from speaking any thing directly of setting Bounds to the Magistrate's Power, or telling him his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that point; though you are very frequent in mentioning the Obligation he is under, that Men should not want the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of his Force; and how answerable he is, if any body miscarry for want of it; though there be not the least Whisper of any care to be taken, that no body be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by it. And now I recollect my self; I think your Method would not allow it: For if you should have put the Magistrate upon Examining, it would have suppos'd him as liable to Error as other Men;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49288:100"/>
whereas, to secure the Magistrate's acting right, upon your Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of never using Force but for the True Religion, I see no help for it, but either he or you (who are to licence him) must be got past the State of Examination, into that of certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Infallibility.</p>
            <p>Indeed, as you say, you <hi>tell the Magistrate that the Power you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to him in reference to Religion, is given him to bring Men not to his own, but to the True Religion.</hi> But do you put him upon a <hi>severe and impartial Examination;</hi> Which, amongst the many False, is the one only True Religion he must use Force to bring his Subjects to; that he may not mistake and misapply his Power in a Business of that Consequence? Not a Syllable of this. Do you then tell him which it is he must take, without Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and promote with Force; whether that of <hi>England, France</hi> or <hi>Denmark?</hi> This, methinks, is as much as the Pope, with all his Infallibility, could require of Princes. And yet, what is it less than this you do; when you suppose the Religion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be the only True; and upon this your Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tell the Magistrate it is his Duty, by Force, to bring Men to it; without ever putting him upon Examining, or suffering him or any body else to question, whether it be the only True Religion or no? For if you will stick to what you in another place say, <hi>That</hi> it is <hi>enough to suppose that there is one True Religion, and but one, and that that Religion may be known by those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it;</hi> What Authority will this Knowableness of the True Religion, give to the King of <hi>England</hi> more than to the King of <hi>France,</hi> to <hi>use Force,</hi> if he does not actually know the Religion he professes to be the True; or to the Magistrate more than the Subject, if he has not examin'd the Grounds of his Religion? But if He believes you when you tell him, your Religion is the True, all is well; he has Authority enough to use Force, and he need not examine any farther. If this were not the case; why you should not be careful to prepare a little Advice to make the Magistrate examine, as well as you are sollicitous to provide Force to make the Subject examine, will require the Skill of a <hi>Man of Art</hi> to discover.</p>
            <p>Whether you are not of the Number of those Men I there mention'd, (for that there have been such Men in the World, Instances might be given) one may doubt srom your Principles. For if upon a Supposition that yours is the True Religion, you

               </gap> Penalties on all his Subjects that dissent from the Communion of the National Church, without examining whether theirs too may not be that only True Religion which is necessary to Salvation; Is not this to demand, that the Magistrate's Power should be applied only <hi>in favour of a Party?</hi> And can any one avoid being confirm'd in this Suspicion, when he reads that broad Insinuation of yours, <hi>P.</hi> 34. as if Our Magistrates were not concern'd <hi>for Truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Piety,</hi> because they granted a <hi>Relaxation</hi> of those Penalties, which you would have imploid in favour of your <hi>Party:</hi> For so it must be call'd, and not the Church of God, exclusive of others; unless you will say Men cannot be saved out of the Communion of your particular Church, let it be National where you please.</p>
            <p>You do not, you say, encourage the Magistrate to misapply his Power; because <hi>in the very same Breath you tell him he misapplies his Power.</hi> I answer, Let <hi>all Men understand you,</hi> as much as you please, to say that <hi>he sins in doing it;</hi> That will not excuse you from encouraging him there; unless it be impossible that a Man may be encourag'd to Sin. If your telling the Magistrate that his Subjects <hi>gain</hi> by his <hi>misapplying of Force,</hi> be not an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him to misapply it, the doing good to others must cease to be an Encouragement to any Action. And whether it be not a great Encouragement in this case to the Magistrate, to go on in the use of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, without impartially examining whether his or his Subjects be the True Religion; when he is told that (be his Religion true or false,) his Subjects, who suffer, will be sure to be Gainers by it, let any one judg. For the Encouragement is not (as you put it) to the Magistrate to use Force to bring Men to what he thinks a false Religion; but it is an Encouragement to the Magistrate, who presumes his to be the True Religion, to punish his Dissenting Subjects; without due and impartial Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination on which side the Truth lies. For having never told the Magistrate, that neglect of Examination is a <hi>Sin</hi> in him; if you should tell him a thousand times, that he who uses his Power to bring Men to a False Religion misapplies it; he would not understand by it that he sinn'd, whilst he thought his the True; and so it would be no restraint to the <hi>misapplying</hi> his Power.</p>
            <p>And thus we have some Prospect of this admirable Machin you have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Magistrate is to use Force to bring Men to the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But what if he misapplies it to bring Men to a False Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? 'Tis well still for his Subjects: They are Gainers by it. But this may encourage him to a Misapplication of it. No; You <hi>tell him</hi> that he that uses it <hi>to bring Men</hi> to a False Religion, <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applies it;</hi> And therefore he cannot but understand that you say <hi>he sins, and lays himself open to Divine Vengeance.</hi> No; He believes himself in the right; and thinks as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whilst a Persecutor, that he does God good Service. And you assure him here, he makes his suffering. Subjects Gainers; and so he goes on as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did. Is there no Remedy for this? Yes, a very ready one, and that is, that the <hi>one only True Religion may be known by those who profess it to be the only True Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which, if we add how you moderate as well as direct the Magistrate's Hand in punishing; by making the last Regulation of your <hi>convenient Penalties</hi> to lie in the <hi>Prudence and Experience</hi> of Magistrates themselves; we shall find the Advantages of your Method. For are not your necessary Means of Salvation, which lie in moderate Penalties used to bring Men to the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, brought to an happy State; when that which is to guide the Magistrate in the Knowledg of the True Religion, is, that <hi>the True Religion may be known by those who profess it to be the only True Religion;</hi> and the convenient Penalties to be used for the promoting of it, are such as the Magistrate shall in his <hi>Prudence</hi> think fit; and that whether the Magistrate applies it right or wrong, the Subject will be a Gainer by it? If in either of your Discourses, you have given the Magistrate any better Direction than this to know the True Religion by, which he is by Force to promote; or any other intelligible Measure to moderate his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties by; or any other Caution to restrain the misuse of his Power; I desire you to shew it me: And then I shall think I have reason to believe, that in this Debate you have had more Care of the True Religion, and the Salvation of Souls, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Magistrate to use the Power he has, by your Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without Examination, and to what degree he shall think sit, in favour of a Party. For the Matter thus stated, if I mistake not, will serve any Magistrate, to use any degree of Force, against any that dissent from his National Religion.</p>
            <p>Having recommended to the Subjects the Magistrate's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

well to bring in the Example of <hi>Julian;</hi> who whatever he did to the Christians, would (no more than you) own that it was Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but for their Advantage in the other World.

This seems reasonable; That his <hi>talk of Philanthropy,</hi> and yours of Moderation, should be bound up together. For till you speak and tell them plainly what they may trust to; the Advantage the Persecuted are to receive from your Clemency, may, I imagine, make a second Part to what the Christians of that Age <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <head>CHAP. IX. Of the Vsefulness of Force in Matters of Religion.</head>
            <p>YOU having granted that in all Pleas for any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> of its Usefulness, it is not enough to say that it may be serviceable; but it must be considered, not only what it may, but what it is likely to produce; and the greater Good or Harm likely to come from it ought to determine the use of it; I think there need nothing more to be said to shew the Useles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Force in the Magistrate's Hands for promoting the true Religion, after it has been proved that, if any, then all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, who believe their Religion to be true, are under an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to use it. But since the usefulness and necessity of Force is the main Foundation on which you build your Hypothesis, we will in the two remaining Chapters examine particularly what you say for them.</p>
            <p>To the Author's saying, <q>That Truth seldom hath received, and he fears never will receive much assistance from the Power of Great Men, to whom she is but rarely known, and more rarely welcome,</q> You answer, <hi>And yet God himself foretold and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> 
               <hi>promised that Kings should be Nursing Fathers, and Queens Nursing Mothers to his Church.</hi> If we may judg of this Prophecy by what
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49288:102"/>
is past or present, we shall have reason to think it concerns not our Days; or if it does, that God intended not that the Church should have many such Nursing Fathers and Nursing Mothers, that were to nurse them up with moderate Penalties, if those were to be the Swadling-Clouts of this Nursery. Perhaps, if you read that Chapter, you will think you have little reason to build much on this Promise, till the restoring of <hi>Israel:</hi> And when you see the Gentiles bring <hi>Thy</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>

               </gap> the stile of the Chapter seems to import the Sons of the <hi>Israelites) Sons in their Arms, and thy Daughters be carried upon their Shoulders,</hi> as is promised in the immediately preceding Words; you may conclude that then <hi>Kings shall be thy,</hi> (i. e. <hi>Israels) Nursing Fathers, and Queens thy Nursing Mothers.</hi> This seems to me to be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> by that Prophecy, and I guess to a great many others, upon an attentive reading that Chapter in <hi>Isaiah.</hi> And to all such this Text will do you little Service, till you make out the meaning of it better than by barely quoting of it; which will scarce ever prove, that God hath promised that so many Princes shall be Friends to the true Religion, that it will be better for the true Religion that Princes should use Force for the imposing or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of their Religions, than not. For unless it prove that, it answers not the Author's Argument, as an indifferent Reader must needs see. For he says not <hi>Truth</hi> never, but <hi>she seldom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Not many wise, not many mighty, not many noble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But supposing many <hi>Kings</hi> were to be <hi>Nursing Fathers to the Church,</hi> and that this Prophecy were to be fulfilled in this Age, and the <hi>Church</hi> were now to be their Nursery; 'Tis I think more proper to understand this figurative Promise, that their Pains and Discipline was to be imploy'd on these in the Church, and that they should feed and cherish them, rather than that these Words meant that they should whip those that were out of it. And therefore this Text will, I suppose, upon a just consideration of it, signify very little against the known matter of Fact which the Author urges; Unless you can find a Country where the Cudgel and the Scourge are more the Badges and Instruments of a good Nurse than the Breast and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> are divided in their opinions and ways of Worship. Differences in ways of Worship, wherein there is nothing mixed inconsistent with the true Religion, will not hinder Men from Salvation, who sincerely follow the best Light they have; which they are as likely to do under Toleration as Force. And as for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Opinions, speculative Opinions in Religion, I think I may safely say, that there are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> any where three consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men (for 'tis want of Consideration you would punish) who are in their Opinions throughout of the same Mind. Thus far then, if Charity be preserved, (which it is likelier to be where there is Toleration, than where there is Persecution) though without Uniformity, I see no great reason to complain of those ill Fruits of Toleration.</p>
            <p>But Men will run, as they did in the late Times, into <hi>dangerous and destructive Errors, and extravagant ways of Worship.</hi> As to Errors in Opinion; If Men upon Toleration be so apt to vary in Opinions, and run so wide one from another, 'tis evident they are not so averse to thinking as you complain. For 'tis hard for Men, not under Force, to quit one Opinion and imbrace another, without thinking of them. But if there be danger of that; It is most likely the National Religion should sweep and draw to its self the loose and unthinking part of Men; who without Thought, as well as without any contest with their corrupt Nature, may imbrace the Profession of the countenanced Religion, and join in outward Communion with the great and ruling Men of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For he that troubles not his Head at all about Religion, what other can so well suit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as the National, with which the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49288:103"/>
Cry and Preferments go; And where (it being, as you say, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumable</hi> that he makes that his Profession upon <hi>Conviction,</hi> and that he is in earnest,) he is sure to be Orthodox without the pains of examining, and has the Law and Government on his side to make it good that he is in the right?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Seducers,</hi> if they be tolerated, will be ready at hand, and diligent; and Men will hearken to them. <hi>Seducers</hi> surely have no Force on their side, to make People hearken. And if this be so, there is a Remedy at hand, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> than Force, if you and your Friends will use it, which cannot but prevail; And that is, let the Ministers of Truth be as diligent; And they bringing Truth with them, Truth <hi>obvious and easy to be understand</hi> (as you say, what is <hi>necessary to Salvation</hi> is) cannot but prevail. <note place="margin">P. 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Seducers</hi> are hearken'd to, because they teach Opinions favourable to Mens Lusts. Let the Magistrate, as is his Duty, hinder the Practises which their Lusts would carry them to, and the Advantage will be still on the side of Truth.</p>
            <p>After all, Sir, If, as the Apostle tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 19.) <hi>There must be Heresies amongst you, that they which are approved may be made manifest;</hi> which, I beseech you, is best for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mens Souls; that they should enquire, <hi>hear, examine, consider,</hi> and then have the Liberty to profess what they are perswaded of; or, that having consider'd, they should be forced not to own nor follow their Perswasions; or else, that being of the National Religion, they should go ignorantly on without any Consideration at all? In one case, if your Penalties prevail, Men are forced to act contrary to their Consciences, which is not the way to Salvation; and if the Penalties prevail not, you have the same Fruits, Sects and Heresies, as under Toleration: In the other, 'tis true, those ignorant, loose, unthinking Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, do not break company with those who imbrace the Truth that will save them; but I fear can no more be said to have any share in it, than those who openly dissent from it. For 'tis not being in the Company, but having on the Wedding-Garment, that keeps Men from being bound Hand and Foot, and cast into the dreadful and eternal Prison.</p>
            <p>You tell us, <hi>Force has a proper Efficacy to procure the Enlightning</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 16.</note> 
               <hi>of the Vnderstanding, and the Production of Belief, viz.</hi> by making Men consider. But you ascribing Mens Aversion to examine Matters of Religion, to the Corruption of their Nature; Force
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49288:103"/>
your way apply'd, (<hi>i. e.</hi> so that Men avoid the Penalties by an outward Conformity) cannot have any <hi>proper Efficacy</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Consideration; since Men may outwardly conform, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Corruption, and Aversion to Consideration; and upon this account, Force, your way apply'd, is absolutely imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
            <p>But further; If Force has such a <hi>proper Efficacy</hi> to procure the <hi>Production of Belief,</hi> it will do more harm than good, imploid by any but Orthodox Magistrates. But how to put it only into Orthodox Hands, is the Difficulty. For I think I have proved, that if Orthodox Magistrates may, and ought to use Force, for the promoting their Religion, all that think themselves Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox are obliged to use it too. And this may serve for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to all you have said, <hi>P.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I having said, Whatever indirect Efficacy there be in Force</hi> 
               <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 30</note> 
               <hi>apply'd by the Magistrate your way, it makes against you;</hi> Force used by the Magistrate, to bring Men to consider those Reasons and Arguments, which are proper and sufficient to convince them, but which without being forced, they would not consider; may, <hi>say you, be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable</hi> indirectly and at a distance, <hi>to make Men imbrace the Truth which must save them. ` And thus, say I, it may be</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable <hi>to bring Men</hi> to receive and imbrace <hi>Falshood, which ` will destroy them. To this you with great Triumph reply.</hi> How, <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> Sir, may Force used by the Magistrate, to bring Men to consider those Reasons and Arguments which are proper and sufficient to convince them, be serviceable to bring Men to imbrace Falshood, such Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood as will destroy them? It seems then, there are Reasons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are proper and sufficient to convince Men of the truth of Falshood, which will destroy them. Which is certainly a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Discovery, though such as no Man can have any reason to thank you for.</p>
            <p>In the first place, let me ask you; Where did you find, or from what Words of mine do you infer that notable Proposition, That <hi>there are Reasons and Arguments proper and sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men of the Truth of Falshood?</hi> If a Magistrate of the True Religion may use Force to make Men consider Reasons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments proper to convince Men of the Truth of his Religion; may not a Prince of a False Religion use Force to make Men consider Reasons and Arguments proper and sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of what he believes to be true? And may not Force
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49288:104"/>
thus be serviceable to bring Men to receive and imbrace Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?</p>
            <p>In the next place; Did you, who argue with so much School-Subtilty as if you drank it in at the very Fountain, never hear of such an ill way of Arguing as a <hi>conjunctis ad divisa?</hi> There are no Arguments proper and sufficient to bring a Man into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, whilst he knows or believes it to be false; therefore there are no Arguments proper and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring a Man into the Belief of what is in it-self false, which he neither knows nor believes to be so. A Senior Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster would be laugh'd at for such Logick. And yet this is all you say in that Sentence you erect for a Trophy, to <hi>convince M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n of the Truth of Falshood;</hi> which though not my Words, but such as you in your way supply from what I said, you are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pleased with, and think their very repeating a Triumph. But though there are no Arguments proper and sufficient <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men of the Truth of Falshood,</hi> as Falshood; yet I hope you will allow that there are <hi>Arguments proper and sufficient</hi> to make Men receive Falshoods for Truths; why else do you complain of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>?</hi> And those who imbrace Falshoods for Truths, do it under the Appearance of Truth, misled by those Arguments which make it appear so, and so convince them. And that Magistrates who take their Religion to be true, though it be not so, may with Force urge such Arguments, you will, I think, grant.</p>
            <p>But you talk as if no body could have <hi>Arguments proper and sufficient to convince another,</hi> but he that was of your way, or your Church. This indeed is a new and <hi>very extraordinary discav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> and such as your Brethren, if you can <hi>convince</hi> them of it, <hi>will have reason to thank you for.</hi> For if any one was ever by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Reasons brought off, or seduced from your Church, to be a Dissenter, there were then I think Reasons and <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proper and sufficient to convince</hi> him. I will not name to you again Mr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> because you have charity enough to question his Sincerity. Though his leaving his Country, Friends, and Acquaintance, may be <hi>presum'd</hi> as great a Mark of his being convinced and in earnest, as it is for one to write for a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Religion in a Country where it is uppermost. I will not yet deny but that, in you, it may be pure Zeal for the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>gion, which you would have assisted with the Magi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ratos Force.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49288:104"/>
And since you seem so much concern'd for your Sincerity in the Argument, it must be granted you deserve the Character of a well-meaning Man, who own your Sincerity in a way so little advantageous to your Judgment.</p>
            <p>But if Mr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> in your Opinion, was misled by corrupt Ends, or secular Interest; what do you think of a Prince now living? Will you doubt his Sincerity, or that he was convinced of the Truth of the Religion he professed, who ventured Three Crowns for it? What do you think of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> when he left the Church of <hi>England</hi> for the <hi>Romish</hi> Profession? Did he do it without being <hi>convinc'd</hi> that that was the right? Or was he convinc'd with <hi>Reasons and Arguments,</hi> not <hi>proper or sufficient to convince him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But certainly this could not be true, because, as you say, <hi>p.</hi> 25. <hi>the Scripture does not teach</hi> any thing of it. Or perhaps those that leave your Communion do it always without being convinc'd, and only think they are <hi>convinc'd</hi> when they are not; or are <hi>convinc'd</hi> with <hi>Arguments</hi> not <hi>proper and sufficient to convince them.</hi> If no body can convince another, but he that has Truth on his side, you do more honour to the <hi>first and second Letter concerning Toleration,</hi> than is for the Advantage of your Cause, when you impute to them the Increase of <hi>Sects and Heresies</hi> amongst us. And there are some, even of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves so fully satisfied by the Reasons and Arguments in the first of them, that though I dare not be positive to you, whose Privilege it is to <hi>convince</hi> Men, that they are convinced; yet I may say, 'tis as <hi>presumable</hi> they are <hi>convinced,</hi> having own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, as it is <hi>presumable</hi> that all that are Conformists <hi>are made so upon Reason and Conviction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This, I suppose, may serve for an Answer to your next words,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> That God in his just Judgment will send such as receive not the Love of Truth, that they may be saved, but reject it for the Pleasure they have in Vnrighteousness, <gap reason="foreign">

But that there are any such Reasons or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are proper and sufficient to convince or satisfy any, but such resolute and obdurate Sinners, of the Truth of such Falshood as will destroy them, is a Position which you are sure the Scripture doth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> us; and which, <hi>you tell me,</hi> when <hi>I</hi> have better considered it,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49288:105"/>
               <hi>you</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> will not undertake to maintain. And yet if it be not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, what <hi>I</hi> say here is to no purpose: For if there be no such Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Arguments as here we speak of, 'tis in vain to talk of the Magistrate's using Force to make Men consider them.</p>
            <p>But if you are still of the mind, that no Magistrate but those who are of the True Religion, can have Arguments back'd with Force, proper and sufficient to convince; and that in <hi>England</hi> none but <hi>resolute obdurate Sinners</hi> ever forsook or forbore the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> upon Reasons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that <hi>satisfy or convince</hi> them; I shall leave you to enjoy so charitable an Opinion.</p>
            <p>But as to the Usefulness of Force, your way applied, I shall lay you down again the same Argument I used before; though in Words less sitted for your Way of Reasoning on them, now I know your Talent. If there be any Efficacy in Force to bring Men to any Perswasion, it will, your Way apply'd, bring more Men to Error than to Truth. Your Way of using it is only to punish Men for not being of the National Religion; which is the only Way you do or can apply Force, without a Toleration. Nonconformity is the Fault that is punish'd; which Fault, when it ceases, the Punishment ceases. But yet to make them consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is the end for which they are punish'd; but whether it be or be not intended to make Men consider, it alters nothing in the case. Now I say, that since all Magistrates who believe their Religion to be true, are as much obliged to use Force to bring their Subjects to it, as if it were true; and since most of the National Religions of the World are erroneous; if Force made use of to bring Men to the National Religion, by punishing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters, have any Efficacy, (let it be what it will, <hi>indirect and at a distance,</hi> if you please) it is like to do twenty times more harm than good; because of the National Religions of the World, to speak much within compass, there are above 20 wrong for one that is right.</p>
            <p>Indeed, could Force be directed to drive all Men indifferently, who are negligent and backward in it, to <hi>study, examine,</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> seriously Matters of Religion, and search out the Truth; And if Men were, upon their Study and Examination, permitted to follow what appears to them to be right; you might have some pretence for Force, as serviceable to Truth in making Men consider. But this is impossible, but under a Toleration.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49288:105"/>
And I doubt whether, even there, Force can be so apply'd, as to make Men consider and impartially examine what is true in the professed Religions of the World, and to imbrace it. This at least is certain, that where Punishments pursue Men like outly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deer, only to the Pale of the National Church; and when once they are within that, leaves them free there, and at ease; it can do no Service to the True Religion, even in a Country where the National is the true. For the Penalties ceasing as soon as Men are got within the Pale and Communion of the Church, they help not Men at all against that which you assign as the great Hindrance to the True Religion, and which therefore, in your Opinion, makes Force necessary to assist it.</p>
            <p>For there being no necessity that Men should leave either their Vices or Corruption, or so much as their Ignorance, to get with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Pale of the Church; Force, your way apply'd, serves only to bring them (even in the few Christian and Orthodox Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries) to the Profession, not to the Knowledg, Belief or Practice, of the True Religion.</p>
            <p>You say corrupt Nature inclines Men from the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to false ones; and moderate Force is requisite to make such Men consider. But such Men as, out of corrupt Nature, and for their Ease and carnal Pleasures, chuse an erroneous Religion without considering, will again, as soon as they can find their Choice incommoded by those Penalties, consult the same corrupt Nature and carnal Appetites, and without considering any thing further, conform to that Religion where they can best en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy themselves. 'Tis only the conscientious part of Dissenters, such as dissent not out of Indulgence to corrupt Nature, but out of Perswasion, who will not conform without considering as they ought. And therefore your Argument from corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is out of doors. If moderate Penalties serve only to work on those who are led by corrupt Nature, they are of no use but to fill the Church with Hypocrites; that is, to make those Men worse Hypocrites than they were before, by a new Act of Hypocrisy, and to corrupt the Manners of the rest of the Church, by their converse with these. And whether this be for the Salvation of Souls, as is pretended, or for some other End, that the Priests of all Religions have generally so earnestly contended for it, I leave to be consider'd. For as for those who dissent out of Perswasion, I suspect your moderate Penalties will
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49288:106"/>
have little effect upon them. For such Men being awed by the Fear of Hell-fire, if that Fear will not make them consider bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they have done, moderate Penalties will be too weak to work upon them. 'Tis well if Dragooning and Martyring can do it.</p>
            <p>But you add, <hi>May it not be true nevertheless, that Force</hi> your way <note place="margin">P. 26.</note> applied <hi>may be serviceable indirectly, and at a distance, to bring Men to imbrace the Truth which may save them? which is all you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned here to make good.</hi> So that if it may possibly happen that it should ever bring two Men to imbrace the Truth, you have gain'd your Point, and overthrown Toleration, by the <hi>usefulness</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> there is of Force. For without being forced these two Men would never have <hi>considered:</hi> Which is more yet than you know, unless you are of his private Council, who only can tell when the Season of Grace is past, and the time come that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Intreaty, Instruction and Perswasion shall never after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon a Man. But whatever you are <hi>here concerned to make</hi>

               <hi>good,</hi> are you not also <hi>concerned</hi> to remember what you say; where declaring against the Magistrates having a power to use what may any way, at any time, upon any Person, by any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, be useful towards the promoting the true Religion, you say, <hi>Who sees not that however such means might chance to hit right in some few Cases, yet, upon the whole matter, they would certainly do a great deal more harm than good; And in all Pleas,</hi> (making use of my Words) <hi>for any thing because of its usefulness, it is not enough to say that it may be serviceable, but it must be considered, not only what it may, but what it is likely to produce; and the greater good or harm like to come from it, ought to determine the use of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You proceed and tell me, That I, <hi>not content to say that</hi> Force <note place="margin">P. 26.</note> your way applied (i. e. <q>
                  <hi>to bring Men to imbrace the Truth which must save them</hi>) may be serviceable to bring Men to imbrace Falshood which will destroy them;</q> 
               <hi>and so is</hi> proper to do as much harm as good, <hi>(which seems strange enough;) I add (to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the Wonder)</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>that in your</hi> indirect way it is much more proper, and likely to make Men receive and embrace Error, than the Truth: <hi>And that,</hi> 1. Because Men out of the right Way are as apt, and I think I may say apter, to use Force than others;</q> 
               <hi>Which is, doubtless, an irrefragable demonstration, that Force used by the Magistrate to bring Men to receive and imbrace the Truth which must save them,</hi>
               <q>is much more proper and likely
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49288:106"/> to make Men receive Error than the Truth.</q> And then you ask me, <hi>How we come to talk here of what Men out of the right way are apt to do, to bring others into their,</hi> (i. e. a wrong) way; <hi>where we are only inquiring, what may be done to bring Men to the right way. For</hi> you <hi>must put</hi> me <hi>in Mind,</hi> you say, that <hi>that is our question,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether the Magistrate has any right to use Force, to bring Men to the</hi> true Religion. Whether the Magistrate has aright to use Force in matters of Religion, as you more truly state it, (<hi>P.</hi> 78.) is the main Question between us, I confess. But the Question here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us is about the usefulness of Force your way apply'd; which being to punish Dissenters as Dissenters, to make them consider, I shew'd would do more harm than good. And to this, you were here answering. Whereby, I suppose, it is plain that the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here is about the Usefulness of Force, so apply'd. And I doubt not but my Readers, who are not concerned, when the Question in debate will not serve your turn, to have another substituted, will take this for a regular and natural way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, <hi>viz.</hi> `That Force, your way apply'd, is more proper and likely to make Men imbrace Error than the Truth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Men out of the right Way are as apt, I think I may say ` apter, to use Force than others. You need not then ask as you do, <hi>How we come to talk here of Men out of the right Way.</hi> You see how. If you do not, I know not what help there is for your Eyes. And I must content my self that any other Reader that has Eyes, will not miss it. And I wonder that you should: since you know I have on several Occasions argued against the Use of Force in Matters of Religion; upon a Supposition, that if any one, then all Magistrates have a just Pretence and Right to use it; which has served you in some Places for Matter of great Reproof, and in others of Sport and Diversion. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so plain a thing as that was so strange to you, that you thought it a ridiculous Paradox to say,<q>That for all Magistrates to suppose the Religion they believed to be true, was equally just and reasonable;</q> And because you took no notice of the Words adjoin'd that proved it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>Unless we can imagine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where but in <hi>England,</hi> [or where the National Religion is the true] Men believe what at the same time they think to be a Lie</q>; I have taken the pains to prove it to you more at large in another place, and therefore shall make bold to use it here as an Argument against Force, <hi>viz.</hi> That if it have any Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49288:107"/>
it will do more harm than good; <q>Because Men out of the right Way are as apt, or apter to use it</q>: And I shall think it a good one, till you have answered it.</p>
            <p>It is a good and a sure way, and shews a Zeal to the Cause, still to hold fast the Conclusion, and whatever be in debate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn still to one' old Position.

            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:49288:107"/>
Your Way is to lay Penalties on Men for Nonconformity, as you say, <hi>to make Men consider:</hi> Now here let me ask any one but you, Whether it be not utterly <hi>impertinent</hi> so to lay Penalties on Men, to <hi>make them consider,</hi> when they can avoid those Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties without considering? But because it is not enough to prove Force, your way apply'd, <hi>utterly impertinent,</hi> I shall shew you in the next place, that were a Law made to punish not barely Non-conformity, but Non-consideration, those Penalties laid on not considering, would be utterly impertinent; because it could never be proved that a Man had not consider'd the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments offer'd him. And therefore all Law-makers till you, in all their Penal Laws about Religion, laid all their Penalties upon not imbracing; and 'twas against that, that our Author was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing when he said Penalties, in this case are absolutely <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;</hi> because they are not proper to convince the Mind. For in that case, when Penalties are laid on Men for not imbracing, 'tis plain they are used as a means to make Men imbrace: which, since those who are careless in Matters of Religion can do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out considering, and those who are conscientious cannot do without Conviction; and since Penalties can in no wise convince; this Use of them is absolutely <hi>impertinent,</hi> and will always be so till you can shew a way how they can be used in Religion, not as Motives to imbrace, but as Motives barely to make Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider. For if you punish them on when they tell you they have considered your Arguments, but are not convinced by them, and you judg of their having not considered by nothing but their not imbracing, 'tis plain you use Penalties instead of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to convince them; since without Conviction, those who our Author pleads for, cannot imbrace; and those who do imbrace without Conviction, 'tis all one as if they did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace at all, they being not one jot the more in the Way of Salvation; and so Penalties are absolutely <hi>impertinent.</hi> But Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing in the Sense of the Law, and yours too, when you say Men have not <hi>considered as they ought</hi> as long as they <hi>reject,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but outward Conformity, or an outward Profession of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing, wherewith the Law is satisfied, and upon which the Penalties cease. Now Penalties used to make Men in this Sense imbrace, are absolutely <hi>impertinent</hi> to bring Men to imbrace in earnest, or, as the Author calls it, believe: because an outward Profession, which in this case is the immediate end to which
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49288:108"/>
Penalties are directed, and beyond which they do not reach, is no proper means to produce in Men Consideration, Conviction, or Believing.</p>
            <p>What can be more <hi>impertinent</hi> than to vex and disease Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the Use of Force, to no purpose? and that Force must needs be to no purpose, which is so apply'd as to leave the end for which it is pretended to be used, without the means which is acknowledg'd necessary for its Attainment. That this is so in your way of using Force, will easily appear from your Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis. You tell us at large in your <hi>Argument consider'd,</hi> that <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 6, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 12.</note> Mens Lusts hinder them from even impartial <hi>Consideration and Examination</hi> of Matters in Religion, and therefore Force is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to remove this Hindrance. You tell us likewise at large <note place="margin">P, 6,—8.</note> in your <hi>Letter,</hi> that Mens corrupt Nature and beloved Lusts hinder them also from <hi>imbracing</hi> the True Religion, and that Force is necessary likewise to remove this Obstacle. Now in your way of using Force, wherein Penalties are laid on Men till, and no longer than till, they are made outwardly to conform, Force is so apply'd, that notwithstanding the Intention of the Law-maker (let it be what it will) neither the Obstacle to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Examination, rising from Mens <hi>Lusts,</hi> nor the Aversion to imbracing the True Religion, rising from Mens <hi>corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> can be removed: unless they can be removed without that, which you suppose necessary to their removal. For since a Man may conform, without being under the necessity of <hi>impartial Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining or Imbracing</hi> on the one hand, or Suffering the Penalties on the other; it is unavoidable, that he should neither imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally examine nor imbrace, if Penalties are necessary to make him do either; because Penalties, which are the necessary Remedies to remove those Hindrances, were never apply'd to them; and so those Obstacles not being removed for want of their necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Remedy, must continue on to hinder both <hi>Examining and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing.</hi> For Penalties cannot be used as a Means to any end, or be apply'd to the procuring any Action to be done, which a Man from his Lusts or any other cause, has an aversion to, but by putting them as it were in one Scale as a Counter-ballance to that Aversion, and the Action in the other Scale, and putting a Man under the necessity of choosing the one or the other: where that is not done, the Penalty may be avoided, the Aversion or Obstacle hath nothing to remove it, and so the Action must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49288:108"/>
undone. So that if Penalties be necessary to make Men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially <hi>examine</hi> and really <hi>imbrace;</hi> if Penalties are not so laid on Men as to make the Alternative to be either suffering the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties or Conforming, it is impossible that Men, who without Penalties would not impartially <hi>examine</hi> or really <hi>imbrace</hi> the True Religion, should ever do either; and then I beseech you consider whether Penalties, your Way apply'd, be <hi>impertinent</hi> or no.</p>
            <p>The necessity of Penalties is only where there is some incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or byas in a Man, whencesoever arising, that keeps him from doing something in his Power, which he cannot be brought to without the Inconveniences of some Penal Infliction. The Efficacy of Penalties lies in this, that the Inconvenience to be suffer'd by the Penalties over-ballance the Byas or Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which leans the Man the other way, and so removes the Obstacle; And the Application of this Remedy lies only in puting a Man under the necessary choice either of doing the Action, or suffering the Penalty: So that in what ever case a Man has not been put under that necessity, there Penalties have never been apply'd to the procuring that Action; for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle or Aversion to it, has never had its necessary Remedy.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will say it is not <hi>absolutely impertinent,</hi> because it may possibly <hi>do some Service indirectly and at a distance,</hi> and be the occasion that some may consider and imbrace. If whatever may by accident contribute to any End, may be used not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently as a Means to that End, nothing that I know can be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent;</hi> and a Penalty of 12 <hi>d.</hi> a time laid on them for being drunk, may be said, to be a pertinent means, to make Men Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesians, or Conformists: because it may <hi>indirectly and at a distance do some Service,</hi> by being an Occasion to make some Men consider their mispending their time; whereby it may happen that one may betake himself to the Study of Philosophy, where he may meet with <hi>Arguments proper and fit to convince him</hi> of the Truth of that Philosophy; as another betaking himself to the Study of Divinity, may <hi>consider Arguments proper and fit to make</hi> him (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in <hi>England, Holland</hi> or <hi>Denmark</hi>) of the National Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, which he was not of before.</p>
            <p>Just thus, and no otherwise, does 12 <hi>d.</hi> a Sunday, or any other Penalty laid on Non-conformity, make Men study and imbrace the True Religion; and whatever you will call the Service it
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49288:109"/>
does, direct or <hi>indirect,</hi> near or <hi>at a distance,</hi> 'tis plain it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces that effect, and conduces to that end meerly by accident; and therefore must be allow'd to be impertinent to be used to that purpose.</p>
            <p>That your Way of using Force in Matters of Religion, even in a Country where the Magistrate's is of the True Religion, is absolutely <hi>impertinent;</hi> I shall further shew you from your own Positions.</p>
            <p>Here in the entrance give me leave to observe to you, that you confound two things very different, <hi>viz.</hi> Your Way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Force, and the End for which you pretend you use it.

For in that use of Force, which</hi> you <hi>defend, the Effect is both intended by him that uses it, and withal, you doubt not, so often attain'd, as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to manifest the Vsefulness of it.</hi> Whereby 'tis plain the two Marks, whereby you distinguish'd your <hi>indirect and at a distance</hi> Usefulness, from that which is <hi>by accident,</hi> are that, <hi>that by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> does Service but seldom, and besides the Intention of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but yours the contrary.</p>
            <p>First, as to the Intention, you tell us, <hi>in the use of Force,</hi> which <note place="margin">

If they did not, then so far you and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ions</hi> alike. Did they, ever say so in those Laws?
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49288:109"/>
nor that neither. Those vers'd then in the Interpretations of Laws, will tell you nothing can be known to be the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Law-makers in any Law, of which the Law is wholly si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: That Way then you can not know it to have been their <hi>Intention,</hi> if the Law says nothing of it. Whatever was the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> of former Law-makers, if you had read with Attention the last Act of Uniformity of <hi>Car.</hi> 2. printed before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer Book, I conclude you would have been better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied about the <hi>Intention</hi> of the then Law-makers in that Law; sor I think nothing can be plainer to any one who will look into that Statute, than that their only End in that Law was, what they have expressed in these Words, <hi>And to the end that Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the Publick Worship of God (which is so much desired) may be speedily effected;</hi> which was driven with such speed, that if all concern'd had opportunity to get and peruse the then esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd Liturgy, 'tis certain they had not over-much time se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously and deliberately to consider of all the Parts of it before the Day set for the Use of it.</p>
            <p>But you think, they ought to have <hi>intended,</hi> and therefore they did: And I think they neither ought, nor could, in making those Laws, intend so unpracticable a thing; and therefore they did not. Which being as certain a way of Knowledg as yours, if you know it by that way; 'tis possible you and I may at the same time know contraries.</p>
            <p>But you know it, by their <hi>having provided sufficient means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction for all under their Care in the true Religion;</hi> (of this <hi>sufficient Means,</hi> we have something to say in another place.) Penalties laid expresly on one Fault, have no Evidence that they were de-signed to mend another, though there are sufficient Means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of mending it, if Men would make a sufficient use of them; unless those two Faults are so connected, as one cannot be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without the other. Now if Men cannot conform, without so <hi>considering as to be convinced of, and embrace the Truth that must save them,</hi> you may know that Penalties laid on Nonconformity, were <hi>intended</hi> to make Men so consider: but if Men may conform; without so <hi>considering,</hi> one cannot know nor conclude those Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties were <hi>intended</hi> to make Men so <hi>consider,</hi> whatever Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is made of <hi>Means of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say, it is evident that Penalties on Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, were <hi>intended</hi> to make them use these Means of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49288:110"/>
because they are <hi>intended</hi> for the bringing Men to Church, the place of Instruction, That they are <hi>intended</hi> to bring Men to Church, the Place of Preaching, that I grant, but that those Penalties that are laid on Men, for not coming to Church, can be known thereby to be <hi>intended</hi> to make Men so <hi>consider,</hi> as to be <hi>convinced</hi> and <hi>imbrace</hi> the true Religion, that I deny: and it is utterly impossible it should be so, if what you say be true, where you tell us, That <hi>the Magistrates concern themselves for</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Compliance or Conformity, only as the fruit of their Conviction.</hi> If therefore the <hi>Magistrates are concerned for Mens Conformity, only as the fruit of their Conviction,</hi> and coming to Church be that Conformity; coming to Church cannot be <hi>intended</hi> as a Means of their Conviction: unless it be <hi>intended</hi> they should be convinc'd, before they are convinc'd.</p>
            <p>But to shew you, that you cannot pretend the Penalty of Laws for Conformity, to proceed from a Care of the Souls of <hi>all</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Magistrates Power, and so to be <hi>intended,</hi> to make them <hi>all</hi> consider, in any Sense. Can you, or any one know, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that Penalties which are laid by the Law on Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, are <hi>intended</hi> to make <hi>all</hi> Men consider; where 'tis known that a great Number, under the Magistrates Power, are dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with, and privileged from those Penalties? How many, omitting the Jews, are there; for example, in the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Dominions, under his Care and Power, of the <hi>Walloon,</hi> and <hi>French Church;</hi> to whom Force is never apply'd, and they live in Security from it? How many Pagans are there in the Plantations, many whereof born in His Dominions, of whom there was never any care taken, that they should so much as come to Church, or be in the least instructed in the Christian Religion? And yet must we believe, or can you pretend, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates use of Force, against Nonconformists; is to make <hi>all</hi> his Subjects consider, so as to be convinc'd of, and imbrace the Truth that must save them? If you say, in your way you mean no such Indulgence: I answer, the Question is not of yours but the Magistrates Intention; though what your <hi>Intention</hi> is, who would have the want of Consideration, or Knowledg, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, exempt from Force, is visible enough.</p>
            <p>Again, Those Penalties cannot be supposed, to be <hi>intended</hi> to make Men <hi>consider;</hi> which are laid on those, who have, or may have already considered: And such you must grant to be the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49288:110"/>
Penalties laid in <hi>England,</hi> on Nonconformists; unless you will deny, that any Nonconformist has, or can <hi>consider,</hi> so as to be convinced, or believe, and <hi>imbrace the Truth that must save him.</hi> So that you cannot vouch the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Magistrate, where his Laws say nothing; much less affirm, that Force is <hi>intended</hi> to produce a certain end in <hi>all</hi> his Subjects, which is not applied to them <hi>all,</hi> and is applied to some who have attained that end al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: Unless you have a Privilege to affirm, against all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whatsoever may serve your Cause. But to learn some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in this, I shall send you to my <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> For whatever charitable wishes Magistrates may sometimes have in their Thoughts (which I meddle not with); no Body can say, that in making the Laws, or in the use of Force, we are speaking of, they <hi>intended</hi> to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>mselves to the use of those Means, and Helps, which are proper to make them what they are designed to be.</hi> In the Case before us, What are Men designed to be? Holy Believers of the Gospel in this World, without which no Salvation, no seeing of God in the next. Let us see now, whether Force, your way applied, can be suted to such a Design, and so <hi>intended</hi> for that End.</p>
            <p>You hold, That all out of the National Church, where the Religion of the National Church is true, should be punished, and ought to have Force used to them: And again, you grant That those who are in the Communion of the National Church, ought <note place="margin">P. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> not to be punished, or be under the stroke of Force; nor indeed in your way can they. If now <hi>the effect</hi> be to prevail with Men, <hi>to consider as they ought,</hi> so that they may become <hi>what they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be:</hi> How can any one think, that you, and they who use Force thus, <hi>intend,</hi> in the use of it, that Men should really be Christians, both in Perswasion and Practice, without which there is no Salvation; if they leave off Force before they have attained that <hi>effect?</hi> Or how can it be imagined, that they <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> any thing but Conformity, by their use of Force; if they leave off the use of it as soon as Men conform? Unless you will say that an outward Conformity to the National Church, whose
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49288:111"/>
Religion is the true Religion, is such an imbracing of the Truth as is sufficient to Salvation? Or that an outward Profession of the Christian Religion, is the same with being really a Christian; which possibly you will not be very forward to do, when you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, what you meet with in the Sermons, and Printed Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, of Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> concerning the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Irreligion of Conformists themselves. For Penalties can never be thought, by any one (but he that can think against common Sense, and what he pleases) to be <hi>intended</hi> for any End; which by that Constitution, and Law whereby they are imposed, are to cease before that End be attained. And will you say, that all who are conformable, have so well <hi>considered,</hi> that they <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>heartily imbrace</hi> the Truths of the Gospel, that <hi>must save them:</hi> When perhaps it will be found that a great many Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, do not so much as understand them? But the Ignorance or Irreligiousness to be found amongst Consormists, which your way of talking forces me in some Places to take notice of, let me here tell you once for all I lay not the blame of upon Conformity, but upon your use of Force to make Men conform. For whatever the Religion be, true or false, it is natural for Force, and Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so applied, to bring the irreligious, and those who are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and unconcerned for the true, into the National Profession: But whether it be fitter for such to be kept out, rather than, by Force, to be driven into the Communion of any Church, and owned as Members of it, those who have a due Care and Respect for truly religious and pious Conformists, were best consider.</p>
            <p>But farther, if, as you say, the opposition to the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lies only in Mens Lusts; it having <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> enough (were it not for that) to prevail: and it is upon that account on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Force is <hi>necessary,</hi> there is no necessity at all to use Force on Men, only till they conform, and no farther: Since I think, you will not deny, but that the <hi>Corruption of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is as great in Consormists, as in Nonconformists; in the Professors of, as in the Dissenters from, the National Religion. And therefore either Force was not necessary before, or else it is necessary still, after Men are Conformists: Unless you will say, that it is harder for a Man to be a Professor, than a Christian indeed: And that the true Religion, by its own <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> can, without the help of Force, prevail over a Man's Lusts, and the Corruption of his Nature; but it has need of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49288:111"/>
help of Force, to make him a Conformist, and an outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor. And so much for the <hi>Effect,</hi> which is <hi>intended by him that uses it in that use of Force, which you defend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Argument you bring to shew, that your <hi>indirect and at a distance Vsefulness</hi> of Force your way apply'd, is not by accident, is the <hi>frequent Success</hi> of it. Which I think is not the true Mark of what is not <hi>by accident:</hi> for an Effect may not be <hi>by accident,</hi> though it has never been produced but once; and is certainly as little <hi>by accident</hi> the first time, as when it has been produced a thousand times. That then, by which any thing is excused from being by accident, is not the Frequency of the Event, but that whereon the Frequency of the Event de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, when frequent Trials are made; and that is the proper, natural, direct Efficacy of the Cause or Means, which produces the Effect. As in the Case before us, Penalties are the Cause or Means used to produce an End; the proper and immediate Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Penalties, is to produce some Pain or Inconvenience; and the natural Effect of that, is to make a Man, who naturally flies from all Pain or Inconvenience, to endeavour to avoid it; whereby it naturally and directly works upon the Will of Man, by proposing to him this unavoidable Choice, of doing some Action, or enduring the Pain or Inconvenience of the Penalty annexed to its Omission. When the Pain of doing the Action is outweigh'd in the Sense of him that lies under the Penalty, the Pain, that by the Law is annex'd to the Omission, operates up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Will, as naturally, as thirteen Ounces in one Scale, laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst twelve Ounces in the other, incline the Ballance, and bring it down on that side. And this is by a direct and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Efficacy, wherein there is nothing of Chance.</p>
            <p>Let us see this how far this will go in <hi>your indirect and at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> Usefulness. In your Method, the Action, you propose to be done, is <hi>Considering,</hi> or a severe and <hi>impartial Examining</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, which you tell us, Men by their great Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or Aversion are kept from doing. What now is a proper Means to produce this? <hi>Penalties, without which,</hi> you tell us, it will not be done. How now is it apply'd in your Method? Conformity, and Mens Neglect or Aversion to it, is laid in one Scale, and the Penalty join'd to the Omission of it, laid in the other; and in this Case, if the Inconvenience of the Penalty overweighs the Pains of, or Aversion to Conformity, it does by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49288:112"/>
a direct and natural Efficacy produce Conformity: but if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a severe and impartial Examination, that is meerly by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; because the Inconvenience of the Penalty is not laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Mens Aversion or Backwardness to examine impartially, as a Counter-ballance to that, but against their Aversion or Backwardness to conform; and so whatever it does, <hi>indirectly and at a distance,</hi> 'tis certain its making Men <hi>sev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rely and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially examine</hi> (if ever that happens) is as much by accident, as it would be <hi>by accident,</hi> if a piece of Lead laid in one Scale as a Counterpoise to Feathers in the opposite Scale, should move or weigh done Gold that was put in the Scale of another Pair of Ballances, which had no Counterpoise laid against it. Unless you will say there is a necessary Connection between Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a severe and impartial Examination.</p>
            <p>But you will say perhaps, that though it be not possible that Penalties should produce Examination but by mere accident, because Examination has no necessary Connection with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, or the Profession of any Religion; yet since there are some who will not take up any Profession without a <hi>severe and impartial Examination,</hi> Penalties for Nonconformity will, by a direct and natural Efficacy, produce Examination in all such. To which I answer, That those are (if we may believe what <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 6, &amp;c.</note> you say) so very few, that this your Remedy, which you put into the Magistrate's hands to bring <hi>all</hi> his Subjects to consider and examine, will not work upon one in a thousand; nay, it can work on none at all, to make them severely and impa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tially examine, but meerly by <hi>accident.</hi> For if they are Men, whom a slight and partial Examination (which upon your Principles you must say) sufficed to make Non-conformists, a slight and partial Examination will as well serve to make them Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists; and so Penalties laid on them to make them conform, can only by accident produce a <hi>severe and impartial Examination,</hi> in such Men, who can take up the Profession of any Religion without a <hi>severe and impartial Examination,</hi> no more than it can otherwise than by accident, produce any Examination in those who, without any Examination, can take up the Profession of any Religion.</p>
            <p>And in those very few, who take not up the Profession of any Religion without a <hi>severe and impartial Examination,</hi> that Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can do any Service, to bring them either to the Truth that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49288:112"/>
must save them, or so much as to outward Conformity, but meerly <hi>by accident,</hi> that also is evident. Because all such in a Country, where they dissent from the National Religion, must necessarily have severely and impartially examin'd already, or else you destroy the Supposition this Argument is built on, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are Men who do severely and impartially examine before they choos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>. And if you lay, or continue your Penalties on Men, that have so examin'd, 'tis plain you <hi>use</hi> them <hi>instead of Reasons and Arguments;</hi> in which Use of them, you confess they have no <hi>proper Efficacy,</hi> and therefore if they do any Service, it is meerly by accident.</p>
            <p>But now let us see the <hi>Success</hi> you boast of, and for that you tell us, that you <hi>doubt not</hi> but it is <hi>so often attain'd, as abundantly</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 17.</note> 
               <hi>to manifest the Vsefulness of it.</hi> You speak here of it, as a thing tried, and so known, that you doubt not. Pray tell us where your <hi>moderate</hi> (for great ones you acknowledg to do harm, and to be useless) Penalties have been used, with such Success, that we may be past doubt too. If you can shew no such place, do you not vouch Experience where you have none? and shew a Willingness not to doubt, where you have no Assurance? In all Countries, where any Force is used to bring Men to the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the National Religion, and to outward Conformity, it is not to be doubted, but that Force joining with their natural Corruption, in bringing them into the Way of Preferment, Countenance, Protection, Ease and Impunity, should easily draw in all the Loose and Careless in Matters of Religion, which are every-where the far greater number: But is it those you count upon, and will you produce them as Examples of what Force has done to make Men <hi>consider, study</hi> and <hi>imbrace</hi> the True Religion? Did the Penalties laid on Nonconformity make you consider, so as to study, be convinced, and imbrace the True Religion? Or can you give an Instance of any one, in whom it produced this Effect? If you cannot, you will have some reason to doubt of what you have said, and not to be so consident that the Effect you talk of, is so often attain'd. Not that I deny, but that God may sometimes have made these Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments the Occasions to Men of setting themselves seriously on considering Religion, and thence they may have come into the National Religion upon a real Conviction: but the Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it I believe to be so few, that you will have reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49288:113"/>
your own Words, where you speak of such things as, <q>Any Way, at any Time, upon any Person, by any Accident, may be useful towards the promoting of True Religion</q>: <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
               <hi>If Men should thence take occasion to apply such things generally, who see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> not that, however they might chance to hit right in some few Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, yet upon the whole matter, they would certainly do a great deal more harm than good.</hi> You and I know a Country wherein, not long since, greater Severities were used than you pretend to approve of. Were there not for all that, great Numbers of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Professions stood out, who by your Rule, ought now to have your moderate Penalties tried upon them? And can you think less degrees of Force can work, and often, as you say, prevail where greater could not? But perhaps they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on many of those to return, who having been brought into the Communion of the Church by former Penal Laws, have now upon the <hi>Relaxation</hi> left it again. A manifest Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s it not? That <hi>their Compliance was the fruit of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction;</hi> and that the Magistrate was <hi>concern'd for their Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance only as the fruit of their Conviction.</hi> When they as soon as any Relaxation of those Laws took off the Penalties, left again the Communion of the National Church? For <hi>the lessening the Number of Conformists,</hi> is, I suppose, one of those things which you say your <hi>Eyes cannot but see at this time;</hi> and which you, with concern, impute to the late <hi>Relaxation.</hi> A plain Evidence how <hi>presumable</hi> it is, even in your own Opinion, that those who conform do it upon real <hi>Conviction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, these Proofs, though I do not pretend to bring <hi>as good as the Thing will admit,</hi> will serve my turn to shew, that Force, is impertinent; since by your own Confession it has no direct Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to convince Men, and by its being <hi>indirect and at a distance</hi> useful, is not at all distinguish'd from being barely so <hi>by accident:</hi> since you can neither prove it to be intended for that end, nor frequently to succeed, which are the two Marks whereby you put a Difference between <hi>indirect and at a distance, and by accident.</hi> This, I say, is enough to shew what the Author said, is true, that the Use of Force is wholly <hi>impertinent.</hi> Which, whatever other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> do, you upon another reason, must be forced to allow.</p>
            <p>You profess your self of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and, if I may guess are so far of it, as to have subscrib'd the 39 Articles, which if you have done, and assented to what you subscribed, you must
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49288:113"/>

The End here, is to make a Man a true Christian, that he may be saved; and he is then, and then only, a true Christian, and in the Way of Salvation, when he believes, and with Sincerity obeys the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. By the 13th Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you hold, that <hi>WORKS DONE BEFORE THE GRACE OF CHRIST, AND THE INSPIRATION OF HIS SPIRIT, ARE NOT PLEASING TO GOD; FOR AS MUCH AS THEY SPRING NOT OF FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST, NEITHER DO THEY MAKE MEN MEET TO RECEIVE GRACE, (OR AS THE SCHOOL - AUTHORS SAY) DESERVE GRACE OF CONGRUITY; YEA RATHER, FOR THAT THEY ARE NOT DONE AS GOD HAS WILLED AND COMMANDED THEM TO BE DONE, WE DOUBT NOT BUT THEY HAVE THE NATURE OF SIN.</hi> Now if it be impertinent to use Force to make a Man do more than he can, and a Man can do nothing to procure Grace, unless <hi>Sin</hi> can procure it; and without Grace, a Man cannot b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To hear and consider, is in Mens Power, you will say, and to that Force may be pertinent; I grant to make Men hear, but not to make them <hi>consider</hi> in your sense, which you tell us, is to <hi>consider so as to imbrace;</hi> if you mean by <hi>imbracing</hi> any thing but outward Conformity. And that according to your Article, contributes nothing to the attaining of Grace; because without Grace, your Article says it is a Sin; and to conform to, and outwardly profess a Religion which a Man does not understand and heartily believe, every one, I think, judges to be a <hi>Sin,</hi> and no fit Means to procure the Grace of God.</p>
            <p>But you tell us, <hi>That God denies his Grace to none who seriously ask</hi>

               <hi>it.</hi> If that be so, methinks Force should most properly and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently be used to make Men <hi>seriously</hi> pray to God <hi>for Grace.</hi> But how, I beseech you, will this stand with your 13th Article? For if you mean by <hi>seriously,</hi> so as will make his Seeking acceptable to God, that cannot be, because he is supposed yet to want Grace which alone can make it acceptable: and if his Asking has <hi>the</hi>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:49288:114"/>
               <hi>Nature of Sin,</hi> as in the Article you <hi>do not doubt</hi> but it has, can you expect that Sinning should procure the Grace of God? You will I fear here, without some great help in a very nice Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction from the <hi>School-Authors,</hi> be forced either to renounce your Article in the plain sense of it, and so become a Dissenter from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or else acknowledg Force to be wholly <hi>impertinent</hi> to the business of True Religion and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Another Reason I gave against the <hi>Vsefulness</hi> of Force in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, was, <q>Because the Magistrates of the World, being few of them in the Right-way, (not one of ten, take which side you will) perhaps not one of an hundred, being of the True Religion</q>: 'Tis likely your indirect Way of using Force would do an hundred, or at least ten times as much Harm as Good. To which you reply, <hi>Which would have been to the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> 
               <hi>purpose, if</hi> you <hi>had asserted, that every Magistrate may use Force, your indirect Way (or any Way) to bring Men to his own Religion, whatever that be. But if</hi> you <hi>assert no such thing,</hi> (<hi>as no Man</hi> you <hi>think but an Atheist will assert it) then this is quite beside the Business.</hi> I think I have proved, that if Magistrates of the True Religion may use Force to bring Men to their <hi>Religion,</hi> every Magistrate may use Force to bring Men to his own Religion, when he thinks it the True: And then do you look where the <hi>Atheism</hi> will light.</p>
            <p>In the next Paragraph, having quoted these following Words of mine; where I say, <q>Under another Pretence, you put into the Magistrate's hands as much Power to force Men to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as any the openest Persecutors can pretend to. I ask what difference is there between punishing them to bring them to Mass, and punishing them to bring them to consider those Reasons and Arguments which are proper and sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that they ought to go to Mass?</q> You reply; <hi>A Question which you shall then think your self obliged to answer, when</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> I <hi>have produced those</hi> Reasons and Arguments which are <hi>proper and sufficient to convince Men that they ought to go to Mass.</hi> But if you had not omitted the 3 or 4 immediately preceding Lines, (an Art to serve a good Cause, which puts me in mind of my <hi>Pagans and Mahumetans</hi>) the Reader would have seen that your Reply was nothing at all to my Argument: My Words were these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:49288:114"/>
               <q>Especially, if you consider, that as the Magistrate will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly use it [Force] to force Men to hearken to the <hi>proper Ministers of his Religion,</hi> let it be what it will; so you having set no time nor bounds to this Consideration of Arguments and Reasons short of being convinced, you under another, &amp;c.</q> My Argument is to shew of what advantage Force, your Way apply'd, is like to be to the True Religion, since it puts as much Force into the Magistrate's hands as the openest Persecutors can pretend to, which the Magistrates of wrong Perswasions may and will use as well as those of the true; because your Way sets no other Bounds to Considering short of Complying.

humane Frailty; and he must be well assured of his own Strength, who can peremptorily affirm, he is sure he should have stood, what above a Million of People sunk under: amongst which, 'tis great Confidence to say, there was not one so well perswaded of the Truth of his Religion, as you are of yours; though some of them gave great Proofs of their Perswasion in their Sufferings for it. But what the <hi>necessary</hi> Method of Force may be able to do, to bring any one, in your sense, to any R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>i. e.</hi> to an outward Profession of it, he that thinks himself secure against, must have a greater Assurance of himself, than the Weakness of decayed and depraved Nature will well allow. If you have any Spell against the Force of Arguments, driven with Penalties and Punishments, you will do well to teach it the World; for it is the hard Luck of well-meaning People to be often misled by them, and even the Confident themselves have not seldom fallen under them, and betrayed their Weakness.</p>
            <p>To my demanding, if you meant <hi>Reasons and Arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and sufficient to convince Men</hi> of the Truth, why did you not say so? You reply, <hi>As if it were possible for any Man that reads</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> 
               <hi>your Answer, to think otherwise.</hi> Whoever reads that Passage in your <hi>A. p.</hi> 5. cannot possibly think you meant to speak out, and possibly you found some difficulty to add any thing to your Words (which are these, <hi>Force used to bring Men to consider</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>Reasons and Arguments proper and sufficient to convince them</hi>) that might determine their Sense. For if you had said, <hi>to convince them</hi> of Truth; then the Magistrate must have made Laws, and <hi>used Force</hi> to make Men search after Truth in general, and that would not have served your turn: If you had said to <hi>convince them</hi> of the Truth of the Magistrate's Religion, that would too manifestly have put the Power in every Magistrate's hands, which you tell us, <hi>none but an Atheist will say.</hi> If you had said, <hi>to convince them</hi> of the Truth of your Religion, that had looked too ridiculous to be owned, though it were the thing you meant; and therefore in this strait, where nothing you could say, would well sit your purpose, you wisely choose to leave the Sense imperfect, and name nothing they were to be convinced of, but leave it to be collected by your Reader out of your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, rather than add three Words to make it good Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, as well as intelligible Sense.</p>

To my saying,<q>That if you pretend it must be Arguments to convince Men of the Truth, it would in this Case do you little Service; because the Mass in <hi>France</hi> is as much suppos'd the Truth, as the Liturgy here.</q> You reply, <hi>So that it seems,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 28.</note> 
               <hi>that in your Opinion, whatsoever is suppos'd the Truth, is the Truth, for otherwise this Reason</hi> of mine <hi>is none at all.</hi> If, in my Opinion, the Supposition of Truth authorizes the Magistrate to use the same Means to bring Men to it, as if it were true, my Argument will hold good, without taking all to be true which some Men suppose true. According to this Answer of yours, to suppose or believe his Religion the true, is not enough to authorize the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to use Force, he must know, <hi>i. e.</hi> be infallibly certain, that his is the True Religion. We will for once suppose you our Magistrate, with Force promoting our National Religion. I will not ask you, whether you know that all required of Conformists, is necessary to Salvation: But will suppose one of my Pagans asking you, whether you know Christianity to be the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? If you say, Yes, he will ask you how you know it? and no doubt, but you will give the Answer whereby our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Mission, <hi>John</hi> V. 36. that <hi>the Works which</hi> our Saviour <hi>did bear witness</hi> of him, <hi>that the Father sent him.</hi> The Miracles that Christ did, are a Proof of his being sent from God, and so his Religion the True Religion. But then you will be asked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Whether you know that he did those Miracles, as well as those who saw them done? If you answer, Yes; then it is plain that Miracles are not yet withdrawn, but do still accompany the Christian Religion with all the Efficacy and Evidence, that they had upon the Eye-witnesses of them, and then upon your own Grounds, there will be no necessity of the Magistrate's Assistance, Miracles still supplying the want of it. If you answer, that Matter of fact done out of your sight, at such a distance of Time and Place, cannot be known to you as certainly, as it was to the Eye-witnesses of it, but that you upon very good Grounds firmly believe it; you are then come to believing, that yours is the True Religion, and if that be sufficient to authorize you to use Force, it will authorize any other Magistrate of any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to use Force also. For whoever believes any thing, takes it to be true, and as he thinks upon good Grounds; and those often who believe on the weakest Grounds, have the strongest Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and thus all Magistrates who believe their Religion to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49288:116"/>
be true, will be obliged to use Force to promote it, as if it were the true.</p>
            <p>To my saying that the Usefulness of Force, your Way apply'd, amounts to no more but this, that it is not impossible but that it may be useful. You reply, <hi>I leave it to be judg'd by what has been</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 28.</note> 
               <hi>said;</hi> and I leave it to you your self to judg: Only, that you may not forget, I shall here remind you in short of some of the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>sons I have to say so: 1. You grant that Force has no direct E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>cacy to bring Men to imbrace the Truth. 2. You distinguish the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct</hi> and <hi>at a distance Vsefulness</hi> of your Force, from that which is barely <hi>by accident;</hi> by these two Marks, <hi>viz.</hi> 1st. That Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment on Dissenters for Nonconformity, is, <hi>by those that use it, intended</hi> to make Men consider: and 2d. That your moderate Punishments, by Experience, are found <hi>often successful;</hi> and yours having neither of these Marks, it must be concluded to be useful only by accident: and such an Usefulness, as I said, <q>One cannot deny, to Auricular Confession, doing of Penance, going <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 15.</note> Pilgrimages to Saints, and what not? Yet our Church does not think fit to ufe them; though it cannot be deny'd but they may have some of your <hi>indirect and at a distance Vsefulness;</hi>
               </q>  that is, perhaps may <hi>do some Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>viceindirectly</hi> and by accident. If the Intention of those that use them, and the <hi>Success</hi> they will tell you they find in the use of them, be a Proof of doing Service more than by accident; that cannot be deny'd to them more than to Penalties, your Way applied. To which, let me add, that Niceness and Difficulty there is, to hit that just De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Force; which according to your Hypothesis, must be neither so much as to do harm, nor so little as to be ineffectual; for you your self cannot determine it, makes its Usefulness yet more uncertain and accidential. And after all, let its Efficacy to work upon Mens Minds, be what it will, great or little, it being sure to be imploid ten, or possibly, an hundred times to bring Men to Error, for once that it is imploid to bring Men to the Truth; and where it chances to be imploid, on the side of Truth, it being liable to make an hundred, or perhaps a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand outward Conformists, for one true and sincere Convert; I leave it also to be judg'd what Usefulness it is like to be of.</p>
            <p>To shew the Usefulness of Force, your way apply'd, I said,<q>Where the Law punish'd Dissenters without telling them it is to make them consider, they may through Ignorance and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49288:116"/> neglect to do it.</q> Your Answer is, <hi>But where the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides sufficient means of Instruction for all, as well as Punishment for Dissentors, it is so plain to all concern'd, that the Punishment is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 28.</note> 
               <hi>to make them consider, that</hi> you <hi>see no danger of Mens neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to do it, through Ignorance and Oversight.</hi> I hope you mean by <hi>consider,</hi> so to <hi>consider</hi> as not only to imbrace in an outward Profession (for then all you say is but a poor Fallacy, for such a Considering amounts to no more but bare outward Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;) but so to <hi>consider, study</hi> and <hi>examine</hi> Matters of Religion, as really to imbrace, what one is convinced to be the true, with Faith and Obedience. If it be so plain and easy to understand, that a Law, that speaks nothing of it, should yet be intended to make Men <hi>consider,</hi> search and <hi>study,</hi> to sind out the <hi>Truth that must save them;</hi> I wish you had shew'd us this Plainness. For I confess many of all degrees, that I have purposely asked about it, did not ever see, or so much as dream, that the Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, or against Conventicles, or the Penalties in either of them, were ever intended to make Men seriously study Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make it their business to find the <hi>Truth which must save them;</hi> but barely to make Men conform. But perhaps you have met with Handicrafts-Men, and Country-Farmers, Maid-Servants, and Day-Labourers, who have quicker Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and reason better about the Intention of the Law, for these as well as others are <hi>concern'd.</hi> If you have not, 'tis to be fear'd, your saying <hi>it is so plain, that you see no danger of Mens neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to do it, through Ignorance or Oversight,</hi> is more for its ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your purpose, than from any Experience you have, that it is so.</p>
            <p>When you will enquire into this Matter, you will, I guess, find the People so ignorant amidst that great <hi>Plainness</hi> you speak of, that not one of twenty of any degree, amongst Conformists or Nonconformists, ever understood the Penalty of 12 <hi>d.</hi> a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or any other of our Penal Laws against Nonconformity, to be intended to set Men upon studying the True Religion, and impartially examining what is necessary to Salvation. And if you would come to <hi>Hudibras</hi>'s Decision, I believe he would have a good Wager of it, who should give you a Guinea for each one who had thought so, and receive but a Shilling for every one who had not. Indeed you do not say, it is plain every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but only <hi>where the Law provides sufficient means of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:49288:117"/>
               <hi>for all, as well as Punishments for Dissenters.</hi> From whence, I think it will follow, that that contributes nothing to make it plain, or else that the Law has not provided sufficient means of Instruction in <hi>England,</hi> where so very few find this to be so plain. If by this <hi>sufficient Provision of means of Instruction for all;</hi> you mean, Persons maintain'd at the Publick Charge to preach, and officiate in the publick Exercise of the National Religion; I suppose you needed not this Restriction, there being sew Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which have an establish'd National Religion, where there is not such <hi>means of Instruction provided:</hi> if you intend any other <hi>means of Instruction,</hi> I know none <hi>the Law</hi> has provided in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> but the 39 Articles, the Liturgy, and the Scripture, and how either of them by it self, or these altogether, with a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Clergy, make it plain, that the Penalties laid on Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, are intended to make Men <hi>consider, study, and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally examine Matters of Religion,</hi> you would do well to shew. For Magistrates usually know (and therefore make their Laws ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly) that the People seldom carry either their Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Practice beyond what the express Letter of the Law requires of them. You would do well also to shew, that a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient provision of means of Instruction, cannot but be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to require an effectual Use of them, which the Law that makes that provision says nothing of. But on the contrary, contents it self with something very short of it: For Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Coming to Church, is at least as far from <hi>considering, studying</hi> and <hi>impartially examining</hi> Matters of Religion, so as to <hi>imbrace the Truth upon Conviction and with an obedient Heart,</hi> as being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at a Discourse concerning Mathematicks, and studying Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, so as to become a knowing Mathematician, are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent one from the other.</p>
            <p>People generally think they have done their Duties abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, if they have been at Church, whether they mind any thing done there or no: this they call serving of God, as if it were their whole Duty; so backward are they to understand more, though it be plain the Law of God expresly requires more. But that they have fully satisfied the Law of the Land, no body doubts; nor is it easy to answer what was are ply'd to me on this occasion, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Magistrate <hi>intended</hi> any thing more in those Laws but Consormity, would he not have said it?

            <p>To my saying, <q>Some Dissenters may have consider'd alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and then Force imploid upon them must needs be useless; unless you can think it useful to punish a Man to make him do that which he has done already.</q> You reply, <hi>No Man who</hi>

For without that Supposition, that all Dissenters <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Truth necessary to Salvation,</hi> the Argument and Answer will stand thus. It may be useless to punish all Dissenters to make them <hi>consider,</hi> because some of them may have <hi>consider'd</hi> already.

               <note place="margin">P. 29.</note> 
               <hi>ever you thought them.</hi> Whether you conclude from thence or no, that then there will be a necessity of an <hi>infallible Guide,</hi> and an <hi>implicit Faith,</hi> 'tis nevertheless true, that the greatest part of Men are unable to discern, as I said, between Truth and Falshood depending, upon long and many Proofs, &amp;c. But whether that will make an infallible Guide necessary or no, Imposition in Matters of Religion certainly will: since there can be nothing more absur'd imaginable, than that a Man should take upon him to impose on others in Matters of their Eternal Concernment, without being, or so much as pretending to be <hi>infallible:</hi> For colour it with the name of <hi>Considering</hi> as much as you please, as long as it is to <hi>make Men consider as they ought, and considering as they ought, is</hi> so to consider, as to <hi>imbrace;</hi> the using of Force to make Men <hi>consider,</hi> and the using of Force to <hi>make them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace</hi> any Doctrine or Opinion, is the same thing: and to shew a difference betwixt imposing an Opinion, and using Force to make it be imbrac'd, would require such a piece of Subtilty, as I heard lately from a Learned Man out of the Pulpit, who told us, that though two things, he named, were all one, yet for Distinction's sake, he would divide them. Your Reason for the necessity of an infallible Guide, is, <hi>For if the greatest part of Mankind be not able to discern betwixt Truth and Falshood in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning their Salvation</hi> (<hi>as</hi> I <hi>must mean if</hi> I <hi>speak to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) their Condition must needs be very hazardous, if they have not some Guide or Judg, to whose Determination and Direction they may</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:49288:118"/>
               <hi>securely resign themselves.</hi> And therefore they must resign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>Determination and Direction</hi> of the Civil Magistrate, or be punish'd. Here 'tis like you will have something again to say to my <hi>Modesty and Conscience,</hi> for imputing to you, what you no where say. I grant it, in direct words; but in effect as plainly as may be. The Magistrate may <hi>impose sound Creeds and decent Ceremonies, i. e</hi> such as he thinks sit, for what is <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>decent</hi> he I hope must be Judg, and if he be Judg of what is <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>decent,</hi> it amounts to no more, but what he thinks sit: and if it be not what he thinks sit, why is one Ceremony preferr'd to another? why one Doctrine of the Scripture put into the Creed and Articles, and another as sound left out? They are <hi>Truths necessary to Salvation.</hi> We shall see that in good time, here only I ask, Does the Magistrate only believe them to be Truths and Ceremonies necessary to Salvation, or does he certainly know them to be so? If you say he only believes them to be so, and that that is enough to authorize him to <hi>impose</hi> them, you by your own Confession, authorize Magistrates <hi>to impose</hi> what they think necessary for the Salvation of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Souls; and so the King of <hi>France</hi> did what he was obliged to, when he said he would have all his Subjects saved, and so fell to Dragooning.</p>
            <p>If you say the Magistrate certainly knows them to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation, we are luckily come to an <hi>Infallible Guide.</hi> Well then, the <hi>sound Creeds</hi> are agreed on; the Confession and Liturgy are framed; the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> pitch'd on; and the Terms of Communion thus set up, you have Religion establish'd by Law: and what now is the Subject to do? He is to conform. No; he must first <hi>consid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He does consider the best he can, but finds some things he does not understand, other things he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, assent or consent to. What now is to be done with him? He must either be punished on, or resign himself up to the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Direction of the Civil Magistrate, which till you can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This will be a good Answer to what I objected from the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger most are in to be led into Error, by the Magistrate's adding Force to the Arguments for their National establish'd Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; when you have shewn, that nothing is wont to be impos'd in National Religions, but what is necessary to Salvation; or which will a little better accommodate your Hypothesis, when you can shew that nothing is impos'd, or requir'd for Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but what is <hi>necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and consequently, is very easy and <hi>obvious</hi> to be known, and distinguish'd from Falshood. And indeed, besides what you say here, upon your Hypothesis, that Force is lawful only, because it is <hi>necessary to bring Men to Salvation,</hi> it cannot be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to use it, to bring Men to any thing, but what is absolutely necessary to <hi>Salvation.</hi> For if the Lawfulness of Force be only from the need Men have of it to bring them to <hi>Salvation,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lawfully be used, to bring Men to that, which they do not need, or is not necessary, to their Salvation; for in such an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, it is not needful to their <hi>Salvation.</hi> Can you therefore say, that there is nothing required to be believ'd and profess'd in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but what <hi>lies so obvious and expos'd to all that sincerely and diligently seek it, that no such Person</hi>

If ever you were acquainted with a Country-Parish, you must needs have a strange Opinion of them, if you think all the Plough-Men and Milk-Maids at Church, understood all the Propositions in <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s Creed; 'tis more truly, than I should be apt to think of any one of them, and yet I cannot hence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my self authorized to judg or pronounce them all damn'd: 'tis too bold an Intrenching on the Prerogative of the Almighty, to their own Master they stand or fall.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of Original Sin, is that which is profess'd, and must be owned by the Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as is evident from the 39 Articles, and several Passages in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: and yet I ask you, whether this be <hi>so obvious and expos'd to all that diligently and sincerely seek the Truth,</hi> that one who is in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> sincerely seeking the Truth, may not raise to himself such Difficulties concerning the Doctrine of Original Sin as may puzzle him, though he be a Man of Study; and whether he may not push his Enquiries so far, as to be stagger'd in his Opinion.</p>
            <p>If you grant me this, as I am apt to think you will, then I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether it be not true (notwithstanding what you say concerning the Plainness and Obviousness of Truths necessary to Salvation) that a great part of Mankind may not be able to discern between Truth, and Falshood, in several Points, which are thought so far <hi>to concern their Salvation,</hi> as to be made neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Parts of the National Religion?</p>
            <p>If you say it may be so, then I have nothing farther to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; but shall only advise you not to be so severe hereafter in your Censure of Mr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> as you are, where you tell me, that the <hi>famous Instance</hi> I <hi>give of the two</hi> Reynolds's <hi>is not of any moment to prove the contrary; unless</hi> I <hi>can undertake, that he that erred was as sincere in his Enquiry after that Truth, as</hi> I <hi>suppose him able to examine and judg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will, I suppose, be more charitable another time, when you have consider'd, that neither <hi>Sincerity,</hi> nor Freedom from Error, even in the establish'd Doctrines of their own Church,

is the Privilege of those who join themselves in outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to any National Church whatsoever.

This is all the reason you have, when you speak of the <hi>Reynolds</hi>'s, to suspect one of the Brothers more than the other: And to think, that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> had not as much Sincerity when he quitted, as when he return'd to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is a Partiality, which nothing can justify without pretending to <hi>Infallibility.</hi>

               <hi>giving Offence: Though I hope it will be none to any that have a just Concern for Truth and Piety, to take notice of the Books and Pamphlets which now fly so thick about this Kingdom, manifestly tending to the multiplying of Sects and Divisions, and even to the promoting of</hi> Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism <hi>in Religion among us. In which number,</hi> you say, you <hi>shall not much need</hi> my <hi>pardon, if</hi> you <hi>reckon the First and Second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning Toleration.</hi> Wherein, by a broad Insinuation, you impute the spreading of <hi>Atheism</hi> among us, to the late <hi>Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> made in favour of Protestant Dissenters: and yet all that you take notice of as a proof of this, is, <hi>the Books and Pamphlets which now fly so thick about this Kingdom, manifestly tending to the multiplying of Sects and Divisions, and even to the promoting of Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism in Religion amongst us;</hi> and for instance, you name <hi>the First and Second Letter concerning Toleration.</hi> If one may guess at
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49288:121"/>
the others by these, The <hi>Athcism</hi> and <hi>Scepticism</hi> you accuse them of will have but little more in it, than an Opposition to your Hypothesis; on which, the whole business of Religion must so turn, that whatever agrees not with your System, must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, by Interpretation, be concluded to <hi>tend</hi> to the promoting of <hi>Atheism</hi> or <hi>Scepticism</hi> in Religion. For I challenge you to shew in either of those two Letters you mention, one word ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Epicurism, Atheism</hi> or <hi>Scepticism</hi> in Religion.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, against the next time you are to give an account of <hi>Books and Pamphlets tending to the promoting Scepticism in Religion amongst us.</hi> I shall mind you of the <hi>third Letter concerning Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to be added to the Catalogue, which asserting and building <note place="margin">P. 47.</note> upon this, that <hi>True Religion may be known by those who profess it, to be the only True Religion,</hi> does not a little towards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the Christian Religion to Scepticks. For what greater advantage can be given them, than to teach, that one may know the True Religion? thereby putting into their hands a Right to demand it to be demonstrated to them, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion is true, and bringing on the Professors of it a necessity of doing it. I have heard it complain'd of as one great Artifice of Scepticks, to require Demonstrations where they neither could be had, nor were necessary. But if the True Religion may be known to Men to be so, a Sceptick may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and you cannot blame him if he does not receive your Religion, upon the strongest probable Arguments, without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</p>
            <p>And if one should demand of you Demonstration of the Truths of your Religion, which I beseech you, would you do, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther renounce your Assertion, that it may be known to be true, or else undertake to demonstrate it to him?</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>the decay of the very Life and Spirit of Christianity,</hi> and the <hi>spreading of Epicurism</hi> amongst us: I ask, what can more tend to the promoting of them than this Doctrine, which is to be found in the same Letter, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is <hi>presumable</hi> that those who <hi>conform, do it upon Reason and Conviction?</hi> When you can instance in any thing so much tending to the promoting of <hi>Scepticism in Religion</hi> and <hi>Epicurism,</hi> in <hi>the first or second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning Toleration,</hi> we shall have reason to think you have some ground for what you say.</p>

               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:49288:122"/>
As to <hi>Epicurism,</hi> the spreading whereof you likewise impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And for the Toleration of corrupt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the Debaucheries of Life, neither our Author, nor I do plead for it; but say it is properly the Magistrate's Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by Punishments, to restrain and suppress them. I do not therefore blame your Zeal against <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Epicurism;</hi> but you discover a great Zeal against something else, in charging them on Toleration, when it is in the Magistrate's power to restrain and suppress them by more effectual Laws than those for Church-Conformity. For there are those who will tell you that an outward Profession of the National Religion, even where it is the True Religion, is no more opposite to, or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with <hi>Atheism</hi> or <hi>Epicurism,</hi> than the owning of another Religion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And</hi> you <hi>think</hi> I <hi>might have given you some reason for what</hi> I <hi>say: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is not so self-evident as to need no proof. But</hi> you <hi>think it is</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:49288:123"/>
no hard matter to guess at <hi>my</hi> Reason, though <hi>I</hi> did not think fit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presty to own it. For 'tis obvious enough there can be no other Reason for this Assertion of <hi>mine,</hi> but either the equal Truth, or at least the equal Certainty (or Vncertainty) of all Religions. For whoever considers <hi>my</hi> Assertion, must see, that to make it good <hi>I</hi> shall be obliged to maintain one of these two things. Either, <hi>1.</hi> That no Religion is the true Religion, in opposition to other Religions: Which makes all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions true or false, and so either way indifferent. Or, <hi>2.</hi> That though some one Religion be the true Religion, yet no Man can have any more Reason than another Man of another Religion may have, to believe his to be the true Religion. Which makes all Religions equally certain, (or uncertain, whether <hi>I</hi> please) and so renders it vain and idle to enquire after the true Religion, and only a piece of good luck if any Man be of it, and such good luck as he can never know that he has till he come into the other World. Whether of these two Principles <hi>I</hi> will own, <hi>you</hi> know not. But certainly one or other of them lies at the bottom with <hi>me,</hi> and is the lurking Supposition upon which <hi>I</hi> build all that <hi>I</hi> say.</p>
            <p>Certainly no, Sir, neither of these Reasons you have so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously and friendly found out for me, lies at the bottom; but this, That whatever Privilege or Power you claim, upon your supposing yours to be the true Religion, is equally due to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (who supposes his to be the true Religion) upon the same claim: and therefore that is no more to be allow'd to you than to him. For whose is really the true Religion, yours or his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter in contest betwixt you, your <hi>supposing</hi> can no more determine it on your side, than his <hi>supposing</hi> on his; unless you can think you have a right to judg in your own Cause. You believe yours to be the true Religion, so does he believe his: you say you are certain of it, so says he, he is: you think you have <hi>Arguments proper and sufficient</hi> to convince him, if he would consider them; the same thinks he of his. If this claim, which is equally on both sides, be allow'd to either, without any Proof, 'tis plain he, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> whose favour it is allow'd, is allow'd to be Judg in his own Cause, which no body can have a Right to be, who is not at least infallible. If you come to Arguments and Proofs, which you must do, befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e it can be determin'd whose is the True Religion, 'tis plain your Supposition is not allow'd.</p>
            <p>In our present case, in using Punishments in Religion, your supposing yours to be the True Religion, gives you or your
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49288:123"/>
Magistrate no more Advantage over a Papist, Presbyterian or Mahometan, or more Reason to punish either of them for his Religion, than the same. Supposition in a Papist, Presbyterian or Mahometan gives any of them, or a Magistrate of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, advantage over you, or reason to punish you for your Religion: and therefore this Supposition, to any purpose or privilege of using of Force, is no more to be allow'd to you, than to any one of any other Religion. This the words, <hi>IN THIS CASE,</hi> which I there used, would have satisfied any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have been my meaning: But whether your Charity made you not to take notice of them, or the Joy of such an Advantage as this, not to understand them, this is certain, you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to lose the Opportunity, such a place as this afforded you, of shewing your Gift, in commenting and guessing shrewdly at a Man's Reasons, when he does not <hi>think fit expresly to own them</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>I must own you have a very lucky hand at it, and as you do it here upon the same ground, so it is just with the same Success, as you in another place have exercis'd your Logick on my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing something to the same purpose, as I do here. But, Sir, if you will add but one more to your plentiful stock of Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and observe the difference there is between the ground of any one's supposing his Religion is true, and the Privilege he may pretend to by supposing it true, you will never stumble a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> this again; but you will find, that though upon the former of these Accounts, Men of all Religions cannot be equally allow'd to suppose their Religions true, yet in reference to the Latter, the Supposition may and ought to be allow'd, or deny'd equally to all Men. And the reason of it is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> because the Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance wherewith one Man supposes his Religion to be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more an Argument of its Truth to another, than <hi>vice versâ;</hi> neither of them can claim by the Assurance, wherewith he supposes his Religion the True, any Prerogative or Power over the other, which the other has not by the same Title an equal Claim to, over him. If this will not serve to spare you the pains another time of any more such Reasonings, as we have twice had on this Subject, I think I shall be forced to send you to my <hi>Mahometans</hi> or <hi>Pagans:</hi> and I doubt whether I am not less civil to your Parts than I should be, that I do not send you to them now.</p>

            <p>You go on, <hi>No, Sir, it is enough for that purpose, that there is</hi>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, more than enough, for you, upon them, to prove any National Religion in the World, <hi>the only True Religion.</hi> And till you have proved (for you profess here to have quitted the Supposition of any one's being true, as necessary to your Hypothesis) some Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Religion to be that <hi>only True Religion,</hi> I would gladly know
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49288:124"/>
how it is any where practicable to use Force to bring Men to the True Religion.</p>
            <p>You suppose <hi>there is one True Religion, and but one.</hi> In this we are both agreed: And from hence, I think, it will follow, since whoever is of this True Religion shall be saved, and without being of it no Man shall be saved, that upon your second and third Supposition, it will be hard to shew any National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be this <hi>only True Religion.</hi> For who is it will say, he knows, or that it is knowable, that any National Religion (wherein must be comprehended all that, by the Penal Laws, he is requird to imbrace) is that <hi>only True Religion;</hi> which if Men reject, they shall; and which, if they imbrace, they shall not miss Salvation? Or can you undertake that any National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the World can be <hi>manifested</hi> to be such, <hi>i. e.</hi> in short, to contain all things necessary to Salvation, and nothing but what is so? For that, and that alone, is the <hi>One only True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> without which no body can be saved; and which is enough for the Salvation of every one who imbraces it. And therefore whatever is less or more than this, is not the <hi>One only True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> or that which there is a necessity for their Salvation, Men should be forced to imbrace.</p>
            <p>I do not hereby deny, that there is any National Religion which contains all that is necessary to Salvation, for so doth the Romish Religion, which is not for all that, so much as a True Religion. Nor do I deny, that there are National Religions that contain all things necessary to Salvation, and nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with it, and so may be call'd <hi>True Religions.</hi> But since they all of them joyn with what is necessary to Salvation, a great deal that is not so, and make that as necessary to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as what is necessary to Salvation, not suffering any one to be of their Communion, without taking all together; nor to live amongst them free from Punishment, out of their Communion; will you affirm, that any of the National Religions of the World, which are imposed by Penal Laws, and to which Men are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with Force, can be said to be, that <hi>One only True Religion,</hi> which if Men imbrace, they shall be saved; and which if they imbrace not, they shall be damn'd? And therefore, your two Suppositions, True or False, are not enough to make it practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, upon your Principles of necessity, to use Force upon Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters from the National Religion, though it contain in it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49288:125"/>
but Truth, unless that which is requir'd to Communion be all necessary to Salvation. For whatever is not necessary to Salvation, there is no necessity any one should imbrace. So that whenever you speak of the <hi>True Religion,</hi> to make it to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, you must speak only of what is necessary to Salvation; unless you will say, that in order to the Salvation of Mens Souls, it is necessary to use Force to bring them to imbrace something, that is not necessary to their Salvation. I think that neither you nor any body else, will affirm, that it is necessary to use Force to bring Men to receive all the Truths of the Christian Religion, though they are Truths God has thought sit to reveal. For then, by your own Rule, you who profefs the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, must <hi>know</hi> them all, and must be able to <hi>manifest</hi> them to others; for it is on that here you ground the Necessity and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of Penalties used to bring Men to imbrace the Truth. But I suspect 'tis the good word <hi>Religion</hi> (as in other places other words) has misled you, whilst you content your self with good Sounds, and some confused Notions, that usually accompany them, without annexing to them any precise deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd Signification. To convince you that 'tis not without ground I say this, I shall desire you but to set down what you mean here by <hi>True Religion,</hi> that we may know what in your Sense is, and what is not contain'd in it. Would you but do thus fairly, and define your Words, or use them in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant settled Sense, I think the Controversy between you and me, would be at an end without any farther trouble.</p>
            <p>Having shewed of what advantage they are like to be to you for the making your Method practicable, in the next place let us consider your Suppositions themselves. As to the first, <hi>There is one true Religion, and but one,</hi> we are argeed. But what you say in the next place, That <hi>that one true Religion may be known by those who profess it,</hi> will need a little Examination. As first, it will be necessary to enquire, what you mean by <hi>known,</hi> whether you mean by it Knowledg properly so call'd, as contra-distinguish'd to Belief; or only the assurance of a sirm Belief? If the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tter, I leave you your Supposition to make your use of it, only with this Desire, that to avoid Mistakes, when you do make any use of it, you would call it Believing. If you mean that the true Religion may be <hi>known</hi> with the certainty of Knowledg properly so call'd; I ask you farther, whether that true Religion be to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49288:125"/>
be <hi>known</hi> by the Light of Nature, or needed a Divine Revelation to discover it? If you say (as I suppose you will) the latter; then I ask whether the making out of that to be a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, depends not upon particular matters of Fact, whereof you were no Eye-witness; but were done many Ages before you were born, and if so, by what Principles of Science they can be <hi>known</hi> to any Man now living?</p>
            <p>The Articles of my Religion, and of a great many other such short-sighted People as I am, are Articles of Faith, which we think there are so good grounds to believe, that we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to venture our Eternal Happiness on that Belief: And hope to be of that number of whom our Saviour said, <hi>Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</hi> But we neither think that God requires, nor has given us Faculties capable of knowing in this World several of those Truths which are to be believed to Salvation. If you have a Religion, all whose general Truths are either self-evident, or capable of demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (for matters of Fact are not capable of being any way <hi>known</hi> but to the by-standers) you will do well to let it be known, for the ending of Controversies, and banishing of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror concerning any of those Points out of the World. For whatever may be known, besides matter of Fact, is capable of demonstration, and when you have demonstrated to any one any Point in Religion, you shall have my consent to punish him if he do not assent to it. But yet let me tell you there are many Truths even in Mathematicks, the evidence whereof one Man seeing is able to demonstrate to himself, and so may know them; which Evidence yet he not being able to make another see, (which is to demonstrate to him) he cannot make known to him, though his Scholar be willing, and with all his Power applies himself to learn it.</p>
            <p>But granting your Supposition, That <hi>the one true Religion may be known by those who profess it to be the only true Religion;</hi> will it follow from hence, that because it is knowable to be the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, therefore the Magistrate who prosesses it actually knows it to be so? Without which Knowledg, upon your Principles, he cannot use Force to bring Men to it. But if you are but at hand to assure him, which is the true Religion, for which he ought to use Force, he is bound to believe you; and that will do as well as if he examin'd and knew himself, or perhaps better. For
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49288:126"/>
you seem not well satisfied with what the Magistrates have lately done, without your leave, concerning Religion in <hi>England.</hi> And I confess the easiest way to remove all Difficulties in the Case, is for you to be the Magistrates infallible Guide in matters of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ligion. And therefore you do well here also to keep to your safe Stile, lest if your Sense were clear and determin'd, it might be more exposed to Exceptions; and therefore you tell us the true Religion may be known <hi>by those</hi> who profess it. For not saying <hi>by some of those,</hi> or <hi>by all those,</hi> the Error of what you say is not so easily observed, and requires the more trouble to come at: Which I shall spare my self here, being satisfied, that the Magistrate who has so full an imployment of his Thoughts in the Cares of the Government, has not an over-plus of leisure to attain that Knowledg which you require, and so usually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himself with believing.</p>
            <p>Your next Supposition is, That <hi>the one true Religion may also be manifested to be such, by the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

But because this seems to be spoken more in reference to those who do not receive it, as appears by these following Words of yours; <hi>Then 'tis altogether as plain that it may be very reasonable and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 84.</note> 
               <hi>necessary for some Men to change their Religion; and that it may be made appear to them to be so. And then, if such Men will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what is offer'd to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49288:126"/>
me, but that yours is the only true Religion I am not Religion. Which is so direct and sufficient an <hi>Excuse</hi> to the Magistrate, that had he an express Commission from Heaven to punish all those who did not consider, he could not yet justly punish any one whom he could not convince had not consider'd. But you endeavour to avoid this, by what you infer from this your Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>then it may be very fit and reasonable, for any</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 48.</note> 
               <hi>thing</hi> I <hi>have said to the contrary, to require Men under convenient Penalties to forsake their false Religions, to imbrace the true, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>order to the bringing them to consideration.</hi> Whether I <hi>have said any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> no, the Readers must judg, and I need not repeat. But now I say, it is neither <hi>just</hi> nor <hi>reasonable</hi> to <hi>require Men, under Penalties,</hi> to attain one end, <hi>in order</hi> to bring them to use the means not necessary to that, but to another end. For where is it you can say (unless you will return to your old Supposition, of yours being the true Religion; which you say is <note place="margin">P. 47.</note> not necessary to your method) that Men are by the Law <hi>required to forsake their false Religions, and imbrace the true?</hi> The utmost is this, in all Countries where the National Religion is imposed by Law, Men are <hi>required under the Penalties</hi> of those Laws out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to conform to it; which you say is <hi>in order</hi> to make them consider. So that your Punishments are for the attaining one end, <hi>viz.</hi> Conformity <hi>in order</hi> to make Men use <hi>consideration,</hi> which is a means not necessary to that, but another end, <hi>viz.</hi> finding out and imbracing the one true Religion. For however <hi>consideration</hi> may be a necessary means to find and imbrace the one true Religion, it is not at all a necessary means to outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the Communion of any Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To manifest the consistency and</hi> practicableness <hi>of your</hi> Method, <hi>to the Question, what advantage would it be to the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if Magistrates did every where so punish? You answer,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 51.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> by the Magistrates punishing, if <hi>I</hi> speak to the purpose, <hi>I</hi> must mean their punishing Men for rejecting the true Religi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n (so tender'd to them, as has been said) in order to the bringing them to consider and imbrace it. Now before we can suppose Magistrates every where so to punish, we must suppose the true Religion to be every where the National Religion. And if this were the case; <hi>you</hi> think it is evident <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nough, what advantage to the true Religion it would be, if Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates every where did so punish. For then we might reasonably hope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hat all f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:49288:127"/>
more the only Religion in the World: Whereas if Magistrates should not so punish, it were much to be fear'd (especially considering what has already happen'd) that on the contrary false Religions, and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism, as more agreeable to the Soil, would daily take deeper Root, and propagate themselves, till there were no room left for the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (which is but a foreign Plant) in any Corner of the World.</p>
            <p>If you can make it <hi>practicable</hi> that the Magistrate should <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Men for rejecting the True Religion,</hi> without judging which is the True Religion: or if True Religion could appear in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, take the Magistrate's Seat, and there judg all that rejected her, something might be done. But the mischief of it is, it is a Man that must condemn, Men must punish, and Men cannot do this, but by judging, who is guilty of the Crime, which they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish. An Oracle, or an Interpreter of the Law of Nature who speaks as clearly, tells the Magistrate, he may and ought to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish those, <hi>who reject the True Religion, tender'd with sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> The Magistrate is satisfied of his Authority, and believes this Commission to be good. Now I would know how possibly he can execute it, without making himself the Judg, 1. What is the True Religion; unless the Law of Nature at the same time deliver'd into his Hands the 39 Articles of the One only True Religion, and another Book wherein all the Ceremonies and outward Worship of it are contain'd. But it being certain, that the Law of Nature has not done this; and as certain, that the Articles, Ceremonies and Discipline of this One only True Religion, have been often varied in several Ages and Countries, since the Magistrate's Commission by the Law of Nature was first given: there is no Remedy left, but that the Magistrate must judg what is the True Religion, if he must punish them who reject it. Suppose the Magistrate be commission'd to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish those who depart from <hi>right Reason,</hi> the Magistrate can yet never punish any one, unless he be Judg what is right Reason; and then judging that Murder, Theft, Adultery, Narrow Cart-Wheels, or want of Bows and Arrows in a Man's House, are against right Reason, he may make Laws to punish Men guilty of those, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> right Reason.</p>
            <p>So if the Magistrate in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> having a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to punish those who <hi>reject the One only True Religion,</hi> judges the Religion of his National Church to be it, 'tis possible for him to lay Penalties on those who reject it, pursuant to that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49288:127"/>
Commission; otherwise, without judging that to be the <hi>One on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly True Religion,</hi> 'tis wholly impracticable for him to punish those who imbrace it not, as Rejecters of the <hi>One only True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To provide as good a <hi>Salvo</hi> as the thing will bear, you say, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But we see the contrary; for let the National Religion be what it will before, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate doth not always fall into it and imbrace that; but if he thinks not that, but some other the <hi>True,</hi> the first Opportunity he has, he changes the National Religion into that which he judges <hi>the True,</hi> and then punishes the Dissenters from it; where his Judgment, which is <hi>the True Religion,</hi> always necessarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes, and is that which ultimately does, and must determine who are Rejecters of the <hi>True Religion,</hi> and so obnoxi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That it be directly useful for the promoting some greater Good.</q> 'Tis evident by these Words, that Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brings direct Evil upon a Man, and therefore it should not be used but where it is directly useful for the procuring some greater Good. In this case, the signification of the Word <hi>directly,</hi>

carries a manifest Reason in it, to any one who understands what <hi>directly</hi> means.

               <note place="margin">P. 30.</note> 
               <hi>as</hi> you <hi>take to be useful for promoting the true Religion, upon the bare usefulness of such Force, but upon the necessity as well as usefulness of it;</hi> and therefore you declare it <hi>to be no fit means to be used, either for that purpose or any other, where it is not necessary as well as useful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How useful Force in the Magistrate's Hand, for bringing Men to the true Religion, is like to be, we have shewn in the foregoing Chapter, in answer to what you have said for it. So that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proved not useful, it is impossible it should be necessary. However we will examine what you say to prove the necessity of it. The Foundation you build on for its necessity we have in your <hi>Argument considered,</hi> where having at large dilated on Mens <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> inconsiderateness in the choice of their Religions, and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in those they have once chosen, without due Examination, you conclude thus; <hi>Now if this be the case, if Men are so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is there left?</hi> Wherein you suppose Force necessary, instead of proving it to be so; for Preaching and Perswasion not prevailing upon all Men, you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own Authority think fit something else should be done; and that being resolv'd, you readily pitch on Force, because you say you can find nothing else, which in effect is only to tell us, if the Salvation of Mens Souls were only left to your discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how you would order the matter.</p>
            <p>And in your answer to me, you very considently tell us, <note place="margin">P. 7.</note> 
               <hi>the true Religion cannot prevail without the assistance either of Miracles, or of Authority.</hi> I shall here only observe one or two things, and then go on to examine how you make this good.</p>
            <p>The first thing I shall observe is, that in your <hi>Argument consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c.</hi> you suppose Force necessary only to master the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion there is in Men to <hi>considering</hi> and <hi>examination:</hi> And here in
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49288:130"/>
your Answer to me, you make Force necessary to conquer the aversion there is in Men <hi>to imbrace</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> the true Religion. Which are so very different, that the former justisies the use of Force only to make Men <hi>consider,</hi> the other justisies the use of Force to make Men <hi>imbrace</hi> Religion. If you meant the same thing when you writ your first Trtatise, it was not very ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to express your self in such Words as were not proper to give your Reader your true meaning; it being a far different thing to use Force to make Men <hi>consider,</hi> which is an action in their power to do or omit; and to use Force to make them <hi>imbrace,</hi> i. e. <hi>believe</hi> any Religion, which is not a thing in any ones power to do or forbear as he pleases. If you say you meant barely considering in your first Paper, as the whole current of it would make one believe, then I see your Hypothesis may mend, as we have seen in other parts, and in time, may grow to its full Stature.</p>
            <p>Another thing I shall remark to you, is, That in your first Paper, besides Preaching and Perswasion, and the Grace of God, nothing but <hi>Force</hi> was necessary. Here in your second, it is <hi>either Miracles or Authority,</hi> which how you make good, we will now consider.</p>
            <p>You having said, you had <hi>no reason from any Experiment or expect</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A. <hi>p. 2.</hi> L. 2. <hi>p. 3.</hi>

You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <note place="margin">P. 5.</note> that it has not the same Beauty, Force and Reasonableness now, that it had then, unless I <hi>include Miracles</hi> too, which are now ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>If therefore we will believe you upon your own word, Force being <hi>necessary</hi> (for prove it necessary you never can) you have enter'd into the Counsel of God, and tell us, when <hi>Force</hi> could not be had, <hi>Miracles</hi> were imploy'd to supply its want. <hi>I cannot but think,</hi> say you, <hi>it's highly probable (if we may be allowed to guess at</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 37.</note> 
               <hi>the Counsels of insinite Wisdom) that God was pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them till then,</hi> i. e. till the Laws of the Empire suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Christanity, <hi>not so much for any necessity there was of them all that time, for the evincing the Truth of the Christian Religion, as to supply the want of the Magistrate's Assistance.</hi> You allow your self to guess very frelly, when you will make God use <hi>Miracles</hi>

That the Apostles could lay on Punishments, as troublesome and as great as any <hi>political</hi> ones when they were necessary, we see in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira:</hi> And he that had <hi>all Power given him in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> could, if he had thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <note place="margin">P. 36.</note> 
               <hi>so neither was there any need that he should. He came as a Prophet sent from God to reveal a new Doctrine to the World; and therefore to prove his Mission, he was to do such things as could only be done by a Divine Power: And the Works which he did were abundantly sufficien both to gain him a hearing, and to oblige the World to receive his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> Thus the want of Force and Punishments are supplied. How far? so far as they are supposed necessary <hi>to gain a hearing,</hi> and so far as to <hi>oblige the World to receive Christ's Doctrine;</hi> whereby, as I suppose, you mean <hi>sufficient</hi> to lay an Obligation on them to receive his Doctrine, and render them inexcusable if they did not: But that they were not <hi>sufficient</hi> to make all that saw them effectually to receive and imbrace the Gospel, I think is evident, and you will not I imagine say, that all who saw Christ's Miracles believed on him. So that Miracles were not to supply the want of such Force, as was to be continued on Men to make them <hi>consider as they ought,</hi> i. e. <hi>till they imbraced the Truth that must save them.</hi> For we have little reason to think that our Saviour, or his Apostles, contended with their neglect or refusal by a constant train of Miracles, continued on to those who were not wrought upon by the Gospel preached to them. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, XIII. 57. that he did not many mighty works <note place="margin">Lightfoot <hi>Harm. of the N. T.</hi> Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So that the want of Force to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these purposes not being supplied by <hi>Miracles,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel 'tis plain subsisted and spread it self without Force so made use of, and without <hi>Miracles</hi> to supply the want of it' and therefore it so far remains true, that the Gospel having the same Beauty, Force and Reasonableness now as it had at the beginning, it wants not Force to supply the defect of <hi>Miracles,</hi> to that for which Miracles were no where made use of. And so far, at least,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49288:132"/>
the Experiment is good, and this Assertion true, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is able to prevail by its own Light and Truth, without the continuance of Force on the same Person, or punishing Men fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>In which Words, if you mean any answer to my Argument, it is this, that Force is necessary, because <hi>to bring Men into the right way</hi> there is other <hi>HUMANE Means</hi> necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides Admonitions and Perswasions.

think this is as good an Argument for the highest, as yours is for the lower <hi>Penalties.</hi> When <hi>Admonitions and Intreaties will not prevail,</hi> then Penalties, <hi>lower Penalties, some degrees of Force will be necessary,</hi> say you, <hi>as an HUMANE Means.</hi> And when your <hi>lower Penalties, your some degrees</hi> of Force will not prevail, then higher Degrees will be necessary, say I, as <hi>an HUMANE Means.</hi> And my reason is the same with yours, because <hi>there is no other Means</hi> (i. e. <hi>HUMANE Means) left.</hi> Shew me how your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument concludes for lower Punishments being necessary, and mine not for higher, even to Dragooning, &amp; <hi>eris mihi magnus Apollo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us apply this to your Succedaneum of Miracles, and then it will be much more admirable. You tell us, Admonitions and Intreaties not prevailing to bring Men into the right way, <hi>Force is necessary,</hi> because there is <hi>no other Means left.</hi> To that 'tis said, yes, there is other Means left, the Grace of God. Ay, but, say you, that will not do; because you speak <hi>only of HU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANE Means.</hi> So that according to your way of arguing some <hi>other HUMANE Means</hi> is necessary: For you your self tell us, that the Means you were speaking of, where you say, that when <hi>Admonitions and Intreaties will not do, what other Means is there left but Force? were HUMANE Means.</hi> Your words are, <hi>Which any one, who reads that Paragraph, will find to be only HUMANE Means.</hi> By this Argument then <hi>other HUMANE Means</hi> are <hi>necessary</hi> besides preaching and perswasion, and those <hi>HUMANE Means</hi> you have found out to be either <hi>Force</hi> or <hi>Miracles:</hi> The latter are certainly notable <hi>Humane Means.</hi> And your distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Humane</hi> Means serves you to very good purpose, having brought Miracles to be one of your <hi>Humane Means.</hi> Preaching and Admonitions, say you, are not sufficient to bring Men into the right way, something else is <hi>necessary,</hi> Yes, the Grace of God; no, say you, that will not do, it is not <hi>Humane</hi> Means: 'tis necessary to have other <hi>Humane Means,</hi> therefore in the three or four First Centuries after Christianity, the insufficiency of Preaching and Admonitions was made up with <hi>Miracles,</hi> and thus the necessity of other <hi>Humane Means</hi> is made good. But to consider a little further your <hi>Miracles</hi> as supplying the want of Force.</p>
            <p>The Question between us here is, whether the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion did not prevail in the first Ages of the Church, by its own
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49288:133"/>

            </p>
            <p>If the Testimony, of Miracles having been done, wore sufficient to make the Gospel prevail, without Force, on those, who were not Eye-Witnesses of them, we have that still, and so upon that account need not <hi>Force</hi> to supply the want of it: But if Truth must have either the Law of the Country, or actual <hi>Miracles</hi> to <hi>support</hi> it, what became of it after the Reign of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, under all those Emperors, that were erroneous or Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal?

The History therefore you have from him of Miracles, serves for his Hypothesis, but not at all for yours. For if they were continued to supply the want of Force, which was to deal with the <hi>Corruption</hi> of depraved Humane Nature, that being without any great variation in the World, constantly the same, there could be no reason why they should abate and fail, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and <hi>revive</hi> again. So that there being then, as you suppose, no necessity of Miracles for any other end, but <hi>to supply the want of the Magistrate's Assistance,</hi> they must, to sute that end, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and regularly the same, as you would have Force to be, which is steadily and uninterruptedly to be applied, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly necessary Remedy, to the corrupt Nature of Mankind.</p>
            <p>If you allow the Learned <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s Reasons, for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Miracles, till the Fourth Century, your Hypothesis, that they were continued to supply the Magistrate's Assistance, will be only precarious. For if there was need of Miracles till that time to other purposes, the continuation of them in the Church, though you could prove them to be, as frequent and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as those of our Saviour, and the Apostles, it would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage your cause: since it would be no evidence, that they were used for that end, which as long as there were other visible uses of them, you could not, without Revelation, assure us were made use of by Divine Providence <hi>to supply the want of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate's Assistance.</hi> You must therefore confute his Hypothesis, before you can make any advantage of what he says, concerning the continuation of Miracles, for the establishing of yours. For till you can shew, that that which he assigns was not the end, for which they were continued in the Church; the utmost you can say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>is, that it may be imagined, that one reason of their continuation was <hi>to supply the want of the Magistrate's Assistance:</hi> But what you can without proof imagine possible, I hope you do not expect should be received as an unquestionable proof, that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>as so. I can imagin it possible they were not continued for that end, and one Imagination will be as good a proof as another.</p>
            <p>To do your Modesty right therefore, I must allow, that you do faintly offer at some kind of reason, to prove that Miracles were continued <hi>to supply the want of the Magistrate's Assistance:</hi> And since God has no where declared, that it was for that end, you would perswade us in this Paragraph, that it was so, by two
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49288:135"/>
Reasons. One is, that the Truth of the Christian Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficiently evinced by the Miracles done by our Saviour and his Apostles, and perhaps their immediate Successors, there was no other need of Miracles to be continued till the Fourth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and therefore they were used by God <hi>to supply the want of the Magistrate's Assistance.</hi> This I take to be the meaning of these Words of yours, <hi>I cannot but think it highly probable that God was pleased to continue them till then, not so much for any necessity there was of them all that while for the evincing the Truth of the Christian Religion, as to supply the want of the Magistrate's Assistance.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, I suppose, you do not barely intend to tell the World what is your opinion in the case, but use this as an Argument, to make it probable to others, that this was the end for which Miracles were continued, which at best will be but a very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Probability to build such a bold Assertion on, as this of yours is, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Christian Religion is not able to subsist and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ail in the World, by its own Light and Strength, without the assistance either of Force, or</hi> actual <hi>Miracles.</hi> And therefore you must either produce a Declaration from Heaven that authorizes you to say, that Miracles were used <hi>to supply the want of Force,</hi> or shew that there was no other use of them but this. For if any other use can be assigned of them, as long as they continued in the Church, one may safely deny, that they were <hi>to supply the want of Force:</hi> and it will lie upon you to prove it by some other way than by saying you <hi>think it highly probable.</hi> For I suppose you do not expect that your <hi>thinking</hi> any thing <hi>highly probable,</hi> should be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reason for others to acquiesce in. When perhaps, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Miracles considered, no Body could bring himself to say he thought it <hi>probable,</hi> but one whose Hypothesis stood in need of such a poor support.</p>
            <p>The other Reason you seem to build on is this, That when <hi>Christianity was received for the Religion of the Empire,</hi> Miracles ceased; because there was then no longer any need of them: which I take to be the Argument infinuated in these Words, <hi>Considering that those extraordinary means were not withdrawn, till by</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 37.</note> 
               <hi>their help Christianity had prevailed to be received for the Religion of the Empire.</hi> If then you can make it appear that Miracles lasted <hi>till Christianity was received for the Religion of the Empire,</hi> without any other Reason for their continuation, <hi>but to supply the wants of the Magistrate's Assistance;</hi> and that they ceased as soon as the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:49288:136"/>
Magistrates became Christian: Your Argument will have some kind of probability, that within the Roman Empire this was the method God used for the propagating the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But it will not serve to make good your Position, That the Christian Religion cannot subsist <hi>and prevail by its own Strength and Light, without the assistance of Miracles or Authority,</hi> unless you can shew, that God made use of Miracles, to introduce and support it in other parts of the World, not subject to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, till the Magistrates there also became Christians. For the corruption of Nature being the same without, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bounds of the Roman Empire; Miracles, upon your Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, were as necessary to supply the want of the Magistrate's Assistance in other Countries as in the Roman Empire. For I do not think you will find the <hi>Civil Sovereigns</hi> were the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in all those Countries, where the Christian Religion was planted after <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Reign: And in all those it will be necessary for you to shew us the Assistance of <hi>Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us see how much your Hypothesis is favoured by Church-History. If the Writings of the Fathers of greatest Name and Credit are to be believed, Miracles were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn when <hi>Christianity had prevail'd to be received for the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Empire. Athanasius,</hi> the great Defender of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Orthodoxy, writ the Life of his Contemporary St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> full of Miracles; which though some have question'd, yet the Learned <hi>Dodwell</hi> allows to be writ by <hi>Athanasius:</hi> and the Stile evinces it to be his, which is also confirmed by other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Writers.</p>
            <p>Palladius <hi>tells us, That</hi> Ammon did many Miracles: But that particularly St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> related in the Life of <hi>Anthony,</hi> That <hi>Ammon</hi> going with some Monks, <hi>Anthony</hi> had sent to him; when they came to the River <hi>Lycus,</hi> which they were to pass, was afraid to strip for fear of seeing himself naked; and whilst he was in dispute of this matter, he was taken up, and in an extasy carry'd over by an Angel, the rest of the Monks swimming the River. When he came to <hi>Anthony, Anthony</hi> told him he had sent for him, because God had revealed many things to him concerning him, and particularly his Translation. And when <hi>Ammon</hi> died, in his retirement, <hi>Anthony</hi> saw his Soul carried into Heaven by Angels. <hi>Palladius in vita Ammonis.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> was thought worthy of the Vision of God, and led a Life perfectly conformable to the Laws of Christ. This whoever reads the Book, wherein is contain'd the History of his Life, will easily know; wherein he will also see Prophecy shining out: For he prophesied very clearly of those who were infected with the Arian Contagion, and foretold what Mischief from them was threatned to the Churches, God truly reuealing all these things to him, which is certainly the principal evidence of the Catholick Faith. No such Man being to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Hereticks. But do not take this upon my Word, but read and study the Book it self.</p>

It is not now two Years since that Shrine has been at <hi>Hippo:</hi> And many of the Books (which I certainly knew to be so) not being published, those which are published concerning those miraculous Operations, amounted to near fifty when I writ this. But at <hi>Calama,</hi> where this Shrine was before, there are more published, and their number is incomparably greater. At <hi>Uzal</hi> also a Colony, and near <hi>Utica,</hi> we know many famous Things to have been done by the same Martyr.</p>

So that at <hi>Hippo</hi> alone, in two Years time, we may count, besides those omitted, there were published a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 600 Miracles, and, as he says, <hi>incomparably more</hi> at <hi>Calama:</hi> besides what were done by other Reliques of the same St. <hi>Stephen</hi> in other parts of the World, which cannot be suppos'd to have had less virtue than those sent to this part of <hi>Africa.</hi> For the Reliques of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> discovered by the Dream of a Monk, were divided and sent into distant Countries, and there distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to several Churches.</p>
            <p>These may suffice to shew, that if the Fathers of the Church of great it Name and Authority are to be believed, Miracles were not withdrawn, but continued down to the latter end of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49288:137"/>

            <p>This being so, you must either deny the Authority of these Fathers, or grant that Miracles continued in the Church after <hi>Christianity was received for the Religion of the Empire:</hi> and then they could not be to <hi>supply the want of the Magistrate's Assistance,</hi> unless they were to supply the want of what was not wanting; and therefore they were continued for some other end. Which end of the Continuation of Miracles, when you are so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in, as to be able to assure us, that it was different from that for which God made use of them in the 2d and 3d Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies: when you are so far admitted into the Secrets of Divine Providence, as to be able to convince the World that the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles between the Apostles and <hi>Constantine's</hi> Time, or any other Period you shall pitch on, were <hi>to supply the want of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate's Assistance,</hi> and those after, for some other purpose, what you say may deserve to be consider'd.

All the Assistance the true Religion needs from Authority, is only a Liberty for it, to be truly taught; but it has seldom had that, from the Powers in being, in its first entry into their Dominions, since the withdrawing of Miracles: And yet I desire you to tell me, into what Country the Gospel, accompanied (as now it is) only with past Miracles, hath been brought by the Preaching of Men, who have labour'd in it after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apostles, where it did not so prevail over Mens Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, that <hi>as many as were ordain'd to eternal Life,</hi> consider'd <hi>and believ'd</hi> it.

Or is this your way of Force and Punishment? If it be not, your's is not what Miracles came to supply the room of, and so is not necessary. For you tell us, they are punish'd to <hi>make them consider,</hi> and they can never be suppos'd to consider <hi>as they ought, whilst they persist in rejecting;</hi> and therefore, they are justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd <note place="margin">P. 24, 25.</note> to make them so consider: So that not so <hi>considering,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Fault</hi> for which they are punish'd, and the Amendment of that Fault the end which is design'd to be attain'd by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, the Punishment must continue. But Men were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways heat upon with Miracles. To this, perhaps you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the seeing of a Miracle or two, or half a dozen, was sufficient <hi>to procure a hearing;</hi> but that being punish'd once or twice, or half a dozen times, is not; for you tell us, the <hi>Power</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 36.</note> 
               <hi>of Miracles communicated to the Apostles, served altogether, as well as Punishment, to procure them a hearing:</hi> Where, if you mean by <hi>Hearing,</hi> only Attention, who doubts but Punishment may also procure that? if you mean by <hi>Hearing,</hi> receiving and imbracing, what is propos'd, that even Miracles themselves did not effect upon all Eye-witnesses. Why then, I beseech you, if one be to supply the place of the other, is one to be continued on those who do <hi>reject,</hi> when the other was never long continued, nor, as I think, we may safely say, often repeated to those, who persisted in their former Perswasions?</p>
            <p>After all therefore, may not one justly doubt, whether Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles supplied the place of Punishment; nay, whether you your self, if you be true to your own Principles, can think so? You tell us, that not to join <hi>themselves to the True Church, where suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidence is offered to convince Men that it is so, is a Fault that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> 
               <hi>it cannot be unjust to punish.</hi> Let me ask you now; Did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, by their Preaching and Miracles, offer <hi>sufficient Evidence</hi>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:49288:139"/>
to convince Men that the Church of Christ was the <hi>True Church;</hi> or, which is, in this case, the same thing, that the Doctrine they preach'd was the <hi>True Religion?</hi> If they did, were not those, who persisted in Unbelief, guilty of a <hi>Fault?</hi> And if some of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles done in those days, should now be repeated, and yet Men should not imbrace the Doctrine, or join themselves to the Church which those Miracles accompanied, would you not think them guilty of a <hi>Fault,</hi> which the Magistrate might justly, nay, ought to <hi>punish?</hi> If you would answer truly and sincerely to this Question, I doubt you would think your beloved Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments necessary notwithstanding Miracles, <hi>there being no other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nay, Sir, since the true Religion, as you tell us cannot prevail or subsist without, <hi>Miracles or Authority,</hi> i. e. your moderate Force; it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follow, that the Christian Religion has, in all Ages and Countries, been accompanied either with actual Miracles, or such Force: which, whether it be so or no, I leave you and all sober Men to consider.

               </gap> with your bold Assertion: That the Christian <hi>Religion,</hi> as delivered in the New Testament,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:49288:140"/>
cannot <hi>prevail by its own Light, and Strength, without the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> of your moderate Penalties, or of actual <hi>Miracles</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it. But if ever since the withdrawing of Miracles in all Christian Countries, where Force has been thought necessary by the Magistrate to support the National, or (as every where it is called) the true Religion, those Severities have been made use of, which you (for a good Reason) <hi>condemn, as apter to hinder, than promote the true Religion;</hi> 'tis plain that Miracles supplied the want of such an <hi>Assistance</hi> from the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> as was <hi>apter to bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, than promote the true Religion.</hi> And your substituting of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, to supply the want of moderate Force, will shew nothing, for your Cause, but the zeal of a Man so sond of Force, that he will without any warrant from Scripture, enter into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of the Almighty; and without authority from History, talk of Miracles, and Political Anministrations, as may best sute his System.</p>
            <p>To my saying, a Religion that is from God, wants not the assistance of Humane Authority to make it prevail; you answer, This <hi>is not simply nor always true. Indeed when God takes the matter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 8.</note> 
               <hi>wholly into his own Hands, as he does at his first revealing any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there can be no need of any assistance of Humane Authority: but when God has once sufficiently settled his Religion in the World, so that if Men from thenceforth will do what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ey may and ought, in their several Capacities, to preserve and propagate it, it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and prevail without that extraordinary Assistance from him, which was necessary for its first establishment.</hi> By this Rule of yours, how long was there need of Miracles to make Christianity subsist and prevail? If you will keep to it, you will find there was no need of Miracles, after the promulgation of the Gospel by Christ and his Apostles; for I ask you, was it not then so <hi>sufficiently settled in the World, that if Men would from thenceforth have done what they might and ought, in their several Capacities,</hi> it would have subsisted and prevailed without that <hi>extraordinary assistance</hi> of Miracles? unless you will on this occasion retract what you say in other places, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a Fault not to receive the <hi>true Religion, where sufficient evidence is offered to convince Men that it is so.</hi> If then from the times of the Apostles, the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has had sufficient evidence, that it is the true Religion, and <hi>Men did their Duty,</hi> i. e. receive it, it would certainly have subsisted and prevailed, even from the Apostles Times, without
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49288:140"/>
that extraordinary Assistance, and then Miracles after that were not necessary.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you will say, that by <hi>Men in their several Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> you mean the Magistrates. A pretty way of speaking, proper to you alone: But even in that Sense, it will not serve your turn. For then there will be need of Miracles, not only in the time you propose, but in all times after. For if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, who is as much subject as other Men to that Corruption of Humane Nature, by which you tell us False Religions prevall against the True, should not do <hi>what he may and ought,</hi> so as to be of the true Religion, as 'tis the odds he will not, what then will become of the true Religion, which according to you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subsist or prevail without either the <hi>Assistance of Miracles or Authority?</hi> Subjects cannot have the Assistance of <hi>Authority,</hi> where the Magistrate is not of the true Religion; and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate wanting the <hi>assistance of Authority</hi> to bring him to the true Religion, that want must be still supplied with Miracles, or else, according to your Hypothesis, all must go to wrack; and <hi>the True Religion,</hi> that cannot subsist <hi>by its own Strength and Light,</hi> must be lost in the World. For I presume you are scarce yet such an Adorer of the Powers of the World, as to say, that Magistrates are privileged from that common Corruption of Mankind, whose opposition to the true Religion you suppose cannot be overcome, without the <hi>assistance of Miracles or Force.</hi> The Flock will stray, unless the Bell-weather conduct them right; the Bell-weather himself will stray, unless the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's Crook and Staff (which he has as much need of as any Sheep of the Flock) keep him right. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The whole Flock will stray, unless the Bell-weather have that assistance which is necessary to conduct him right. The Case is the same here. So that by your own Rule, either there was no need of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to supply the want of Force, after the Apostles time, or there is need of them still.</p>
            <p>But your Answer, when looked into, has something in it more excellent. I say, a Religion that is of God, wants not the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Humane Authority to make it prevail. You answer, <hi>True, when God takes the matter into his own Hands. But when once</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 8.</note> 
               <hi>he has sufficiently settled Religion, so that if Men will but do what they may and ought, it may subsist without that extraordinary assistance from Heaven; then he leaves it to their Care.</hi> Where you suppose,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49288:141"/>
if Men will do their Duties in their several Capacities, true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, being once establish'd, may subsist without Miracles. And is it not as true, that if they will, in <hi>their several Capacities, do what they may and ought,</hi> true Religion will also subsist without Force? But you are sure Magistrates will do <hi>what they may and ought, to preserve and propagate the true Religion,</hi> but Subjects will not. If you are not, you must bethink your self how to answer that old Question,
<q>
                  <l>—Sed quis custodiet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>To my having said, that prevailing without the assistance of Force, I thought was made use of as an Argument for the Truth of Christian Religion. You reply, that you hope <hi>I am mistaken, for sure this is a very bad</hi> Argument, <hi>That the Christian Religion,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 6.</note> 
               <hi>so contrary in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>eer,</hi> which is not any where used by me, I will not examine. The Question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Christian Religion, such as it was then, (for I know not any other Christian Religion) and is still <hi>contrary to the Flesh and Blood, and to the Powers of Darkness,</hi> prevail'd not without the assistance of Humane Force, by those aids it has still? This, I think, you will not deny to be an Argument used for its Truth by Christians, and some of our Church. How far any one in the use of this Argument, pleases or displeases you, I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. All the use I made of it was to shew, that it is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that the Christian Religion did prevail, without that <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Means</hi> of the <hi>coactive Power</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> which you assumed to be <hi>necessary;</hi> and this, I think, makes good the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49288:141"/>
Experiment I brought. Nor will your seeking, your way, a Refuge, in Miracles, help you to evade it; as I have already shewn.</p>
            <p>But you give a Reason for what you say, in these following words; <hi>For neither does the True Religion always prevail without</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 6.</note> 
               <hi>the Assistance of the Powers in being; nor is that always the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which does so spread and prevail.</hi> Those who use the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of its prevailing without Force, for the Truth of the Christian Religion, 'tis like will tell you, that, if it be true, as you say, that the Christian Religion (which at other times does) some-times does not prevail without the Assistance of the Powers in being, it is, because when it fails, it wants the due Assistance and Diligence of the Ministers of it. <hi>How shall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> How shall the Gospel be spread and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, if those who take on them to be the Ministers and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it, either neglect to teach it others as they ought, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it not by their Lives? If therefore you will make this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any use to you, you must shew, where it was, that the Ministers of the Gospel, doing their Duty by the Purity of their Lives, and their interrupted Labour, in being instant in season and out of season, have not been able to make it prevail. An Instance of this, 'tis believed you will scarco find: And if this be the case, that it fails not to prevail where those, whose Charge it is, neglect not to teach and spread it with that Care, Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity, and Application which they ought, you may hereafter know where to lay the blame; Not on the Want of sufficient Light and Strength in the Gospel to prevail, (wherein me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, you make very bold with it) but on the want of what the Apostle requires in the Ministers of it; some part whereof, you may read in these Words to <hi>Timothy; But thou, O Man of God, follow after Righteousness, Godliness, Faith, Love, Patience, Meekness: Give Attendance to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine, preach the Word, be instant in season and out of season; reprove, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, exhort, with all Long-suffering and Doctrine:</hi> And more to this purpose in his Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Christian Religion has prevail'd, and supported it self in the World now above these 1600 Years, you must grant, and that it has not been by Force, is Demonstration. For where-ever the Christian Religion prevail'd, it did it, as far as we know any thing of the means of its Propagation and Support,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:49288:142"/>
without the help of that Force, <hi>moderate</hi> Force, which you say, is alone useful and necessary. So that if the Severities you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, be, as you confess, <hi>apter to hinder than promote</hi> the Gospel, and it has no where had the Assistance of your <hi>moderate</hi> Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it must follow, that it prevail'd without Force, only by its own Strength and Light, displaid and brought home to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings and Hearts of the People, by the Preaching, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and Exhortations of its Ministers. This at least you must grant, that Force can be by no means necessary to make the Gospel prevail any where, till the utmost has been tried that can be done by Arguments and Exhortations, Prayers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, and all the friendly Ways of Perswasion.</p>
            <p>As to the other part of your Assertion, <hi>Nor is that always the True Religion, that does so spread and prevail.</hi> 'Tis like they will demand Instances of you, where False Religions ever prevail'd against the Gospel, without the assistance of Force on the one side, or the betraying of it by the Negligence and Carelesness of its Teachers on the other? So that if the Gospel any where wants the Magistrate's Assistance, it is only to make the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of it do their Duty. I have heard of those, and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly there are Instances of it now not wanting, who by their pious Lives, peaceable and friendly Carriage, and diligent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the several Conditions and Capacities of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners, and screening them as much as they could from the Penalties of the Law, have in a short time scarce left a Dissenter in a Parish; where, notwithstanding the Force had been before used, they scarce found any other. But how far this has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended such Ministers to those who ought to incourage or follow the Example, I wish you would inform your self, and then tell me. But who sees not that a Justice of Peace's War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Pastoral Care, <hi>pag.</hi> 202.</note> is a shorter, and much easier way for the Minister, than all this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>do of instruction, Debates, and particular Application. Whether it be also more Christian, or more effectual to make real Converts, others may be apt to enquire. This, I am sure, it is not justifiable (even by your very Principles) to be used till the other has been throughly tried.</p>
            <p>But if there be any thing in the Argument for the Truth of Christianity, (as God forbid there should not) that it has, and consequently can prevail without Force, I think it can scarce be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in matter of Fact, that False Religions do also prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:49288:142"/>
the Christian Religion, when they come upon equal Terms in Competition; and as much Diligence and Industry is used by the Teachers of it, as by Seducers to False Religions, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate using his Force on neither side. For if in this case, which is the fair trial, Christianity can prevail, and False Religions too, 'tis possible Contrarieties may prevail against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both together. To make good therefore your Assertion, you must shew us, where-ever any other Religion so spread and prevail'd, as to drive Christianity out of any Country without Force, where the Ministers of it did their Duty to teach, adorn and support it.</p>
            <p>As to the following words, <hi>Nor is that always the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 6.</note> 
               <hi>which does so spread and prevail; as I doubt not but you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg with me, when you have but consider'd within how few Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations after the Flood, the Worship of false Gods prevail'd against that which</hi> Noah <hi>professed and taught his Children, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the True Religion, almost to the utter Exclusion of it, (though that at first was the only Religion in the World) without any aid from Force, or assistance from the Powers in being.</hi> This will need some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a negative Proof, as we shall see by and by.</p>
            <p>Where I say, <q>The Inventions of Men need the Force and <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 3.</note> Help of Men: A Religion that is from God, wants not the  assistance of humane Authority.</q> The first part of those Words you take no notice of; neither grant nor deny it to be so, though perhaps it will prove a great part of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy between us.</p>
            <p>To my Question, Whether if such a Toleration as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Author of the First Letter, were establish'd in <hi>France, Spain, Italy, Portugal,</hi> &amp;c. the True Religion would not <note place="margin">P. 8.</note> be a gainer by it? You answer, That the <hi>True Religion would be a loser by it in those few Places where it is now establish'd as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Religion;</hi> and particularly, you name <hi>England.</hi> It is then, it seems, by your way of <hi>moderate Force and lower Penalties,</hi> that in all Countries where it is National, the True Religion hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd and subsists. For the Controversy is between the Author's universal Toleration, and your new Way of <hi>Force;</hi> for greater degrees of Force, you condemn as hurtful. Say then that in <hi>England,</hi> and where-ever the True Religion is National, it has been beholden to your Force for the Advantages and Support it has had, and I will yeild you the Cause. But of National Re
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49288:143"/>
ligions, and particularly that of <hi>England,</hi> I have occasion to speak more in another place.</p>
            <p>In the next place you answer, That you <hi>suppose</hi> I <hi>do not hope</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 9.</note> I <hi>shall perswade the World to consent to</hi> my <hi>Toleration.</hi> I think by your Logick, a Proposition is not less true or false, because the World will or will not be perswaded to consent to it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it will not consent to a general Toleration, it may nevertheless be true that it would be advantageous to the True Religion: and if no body must speak Truth till he thinks all the World will be perswaded by it, you must have a very good Opinion of your Oratory, or else you will have a very good Excuse to turn your Parsonage, when you have one, into a sine-Cure. But though I have not so good an Opinion of my Gift of Perswasion, as perhaps you have of yours; yet I think I may without any great Presumption hope, that I may as soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> or any Government in it, to consent to my Toleration, as you perswade it to content it self with <hi>moderate Penalties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You farther answer, If such a Toleration, establish'd there, would permit the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preach'd, and its Worship set up in any Popish, Mahometan or Pagan Country, you think True Religion would be <hi>a gainer by it for a time; but</hi> you <hi>think withal, that an universal Toleration</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 10.</note> 
               <hi>would ruin it both there and every where else, in the end.</hi> You grant it then possible, notwithstanding the Corruption of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the True Religion may gain some where, and for some time, by Toleration: It will gain under a new Toleration you think, but decay under an old one; Would you had told us the Reason why you think so. <hi>But you think there is great reason to fear, that without God's extraordinary Providence, it wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> by it throughout the World.</hi> If you have considered right, and the matter be really so, it is demonstration, that the Christian Religion, since <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, as well as the True Religion before <hi>Moses</hi>'s time, must needs have been totally extinguish'd out of the World, and have so continued, unless by Miracle and immediate Revelation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd. For those Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Magistrates, upon whose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the True Religion, the Preservation of it, according to you, depends, living all of them under a free Toleration, must
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49288:143"/>
needs lose the True Religion effectually and speedily, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d they quitting the True Religion, the assistance of Force, which should support it against a general Defection, be utterly lost.</p>
            <p>The Princes of the World are, I suppose, as well infected with the <hi>depraved Nature of Man,</hi> as the rest of their Brethren. These, whether 100 or 1000, suppose they lived together in one So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, wherein, with the True Religion, there were a free Toleration, and no <hi>Coactive Power</hi> of the Magistrate imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Matters of Religion, would the True Religion be soon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated amongst them? If you say it would not, you must grant Toleration not to be so destructive of the True Religion, as you say; or you must think them of another race, than the rest of corrupt Men, and free from that general Taint. If you grant that the True Religion would be quickly extirpated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, by Toleration, living together in one Society, the same will happen to them, living as Princes, where they are free from all Coactive Power of the Magistrate in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and have as large a Toleration as can be imagin'd. Unless you will say, that <hi>depraved humane Nature</hi> works less in a Prince than a Subject; and is most tame, most mortified, where it has most Liberty and Temptation. Must not then, if your Maxim be true, Toleration quickly deprive the few Orthodox Princes that are in the World (take it when you will) of the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and with them, take away the Assistance of Authority, which is necessary to support it amongst their Subjects? Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then does not, whatever your Fears are, make that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wrack on True Religion which you talk of.</p>
            <p>I shall give you another Evidence of it, and then come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your great Reason taken from the Corruption of humane Nature, and the Instance you so often repeat, and build so much on, the <hi>Apostacy after the Flood.</hi> Toleration, you sav, would quickly, and <hi>effectually extirpate the True Reiigion through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World.</hi> What now is the Means to preserve True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the World? If you may be believed, 'tis Force, but not all Force, great Severities, Fire, Faggot, Imprisonment, loss of Estate, &amp;c. These will do more harm than good; 'tis only <hi>lower and moderate Penaltics, some tolerable Inconveniences,</hi> can do the business. If then <hi>moderate</hi> Force hath not been all along, no, nor any where, made use of for the Preservation of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49288:144"/>
the True Religion, the Maintenance and Support of the True Religion in the World, has not been owing to what you oppose to Toleration: And so your Argument against Toleration is out of doors.</p>
            <p>You give us in this and the foregoing Pages, the Grounds of your <hi>Fear,</hi> It is the <hi>Corruption of humane Nature</hi> which opposes the True Religion. You express it thus, <hi>Idolatry prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>

For,</hi> say you, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Hardships some False Religions may impose, it will however, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be easier to carnal and worldly-minded Men, to give even their First-born for their Transgressions, than to mortify their Lusts from which they spring, which no Religion but the True, requires of them.</hi> I wonder, saying this, how you could any longer mistake the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate's Duty, in reference to Religion, and not see wherein <hi>Force</hi> truly can and ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ht to be serviceable to it. What you have said, plainly shews you, that the Assistance the Magistrate's Authority can give to the True Religion, is in the subduing of Lusts, and its being directed against Pride, Injustice, Rapine, Luxury and Debauchery, and those other Immoralities which come properly under his Cognisance, and may be corrected by Punishments; and not by the imposing of <hi>Creeds and Ceremonics,</hi> as you tell us. <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Decent,</hi> you might have left out, <note place="margin">p. 13.</note> whereof their Fancies, and not the Law of God, will always be Judg and consequently the Rule.</p>

               </gap>istance is wanting: Here they may and ought to interpose their Power, and by Severities, against Drunkenness, Laciviousnes, and all sorts of Debauchery; by a steady and unrelaxed Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the ways of Fraud and Injustice; and by their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, Countenance, and Example, reduce the Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of Mens Manners into order, and bring Sobriety, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness, Industry and Honesty into Fashion. This is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Business every-where; and for this they have a Commission from God, both by the Light of Nature and Revelation; and by this, removing the great Counterpoise, which lies in strictness of Life, and is so strong a Bias, with the greatest part, against: the true Religion, they would cast the Ballance on that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Idolatry, at its entrance into the World, had not that Assistance from Men in Power, which it never fail'd of afterwards. Who they were that made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin, the Scripture tells us.

            <p>One of the first False Religions, whose rise and way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating we have an account of in Sacred History, was by an ambitious Usurper, who having rebell'd against his Master, with a False Title set up a False Religion, to secure his Power and Dominion. Why this might not have been done before <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s days, and Idols set up at other places, as well as at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> to serve politick Ends, will need some other Proof, than barely saying, it <hi>could not</hi> be so at first. The Devil, unless much more ignorant, was not less busy in those days to engage Princes in his favour, and to weave Religion into Affairs of State, the better to introduce his Worship, and support Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, by accommodating it to the Ambition, Vanity, or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, of Men in Power: and therefore, you may as well say, that the <hi>Corruption of humane Nature,</hi> as that the <hi>Assistance of the Powers in being,</hi> did not, in those days, help forward False Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions; because your Reading has furnish'd you with no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mention of it out of History.

And here we may perhaps, with good reason, place the rise and original of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry after the Flood, there being nothing of this kind more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. So ready was the Ambition, Vanity, or Superstition of Princes, to introduce their Predecessors into the Divine Worship of the People, to secure to themselves the greater Veneration from their Subjects, as descended from the Gods; or to erect such a Worship, and such a Priesthood, as might awe the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and seduced People into that Obedience they desired. Thus <hi>Ham,</hi> by the Authority of his Successors, the Rulers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is first brought for the Honour of his Name and Memory into their Temples, and never left, till he is erected into a God, and made <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi> &amp;c. which Fashion took afterwards with the Princes of other Countries.</p>

What Idolatry does your History tell you of among the Greeks, before <hi>Phoroncus</hi> and <hi>Danaus,</hi> Kings of the <hi>Argives,</hi> and <hi>Cecrops</hi> and <hi>Theseus</hi> Kings of <hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> and <hi>Cadmus</hi> King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> introduced it? An Art of Rule 'tis probable they borrowed from the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> So that if you had not vouch'd the Silence of History, without consulting it, you would possibly have found, that in the first Ages, Princes, by their Influence and Aid, by the Help and Artisice of the Priests they imploy'd, their Fables of their Gods, their Mysteries and Oracles, and all the Assistance they could give it by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, did so much against the Truth, before direct Force was grown into fashion, and appear'd openly, that there would be little reason of putting the Guard and Propagation of the True Religion, into their hands now, and arming them with Force to promote it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:49288:148"/>
That this was the Original of Idolatry in the World, and that it was borrowed by other Magistrates from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> is farther evident in that this Worship was setled in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and grown the National Religion there, before the Gods of <hi>Greece,</hi> and several other Idolatrous Countries, were bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>. For though they took their Pattern of Deifying their deceased Princes, from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and kept, as near as they could, to the Number and Genealogies of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Gods; yet they took the Names still of some great Men of their own, which they accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Mythology of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Thus, by the assistance of <hi>the Powers in being,</hi> Idolatry entred into the World after the Flood.

            <p>I grant that the entranee and growth of Idolatry, might be owing to the Negligence of the <hi>Powers in being,</hi> in that they <hi>did not do what they might and ought to have done,</hi> in using their Authority to suppress the Enormities of Mens Manners, and correct the Irregularity of their Lives. But this was not all the Assistance they gave to that <hi>horrible Apostacy:</hi> They were, as for as History gives us any light, the Promoters of it, and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in it, and did what they ought not to have done, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up False Religions, and using their Authority to establish them to serve their corrupt and ambitious Designs.</p>
            <p>National Religions, establish'd by Authority, and inforced by the Powers in being, we hear of every where, as far back as we have any account of the rise and growth of the Religions of the World.

               </gap>ience. But to talk of that great Apostacy, as wholly owing to Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when you cannot produce one Instance of Toleration then in the World, is to say what you please.</p>
            <p>That the majority of Mankind were then, and always have been, by the <hi>Corruption and Pravity of humane Nature,</hi> led away, and kept from imbracing the True Religion, is past doubt. But whether this be owing to Toleration, in Matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the Question. <hi>David</hi> describes an horrible Corruption and Apostacy in his time, so as to say, <hi>There is none that doth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. XIV</note> 
               <hi>good, no not one;</hi> and yet I do not think you will say, a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then in that Kingdom, was the cause of it. If the greatest part cannot be ill without a Toleration, I am afraid you must be fain to find out a Toleration in every Country, and in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the World. For I think it is true, of all Times and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the <hi>Broad way</hi> that leadeth to Destruction, has had most Travellers. I would be glad to know where it was that Force, your way apply'd, <hi>i. e.</hi> with Punishments only upon Nonconformists, ever prevail'd to bring the greater number in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Narrow-way, that leads unto Life;</hi> which our Saviour tells us, there are <hi>sew</hi> that <hi>sind.</hi>

                  </gap>on of Humane Nature,</hi> you say, opposes the True Religion. I grant it you. There was also, say you, an <hi>horrible Apostacy</hi> after the Flood; let this also be granted you: and yet from hence it will not follow, that the True Religion cannot subsist and prevail in the World without the assistance of Force, your way apply'd, till you have shewn, that the False Religions, which were the Inventions of Men, grew up under Toleration, and not by the Encouragement and Assistance of the Powers in being.</p>
            <p>How near soever therefore, the <hi>True Religion</hi> was to be <hi>extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd within a few Generations</hi> after the Flood, (which whether more in danger then, than in most Ages since, is more than you can shew.) This will be still the Question, Whether the Liberty of Toleration, or the Authority of the Powers in being, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted most to it? And whether <hi>there can be no other, nor more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Cause</hi> assigned, than the want of Force, your way apply'd, I shall leave the Reader to judg. This I am sure, whatever
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:49288:149"/>
Causes any one else shall <hi>assign,</hi> are as well proved as yours, if they offer them only as their Conjectures.</p>
            <p>Not but that I think Men could run into false and foollsh Ways of Worship, without the Instigation or Assistance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority; but the Powers of the World, as far as we have any History, having been always forward enough (<hi>True Religion</hi> as little serving Princes as private Mens <hi>Lusts</hi>) to take up Wrong Religions, and as forward to imploy their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Religlon, good or bad, which they had once taken up, I can see no reason why the not using of Force, by the Princes of the World, should be assigned as the sole, or so much as the most <hi>probable Cause</hi> of propagating the False Religions of the World, or extirpating the True; or how you can so positively say, Idolatry <hi>prevail'd without any assistauce from the Powers in being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore History leads us to the Magistrates, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Promoters of Idolatry in the World, to which we may suppose their not supressing of Vice, joined as another Cause of the spreading of False Religions, you were best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether you can still <hi>suppose there can no other Cause be assigned,</hi> of the prevailing of the worship of False Gods, but the Magistrate's not interposing his Authority in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For that that cannot with any probability at all be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as any Cause, I shall give you this further Reason. You impute the prevailing of False Religions, to <hi>the Corruption and Pravity of Humane Nature, left to it self, unbridled by Authority.</hi> Now, if Force, your way applied, does not at all <hi>bridle the Corruption and Pravity of Humane Nature,</hi> the Magistrate's not so interposing his Authority, cannot be <hi>assigned</hi> as any <hi>Cause</hi> at: all of that Apostacy. So that let that Apostacy have what rise, and spreas as far as you please, it will not make one jot for Force, your way applied, or shew that that can receive any as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance your way from Authority. For your use of Authority and Force, being only to bring Mento an outward Conformity to the National Religion, it leaves the <hi>Corruption and Prauity of Humane Nature,</hi> as <hi>unbridled</hi> as before; as I have shewn else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>You tell us, <hi>That it is not true, that the true Religion will preuail</hi>

For it seems it was then the Fashion to bow to the Priest as it is now to the Altar. If therefore you say Force is necessary, because without it no Men will so consider as to imbrace the true Religion, for the Salvation of their Souls, that I think is manifestly false. If you say it is <hi>necessary</hi> to use such means as will make the greatest part so imbrace it, you must
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:49288:150"/>
use some other means than Force, your way applied, for that does not so far work on the Majority. If you say it is <hi>necessary,</hi> because possibly it may work on some, which bare Preaching, and Perswasion, will not: I answer, If possibly your <hi>moderate Punishments</hi> may work on some, and therefore <hi>they</hi> are <hi>necessary,</hi> 'tis as possible, that greater Punishments may work on others, and therefore they are necessary, and so on to the utmost Severities.</p>
            <p>That the Corruption of Humane Nature is every where spread, <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> and that it works powerfully in the Children of Disobedience, who <hi>received not the Love of the Truth, but had Pleasure in Unrighteousness;</hi> and therefore God gives them up <hi>to believe a Lie,</hi> no Body, I think, will deny. But that this Corruption of Humane Nature works e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually in all Men, or in all Ages; and so, that God will, or ever did, give up all Men, not restrained by Force, your way modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and applied, to believe a Lie, (as all False Religions are) that I yet see no reason to grant. Nor will this Instance of <hi>Noah's</hi> Religion, you so much rely on, ever perswade, till you have proved, that from those eight Men which brought <hi>the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> with them into the new World, there were not eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, or eighty thousand, which retain'd it in the World in the worst Times of the Apostacy. And Secondly, till you have proved, that the False Religions of the World prevail'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any aid from Force, or the assistance of the Powers in being. And Thirdly, That the decay of the true Religion was for want of Force, your <hi>moderate</hi> Force, neither of which you have at all proved, as, I think it manifest.</p>
            <p>One Consideration more touching <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Religion, give me leave to suggest, and that is; If Force were so necessary for the support of the true Religion, as you make it, 'tis strange God, who gave him Precepts about other things, should never reveal this to him, nor any Body else, that I know. To this, you, who have confessed the <hi>Scripture not to have given the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate this Commission,</hi> must say, that it is plain enough in the Commission that he has from the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and so needed not any Revelation, to instruct the Magistrate in the Right he has to use Force. I confess the Magistrates have used Force in matters of Religion, and have been as considently and constantly put upon it by their Priests, as if they had as clear a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from Heaven, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> had to preach the Gospel to the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:49288:150"/>
               <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But yet 'tis plain, notwithstanding that Commission from the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> there needs some farther instruction from Revelation, since it does not appear, that they have found out the right use of Force, such as the true Religion requires for its Preservation; and though you have after several thousands of Years, at last, discovered it, yet it is very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, you not being able to tell, if a Law were now to be made against those who have not <hi>consider'd as they ought,</hi> what are those <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi> Penalties which are to be imployed against them, though yet without that all the rest signifies nothing. But however <note place="margin">P. 7.</note> doubtful you are in this, I am glad to find you so direct, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Mens rejecting the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>To conclude, That we may see the great advantage your Cause will receive from that Instance, you so much rely on, of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy</hi> after the Flood; I shall oppose another to it.

            <p>But to take your Argument in its full Latitude, you say, but you say it without Book, that there was once a Toleration in the World to the <hi>almost utter Extirpation</hi> of the true Religion; and I say to you, that as far as Records authorize either Opinion, we may say Force has been always used in matters of Religion, to the great prejudice of the true Religion, and the Professors of it. And there not being an Age wherein you can shew me, upon a fair Trial of an establish'd National Toleration, that the true Religion was <hi>extirpated,</hi> or indangered, so much as you pretend by it: Whereas there is no Age (whereof we have sufficient History to judg of this matter) wherein it will not be easy to find that the true Religion, and its Followers, suffered by Force. You will in vain endeavour, by Instances, to prove the ill effects, or uselesness of Toleration, such as the Author proposed, which I challenge you to shew me was ever yet set up in the World, or that the true Religion sufferd by it; and 'tis to the want of it, the Restraints and Disadvantages the true Religion has laboured under, and its so little spreading in the World will justly be imputed; until, from better Experiments, you have something to say against it.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour has promised that he will build his Church on this fundamental Truth, That he is <hi>Christ the Son of God;</hi> so that <hi>the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it:</hi> And this I believe, though you tell us the True Religion is not able to subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the assistance of Force, when Miracles cease. I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that our Saviour any where promises any other as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance but that of his Spirit, or gives his little Flock any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to expect much Countenance or Help from the great Men of the World, or the Coercive Power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, nor any where authorizes them to use it for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his Church; <hi>Not many wise Men after the Flesh; not many</hi>

be found to belong to all Ages of the Church Militant, past and to come, as well as to the first: For God, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, has chosen the <hi>foolish things of the World to confound the wise, and the weak things of the World to confound the mighty;</hi> and this not only till Miracles ceased, but ever since. To be <hi>hated for Christ's Name sake,</hi> and by <hi>much Tribulation to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> has been the general and constant Lot of the People of God, as well as it seems to be the current Strain of the New Testament; which promises nothing of secular Power or Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; says nothing of <hi>Kings being nursing Fathers, or Queens nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Mothers:</hi> which Prophecy, whatever meaning it have, 'tis like our Saviour would not have omitted to support his Church with some Hopes and Assurance of such Assistance, if it were to have any Accomplishment before his second Coming; when <hi>Israel</hi> shall come in again, and with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> make up the Fulness of his glorious Kingdom.

               <note place="margin">P. 35.</note> 
               <hi>be made, can do any Service towards the Salvation of Mens Souls in Subordination to God's Grace, or that God has forbidden the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi> to use Force, (for so you ought to put it;) but you rather choose (according to your ordinary way) to use general and doubtful Words; and therefore you say, <hi>To serve him in that great Work with the Authority which he has given him, there will be no occasion for the Caution</hi> I <hi>have given,</hi> not to be wiser than our Maker in that stupendous Work of our Salvation. By which way of Arguing, any thing that I cannot shew, cannot possibly, cannot <hi>indirectly and at a distance,</hi> or by accident, do <hi>any Service,</hi> or <hi>God has not forbidden,</hi> may be made use of for the Salvation of Souls. I suppose you mean expresly <hi>forbidden,</hi> for else I might think these Words, <hi>[Who has required this at your hands?]</hi> a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prohibition of it. The sum of your Argument is what cannot <hi>be shew'd not</hi> to do <hi>any Service,</hi> may be used <hi>as an humane Means in Subordination to Grace,</hi> in the Work of Salvation. To which I reply, That what may, through the Grace of God,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49288:155"/>
sometimes do some Service, cannot without a farther warrant from Revelation, than such an Usefulness be <hi>requir'd,</hi> or made use of as a subordinate Means to Grace. For if so, then Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Confession, Penance, Pilgrimages, Processions, &amp;c. which no body can shew, do not ever do <hi>any Service,</hi> at least, <hi>indirectly and at a distance,</hi> towards the Salvation of Souls.</p>
            <p>'Tis not enough that it cannot be shewn that it cannot do any Service to justify its Usefulness; For what is there that may not, <hi>indirectly and at a distance,</hi> or by accident, do some Service? To shew that it is an <hi>humane Means,</hi> that God has no where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>in Subordination to Grace,</hi> in the supernatural Work of Salvation, is enough to prove it an unwarrantable Boldness to use it: And much more so in the present case of <hi>Force,</hi> which, if put into the Magistrate's hands with Power to use it in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, will do more harm than good; as I think I have sufficiently shewon.</p>
            <p>And therefore, since according to you, the Magistrate's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, to use Force for the Salvation of Souls, is from the Law of Nature; which Commission reaches to none, since the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Gospel, but Christian Magistrates; 'tis more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to conclude, (were there nothing else in the case but the Silence of Scripture) that the Christian Magistrate has no such Power, because he has no such Commission any where in the Gospel, wherein all things are appointed necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; than that there was so clear a Commission given to all Magistrates by the Law of Nature, that it is necessary to <hi>shew</hi> a Prohibition from Revelation, if one will deny Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates to have that Power. Since the Commission of the Law of Nature to Magistrates, being only that general one, of doing Good according to the best of their Judgments: if that extends to the use of Force in Matters of Religion, it will abundantly more oppose than promote the True Religion, if Force in the case has any Efficacy at all, and so do more harm than good: Which though it shews not, (what you here demand) that it can not <hi>do any Service towards the Salvation of Mens Souls,</hi> for that cannot be shewn of any thing; yet it shews the Disservice it does, is so much more, than any <hi>Service</hi> can be expected from it, that it can never be proved, that God has given Power to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates to use it by the Commission they have of doing Good, from the Law of Nature.</p>

            <p>As to your other place of Scripture; if St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as it seems to me in that Xth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> were shewing that the Gentiles were provided with all things necessary to Salvation, as well as the Jews; and that by having Men sent to them to preach the Gospel, that Provision was made, what you say in the two next Paragraphs will shew us, that you understand, that the Greek <note place="margin">P. 37.</note> Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies both <hi>Hearing</hi> and <hi>Report,</hi> but does no more answer the Force of those two Verses, against you, <note place="margin">Rom. X. 14, 17.</note> than if you had spared all you said with your Greek Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism. The Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> are these; <hi>How then shall they call on him on whom they have not believed? And how shall they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear</hi>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:49288:157"/>
               <hi>without a Preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? So then Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God.</hi> In this Deduction of the Means of propagating the Gospel, we may well suppose St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have put in <hi>Miracles</hi> or <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,</hi> if, as you say, one of them had been necessary. But whether or no every Reader will think St. <hi>Paul</hi> set down in that place all necessary Means, I know not; but this, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, he will think, that the New Testament does; and then I ask, Whether there be in it one word of Force to be used to bring Men to be Christians, or to hearken to the good Tidings of Salvation, offer'd in the Gospel?</p>
            <p>To my asking, <q>What if God, for Reasons best known to Himself, would not have Men compell'd?</q> You answer, <hi>If he would not have them compell'd now Miracles are ceased, as far as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi>

You first suppose Force <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now may we not ask one, that is so far of the Council of the Almighty that he can positively say what he would or would not have, to tell us, whether it be not as probable that God, who knows the Temper of Man that he has made, who knows how apt he is not to spare any degree of Force wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> he believes he has a Commission to compel Men to do any thing in their power, and who knows also how prone Man is to think it reasonable to do so: whether, I say, it is not as probable that God, if he would have the Magistrate to use none but <hi>moderate</hi> Force to <hi>compel Men to hear, would</hi> also <hi>have told us so?</hi> Fathers are not more apt than Magistrates to strain their Power beyond what is convenient for the Education of their Children; and yet it has pleased God to tell them in the New-Testament of this Moderation, by a Precept more than once repeated.</p>

            <p>To my saying, <q>That the Method of the Gospel is to pray <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</note> and beseech, and that if God had thought it necessary to have Men punish'd to make them give ear, he could have called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates to be Spreaders of the Gospel as well as poor Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or <hi>Paul</hi> a Persecutor, who yet wanted not Power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapbira,</hi> and the incestuous <hi>Corinthian.</hi>
               </q> You <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> reply, <hi>Though it be</hi> the Method of the Gospel, <hi>for the Ministers of it to pray and beseech Men; yet it appears from</hi> my <hi>own Words here, both that Punishments may be sometimes necessary; and that Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that even by those who are to pray and beseech, is inconsistent with that Metbod.</hi> I fear, Sir, you so greedily lay hold upon any Examples of Punishment, when on any account they come in your way, that you give your self not liberty to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 19.</note> they are for your purpose or no; or else you would scarce inser, as you do from my Words, that, in your case, <hi>Punishments may be sometimes necessary. Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; therefore it <hi>appears,</hi> say you, <hi>that Punishment may be sometimes necessary.</hi> For what, I beseech you? For the only End, you say, Punishments are useful in Religion, <hi>i. e.</hi> to make Men <hi>consider.</hi> So that <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were struck dead: For what end? To make them consider. If you had given your self the leisure to have reflected on this and the other Instance of the incestuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> 'tis possible you would have

found neither of them to have served very well to shew <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment necessary</hi> to bring Men to imbrace the True Religion; for both these were Punishments laid on those who had already imbraced the True Religion, and were in the Communion of the True Church, and so can only shew (if you will infer any thing concerning the necessity of Punishments from them) that Punishments may be sometimes necessary for those who are in the Communion of the True Church. And of that you may make your advantage.</p>

            <p>To my asking, <q>What if God, foreseeing this Force would <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</note> be in the hands of Men, as passionate, as humoursom, as liable to Prejudice and Error, as the rest of their Brethren, did not think it a proper Means to bring Men into the right Way?</q> You reply, <hi>But if there be any thing of an Argument in this, it</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 39.</note> 
               <hi>proves that there ought to be no Civil Government in the World; and so proving too much, proves nothing at all.</hi> This you say; but you being one of those Mortals which is liable to Error as well as your Brethren, you cannot expect it should be received for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sallible Truth, till you have proved it; and that you will never do, till you can shew, that there is as absolute a necessity of Force in the Magistrate's hand for the Salvation of Souls, as there is of Force in the Magistrate's hands for the Preservation of Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; And next, till you have proved that Force, in the hands of Men, as passionate, and humoursom, or liable to Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>judice and Error as their Brethren, would contribute as much to the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:49288:159"/>
bringing Men, and keeping them in the right Way to Salvation, as it does to the support of Civil Society, and the keeping Men at Peace in it.</p>
            <p>Where Men cannot live together without mutual Injuries, not to be avoided without Force, Reason has taught them to seek a Remedy in Government, which always places Power somewhere in the Society to restrain and punish such Injuries; which Power, whether placed in the Community it self, or some chosen by the Community to govern it, must still be in the hands of Men; and where (as in Society of civiliz'd and setled Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) the Form of the Government place this Power out of the Community it self, it is unavoidable, that out of Men (such as they are) some should be made Magistrates, and have Coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive Power or Force put into their hands, to govern and direct the Society for the Publick Good; without which, Force so pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the hands of Men, there could be no Civil Society, nor the ends for which it is instituted to any degree attain'd. And thus Government is the will of God.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Will of God also, that Men should be saved; but to this, it is not necessary that Force or <hi>Coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>live Power</hi> should be put into Mens hands; because God can, and hath provided o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Means to bring Men to Salvation: To which, you indeed suppose, but can never prove Force necessary.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Passions, Humours,</hi> Liableness to <hi>Prejudices</hi> and <hi>Errors,</hi> common to Magistrates with other Men, do not render Force in their hands so dangerous and unuseful, to the Ends of Society, which is the Publick Peace, as to the Ends of Religion, which is the Salvation of Mens Souls. For though Men of all Rank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, could be content to have their own <hi>Humours, Passions</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices</hi> satisfied, yet when they come to make Laws, which are to direct their Force in civil Matters, they are driven to oppose their Laws to the <hi>Humours, Passions</hi> and <hi>Prejudices</hi> of Men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, whereby their own come to be restrain'd: For if Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, in making of Laws, did not direct them against the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular <hi>Humours, Prejudices</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> of Men, which are apt to mislead them: If they did not endeavour with their best Judgment, to bring Men from their <hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>,</hi> to the Obedience and Practice of right Reason, the Society could not subsist, and so they themselves would be in danger to lose their Station in it, and be expos'd to the unrestrain'd <hi>Humours, Passions,</hi>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:49288:160"/>
and Violence of others. And hence it comes, that be Men as humoursom, passionate, and prejudiced as they will, they are still by their own Interest obliged to make use of their best Skill, and with their most unprejudiced and sedatest Thoughts take care of the Government and endeavour to preserve the Common-wealth; and therefore, notwithstanding their <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and Passions,</hi> their liableness to <hi>Error and Prejudice,</hi> they do provide pretty well for the Support of Society, and the Power in their hands is of use to the maintenance of it.</p>
            <p>But in Matters of Religion it is quite otherwise; you had told us, about the latter end of your <hi>Argument C.</hi> how liable Men were in <hi>choosing their Religion,</hi> to be misled by <hi>Humour,</hi> Passion and <hi>Prejudice;</hi> and therefore, it was not fit that in a Business of such Concernment they should be left to themselves: and hence, in this Matter of Religion, you would have them sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the <hi>Coactive Power</hi> of the Magistrate. But this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance is visibly of no advantage to the True Religion, nor can serve at all to secure Men from a wrong Choice. For the Magistrates, by their <hi>Humours, Prejudices</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> (which they are born to like other Men) being as liable, and likely to be misled in the Choice of their Religion, as any of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as constant Experience hath always shewn, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage could it be to Mankind, for the Salvation of their Souls, that the Magistrates of the World should have Power to use Force to bring Men to that Religion which they, each of them, by whatsoever <hi>Humour, Passion</hi> or <hi>Prejudice</hi> influenc'd, had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to themselves as the True? For whatsoever you did, I think with Reverence we may say, that God foresaw, that whatever Commission one Magistrate had by the Law of Nature, all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates had: And that Commission, if there were any such, could be only to use their <hi>Coactive Power</hi> to bring Men to the Religion they believed to be true, whether it were really the true or no: And therefore, I shall, without taking away Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment out of the World, or so must as question it, still think this a reasonable Question; <q>What if God, foresecing this Force would be in the hands of Men, as <hi>passionate,</hi> as <hi>humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,</hi> as liable to <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> as the rest of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, did not think it a proper Means, in such hands, to bring Men into the right Way?</q> And that it needs a better Answer than you have given to it: And therefore, you might have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49288:160"/>
the pains you have taken in this Paragraph, to prove that the Magistrates, being liable as much as other Men to <hi>Humour, Prejudice, Passion</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> makes not Force, in his hand, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>erviceable to the Administration of Civil Government. Which is what no body denies: and you would have better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploid it to prove, that if the Magistrate's being as liable to <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Humour, Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> as other Men, made Force, in his hands, improper to bring Men to the True Religion, this would take away Government out of the World: which is a Consequence, I think, I may deny.</p>
            <p>To which, let me now add, What if God foresaw that if Force, of any kind or degree whatsoever, were allow'd in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Truth, it would be us'd by <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> to grow with the Wheet till the Harvest, when the infallible Judg should sever them. That Parable of our Saviour's plainly tells us, If Force were once permitted, even in favour of the True Religion, what Mischief it was like to do in the Misapplication of it, by forward busy mistaken Men, and therefore be wholly forbid it; and yet, I hope, this does not take away Civil Government out of the World?</p>
            <p>To my demanding, `What if there be other Means? and saying, `Then yours ceases to be necessary upon that account, that <hi>there is no other Means left;</hi> for the Grace of God is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Means. You answer, That <hi>though</hi> the Grace of God be <note place="margin">P. 39.</note> another Means, <hi>yet it is none of the Means of which</hi> you <hi>were speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the place</hi> I <hi>refer to, which any one, who reads that Paragraph, will find to be only Humane Means.</hi> In that place, you were endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to prove Force necessary to bring Men to the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as appears; and there having dilated for four or five <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note> Pages together upon the Carelesness, <hi>Prejudices, Passions Lusts, Impressions of Education, worldly Respects,</hi> and other the like Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which you think mislead and keep Men from the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; you at last, conclude Force necessary to bring Men to it, because <hi>Admonitions</hi> and <hi>

               </hi> not prevailing, there is no <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Means left.</hi> To this, Grace being instanced in as another Means, you tell us here, you mean, <hi>no other HUMANE Means left.</hi> So that to prove Force necessary, you must prove that God would have other <hi>Humane Means used</hi> besides Praying,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49288:161"/>
Preaching, Perswasion and Instruction; and for this, you will need to bring a plain Direction from Revelation for your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Punishments; unless you will pretend to know, by your own natural Wisdom, what Means God has made <hi>necessary;</hi> without which, those whom he hath <hi>foreknown</hi> and <hi>predestinated,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom.

            <p>You say, there are many who are not prevail'd on by Prayers, Intreaties and Exhortations, to imbrace the Religion. What then is to be done? <hi>Some degrees of Force</hi> are <hi>necessary</hi> to be used. Why? Because there is no other <hi>Humane Means left.</hi> Many are not prevail'd on by your moderate Force; What then is to be done? Greater degrees of Force are necessary, because <hi>there is no other Humane Means left.</hi> No, say you, God has made moderate Force necessary, because <hi>there is no other Humane Means left</hi> where Preaching and Intreaties will not prevail: but he has not made greater degrees of Force necessary, because <hi>there is no other Humane Means left</hi> where moderate Force will not prevail. So that your Rule changing, where the Reason continues the same, we must conclude you have some way of Judging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Purposes and Ways of the Almighty in the Work of Salvation, which every one understands not. You would not else, upon so slight Ground as you have yet produced for it, which is nothing but your own Imagination, make Force, your <hi>moderate</hi> Force so necessary, that you bring in question the Wisdom and Bounty of the <hi>Disposer and Governour of</hi> all things, <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 16.</note> as if he <hi>had not furnish'd Mankind with competent Means for the promoting his own Honour in the World, and the good of Souls,</hi> if your <hi>moderate</hi> Force were wanting to bring them to the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; whereas you know, that most of the Nations of the World always were destitute of this <hi>Humane Means</hi> to bring them to the True Religion. And I imagine you would be put to it, to name me one now that is furnish'd with it.</p>
            <p>Besides, if you please to remember what you say in the next Words, <hi>And therefore thongh the Grace of God be both a proper and sussicient Means, and such as can work by it self, and without</hi>

               <hi>which, neither Penalties nor any other Means can do any thing;</hi> and by consequence, can make any Means effectual: How can you say any <hi>Humane Means,</hi> in this supernatural Work, unless what God has declar'd to be so, is necessary? Preaching and Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Exhortation, are <hi>Humane Means</hi> that he has appointed: These, therefore, Men may and ought to use; they have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from God, and may expect his Blessing and the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of his Grace; but to suppose, when they are used and prevail not, that Force is necessary, because these are not sussicient, is to exclude Grance, and ascribe this Work to <hi>Humane Means;</hi> as in effect you do, when'you call Force <hi>competent</hi> and <hi>sussicient Means,</hi> as you have done. For if bare Preaching, by the Assistance of Grace, can and will certainly prevail; and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Penalties,</hi> as you confess, or any kind of Force, without the Assistance of Grace, <hi>can do nothing,</hi> How can you say, that Force is in any case a more <hi>necessary</hi> or a more <hi>competent,</hi> or <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> Means, than bare Preaching and Instruction? unless you can shew us, that God hath promised the Co-operation and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of his <hi>Grace</hi> to Force, and not to Preaching? The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof, has more of Appearance. Preaching and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion are not <hi>competent Means,</hi> you say; Why? because, without the Co-operation of Grace, they can do nothing: But by the Assistance of Grace, they can prevail even without Force. Force too, without Grace, you acknowledge can do nothing; but join'd with Preaching and Grace, it can prevail. Why then, I pray, is it a more <hi>competent Means</hi> than Preaching, or why <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> where Preaching prevails not? since it can do nothing without that, which, if joined to Preaching, can make Preaching effectual without it.</p>
            <p>You go on, <hi>Yet it may be true however, that when Admonitions</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 40.</note> 
               <hi>and Intreaties fail, there is no HUMANE Means left but Penalties, to bring prejudiced Persons to hear and consider what may convince them of their Errors, and discover the Truth to them: And then</hi> Penalties <hi>will be</hi> necessary <hi>in respect to that end, as an HUMANE Means.</hi> Let it be true or not true, that when <hi>Intreaties,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>fail, there is no HUMANE Means left but Penalties:</hi> Your Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I deny, that <hi>then Penalties will be</hi> necessary as an <hi>HU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANE Means.</hi> For I ask you, since you lay so much stress to so little purpose on <hi>HUMANE Means, is some Humane Means necessary?</hi> if that be your Meaning, you have <hi>Humane</hi> Means in

And now you may understand what I <hi>intend, by saying</hi> that the Grace of God is the only Means; which is the Enquiry of your next Paragraph, <hi>viz.</hi> this I intend, that it is the only efficacious <note place="margin">P. 40.</note> Means, without which all <hi>Humane Means</hi> is ineffectual.

And you must have more than <hi>Humane</hi> Confidence, if you continue to mix this poor and <hi>humane</hi> Contrivance of yours, with the Wisdom and Counsel of God in the Work of Salvation; since he having declar'd the Means and Methods to be used for the saving Mens Souls, has in the Revelation of the Gospel, by your own Consession, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed no such <hi>Humane Means.</hi>

You here set up a way of propagating Christianity according to your Fancy, and tell us how you would have the work of the Gospel carried on: You commission the Magistrate by Arguments of Congruity; you find an efficacy in Punishment
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:49288:162"/>
towards the converting of Men: you limit the Force, to be used to <hi>low</hi> and <hi>moderate</hi> degrees; and to Countries where <hi>sufficient Means of Instruction are provided</hi> by the Law. And where the <hi>Magistrate's</hi> Religion is the <hi>True,</hi> i. where it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses you; and all this without any Direction from God, or any Authority so much as pretended from the Gospel; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its being truly for the Propagation of Christianity, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so much of it as you think fit, and what else you are pleas'd to join to it.

            <p>This indeed is well suited to any one, who would have a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of punishing those who differ from his Opinion, and would have Men compell'd to Conformity in <hi>England.</hi> But in this your fair Contrivance, what becomes of the rest of Mankind, left to wander in Darkness out of this <hi>Goshen,</hi> who neither have, nor (according to your Scheme) can have your necessary Means of <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Penalties</hi> to bring them to imbrace the Truth that must save them: For if that be necessary, they cannot without a Miracle, either Prince or People, be wrought on without it.

In your next Paragraph, to prove that God does bless the use of Force, you say you suppose I <hi>mean,</hi> by the Words you there <note place="margin">P. 40.</note> cite, that the <hi>Magistrate has no ground to hope that God will bless any Penalties that he may use to bring Men to hear and consider the Doctrine of Salvation; or (which is the same thing) that God does not (at least not ordinarily) afford his Grace and Assistance to them who are brought by such Penalties to hear and consider that Doctrine, to enable them to hear and consider it as they ought,</hi> i. e. <hi>so as to be moved heartily to imbrace it.</hi> You tell me, <hi>If this be my Meaning; then to let</hi> me <hi>see that it is not true,</hi> you <hi>shall only desire</hi> me <hi>to tell</hi> you, <hi>whether they that are so brought to hear and consider, are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Gospel or not? If</hi> I <hi>say they are;</hi> (<hi>and</hi> you <hi>suppose</hi> I <hi>dare not say otherwise;) then it evidently follows, that God does afford them that Grace which is requisite to enable them to believe the Gospel: Because, without that Grace, it is impossible for them to believe it; and they cannot be bound to believe what it is impossible for them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> To which, I shall only answer, That by this irrefragable Argument, it is evident, that where-ever due Penalties have been used (for those you tell us are <hi>sufficient</hi> and <hi>competent Means</hi>) to make Men <hi>hear and consider as they ought,</hi> there all Men were brought to believe the Gospel; which, whether you will resolve with your self to be true or false, will be to me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and on either hand equally advantage your Cause. Had you appeal'd to Eperience for the Success of the use of Force by the Magistrate, your Argument had not shewn half so much depth of Theological Learning: But the Mischief is, that if you will not make it all of a piece Scholastick, and by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing that all whom the Magistrates use Force upon, <hi>are brought to consider as they ought,</hi> and to all that are so <hi>wrought upon, God does afford that Grace which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> and so roundly conclude for a greater Success of Force, to make Men believe the Gospel, than ever our Saviour and the Apostles had by their Preaching and <hi>Miracles,</hi> (for that wrought not on all) your unanswerable Argument comes to nothing. And in truth, as you have in this Paragraph ordered the matter, by being too sparing of your abstract Metaphysical Reasoning, and imploying it but by halves, we are fain, after all, to come to the dull way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; and must be forced to count, as the Parson does his Communicantes, by his Easter-Book, how many those are <hi>that are so broughs to hear and consider,</hi> to know how far God <hi>blesses</hi>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:49288:163"/>
               <hi>Penalties.</hi> Indeed, were it to be measur'd by conforming; the Easter-Book would be a good Register to determin it. But since you put it upon <hi>Believing,</hi> that will be of some-what a harder Disquisition.</p>
            <p>To my saying, (upon that place out of <hi>Isaiah</hi> VI. 10. <hi>Make the Heart of this People fat, lest they understand, and convert, and be healed</hi>) <q>Will all the Force you can use be a means to make such People hear and understand, and be converted?</q> You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>No, sir, it will not. But what then? What if God declares</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 41.</note> 
               <hi>that he will not heal those who have long resisted all his ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and made themselves, morally speaking, incurable by them? (Which is the utmost,</hi> you say, I <hi>can make of the Words</hi> I <hi>quote.) Will it follow from thence, that no good can be done by Penalties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, who are not so far gone in Wickedness and Obstinacy? If it will not, as it is evident it will not, to what purpose is this said?</hi> It is said to this purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> to shew that Force ought not to be used at all. Those <hi>ordinary Methods</hi> which, resisted, are punished with a Reprobate Sense, are the ordinary Methods of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without Force; as is evident by this place and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, particularly <hi>Rom.</hi> I. From whence I argue; That what State soever you will suppose Men in, either as past, or not yet come to the Day of Grace, no Body can be justified in using Force to work upon them. For till the <hi>ordinary Methods</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and Persuasion can do no more, Force is not <hi>necessary,</hi> (for you cannot say <hi>what other Means is there left</hi>) and so by your own Rule not lawful. For till God hath pronounced this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence here, on any one, <hi>Make his Heart fat, &amp;c.</hi> the ordinary Means of Instruction and Perswasion, may, by the assistance of God's Grace, prevail. And when this Sentence is once passed upon them, and <hi>God will not afford them his Grace to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So that whether it <hi>will follow,</hi> or no, from Mens being given up to a Reprobate Mind, for having resisted the preaching of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>That no good can be done by Penalties upon others;</hi> this will follow, that not knowing whether Preaching may not, by the Grace of God, yet work upon them; or whether the Day of Grace be past with them; neither you nor any Body else can say

that Force is <hi>necessary;</hi> and if it be not <hi>necessary,</hi> you your self tell us it is not to be used.</p>
            <p>In your next Paragraph, you complain of me, as <hi>representing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 41.</note> 
               <hi>your</hi> Argument, as you say <hi>I commonly do, as if you allow'd any Magistrate, of what Religion soever, to lay Penalties upon all that dissent from him.</hi> Unhappy Magistrates that have not your al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance!

               </gap> that they are all under the same Obligation, one as another, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Religion they believe to be the true, whether you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it them or no. For to go no farther than the first Words of your Argument, which you complain I have misrepresented, and which you tell me runs thus, <hi>When Men fly from the Means of right Information;</hi> I ask you here, who shall be Judg of those <hi>Means of right Information,</hi> the Magistrate who joins Force with them to make them be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>But that you may not complain again of my misrepresenting, I must beg my Readers leave to set down your Argument at large in your own Words, and all you say upon it.</hi> When Men fly from the Means of a right Information, and will not so much as consider how reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <note place="margin">A. p. 11.</note> it is, throughly and impartially to examine a Religion, which they imbraced upon such Inducements, as ought to have no sway at all in the matter, and therefore with little or no Examination of the proper grounds of it; What Humane Method can be used to bring them to act like Men, in an Affair of such consequence, and to make a wiser and more rational choice, but that of laying such Penalties upon them, as may ballance the weight of those Prejudices, which inclined them to prefer a False Way before the True, &amp;c. Now this Argument, <hi>you tell me, I</hi> pretend to retort in this manner: <q>
                  <hi>And, I say, I see no</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>other Means left (taking the World as we now find it, wherein the Magistrate never lays Penalties, for Matters of Religion, upon those of his own Church, nor is it to be expected they ever should) to make Men of the National Church, any where, throughly and impartially examine a Religion, which they imbraced upon such Inducements as ought to have no sway at all in the matter, and therefore with little or no examination of the proper Grounds of it: And therefore, I conclude the use of Force by Dissenters upon Conformists necessary. I appeal</hi>

               </q> And <hi>you say, you are</hi> well content the World should judg. And when it determines, that there is the same reason to say, That to bring those who conform to the National Church, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their Religion, it is necessary for Dissenters (who cannot possibly have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Power, because the National Church has that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> its side, and cannot be National without it) to use Force upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, As there is to say, That where the National Church is the True Church, there to bring Dissenters (as <hi>I</hi> call them) to examine their Religion, it is necessary for the Magistrate (who has the Coactive Power) to lay moderate Penalties upon them for <hi>dissenting: You</hi> say, when the World determines thus, <hi>you</hi> will never pretend any more to judg what is reasonable, in any case what soever. For <hi>you</hi> doubt not but <hi>you</hi> may safely presume that the <hi>World</hi> will easily admit these two things. <hi>1.</hi> That though it be very fit and desirable, that all that are of the true Religion, should understand the true Grounds of it; that so they may be the better able, both to defend themselves against the assaults of Seducers, and to reduce such as are out of the Way; yet this is not strictly necessary to their Salvation: Because Experience shews (as far as Men are capable to judg of such Matters) that many do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> believe and profess the true Religion, and conscientiously pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the Duties of it, who yet do not understand the true Grounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it challenges their Belief: And no Man doubts but who soever does so believe, profess, and practise the True Religion, if he perseveres to the end, shall certainly attain Salvation by it. <hi>2.</hi> That how much soever i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> concerns those who reject the true Religion (whom <hi>I</hi> may call <note place="margin">P. 39.</note> 
               <hi>Dissenters</hi> if <hi>I</hi> please) to examine and consider why they do so; and how needful soever Penalties may be to bring them to this; it is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tterly unreasonable that such as have not the Coactive Power, should take upon them to inslict Penalties for that purpose: Because, as that is not consistent with Order and Government; which cannot stand, <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note> where private Persons are permitted to usurp the Coactive Power; So there is nothing more manifest, than that the prejudice which is done to Religion, and to the Interest of Mens Souls, by destroying Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, does infinitely outweigh any good that can possibly be done by that which destroys it. And whoever admits and considers these things, <hi>you say, you are</hi> very secure will be far enough from admitting, that there is any Parity of Reason in the Cases we here speak of, or that <hi>mine is as just and natural a Conclusion as yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:49288:165"/>
The sum of what you say, amounts to thus much. Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to take up their Religion, upon <hi>Inducements that ought to have no sway at all in the Matter,</hi> and so, <hi>with little or no Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Grounds of it;</hi> therefore Penalties are necessary to be laid on them, to make them <hi>throughly</hi> and <hi>impartially examine.</hi> But yet Penalties need not be laid on Conformists, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to make them examine; because they, and you, believe yours to be the true Religion: Though it must be laid on Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians and Independents, &amp;c. to make them examine, though they believe theirs to be the true Religion; because you believe it not to be so. But you give another very substantial Reason, why Penalties cannot be laid on Conformists, to make them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine; and that is, <hi>because the National Church has the Coactive Power on its side,</hi> and therefore they have no need of Penalties to make them examine. The National Church of <hi>France</hi> too, has <hi>the Co-active Power on its side;</hi> and therefore, they who are of it have no need of Penalties, any of them, to make them examine.</p>
            <p>If your Argument be good, that Men take up their Religions <note place="margin">A. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> upon wrong <hi>Inducements,</hi> and <hi>without</hi> due <hi>Examination of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Grounds of it;</hi> and that therefore, they have need of Penalties to be laid on them to make them <hi>examine,</hi> as they ought, the Grounds of their Religion; You must confess there are some in the Church of <hi>England</hi> to whom Penalties are necessary: Unless you will affirm, that all, who are in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have so examin'd: But that I think you will not do, however you indeavour to palliate their Ignorance, and Negligence, in this matter. There being therefore a need of Penalties; I say, 'tis as necessary that Presbyterians should lay Penalties on the Conformists of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to make them examine, as for the Church of <hi>England</hi> to lay Penalties on the Presbyterians to make them do so: For they each equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Religion to be true; and we suppose, on both sides, there are those who have not duly <hi>examin'd.</hi> But here you think you have a sure advantage, by saying <hi>it is not consistent with the Order of Government,</hi> and so is <hi>impracticable.</hi> I easily grant it. But is yours more practicable? When you can make your way practicable, for the end for which you pretend it necessary (<hi>viz.</hi>) to make <hi>all,</hi> who have taken <hi>up their Religion upon such Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ought to have no sway at all in the Matter, to examine</hi>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:49288:165"/>
               <hi>throughly and impartially the proper grounds of it;</hi> When, I say, you can shew your way practicable, to this end, you will have clear'd it of one main Objection, and convinc'd the World that yours is a more just and natural Conclusion than mine.</p>
            <p>If your Cause were capable of any other defence, I suppose we should not have had so long and elaborate an Answer as you have given us in this Paragraph, which at last bottoms only on these two things: 1. That there is in you, or those of your Church, some Approaches towards Insallibility; in your Belief that your Religion is true; which is not to be allow'd those of other Churches, in the Belief of theirs. 2. That it is enough if any one does but conform to it, and remain in the Communion of your Church: Or else one would think there should be as much need for Conformists too of your Church, to <hi>examine the Grounds</hi> of their Religion, as for any others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To understand the true Grounds of the True Religion; is not,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 42.</note> you say, <hi>strictly necessary to Salvation.</hi> Yet, I think, you will not deny, but it is as <hi>strictly necessary to Salvation,</hi> as it is to conform to a National Church in all those things it imposes: some whereof, are not necessary to Salvation; some whereof, are acknowledg'd by all to be indifferent; and some whereof, to some conscientious Men, who thereupon decline Communion, appear unsound or unlawful. If not being <hi>strictly necessary to Salvation,</hi> will excuse from Penalties in the one case, why will it not in the other? And now I shall excuse <hi>the World</hi> from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining my Conclusion to be as natural as yours: For 'tis pity so reasonable a Disputant as you are, should take so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a Resolution as <hi>never to pretend any more to judg what is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable in any case what soever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether you have proved that Force, used by the Magistrate, be a Means prescrib'd by God to procure the Gift of Faith from him, (which is all you say in the next Paragraph,) others must judg.</p>
            <p>In that following; you quote these Words of mine. <q>If all the Means God has appointed to make Men hear and consider, be Exhortation in season and out of season, &amp;c. together with Prayer for them, and the Example of Meekness, and a good Life; this is all ought to be done, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. </q>To which you thus reply, <hi>But if</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 43.</note> 
               <hi>these be not all the Means God has appointed, then these things are</hi>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:49288:166"/>
               <hi>not all that ought to be done.</hi> But if I ask you, How do you know that this is not all God has appointed, you have nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer (to bring it to your present purpose) but that you know it by the Light of Nature. For all you say is but this; That by the Light of Nature you know Force to be useful and necessary to bring Men into the way of Salvation; By the Light of Nature you know the Magistrate has a Commission to use Force to that purpose; And by the same Light of Nature, you know that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were appointed to supply the want of Force till the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates were Christians. I imagine, Sir, you would scarce have thought this a reasonable Answer, if you had taken notice of my Words in the same Paragraph immediately preceding those you have cited; Which (that you may see the Scope of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) I will here trouble you with again; and they are these.<q>It is not for you and me, out of an Imagination that they may <note place="margin">I. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note> be useful, or are necessary, to prescribe Means in the great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Work of Salvation, other than what God himself has directed. God has appointed Force as useful and necessary, and therefore it is to be used, is a way of Arguing becoming the Ignorance and Humility of poor Creatures. But I think Force useful or necessary, and therefore it is to be used, has methinks a little too much Presumption in it. You ask what Means is there left? None, say I, to be used by Man, but what God himself has directed in the Scriptures, wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all the Means and Methods of Salvation. Faith is the Gift of God. And we are not to use any other Means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this Gift to any one, but what God himself has prescribed. If he has prescribed appointed, that any should be forced to hear those <hi>who tell them they have mistaken their way, and offer to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, if they did not; 'twill be past doubt, it is to be made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>My Argument here lies plainly in this; That all the Means and Methods of Salvation are contain'd in the Scripture: Which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you were to have deny'd, or else have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>But let us examine a little the Parts of what you here say. <q>
                  <hi>As to the first Spreaders of the Gospel,</hi> say you, <hi>it has already been those, that God appointed other Means besides</hi> Exhortation in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and out of season, Prayer, and the Example of a good Life, <hi>for them to use to induce Men to hear and consider.</hi> What were those other Means? To that you answer readily, <hi>Miracles. Ergo,</hi> Men are directed now by Scripture to use <hi>Miracles.</hi> Or else what Answer do you make to my Argument, which I gave you in these Words, `No Means is to be used by <hi>Man,</hi> but what God himself has directed in the Scriptures; wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd all the Means and Methods of Salvation.</q> No, they cannot use <hi>Miracles</hi> now as a Means, say you, for they have them not. What then? Therefore the Magistrate, who has it, must use Force to supply the want of those <hi>extraordinary Means which are now ceased.</hi> This indeed is an Inference of yours, but not of the Scriptures. Does the Scripture say any thing of this? Not a word: not so much as the least Intimation towards it in all the New Testament. Be it then true or false, that Force is a <hi>Means</hi> to be used by Men in the absence of <hi>Miracles,</hi> this is yet no Answer
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:49288:167"/>
to my Argument; this is no Proof that'tis appointed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which is the thing my Argument turns on.</p>
            <p>Revelation then fails you. Let us see now how Reason and Common Sense, that common Light of Nature, will help you out.</p>
            <p>You then reason thus. Bare Preaching, &amp;c. will not prevail on <hi>Men</hi> to hear and consider: and therefore some <hi>other Means</hi> is <hi>necessary</hi> to make them do so. Pray what do you mean by <hi>Men,</hi> or any other of those indefinite Terms, you have always used in this Case? Is it that bare Preaching will prevail on <hi>no Men?</hi> Does Reason (under which I comprehend Experience too, and all the ways of Knowledg, contradistinguish'd to Revelation) discover any such thing to you? I imagine you will not say that; or pretend that no Body was ever brought, by Preaching and Perswasion, to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> the Truths of the Gospel, (mean by <hi>considering</hi> what you will) without other Means used by those who applied themselves to the care of converting them. To such therefore as may be brought to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>consider,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other Means, you will not say that other Means are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>In the next place, therefore, When you say bare Preaching will not prevail on <hi>Men;</hi> Do you mean that't will not prevail on <hi>all Men,</hi> and therefore'tis necessary that Men should use other Means? Neither, I think, will Reason authorise you to draw such a Consequence: Because neither will Preaching alone, nor Preaching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with Force; or any other Means Man can use, prevail on <hi>all Men.</hi> And therefore no other Means can be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be necellary to be used by Man, to do what Men by those Means never did, nor never can do.</p>
            <p>That some Men shall be saved, and not all, is, I think, past question to all that are Christians: And those that shall be saved, 'tis plain, are the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</hi> If you think not this plain enough in Scripture, I desire you to turn to the 17th of the 29 Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where you will read these Words: <hi>Predestination to Life is the everlasting Purpose of God, whereby (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundations of the World were laid) he hath const de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by his Counsel secret to us, to deliver from Curse and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion those whom he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If you say it will; the neceslity of your other Means, I think, is out of doors. If you say it will not; I desire you to tell me how you do know it without Revelation; And whether by your own reason you can tell us, whether any, and what Means God has made necessary, besides what he has appointed in Scripture for the calling his <hi>Elect.</hi> When you can do this, we shall think you no ordinary Divine, nor a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the secret Counsels of the insinitely wise God.

The outward Means that God has appointed for this, is Preaching. Ay, but Preaching is not enough; that is, not sussicient Means, say you. And I ask you how you know it; since the Scripture, which declares all that we can know in this matter, says nothing of the Insussiciency of it, or of the Necessity of any other? Nor can there be a Necessity of any other Means than wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I must desire you here to take notice, that by Preaching, which I use for Shortness, I mean Exhortation, Instruction, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, Praying for, and in fine, any outward Means of Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the Power of Man, separate from Force.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:49288:168"/>
You tell us here, <hi>As to the first Spreaders of the Gospel, God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed other Means, viz.</hi> Miracles, <hi>for them to use to induce Men to hear and consider.</hi> If by the <hi>first Spreaders of the Gospel,</hi> you <note place="margin">P. 43.</note> mean the twelve Apostles and 70 Disciples, whom Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sent to preach the Gospel; They indeed were appointed by his immediate Command, to shew Miracles by-the Power which he had bestowed upon them. But will you say, all the Ministers and Preachers of the Gospel had such a Commission, and such a Power all along from the Apostles time; and that they, every one, did actually shew Miracles to induce Men <hi>to hear and consider,</hi> quite down, till <hi>Christianity was supported by the Law of the Empire?</hi> Unless you could shew this, though you could produce some well-attested Miracles, done by some Men in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Age till that time, yet it would not be sufficient to prove that Miracles were <hi>appointed</hi> to be constantly used to <hi>induce Men to hear and consider;</hi> and so by your Reasoning, to supply the want of Force, till that necessary Assistance could be had from the Authority of the Magistrate become Christian. For since it is what You build upon, that Men will not <hi>hear and consider</hi> upon bare Preaching, (and I think you will forwardly enough agree, that till <hi>Christianity was made the Religion of the Empira,</hi> there were those every where that <hi>heard</hi> the Preachers of it so little, or so little <hi>consider'd</hi> what they said, that they rejected the Gospel;) and that therefore Miracles or Force are necessary Means to make Men <hi>hear and consider;</hi> You must own that those who preach'd without the Power of Miracles, or the Coactive Power of the Magistrate accompanying them, were unfurnish'd of <hi>competent</hi> and sufficient Means to make Men <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>consider;</hi> and so to bring them to the True Religion. If you will say the Miracles done by others were enough to accompany their Preaching, to make it be <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>consider'd;</hi> the Preaching of the Ministers at this day is so accompanied, and so will need no assistance of Force from the Magistrate. If the report of Miracles done by one Minister of the Gospel some time before, and in another place, were sufficient to make the Preaching of ten or a thousand others, be <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>consider'd,</hi> why is it not so now? For the Credibility and Attestation of the Report is all that is of moment; when Miracles done by others, in other places, are the Argument that prevails. But this, I fear, will not serve your turn in the business of Penalties; and whatever
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:49288:168"/>
might satisfy you in the case of Miracles, I doubt you would not think the Salvation of Souls sufficiently provided for, if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Force of Penalties, used some time since on one side of the <hi>Tweed,</hi> were all that should assist the Preachers of the True Religion on the other, to make Men <hi>hear and consider.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Cretans,</hi> by the Account St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of them, were a People that would require all the Means that were needful to prevail with any Strangers to the Gospel to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>consider.</hi> But yet we find nothing directed for the Support and Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel in this Island, but Preaching, Exhortation, Reproof, &amp;c. with the Example of a good Life. In all this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, writ on purpose to instruct the Preachers of the Gospel, in the Means they were to use among the <hi>Cretans,</hi> for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, not a word about Miracles, their Power or Use: Which one would think strange, if They were the Means appointed and necessary to make Men <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>consider,</hi> and without which they would not do it. Preaching, Admonition, Exhortation, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, Instruction, by the common Light of Reason, were known, and natural to be used, to perswade Men. There needed not be much said to convince Men of it. But if <hi>Miracles</hi> were a necessary Means, it was a Means wholly new, unexpected, and out of the Power of other Teachers. And therefore one would think, if they were appointed for the Ends you propose, one
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:49288:169"/>
should hear something of that Appointment: Since that they were to be used; or how, and when; was farther from common Apprehension; and seems to need some particular Direction.</p>
            <p>If you say the same Spirit that gave them the Power of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacles,</hi> would also give them the knowledg both that they had it, and how to use it; I am far enough from limiting the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of that infinitely wise Spirit, who will not fail to bring all the Elect of God into the Obedience of Truth, by those Means, and in that manner he shall think necessary. But yet our Saviour, when he sent abroad his Disciples, with the Power of <hi>Miracles,</hi> not only put it in their Commission, whereby they were informed that they had that extraordinary Gift, but added Instructions to them in the use of it. <hi>Freely you have received, freely give;</hi> A Caution as necessary to the <hi>Cretan</hi> Elders, in the use of Miracles, if they had that Power; There being nothing more liable to be turn'd to the advantage of <hi>Filthy Lucre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not question but the Spirit of God might give the Power, and stir up the Mind of the first Spreaders of the Gospel to do <hi>Miracles</hi> on some extraordinary occasion. But if they were a necessary means, to make Men hear and consider what was preached to them, till Force supplied their place; and so were ordinarily to accompany the preaching of the Gospel, (unless it should be preach'd without the means appointed and necessary to make it prevail) I think, in that case, we may expect it should expresly have made a part of the Preachers Commission; it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a necessary part of the effectual Execution of his Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

               <hi>as old as St.</hi> Austin. Whatever he says in the place you quote, it shews only his Opinion, but not that it was ever used. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to shew it not to be new in practice, you add, that yon <hi>think it has been made use of by all those Magistrates, who having made all requisite Provisions for the instructing their People in the Truth, have likewise requir'd them under convenient Penalties to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it.</hi> Which is as much as to say, that those Magistrates who used your Method, did use your Method. And that certainly you may <hi>think</hi> safely, and without fear of being gainsaid.</p>
            <p>But now I will tell you what I think, in my turn: And that is, if you could have found any Magistrates who had made use of your Method, as well as you think you have found a Divine that approves of it, you would have named those Magistrates as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly as you do St. <hi>Austin.</hi> If I think amiss, pray correct me yet, and name them.</p>
            <p>That which makes me imagine you will hardly find any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 24.</note> of it, is what I there said in these Words; <q>All other Law-makers have constantly taken this Method; that where any thing was to be amended, the Fault was first declared, and then Penalties denounced against all those who after a time set, should be found guilty of it. This the common Sense of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the very Reason of Laws (which are intended not for Punishment but Correction) has made so plain, that the subtilest and most refined Law-makers have not gone out of this Course, nor have the most ignorant and barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mist it. But you have out-done <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus, Moses,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and are resolved to be a Law-maker of a Way by your self. 'Tis an old and obsolete Way, and will not,

To allow of Impunity to the Innocent, or the Opportunity of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to those who would avoid the Penalties, are Formalities not worth your Notice. You are for a shorter and surer Way. Take a whole Tribe, and punish them at all Adventures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guilty or no of the Miscariage which you would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; or without so much as telling them what it is you would have them do, but leaving them to find it out if they can. All these Absurdities are contained in your Way of proceding; And are impossible to be avoided by any one, who will punish Dissenters, and only Dissenters, to make them <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and weigh the Grounds of their Religion,</hi> and <hi>impartially exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether it be true or no, and</hi> upon <hi>what Grounds they took it up;</hi> that so they may <hi>find</hi> and <hi>

You were best to say so on the other side of the Water. 'Tis sure the Punishments were Punishments, and the Dragooning was Dragooning. And if you think that Plea excus'd them not, I am of your Mind.

If the Magistrate no-where is to be judg who are Dissenters from the true Religion, he can no-where punish them. If he be to be every-where Judg, then the King of <hi>France,</hi> or the Great Turk, must punish those whom they judg Dissenters from the true Religion, as well as other Potentates. If some Magistrates have a right to judg, and others not; That yet, I fear, (how absurd soever it be) should I grant it, will not do your business.

Unless it be this insupportable Presumption, that your <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> ought to be the Measure of all <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> in all others, which how you can claim, without pretending to Infallibility, is not easy to discern.</p>
            <p>The Diversion you give your self, about the likeness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeness of those two Pleas, I shall not trouble my self with; since, when your Fit of Mirth was over, you were forced to confess, That as I <hi>have made your Plea for</hi> you, you <hi>think there</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 45.</note> 
               <hi>is no considerable difference, as to the</hi> Fairness <hi>of them, excepting what arises from the different degrees of Punishment, in the</hi> French <hi>Discipline, and</hi> your <hi>Method. But if the</hi> French <hi>Plea be not true; and that which I make to be</hi> yours <hi>be not</hi> yours;—I must beg your pardon, Sir, I did not think it was your Opinion, (nor do I yet remember that you any where said in your <hi>A. &amp;c.</hi>) that Men were to be punish'd for their Religion; but that it was purely to make Men <hi>examine the Religion they had imbraced, and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that they had rejected.</hi> And if that were of moment, I should think my self sufficiently justified, for this my Mistake, by what you say in your <hi>Argument, &amp;c.</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 6, to 12. But since you explain your self otherwise here, I am not unwilling to take your Hypothesis, as you from time to time shall please to reform it. You answer then, That to <hi>make them examine, is indeed the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>next End for which they are to be punish'd. But what is that to</hi> my <hi>Question? Which, if it be pertinent, demands for what Fault, not for what End, they are to be punish'd: As appears even by</hi> my <hi>next Words.</hi> 
               <q>So that they are punish'd, not for having offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Law, (<hi>i. e. not for any Fault;</hi>) for there is no Law in <hi>England</hi> that requires them to examine.</q> This, I must confess, was to shew, that here, as in <hi>France,</hi> whatever was pretended, yet the True Reason why People were punish'd, was their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And it was for this Agreement, that in both Places Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:49288:172"/>
was meant, though something else was talked of, that I said your plea was like that made use of in <hi>France.</hi> But I see I might have spared my Pains to prove that you punish Diffenters for their Religion, since you here own it.</p>
            <p>You tell me, in the same place, I was impertinent in my Question, (which was this, <hi>For what then are they to be punish'd?</hi>) that I demanded for what <hi>End,</hi> and not for what <hi>Fault</hi> they are to be punish'd. In good earnest, Sir, I was not so subtile as to distinguish them. I always thought that the <hi>End</hi> of all Laws was to amend those Faults which were forbidden; and that when any one was punish'd, the <hi>Fault</hi> for which he was punish'd was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ransgression of the Law, in that particular which was by the Law commanded or forbidden; and the End of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, was the Amendment of that <hi>Fault</hi> for the future. For Example; If the Law commanded to <hi>hear,</hi> not <hi>Hearing</hi> was the Fault punish'd; and the End of that Punishment, was to make the Offenders <hi>hear.</hi> If the Law commanded to <hi>examine,</hi> the <hi>Fault</hi> punish'd, when that Law was put in Execution, was not <hi>Examining;</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of the Punishment, to make the Offenders <hi>examine.</hi> If the Law commanded Conformity, the <hi>Fault</hi> was Nonconformity, and the <hi>End</hi> of it to make Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>This was my Apprehension concerning Laws, and Ends of Punishments. And I must own my self still so dull as not to distinguish otherwise between the <hi>Fault for which</hi> Men <hi>are to be punish'd, and the End for which</hi> they <hi>are to be punish'd,</hi> but only as the one is past, the other future. The Transgression or <hi>Fault,</hi> is an Omission or Action that a Man is already guilty of; the <hi>End</hi> of the Punishment, that it be not again repeated. So that if a Man be punish'd for the Religion he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, I can see no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>End</hi> for which he is punish'd, but to make him quit that Religion. No other immediate <hi>End</hi> I mean; for other remote <hi>Ends,</hi> to which this is subordinate, it may have. So that if <hi>not examining</hi> the Religion which Men have imbraced, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they have rejected, be not the Fault for which Men are punish'd; I would be glad you would shew me how it can be the <hi>next End,</hi> as you say it is, of their being punish'd. And that you may not think my Dullness gives you a Labour without Ground, I will tell you the Reason why I cannot find any other <hi>next End</hi> of Punishment, but the Amendment of the Fault for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden;
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:49288:173"/>
and that is, Because That seems to me to be the <hi>End,</hi> the <hi>next End,</hi> of any Action; which, when obtain'd, the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to cease, and not cease till it be attain'd. And thus, I think, it is, in Punishments, ordain'd by the Law. When the Fault for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden is amended, the Punishment is to cease, and not till then. This is the only way I have to know the <hi>End,</hi> or final Cause for which any Action is done. If you have any other, you will do me a kindness to instruct me. This 'tis which makes me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, (and I think with me all those who have not had the Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Happiness to attain the utmost resining of the Schools) that if their <hi>Religion</hi> be the <hi>Fault</hi> for which Dissenters are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, Examining is not the <hi>End</hi> for which they are punish'd; but the Change of their Religion: Though Examining may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in some Men, precede their Change, and help to it. But that is not necessary. A Man may change his Religion without it: And when he has chang'd, let the Motive be what it will, the <hi>End</hi> the Law aims at is obtain'd, and the Punishment ceases. So on the other side, If <hi>not Hearing,</hi> not <hi>Examining,</hi> be the <hi>Fault</hi> for which Men are punish'd, Conformity is not the <hi>next End</hi> for which they are punish'd, though it may perhaps, in some, be a Consequence of it; but <hi>Hearing</hi> and <hi>Examining</hi> must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be the <hi>Ends</hi> for which they are punish'd. If they are not the <hi>Ends,</hi> why does the Punishment cease when those <hi>Ends</hi> are attain'd? And thus you have my Thoughts concerning this Matter, which perhaps will not be very pertinent (as mine have not the good luck always to be to you) to a Man of nicer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions.</p>
            <p>But let us consider your Hypothesis as it now stands, and see what advantage you have got to your Cause by this new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. <hi>Dissenters from the True Religion are to be punish'd,</hi> say you, <hi>for their Religion.</hi> Why? Because 'tis a <hi>Fault.</hi> Against whom? Against God. Thence it follows indeed, that God, if he pleases, may punish it. But how will you prove that God has given the Magistrates of the Earth a Power to punish all Faults against himself? Covetousness, or not loving our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our selves, are Faults or Sins against God. Ought the Magistrate to punish these? But I shall not need to trouble you much with that Question. This Matter I think will be decided between us without going so sar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:49288:173"/>
If the Magistrate may punish any one for not being of the True Religion, must the Magistrate judg what is that True Religion or no? If he must not, what must guide him in the punishing of some, and not of others? For so it is in all places where there is a National Religion establish'd by Penal Laws. If the Magistrate be commission'd by the same Law of Nature (for that is all the Commission you pretend to) to judg what is the True Religion, by which he is authorized to punish those who dissent from it; Must not all Magistrates judg, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly punish those who dissent from that, which they judg the True Religion, <hi>i. e.</hi> in effect, those who dissent from theirs? And if all Magistrates have a Power to punish those who are not of their Religion, I ask you, Whether it be of more use or disadvantage to the promoting <hi>True Religion</hi> and <hi>Salvation of Souls?</hi> And when you have resolved that Question, you will then be able to tell me whether the Usefulness of it (which must be determin'd by the greater Good or Harm it is like to do) is such as to justify your Doctrine about it, or the Magistrate's use of it.</p>
            <p>Besides, your making the Dissenting from the True Religion a <hi>Pault</hi> to be punish'd by the Magistrate, puts an end to your Pretence to <hi>moderate</hi> Punishments; which, in this place, you make use of to distinguish yours from the <hi>French</hi> Method; saying, That your <hi>Method punishes Men with Punishments which do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be called so, when compared with those of the French Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi> But if the Dissenting from the True Religion, be a <hi>Fault</hi> that the Magistrate is to punish, and a <hi>Fault</hi> of that consequence, that it draws with it the loss of a Man's Soul; I do not see how other Magistrates, whose Duty it is to punish Faults under his Cognizance, and by punishing to amend them, can be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss than the King of <hi>France</hi> has been, and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the next place; I do not see how, by your Method, as you explain it here, the Magistrate can punish any one for not being of the True Religion, (though we should grant him to have a Power to do it) whilst you tell us, That your <hi>Method punishes Men for rejecting the True Religion, propos'd to them with sufficient</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 45.</note> 
               <hi>Evidence, which certainly is a Fault.</hi> By this Part of your Scheme it is plain, that you allow the Magistrate to punish none but those to <hi>whom the True Religion is propos'd with sufficient Evidence.</hi> And sufficient Evidence, you tell us, <hi>is such as will certainly win</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 53.</note> 
               <hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> where-ever it is duty consider'd.</hi> Now by this Rule, there will be very few that the Magistrate will have right to punish; since he cannot know whether those who dissent, do it for want of <hi>due Consideration</hi> in them, or want of <hi>sufficient Evidence</hi> in what is proposed; unless you mean by <hi>due Consideration,</hi> such <hi>Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> that always does bring Men actually to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; which is in effect to say nothing at all. For then your Rule amounts to thus much, <hi>That sufficient Evidence is such as will certainly win As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent where-ever it is consider'd duly, i. e.</hi> so as to win Assent. This being like some of those other Rules we have met with, and ending in a Circle, Which after you have traced, you at last sind your self just where you were at setting out; I leave it to you to own as you think sit: And tell you, if by <hi>duly considering,</hi> you mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering to his utmost; that then, that which is propos'd to one with <hi>sufficient Evidence to win Assent,</hi> may not be so to another.</p>
            <p>There are Propositions extant in Geometry, with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations annexed, and that with such sufficient Evidence to some Men of deep Thought and Penetration, as to make them see the Demonstration, and give Assent to the Truth: Whilst there are many others, and those no No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ices in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, who with all the Consideration and Attention they can use, are never able to attain unto it. 'Tis so in other Parts of Truth. That which hath Evidence enough to make one Man certain, has not enough to make another so much as guess it to be true, though he has spared no Endcavour or Application in examining it. And therefore, if the Magistrate be to punish none but those who <hi>reject the True Religion,</hi> when it has been offer'd <hi>with sufficient Evidence,</hi> I imagine he will not have many to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish; if he will, as he ought, distinguish between the Innocent and the Guilty.</p>

            <p>But that you may not think, whilst I had under Consideration the dangerous Encouragement you gave to Men in Power, to be very busy with their Force in Matters of Religion, by all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thus then stands your System. <hi>The procuring and advancing any way of the spiritual and eternal Interests of Men, is one of the Ends of Civil Society.</hi> And Force is put into the Magistrate's hands, as necessary for the attaining those Ends, where <hi>no other Means are left,</hi> 
               <q>Who then upon your Grounds may quickly find Reason, where it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But you say, <hi>Unless it be as necessary for Men to attain any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

But that there is the same necessity of Mens attaining a greater degree of Glory, as there is of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Glory, no Man will affirm. For without attaining</hi> Glory, <hi>they cannot escape the Demnation of Hell, which yet they may escape, without any</hi> greater degree <hi>of Glory.</hi> One of the <hi>Ends</hi> of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is, say you, the <hi>advancing Mens eternal Interests.</hi> The procuring greater degrees of Glory, is the advancing a Man's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Interest.

               <note place="margin">P. 73.</note> for the attaining any degree of Glory. But you will say, <hi>Attaining Glory is absolutely necessary, but the attaining any greater degree of Glory, however desirable, is not so necessary. Now if there be not the same necessity of the one of these, as there is of the other, there can be no Pretence to say, that whatever is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in respect of one of them, is likewise so in respect of the other.</hi> But there will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be a just Pretence to say, if <hi>advancing the eternal Interests</hi> of Men be one of the Ends of a Commonwealth, and that the Force in the Magistrate's hands be <hi>necessary</hi> to the attaining that End; that then the Magistrate is obliged to use it; whether you will think that End <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> or as <hi>necessary</hi> as another, or no. I shall not here trouble you again with your Mistake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what is <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> having taken notice of it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. Only I shall desire you to shew me, that the <hi>attaining of Glory is absolutely necessary,</hi> when next time you have occasion to affirm it. <hi>Attaining of Glory</hi> is necessary in order to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: And attaining a greater degree of Glory, is necessary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to greater Happiness: But neither of them is <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> but in order to their respective Ends.</p>

And now though, as you say, you <hi>do not think</hi> your <hi>self bound to take notice of all that may be done with some pretence of Right:</hi> Yet, I suppose, upon cooler Thoughts, when you have consider'd of what dangerous Consequence an Argument, manag'd as yours is, may be to the <hi>True Religion,</hi> and the sincere Prosessors of it; and what Occalion or Encouragement it may give to Men in Power warm'd with Zeal, and excited by the <hi>proper Ministers</hi> of their own Religion, to make a wrong and exorbitant Use of Force in Matters of Religion, you will another time think your self bound not to let it go abroad again without some Caution to the Magistrate in the Use of it; without one word of Advice at least, that since it is given him, as you say, only for <hi>promoting the True Religion,</hi> he should take care and examine impartially whether what he imploys it for, be the one only True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. It being your Opinion whenever he makes use of Force in Matters of Religion, for the promoting any thing but that, he goes beyond his Commission, injures his Subjects, and indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers his own Soul.</p>
            <p>By this time, Sir, I suppose you see upon what Grounds I think you have not clear'd those Difficulties which were charg'd by me on your Method: And my Reader will see what reason there was for those Imputations which, with so loud an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, you laid upon me of unfair Dealing; since there is not one of them which cannot be made good to be contain'd either in your Book or in your Hypothesis; and that so clearly, that I could not imagine that a Man who had so far consider'd Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to engage in Print, in such a Controversy as this, could miss seeing it as soon as mention'd to him. One of them which very much offends you, and makes you so often tell me what I say is <hi>impertinent</hi> and <hi>nothing to the purpose,</hi> and sometimes to use warmer Expressions, is, that I argue against a Power in the Magistrate to bring Men to his own Religion: For I could not imagine that, to a Man of any Thought, it could need proving; that if there were a <hi>Commission</hi> given to all Magistrates by <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> which obliged them to use Force to bring Men <hi>to the True Religion,</hi> it was not possible for them to put this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission in execution, without being Judges <hi>what was the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> and then there needed no great quickness to perceive, that every Magistrate, when your Commission came to be put in execution, would, one as well as another, find himself obliged to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:49288:176"/>
use Force to bring Men to that which he believed to be the True Religion. But since this was so hard for you to see, I now have been at the pains to prove it, and thereby to clear all thoseIm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations. I shall not instance in any other: They are all of a like kind. Only where you complain I have not cited your Words fairly, if you can shew that I have done it any where in this or the Second Letter, to the advantage of my Cause; or to avoid any Argument in them, not answered; if you please to shew it me, I shall either let you see your Mistake, or acknowledg mine.</p>
            <p>And now whether you shall think what I have said worth that <hi>Consideration</hi> you promise, or take it all for <hi>Cavils and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">P. 78.</note> to me is very indifferent. Enjoy if you please that short and easy way of answering. But if the <hi>Party you write for,</hi> be, as you say, <hi>God and the Souls of Men,</hi> it will require you se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to weigh your Scheme, examine and put together the Parts of it, observe its Tendency and Consequences; and in a word, consider Things, and not Words. For the <hi>Party of God and Souls</hi> needs not any Help from Obscurity or Uncertainty of general and equivocal Terms, but may be spoke out clearly and distinctly; Needs no retreat in the round of equivalent, or the uncertainty of misapply'd Expressions, that may serve to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse and deceive the unwary, but instruct no body; And lastly, needs no Leave nor Allowance from <hi>Men of Art</hi> to direct both Subjects and Magistrates to the Examination of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> wherein God has reveal'd to the World the Ways and Means of Salvation. In doing of this, in a Treatise where you profess <note place="margin">P. 68.</note> 
               <hi>the Subject of your Enquiry is only what Method is to be used to bring Men to the True Religion;</hi> the <hi>Party</hi> you profess to write for would have justified you against the Rules of any lawful <hi>Art;</hi> and no Christian Man, <hi>of</hi> what <hi>Art</hi> soever, would have denied you that Liberty: And, if I mistake not, the <hi>Party,</hi> you say you write for, demands it of you.</p>
            <p>If you find upon a Review of the whole, that you have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd your Cause for <hi>God and the Souls of Men,</hi> with that Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Clearness that satisfies your own Reason, and you think may satisfy that of other Men, I shall congratulate to you so happy a Constitution. But if all your magnified and <hi>necessary</hi> Means of Force, in the way you contend for, reaches no farther than to bring Men to a bare outward Conformity to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> wherein you can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

that all that are of it are so upon Reason and Conviction; I suppose there needs no more to be said to convince the World what <hi>Party</hi> you write for.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Party</hi> you <hi>write</hi> for is <hi>God,</hi> you say.

'Tis true, you all along speak of bringing Men <hi>to the True Religion.</hi> But to evidence to you, that by <hi>the one only True Religion,</hi> you mean only that of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> I tell you, that upon your Principles, you cannot name any other Church now in the World, (and I again demand of you to do it) for the promoting whereof, or punishing Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from it, the Magistrate has the same Right to use Force, as you pretend he has here in <hi>England.</hi> Till you therefore name some such other True Church and True Religion, besides that of <hi>England,</hi> your saying that <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Party</hi> you <hi>write for,</hi> will rather shew that you make bold with his Name, than that you do not write for another <hi>Party.</hi>

But I think I may say, Truth (in its full Latitude, of those gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Principles of the Gospel, which so much recommend and inculcate universal Charity, and a Freedom from the Inventions and Impositions of Men in the things of God,) has so seldom had a fair and favourable Hearing any where, that he must be very ignorant of the History and Nature of Man, however dignified and distinguish'd, who proposes to himself any secular Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by writing for her at that rate.</p>
