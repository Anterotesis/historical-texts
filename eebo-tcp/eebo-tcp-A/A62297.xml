            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>MOrtuo Ladislao Rege Maximo, Princeps Invictissime, Poloni divino Numine afflati te Regem Suffragiis suis Elegerunt,</hi> For in what manner, Sir, can I better accost your Greatness than in the Method and Form which the Ancient Polonians us'd to Elect their Sovereigns? Your Eternal Fame has spread it self round the World: And doubtless that Head of yours, when first Moulded by Midwife Nature, was Predestinated to wear the Glorious Circle, and be lifted up to that conspicuous point and elevation that the Nations below might look upon it with fear and wonder, and with Satisfaction see the Effects of Popular Wisedom and Machiavilian Policy.</p>
            <p>Thus as your Propitious Stars Appoint you, in your Wane of Years, and approaching Evil days of Bitterness and Infirmity, to Possess and Rule, though not to Fill and Enjoy, the Regal Seat; so let your Soul be transform'd from your Old Ambition to a New and more Exalted Modell of Grandeur, and Commence an Arbitrary Government that may make you fear'd and hated by your People; for you know a Monarch never rises to the highest pitch of Greatness till then, and a Prince that is Elected for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Merit and Mighty Parts as you Expect to be, is rather to be fear'd than belov'd, and consequently ought to depend upon the firm Basis of his more Successfull Power and Policy.</p>
            <p>This Counsel, Sir, I am assured is very Natural and Obvious to your Mightiness's Understanding; for who ever knew a setter up of Anarchy, that had not withall a touch of Tyranny? Supreme Power is still the Mark, let the Polititians never so oft play

booty, and shoot awry: And the Devil himself is not so Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in his Infernal Sway<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as your true Stanch Common wealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that has once got the Reins of Government into his hands. But after all this, if your Fate, according to the common Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of things, should be Retrograde, and you have onely been dreaming of Royalty all this while, take my Advice and rest in your own Station, for you cannot move in a better Sphere than now you are fixt in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> broach some Vessel of new Contriv'd Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, Tap on, Tap on still, you know well enough what will take with the People. And if at any time a Scruple of Conscience afflict or trouble you, look on it onely as a fit of the Gout that pinches and girds for a Moment, but is presently gone, publish your own Vindication with your own hand, and let your own mother Wit dictate to it, trust no Poet with your Cause, unless you pay him well, for to my knowledge it cannot justifie it self. And therefore he that undertakes it deserves a better reward than the single Guiny which you gave one of your Creatures that presented you with <hi>The Character of a Po—sh Succ—sor,</hi> and whom I have heard since rail at you inveterately, <hi>facit Indignatio Versus—</hi> therefore take heed you fall not under the Lash of his Satyr, which if you should, Lord have mercy upon you; for, Sir, I am of Opinion though you are a very <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> at Subtilty and Politicks—yet you are but a poor Devil at Poetry.</p>
            <p>Above all things, Sir, be sure to keep your Wit in repair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> get your Head hoop't round as <hi>Boroski's</hi> is, that your Brains may keep in a constant Motion, and not grow Addle by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly whirling of the Windmills in it, for we begin to suspect by the Shallowness of some late Projects of yours, that in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility you are declining, which if should happen fatal to ye, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! what a Consternation would be upon the People, and what weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth among the blessed Party! however for my part I should never fail to record your memorable Actions, but be always ready, as I am now and ever will be in all humility, to blazon your Greatness's never dying fame, which will doubtless fill a great part of History in our succeeding Ages.</p>
