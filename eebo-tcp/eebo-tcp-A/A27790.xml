            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is Naturall for all men when they are ſtraitned with feares, or actuall infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, to run for ſuccour, to what their fancy or the next opportunity preſents, as an inſtrument of their eaſe and remedy. But that which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes men in theſe caſes, is the choyce of their Sanctuary: for to rely upon the Reeds of Egypt, or to ſnatch at the Bulruſhes of <hi>Nilus,</hi> may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a drowning man, whoſe reaſon is ſo wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded and ſurprized by feare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to be uſeleſſe to him in that confuſion: But he whoſe condition (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſad) is ſtill under the Mastery of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and hath time to deliberate, unleſſe he places his hopes upon ſomething that is likely to cure his miſery, or at least to eaſe it, by making his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leſſe, or his patience more, does deſerve that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb facs="tcp:105331:5"/>
he groanes under: ſtripes and remedileſſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are the lot of Fooles, but afflictions that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to wiſe men or good men, repreſent indeed the ſadneſſes of mortality, but they become Monuments and advantages of their Piety and Wiſdome.</p>
            <p>In this moſt unnaturall Warre commenced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the greateſt ſolennities of Chriſtianity, and all that is called, God, I have been put to it to run ſomewhether to Sanctuary; but whether, was ſo great a queſtion, that had not Religion been my guide, I had not known where to have found reſt or ſafety, when the King and the Lawes, who by God and Man respectively are appointed the protectors of Innocence and truth, had themſelves the greateſt need of a Protector. And when in the beginning of theſe troubles I haſtened to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> the caſe of the King and His good Subjects, was ſomething like that of <hi>I ſaack,</hi> ready to be ſacrificed, the wood was prepared, the fire kindled, the knife was lift up, and the hand was ſtriking, that if we had not been ſomething like <hi>Abraham</hi> too, and againſt hope have believed in hope, we had been as much without comfort, as we were in outward appearance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy.</p>
            <p>It was my custome long ſince to ſecure my ſelfe againſt the violences of Diſcontents abroad, as <hi>Gerſon</hi> did againſt temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <hi>in angulis &amp; libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> in my bookes and my retirements: But now I
<pb facs="tcp:105331:5"/>
was deprived of both them, and driven to a publike view and participation of thoſe dangers and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which threatned the Kingdom, and diſturb'd the evenneſſe of my former life. I was therefore conſtrained to amaſſe together all thoſe arguments of hope and comfort, by which Men in the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were ſupported; &amp; amongſt all the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of trouble and confidence, I reckon'd King <hi>David</hi> one of the biggeſt, and of greateſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For conſidering that he was a King, vexed with a <hi>Civill-Warre,</hi> his caſe had ſo much of ours in it, that it was likely the devotions he uſed might fit our turne, and his comforts ſuſtaine us. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when I came to look upon the Pſalter with a neerer obſervation, and an eye diligent to espy my advantages and remedies there depoſited, I found very many Prayers againſt the enemies of the King and Church, and the miſeries of Warre. I found ſo many admirable promiſes, ſo rare variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the mercies of God, ſo many conſolatory hymnes, the commemoration of ſo many deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from dangers, and deaths, and Enemies, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miracles of mercy and ſalvation, that I began to be ſo confident as to believe there could come no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction great enough, to spend ſo great a ſtock of comfort as was laid up in the treaſure of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the ſaying of <hi>S. Paul</hi> was here verified, if ſinne [and miſery] did abound, then did grace ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
<pb facs="tcp:105331:6"/>
and as we believe of the Paſſion of Chriſt, it was ſo great as to be able to ſatisfy for a thouſand Worlds; ſo it is of the comforts of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, they are more then ſufficient to repaire all the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Mankind. But for the particular occaſion of creating confidences in us that God will defend his Church, and his Annoynted, and all that truſt in him, againſt all their Enemies, (which was our caſe, and contained in it all our needs for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) I found ſo abundant ſupply, that of 150. Pſalmes, ſome whereof are Hiſtoricall, many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſticall, many Propheticall, and the reſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for ſeverall occaſions. 34 of them are expreſly made againſt Gods and our Enemies; Eleven ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly for the Church, foure for the King; that is, a third part of the Pſalmes relate particularly to the preſent occaſion, beſides many clauſes of reſperſion in the other which if collected into one, would of themſelves be great arguments of hope to prevaile in ſo good a cauſe.</p>
            <p>This which experience taught me now, I was promiſed before by a frequent teſtimony of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church, who give the Pſalter ſuch a Character as is due to the best and most uſefull book in the whole World. <hi>viz.</hi> The moſt profitable of books: the treaſure of Holy inſtructions, <hi>conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationem totius paginae Theologicae,</hi> the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the whole Scripture; ſo the ordinary <hi>Gloſſe</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105331:6"/>
calls it; <hi>arma juvenum, parva Biblia, tribulatorum ſolatia,</hi> the young mans armory, the little Bible, the comfort of the diſtreſſed, ſo others; to be ſaid by all men upon all occaſions, is the counſell of the moſt devout amongſt them. But concerning the Pſalter there are good words enough, and reall obſervation of advantages in the ſeverall prefaces before the Commentaries upon the Pſalmes, ſet forth by the Fathers and Writers of the firſt and middle ages. I leave the particular enumeration of them, to the Learned Divines of our Church, to whom it is more proper; the ſumme of them is this which <hi>Tertullian</hi> alone hath expreſſed in his Apology againſt the <hi>Gentiles, Omnes Bibliothecas, &amp; omnia monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta unius Prophetae ſerinium vincit, in quo, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur theſaurus collocatus eſle to totius Iudaici Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenti. &amp; inde etiam noſtri,</hi> this book alone of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> hath in it ſome excellencies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the monuments of Learning in any Library whatſoever, and is the ſtore houſe both of the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. But that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes me moſt is the fancy of S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> expounding the Pſalter to be meant by the Key of <hi>David,</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his <hi>Revelation:</hi> And properly enough; for if we conſider how many myſteries of Religion are open'd to us in the Pſalter, how many things concerning Chriſt, what cleare vaticinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning his Birth, his Prieſthood, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb facs="tcp:105331:7"/>
his Death the very circumſtances of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Reſurrection, and all the degrees of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation more cleerly and explicitely recorded in the Pſalter, then in all the old Prophets beſides, we may eaſily believe that Chriſt with a <hi>Key of David</hi> in his hand, is nothing elſe but Chriſt fully open'd and manifeſted to us in the Pſalmes in the whole myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Redemption. <hi>Omnes penè pſalmi Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti perſonam ſuſtinent,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Almoſt all the Pſalmes repreſent the perſon of Chriſt. Now this <hi>Key of David,</hi> opens not only the Kingdom of Grace, by Revelation of the myſteries of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the Kingdom of Heaven too, it being ſuch a Collection of Prayers, Euchariſt, acts of hope, of love, of patience, and all other Christian virtues, that as the everlaſting Kingdome is given to the Heire of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> ſo the Honour of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening that Kingdom is given to the first Prince of that family; the Pſalmes of his Father <hi>David</hi> are one of the beſt inlets into the Kingdom of the ſonne. Something to this purpoſe is that ſaying of one of the old Doctors, <hi>vox pſalmodiae ſi recto corde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigatur, in tantum omnipotenti Deo aditum ad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimum aperit, ut intentae animae vel Prophetiae myſteria, vel compunctionis ſpiritum infundat.</hi> The ſaying or ſinging of Pſalmes opens a way ſo wide for God to enter into the heart, that a devout ſoule does uſually from ſuch an imployment receive
<pb facs="tcp:105331:7"/>
the grace of compunction and contrition, or of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Prophecies.</p>
            <p>Vpon ſuch premiſes as theſe, or better, the Church of God in all ages hath made <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalter the greateſt part of her publike and private devotions; ſometimes dividing the Pſalter into ſeven parts, that every weeks devotion might spend it all.</p>
            <p>Sometimes decreeing that it ſhould be ſaid day and night. Otherwhile injoyned the recitation of the whole Pſalter before the celebration of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament; and after ſome time it was made the publique office of the Church.</p>
            <p>It was the generall uſe of Chriſtendome, to ſay the Pſalmes <hi>Antiphonatim,</hi> by way of verſe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſaith <hi>Suidas;</hi> and ſo Ancient, that the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of S. <hi>Marke</hi> in <hi>Alexandria</hi> uſed it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith <hi>Philo</hi> the lew; and S. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or elſe <hi>Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> brought it firſt into the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi> And for the private Devotions, that they chiefly conſiſted of the Pſalmes we have great probability from the ſtrict requiring it of the Clergy, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly from them who came to be ordayned, great readineſſe of ſaying the <hi>Pſalter</hi> by heart. It was S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> counſell to <hi>Ruſticus,</hi> and when S. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was to ordaine the Biſhop of <hi>Ancona,</hi> his inquiry concerning his Canonicall ſufficiency was, if he could ſay <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes without book; and for a diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of doing it, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Prieſt was rejected from
<pb facs="tcp:105331:8"/>
the Biſhopricke of <hi>Ravenna.</hi> But this I conceive more relates to their private, then to their publike devotions, for I cannot thinke but that in reſpect of the publike Liturgy, it was enough for Biſhops and Priests to read the Pſalmes; the requiring abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity remember them was to ingage them to a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of ſo admirable devotions in their private offices.</p>
            <p>But the Pſalmes were not only of uſe to the Church, as they lay in their owne poſition and forme, but the devout men of ſeverall ages drew them into Collects, Antiphonaries, Responſories, and all other parts of their devotions. They made their Prayers out of the Pſalmes, their confeſſions, their doxologies, their ejaculations for the most part were clauſes or peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of the Pſalter. <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hierome</hi> made a collection of choice verſicles, and put them together into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall claſſes, and that was much of his devotion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Collection is ſtill extant under the Name of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's Pſalter. S<hi rend="sup">•</hi>^ Athanaſius</hi> made an Index of the ſeverall occaſions and matters of prayer and Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and fitted Pſalmes to each particular, that was his devotion, the Pſalmes intire as they lay, only he made titles of his owne. I have ſeen of latter time a ſhort hymne of ſome eight verſes, which are indeed very choice ſentences out of ſeverall Pſalmes ſet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to make up a compendium of Liturgy or Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary of our neceſſities and devotions, collected by <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:105331:8"/>
Bernardine,</hi> it is a very good Copy to be followed. But if we look into the old Liturgies of the Eaſtern and Western Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and where we will almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the private devotions of the old writers, we may ſay of them in the expreſſion of the Prophet, <hi>Hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeant aquas è fontibus Salvatoris,</hi> they drew their waters from the fountaines of our Bleſſed Saviour, but through the limbecks of <hi>David.</hi>

            <p>But the practice of this devotion I derived from a higher precedent, even of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: for before the paſſion immediatly, they ſung a Pſalm, ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Hymno dicto,</hi> ſaith the vulgar Latine, having recited or ſaid a Pſalme. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it was part of Davids Pſalter that was ſung, it was the great Allelujah, as the Jewes called it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the 113 pſalme, to the 119 excluſively, part of that was ſung. But this devotion continued with our Bleſſed Saviour as long as breath was in him, for when he was upon the Croſſe he recited the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalme <hi>ad verbum,</hi> ſaith the tradition of the Church, and that he began it, ſaith the Scripture, My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me? The whole pſalme is rather a hiſtory <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then a prediction of the paſſion; and what <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of the whole Pſalter is particularly verified of this, <hi>filium ad Patrem, id eſt, Chriſtum ad Deum verba facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem repreſentat,</hi> it repreſents the Sonnes addreſſe to his Father, that is, Chriſt ſpeaking to God, Againſt
<pb facs="tcp:105331:9"/>
the example of Chriſt if we confront the practice of Antichriſt, nothing can be ſaid greater in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this manner of devotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for <hi>B. Hippolytus,</hi> in his oration of the end of the world, ſaith, that in the dayes of Antichriſt, <hi>Pſalmorum decantatio ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabit,</hi> they ſhall then no more uſe the ſinging or ſaying of the Pſalmes; which when I had obſerved. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further deliberation I fix'd, upon the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the beſt weapon againſt him, whoſe comming we have great reaſon to believe is not farre off, ſo great preparation is making for him.</p>
            <p>From the example of Chriſt this grew to be a Practice Apoſtolicall, and their devotion came ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly home to the likeneſſe of the deſigne of this very Booke: they turn'd the Pſalmes into prayers.</p>
            <p>Thus it was ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas. Act. 16. They prayed a Pſalme,</hi> ſo it is in the Greeke; and we have a Copy left us of one of the prayers or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects which they made out of the bowells of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond pſalme, it is in the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> beginning at the 24 verſe, and ends at the 31. And now I have ſhowne the reaſons of my choice, and the precedents that I haue followed. This laſt coms home to every circumſtance of my Book. I only adde this, that ſince according to the inſtruction of our bleſſed Saviour, God is to be worſhipped in Spirit and in truth, no worſhipping can be more true, or more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall then the Pſalter ſaid with a pure mind and a
<pb facs="tcp:105331:9"/>
hearty devotion. For <hi>David</hi> was Gods inſtrument to the Church, teaching and admoniſhing us (as our duty is to each other) in Pſalmes and Hymnes, and spirituall Songs, and the spirit of truth was the Grand Dictator of what <hi>David</hi> wrote; ſo that we may confidently uſe this devotion as the Church of God ever did, making her addreſſes to God moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by the Pſalmes: ſo <hi>Prudentius</hi> reports the guiſe of Chriſtendome.</p>

            <p>The Prayers which I have collected out of the Pſalmes are nothing elſe, but the matter of the Pſalmes put into another mood, and fitted to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of Chriſtendome, and of our ſelves in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, according to the firſt deſignation or ſecondary intention of the bleſſed Spirit: for the uſe of them could not expire in the perſon of <hi>David,</hi> though firſt occaſioned (many of them) by his perſonall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for all Scripture was written for our learning upon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ends of the world are come, (ſaith the Apoſtle) &amp; Chriſt, &amp; his Apoſtles, and the Church of all ages, hath taught us by their example and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, that the purpoſes of the holy Ghoſt were of great extent, and the profits univerſall both for times and occaſions: ſo alſo were the prayers which
<pb facs="tcp:105331:10"/>
the Church made out of the Pſalmes and ſung them in her publike offices. <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> found great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages by ſuch devotions, as himſelfe witneſſes; <hi>Cùm reminiſcor lacrymas meas quas Fud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And yet beſides the ſpirituall ſenſe of an actuall devotion, which is ſooner had in this uſe of the Pſalmes then of other prayers, I have had a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that this manner of devotion might be a good Symbol and inſtrument of Communion betweene Chriſtians of a different perſwaſion: For if we all would communicate in the ſame private devotions, it were a great degree of Peace and Charity. The Nicene Fathers in their zeale againſt Hereſie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad their People to be preſent at the prayers of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes; and they had great reaſon ſo long as they derived their Hereſie into their Liturgy, into their very formes of baptiſme: But I am much ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, when I ſee a man refuſe to communicate with me in my prayers even ſuch as are in his owne brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary or Manuall. For me thinkes it is ſtrange that the Lords Prayer it ſelfe ſhould be unhallowed in the mouth of a Proteſtant, and yet the whole office from the mouth of one of their Prieſts, though never ſo
<pb facs="tcp:105331:10"/>
wicked, though a Necromaneer, a ſecret Jew, or any thing, ſo of their Communion, ſhall looſe no tittle of its ſanctity and value. So long as nothing of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is brought into our prayers (and certainly we may very well pray to God without disputing) and devotion is not made a party, he that refuſes to joyne with me in what himſelfe confeſſes true and holy upon pretence I am a hereticke, will certainly prove himſelfe a Schiſmaticke. For true it is, a Heretick is to be avoyded, that is in his temptation and in his hereſie, juſt as a notorious Fornicator, an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, a ſentenc'd drunkard, and no more, the Apoſtles rule excommunicates all alike, with ſuch men no not to eate, and this rule cannot with ſo much eaſe and certainty be put to practiſe in the caſe of hereſie, as in the caſe of drunkenneſſe, becauſe hereſie is as much harder to be judg'd, as the ſoule is more inviſible then the body, eſpecially if we make hereſie to be an error, not in the great articles of faith only, but to conſiſt in minutes alſo, as all they doe who refuſe to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with Perſons diſagreeing even in the ſmalleſt article.</p>
            <p>But he that is ready to joyne with all the ſocieties of Chriſtians in the world, in thoſe things which are certainly true, juſt and pious, gives great probation that he hath at leaſt, <hi>animum Catholicum,</hi> no Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall ſoule, becauſe he would actually communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with all Christendome, if <hi>bona ſides in falſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulo,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105331:11"/>
a ſincere per ſwaſion (be it true or falſe) did not diſoblige him, ſince he clearly distinguiſhes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from things, and in all good things communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with perſons bad enough in others. This is the Communion of charity, and when the Communion of beleefe is interrupted by misperſwaſion on one ſide, and too much confidence and want of charity on the other, the erring party hath humane infirmity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, but the uncharitable nothing at all. This therefore is the beſt and ſureſt way, becauſe we are all apt to be deceived, to be ſincere in our diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, modeſt in our determinations, charitable in our cenſures, and apt to communicate in things of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truth and confeſſed holineſſe. And ſuch is this devotion; the whole matter whereof is the Pſalmes of <hi>David,</hi> and the prayers Symbolicall, and alike in ſubſtance, and of the ſame expreſſion throughout where it is not altered by circumſtances.</p>
            <p>So that I thought I might not imprudently intend this Booke as an inſtrument of publike charity to Chriſtians of different confeſſions. For I ſee that all ſorts of people ſing or ſay <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, and by that uſe, if they underſtand the conſequences of their owne Religion, accept ſet formes of prayer for their Liturgy, and this forme in speciall is one of their owne choices for devotion; ſo that if all Chriſtians, that thinke <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes lawfull devotion, and ſhall obſerve the Collects from them to be juſt of the
<pb facs="tcp:105331:11"/>
ſame Religion, would joyn in this or the like form, I am ſomething confident the product would be ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, beſides other spirituall advantages. For my owne particular ſince all Chriſtendome is ſo much divided, and ſubdivided into innumerable Sects, I knew not how to give a better evidence of my owne beliefe, and love of the Communion of Saints, and deteſtation of Schiſme, then by an act of Religion, whoſe conſequence might be (if men pleaſe) the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of an vniverſall Communion. For in that which is moſt concerning and is the beſt preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of charity, I meane practicall devotion and active piety, the differences of Christendome are not ſo great and many, to make an eternall diſunion and fracture; and if we inſtance in prayer, there is none at all abroad (ſome indeed we have commens'd at home, but) in the great diviſions of Chriſtendome, none at all but concerning the object of our prayers and adorations. For the Socinian ſhuts the Holy Ghoſt from his Letanies, and places the Sonne of God in a lower forme of addreſſe. But concerning him I muſt ſay, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaid of the Unbeleevers, <hi>what have I to doe with them that are without?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this very thing that they disbelieve the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the holy Trinity, they make themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the communion of other Chriſtian people of the Nicene Faith, and we cannot ſo much at joyne with them in good prayers, becauſe we are not
<pb facs="tcp:105331:12"/>
agreed concerning the perſons to whom our devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt be addreſſed; and Chriſtendome never did ſo lightly eſteem the article of the holy Trinitie, as not to glorie in it, and confeſſe it publiquely, and expreſſe it in all our offices. The holy Ghost toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Father and the Son muſt be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and glorified.</p>
            <p>But ſince all Chriſtians of any publike confeſſion and government, that is, all particular and nationall Churches agree in the matter of prayers, and the great object, God in the myſterie of the Trinitie, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would make her addreſſes to God onely, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and leave the Saints in the Calendar, without drawing them into her offices (which they might do without any preiudice to the ſuits they aske, unleſſe Chriſts interceſſion without their coniuncture were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.) that we might all once pray together, we might hope for the bleſſings of peace and charitie to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us all. I am ſure they that have commenced this war againſt the King and the Church, firſt fell out with our Liturgie and refuſed to ioyne with us in our prayers: I have therefore a ſtrong perſwaſion, that if we were ioyned in our prayers, we ſhould quickly be united in affections: and to this purpoſe I have ſome reaſon to believe this Pſalter may do good ſervice.</p>
            <p>For I have ſeen an Eſſay of this deſigne made by
<pb facs="tcp:105331:12"/>
that prudent and pious moderator of controverſies, <hi>George Caſsander,</hi> who did much for the peace of Christendom, when diſagreeing intereſts and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made the great Schiſme in the Weſterne Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he put forth devotions, and with them Collects for each Pſalme. But I ſaid, it was a meere Eſſay, they are ſhort of what he could have done: but when I ſaw his name at them, I gueſſed what every man elſe would have gueſſed concerning him, it was a purſuance of his great deſigne for peace and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. I have ſeen three more, the firſt by an old Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon Prieſt or Biſhop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which there is nothing of offence, nothing but pious and primitive for the matter, but the Collects ſo ſhort, that the Pſalme did ſcarce paſſe through the Prayer, ſo little of the reliſh is left, that the percolation is ſcarce diſcerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A ſecond was printed at <hi>Lyons, 1545.</hi> without the Authours name, with a complying deſigne of avoiding all offence, and a not engaging God in our ſcholaſticall wranglings, but quite contrary to the Saxon; the prayers are ſo full of paraphraſe, that I reſolved to go further, and ſee if I could ſpeed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and at laſt met with a Pſalter printed lately at <hi>Antwerp</hi> by command, very fairly indeed, with a Title and a Collect to every Pſalme, all free from dispute, and partaking in the queſtions of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, not ſo much as a guſt or reliſh of his owne partie till the Pſalter be done, the prayers all good,
<pb facs="tcp:105331:13"/>
and here I had fixed, but that I had found them very often to be impertinent. But that which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all theſe is, that the deſigne ſeemes alike, and they are a forme of devotion made for no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Sect, but for the benefit of all Chriſtian people, which the Authour of the <hi>Antwerp</hi> Pſalter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines in his additionall Devotions, where he brings in Letanies to Saints as groſſely as he had before avoided it with diſcretion.</p>
            <p>If any mans pietie receives advantage by this intendment, it is what I wiſh; but I deſire that his charitie might increaſe too, and that he would ſay a hearty prayer, when his devotion growes high and pregnant, for me and my family; for I am more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous my poſteritie ſhould be pious than honourable. I have no ends of my own to ſerve, but to purchaſe an intereſt of prayers; for I would fain have theſe Devotions go out into a bleſſing to all them that ſhall uſe them, and yet returne into my own boſome too: and if I may but receive the bleſſings of the Pſalter, <hi>even the ſure mercies of David,</hi> it will be like the reward of five Cities for the improvement of a few talents; I ſhall venture again in a greater negotiation, and traffique for ten talents; for there is no honour ſo great as to ſerve God in a great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie; and though I wait not at the Altar, yet I will pay there ſuch oblations of my time and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, as I can redeem from the ſervices of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and the impertinencies of my own life.</p>
