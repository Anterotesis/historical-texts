            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Marvail not that both your self, and others do think my long Imprisonment strange (or rather strangely of me for the sake of that) for verily I should also have done it my self, had not the Holy Ghost long since forbidden me. <hi>1 Pet. 4, 12. 1 Joh. 3.13.</hi> Nay verily that notwithstanding, ad the adversary but fastened the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of guilt upon me; my long tryalls might by this time have put it beyond dispute: for I have not hitherto been so sordid, as to stand to a Doctrine right or
<pb facs="tcp:104299:3"/>
wrong; much less when so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty an argument, as above eleven years imprisonment, is continually dogging of me to weigh and pause, and pause again, the grounds and foundation of those principles, for which I thus have suffered: but having not only at my tryall asserted them, but also since, even all this tedious tract of time, in cool blood, a thousand times by the word of God examined them, and found them good; I cannot, I dare not now revolt or deny the same, on pain of eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>And that my principles, and practice may be open to the view and judgment of all men (though they stand, and fall to none but the word of God alone) I have in this small treatise presented to this
<pb facs="tcp:104299:3"/>
generation, <hi>A Confession of my Faith, and a Reason of my Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in the Worship of God</hi>; by which although it be brief; Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Christians, may I hope, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a violation to faith or love, judge, I may have the root of the matter found in me.</p>
            <p>Neither have I in this relation abusively presented my Reader, with other doctrine or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then what I held, professed, and preached when apprehended, and cast in Prison. Nor did I then, or now retain a Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, or which is not thereon groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The Subject I should have Preached upon, even then when the Constable came, was, <hi>Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</hi> from whence I intended to shew, the absolute need of Faith in Jesus
<pb facs="tcp:104299:4"/>
Christ; and that it was also a thing of the highest concern, for men to inquire into, and to ask their own hearts whether they had it or no.</p>
            <p>Faith, and Holiness, are my professed principles, with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, so far as in me lyeth, to be at peace with all men. What shall I say, let mine enemies themselves be judges, if any thing in these following doctrines, or if ought that any Man hath heard me preach, doth, or hath accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true intent of my words, savoured either of heresie of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I say again, let they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be judges, if ought they find in my writing or preaching, doth render me worthy of almost twelve years imprisonment, or one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth to be hanged, or banished
<pb facs="tcp:104299:4"/>
for ever, according to their tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Sentence. Indeed my principles are such, as lead me to a denial to communicate in the the things of the Kingdom of Christ, with ungodly and open prophane; neither can I in, or by the superstitious inventions of this World, consent that my Soul should be governed, in any of my approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to God, because commanded to the contrary, and commended for so refusing. Wherefore except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this one thing, for which I ought not to be rebuked; I shall I trust in despite of slander and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, discover my self at all times a peaceable, and an obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But if nothing will do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I make of my conscience a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual butchery, and slaughter-shop, unless putting out my own eyes I
<pb facs="tcp:104299:5"/>
commit me to the blind to lead me, (as I doubt is desired by some) I have determined the Almighty God being my help, and shield, yet to suffer, if frail life might continue so long, even till the moss shall grow on mine eye-browes rather then thus to violate my faith and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Will a man leave the Snow of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> that cometh from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters, that come from another place be forsaken? <hi>Jer. 18.14. Hath a Nation chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Gods which yet are no Gods? For all People will walk every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.</hi> Micah <hi>4.5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching my Practice as to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with visible Saints, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="tcp:104299:5"/>
not Baptized with Water; I say, it is my present Judgement so to do, and am willing to render a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason thereof; shall I see the leading hand of God thereto.</p>

Forasmuch as ye know, that ye were not redeemed, with corruptible things, as silver and Gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your Fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish; and without spot.</hi> Psa. 78.35. 1 Pet. 1.18, 19.</p>
            <p n="12">12. I believe, that the great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the Lord, the second person in the God-head, did cloth himself with our flesh and blood, was that he might be capable of obtaining the redemption, that before the world, was intended for us. <hi>Forasmuch then as the children were made partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise took part of the same; (mark)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104299:9"/>
that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the Divel, and deliver them who through fear of death, were all their life time subject to bondage. When the fulness of the time was Come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law to redeem them that were under the Law. Wherefore it behooved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren; that he might be a mercifull, and faithfull high priest in things pertaining to God; To make reconciliation for the sins of the people.

onely in God by Christ: 1, Sin being the transgression of the Law; 2.

For he saith in Moses, I will have mercy, on whom I will have mercy, and</hi> I <hi>will have compassion, on whom I will have compassion.

To declare his righteousness for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God; to declare I say, at this time his righteousness; that he might be just, and the justifyer of him that believeth on Jesus. Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins; And by him all that believe are justifyed from all things, from which they could not

I believe, that this faith, as it respecteth the imputation of this righteousness, for justification before God; doth put forth it self in such acts, <hi>as purely respect the offer of a gift.</hi> It receiveth, accepteth of, imbraceth, or trusteth to it. <hi>As many as receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to them he gave power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. This is a faithfull saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief, In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the Gospell of your salvation: In whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with the holy spirit of promise.</hi> I believe therefore, that as to my justication from the curse of the Law, I am, as I stand in my self, ungodly, to receive accept of, imbrace, and trust to the

righteousness, that is already provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by, and wrapt up in the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal doings and sufferings of Christ: it being faith in that, and that onely, that can justify a sinner in the sight of God. Joh. 1.12. 1 Tim. 1.15. Heb. 11.13. Eph. 1.13.</p>

And hence it is called the faith that is wrought by the <hi>exceeding great and mighty power of God</hi>: The faith <hi>of the operation of God.</hi> And hence it is that others are said to be <hi>fearfull,</hi> and so unbelieving.

               <head>Of Calling.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I believe, that to effectual Calling the holy Ghost must accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the word of the Gospel, and that with mighty power: I mean that calling, which of God is made to be the fruit of electing love. <hi>I know</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Thessalonians, <hi>brethren, beloved your election of God: for our Gospell came not unto you in word onely; but also in power, and in the holy Ghost, and in much assurance,</hi> &amp;c, 1 Thes. 1.4.8. Otherwise men will not, cannot, hear and turn. <hi>Samuell</hi> was called <hi>four</hi> times, before he knew the voice of him that spake from heaven. It is said of them in <hi>Hosea,</hi> That as the Prophets called them so they went from them; And instead of turning to them, <hi>sacrificed to Balaam, and burnt incense to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Images.</hi> 1 Sam 4.6.10. Hos.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104299:22"/>
11.2. The reason is, because men by nature, are not only dead in sins, <hi>but enemys in their minds by reason of wicked works</hi>: The call then is; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</hi> Eph. 5.14. Understand; therefore that effectual calling is like that word of Christ that raised <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> from the dead: A word atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with an arm, that was omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. <hi>Lazarus come forth</hi>: was a word to the dead; but not onely so: It was a word for the dead; a word that raised him from the dead; a word that outwent all opposition; and that brought him forth of the grave, though bound hand and foot therein. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.43. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 1, 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. And hence it is that calling, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expressed by quickening, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening, illuminating, or bringing them forth of darkness to light that amazeth, and astonisheth them. For
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104299:22"/>
as it is a strange thing for a man that lay long dead, or never saw the light with his eyes, to be raised out of the grave, or to be made to see that which he could not so much as once think of before, so it is with effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al calling 1 Pet. 2.9. Hence it is that <hi>Paul,</hi> when called, stood <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and was astonished:</hi> and that <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>he hath called us out of darkness into his marvellous light</hi> Eph. 4.21. Act. 7.2. In effectual calling the voyce of God is heard, and the gates of heaven are opened: when God called <hi>Abraham,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in glory. Oh that of <hi>Ananius</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> is experienced but by few. <hi>The God of our Fathers hath chosen thee,</hi> saith he, <hi>that thou shouldest know his will, and see that just one, and shouldest hear the voyce of his mouth.</hi> Act. 22.14. True; <hi>Sauls</hi> call was out of the ordinary way, but yet as to the matter, and truth of the work, twas no other
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104299:23"/>
then all the chosen have, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. An effectual awakening about the evil of sin, and especially of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.9. And therefore when the Lord God called <hi>Adam,</hi> he also made unto him, an effectual discovery of sin; insomuch that he stript him of all his righteousness. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Thus he also served the Gealer. Yea it is such an awakening, as by it, he sees he was without Christ, without hope, and a stranger to the common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the word. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.29, 30. <hi>Eph,</hi> 2.12. Oh the dread and amazement that the guilt of sin brings with it, when tis revealed by the God of heaven: and like to it is the sight of mercy, when it pleaseth God, <hi>who calleth us by his grace, to reveal his son in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In effectual calling, there is great awakenings about the world to some, and the glory of unseen things; The resurrection of the dead; and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104299:23"/>
eternal judgement; The salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God hath prepared for them that love him; with the blessedness that will attend us, and be upon us, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, are great things in the soul that is under the awakening calls of God. And hence we are said to be <hi>called to Glory, to the obtaining of the Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 1 Thes, 2.12. 2 Thes. 2.13 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In effectual calling, there is also a sanctifying vertue; And hence we are said to be called with an holy call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with an heavenly calling: Called to glory and vertue. <hi>But ye are a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Generation, a royall priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that you should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.</hi> Heb. 3.1. 1 Thes. 4 7. 1 Pet. 1.8, 9. Yea effectual calling hath annexed to it, as its unseparable companion, the promise of through sanctification. <hi>Faithfull is he that hath
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104299:24"/>
called you, who also will do it.</hi> 1 Thes. 5 22 23, 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I believe, that effectual calling doth therefore produce, 1. <hi>Faith</hi>; and therefore it is said, that faith cometh by hearing; by hearing the word that calleth us unto the grace of Christ. For by the word that calleth us is Jesus Christ held forth to us; and offered to be our righteousness; and therefore the Apostle saith again, <hi>that God hath called us unto the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of his son Jesus Christ</hi>; that is to be made partakers of the riches of grace, and the righteousness that is in him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It produceth hope; It giveth a ground to hope; and therefore hope is said to be the <hi>hope of our calling.</hi> And again, <hi>Even us you are called in one hope of your calling.</hi> Eph. 1.18, 19. chap. 4 4. Now the Godly wise know, whoso misseth of effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al calling, misseth of eternal life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104299:24"/>
God justifyeth none but them whom he calleth; and glorifyes none but those whom he justifyes: And therefore it is that <hi>Peter</hi> said before, <hi>Make your calling, and</hi> (so) <hi>your election sure</hi>: make it sure, that is prove your calling right, by the word of God. For whoso staggereth at the certainty of his calling, cannot comfortably hope for a share in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. <hi>Remember the word unto thy servant, whereon thou hast caused me to hope. My soul fainted for thy salvation, but I hope in thy word.</hi> Psa. 119.49.81.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It produceth repentance; For when a man hath heaven, and hell before his eyes, (as he will have if he be under the power of effectual calling) or when a man hath a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the mercy and justice of God, with an heart-drawing invitation, to lay hold on the tender forgiveness of sins; and being made also to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the goodly beauty of holiness;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104299:25"/>
it must needs be, that repentance appears, and puts forth it self, unto self-revenging acts, for all its wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness which in the dayes of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it delighted in. And hence is that saying, <hi>I came not to call the righteous but sinners to Repentance.</hi> For the effecting of which, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word of the Kingdom, is most proper: <hi>Repent for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is at hand.</hi> Mar. 2.17. chap. 1.10.</p>

Job. 42.5, 6. Ezek. 16. <hi>v.</hi> last.</p>

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:104299:25"/>
2. Godly repentance: doth not onely affect the soul with the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some nature of sin that is past; but filleth the heart with godly hatred of sins that yet may come; When <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> feared that through his being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verburthened, with the care of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> some unruly, or sinfull passions might shew themselves in him; what saith he? <hi>I beseech thee kill me out of hand, if I have found grace in thy sight, and let me not see my wretchedness.</hi> Num. 14.13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>See also, how that, that <hi>Paul</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth godly repentance, wrought in the upright <hi>Corinthians. Behold</hi> saith he, <hi>this self same thing that ye sorrowed after a Godly sort; what carefulness it wrought in you? what clearing of your selves? yea what fear? yea what vehement desire, yea what zeal, yea what revenge? In all things you have approved your selves to be clear in this matter.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.9, 10, 11.</p>

                  </note> they had no need that he should write unto them. 1 Thes. 4.17.19. As who should say, If God be so kind to us, to forgive us our sins, to save our souls, and to give us the kingdom of heaven; let these be motives beyond all other, to provoke us to love again. Farther; If we that are thus beloved of God, are made members of one mans body, all partakers of his grace; clothed all with his glorious righteousness; and are together appointed to be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the next world; why should we not love one another? <hi>Beloved, if God so loved us we ought also to love one another.</hi> 1 Joh 4.11. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so we shall, if the true grace of God be upon us; because we also see them to be the called of Jesus.

               <p>The name, therefore, and word, and truth of God in Christ, together with the sincerity of Grace; of faith, and holyness in us, are the delightfull objects of this love. <hi>Psa.</hi> 119.47, 127.159. <hi>Psa.</hi> 5 11, <hi>and</hi> 69.36. <hi>and</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>TOuching which word of God, I thus believe and confess. 1. That all the holy scriptures are the words of God. <hi>All scriptures is given by inspiration of God.

2 Pet. 1.19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I believe, the great end why God committed the Scriptures to writing was; that we might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed to Christ, taught how to believe, encouraged to patience, and hope, for the grace that is to be brought unto us, at the revelation of Jesus Christ; also, that we might understand what is sin, and how to avoid the commission thereof. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4 <hi>Concerning the works of men</hi> (said David) <hi>by the word of thy lips, I have kept me from the pathes of the destroyer.</hi> Through thy precepts I get understanding, <hi>therefore I hate every false way.</hi> I have hid thy word in my heart, that I might not sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee. <hi>Psa.</hi> 17.4. <hi>and</hi> 119.104. <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>

               <p>HAving thus made confession of my Faith, I now come to shew you my practise in Worship, with the reasons thereof. The which I shall have occasion to touch, under two distinct heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1, <hi>With whom I dare not hold communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>With whom I dare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only, first, Note, that by the word Communion I mean fellowship <hi>in the things of the Kingdom of Christ,</hi> or that which is commonly called Church communion, the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints. For in civil affairs and in things of this World that are honest, I am not altogether tyed up from the fornicators thereof; (<hi>Cor.</hi> 5 9, 10) Wherefore in my following discourse understand me in the first sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:104299:30"/>
Now, Then, <hi>I dare not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them that profess not faith and holiness</hi>; or that are not visible Saints by calling: but note that by this assertion, I meddle not with the elect; but as he is a visible Saint by calling; neither do I exclude the secret Hypocrite, <hi>if he be hid from me by visible Saint ship.</hi> Wherefore I dare not have communion with men from a single supposition, that they may be elect, neither dare I exclude the other from a single supposing that he may be a secret Hypocrite. I meddle not here with these things; I onely exclude him that is not a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Saint: Now he that is visibly or openly prophane, cannot be then a visible Saint,; for he that is a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Saint must profess faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and consequently holyness of life: And with none else dare I communicate.</p>
               <p>First, Because God himself hath so strictly put the difference, both by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104299:31"/>
word and deed; For from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, he did not only put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the children of the wicked, onely the instinct of grace and change of the mind as his own, but did cast out from his presence the father of all the ungodly, even cursed <hi>Cain</hi> when he shewed himself open prophane, and banished him to go into the Land of the Runnagate or Vagabond, where from Gods face, and so the priviledges of the communion of Saints he was ever after hid. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>chap.</hi> 4 9, 10.14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Besides, when after this, through the policy of Satan, the children of <hi>Cain,</hi> and the seed of <hi>Seth,</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix themselves in worship, and by that means had corrupted the way of God: what followed, but first, God judged it wickedness, raised up <hi>Noah</hi> to preach against it, and after that, because they would not be reclaimed, he brought the floud, upon the whole

world of these ungodly; and saved onely <hi>Noah</hi> alive because he had kept himself righteous. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.1, 2 <hi>v.</hi> 3.11, 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, 13.</p>
               <p>Here I could inlarge abundantly, and add many more instances of alike nature, but I am here onely for a truth upon things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because it is so often commanded in the Scriptures, That all the congregation should be holy. <hi>I am the Lord your God, ye shall therefore sanctifie your selves; and ye shall be holy for I am holy. Ye shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy. Sanctifie your selves therefore and be ye holy, for I am the Lord your God.</hi> Besides, 1. The Gates of the temple were to be shut against all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation, that keepeth the truth may enter in: This Gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thus saith the Lord, no stranger uncircumcised in heart, or uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104299:32"/>
in flesh shall enter into my sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of any stranger which is amongst the children of Israel.</hi> 2. Because, the things of worship are holy; <hi>Be ye holy that bear the vessels of the Lord.</hi> 3. Because all the limits, and bounds of communion are holy. <hi>This is the law of the house, upon the top of the mountain, the whole limit thereof shall be most holy: Behold this is the Law of the house.</hi> Lev. 11.44. chap. 19.2. chap. 20.7. 1 Pet. 1.15, 16. Esa. 26.2. Psa. 128.20. Eze. 43.12. chap. 44.9. Esa. 52.11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I dare not have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them; Because the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of new testament churches before us, have been a community of visible Saints. Paul to the Romanes, writes thus: <hi>To all that are at Rome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, called to be Saints,</hi> And to the rest of the Churches thus: <hi>Vnto the Church of God which is at Corinth; to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be Saints.</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:104299:32"/>
To the Saints that are at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and to the faithfull in Christ Jesus; To all the Saints that are at <hi>Philippi</hi> with the Bishops and Deacons. To the Saints and faithfull brethren which are at <hi>Colosse.</hi> To the Church of the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians,</hi> which is in God the Father; and in our Lord Jesus Christ; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus you see under what denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, those persons went of old, who were counted worthy to be members of a visible Church of Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Phil</hi> 1.1. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.1. Besides, the members of such Churches, go under such characters as these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The called of Christ Jesus.</hi> Rom. 1.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men that have drank into the spirit of Jesus Christ. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Persons in whom was God the Father. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They were all made partakers of the joy of the Gospell <hi>Phil.</hi> 1 7.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:104299:33"/>
5. Persons that were circumcised inwardly. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Persons that turned to God from Idols, to serve the living and true God. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Those that were the body of Christ, and members in particulars that is those that were visibly such; because they made profession of faith, of holyness, of repentance, of love to Christ, and of self denyal, at their receiving into fellowship.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I dare not hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the open prophane:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it is promised to the Church, that she shall dwell by her self; that is, as she is a Church, and spiritual; <hi>Lo the people shall dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.</hi> Num. 23, 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because this is their priviledge. <hi>But ye are a chosen generation, a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all priesthood, an holy nation, a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him, who hath called you out
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104299:33"/>
of darkness into his marvellous light.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.9, 10,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because this is the fruit of the death of Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem as from all iniquity; and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.14,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because this is the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Save your selves from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward generation.</hi> Act, 2, 40,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Because with such it is not possible we should have true and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual communion. <hi>Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: For what fellowship hath righteousness, with unrighteousness? And what commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidell? Or what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols? For ye are the temple of the living God, as God hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them, and</hi> I <hi>will be their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104299:34"/>
God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore, Come out from among them, and be ye separate saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and I will be a Father unto you saith the Lord Almighty.</hi> 2 Cor. 6, 14—18.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I dare not hold communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the open prophane.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because this would be plowing with on Ox, and an Ass together: heavenly things suit best for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in heavenly matters. <hi>Deut,</hi> 22.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It subjecteth not the nature of our discipline, which is not forced, but free, in a professed subjection to the will and commandment of Christ: others being excluded by God's own prohibition, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 12. <hi>chap.</hi> 9 7.13. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> also when he exhorteth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to follow after righteousness; Faith, Charity, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104299:34"/>
are the bowels of Church communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) he saith, <hi>do it with those that call on the name of the Lord, out of a pure heart.</hi> 2 Tim. 2, 22.</p>
               <p>Sithly, In a word, to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the open prophane, is most pernicious and destructive.</p>
               <p n="1">1, 'Twas the wicked multitude, that fell a lusting, and that tempted Christ in the desert, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2, It was the prophane, heathen, of whom Israel learned, to worship Idols. <hi>They were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works, and served their Idols, which were a snare to them.</hi> Psa. 106.25, 26, 27,</p>
               <p n="3">3, It is the mingled people that God hath threatned to plague with those deadly punishments of his, with which he hath threatned to punish <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> it self: saying; When a sword is upon her Glyars, her mighty, her chariots and treasures; a sword also shall be upon the mingled people that are in the middest of her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:104299:35"/>
And no marvail: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1, Mixed communion polluteth the ordinances of God. Say to the rebells saith the Lord God. <hi>Let it suffice you, of all your abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that you have brought into my san uary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh; to be in my sanctuary to pollute it; even my house, when ye offered my bread and the fat, and the blood: And they have broken my Covenant, because of all their abominations.</hi> Eze. 44.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It violateth the law; her priests have violated my Law, and prophaned my holy things.</hi> (how) <hi>they have put no difference, between the holy and prophane; neither have they shewed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the unclean, and the clean.</hi> Eze. 22.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3, It prophaneth the holyness of God: <hi>Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel, and Jerusalem: For Judah
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104299:35"/>
hath prophaned the holyness of th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Lord which he loved, and hath marri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed the daughter of a strange God.</hi> Mal. 2, 11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It defileth the truly Gracious; <hi>Know ye not that a little Leaven, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneth the whole lump: Look diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many be defiled.</hi> 1 Cor. 5, 6, Heb. 12, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Lastly, To conclude, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it provoketh God to punish with severe judgments: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heed well.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As I said before, The drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole world was occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the sons of God commixing themselves with the daughters of men; and the corruption of worship that followed thereupon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6, <hi>and</hi> 7 <hi>chapters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2, He sent a plague upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel, for joyning themselves unto the people of Moab; and for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104299:36"/>
following their abominations in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: And let no man think, that now I have altered the state of the question: for it is all one with the Church to Communicate with the prophane; and to sacrifice, and offer their gifts to the Divel: the reason is, because such have by their sin forsaken the protection of heaven, and are given up to their own heart-lusts; and left to be overcome of the wicked to whom they have joyned their selves. <hi>Num,</hi> 25, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Jos,</hi> 22, 17, <hi>Deut,</hi> 32, 16 19, <hi>Psa.</hi> 106, 30, 40, <hi>Deut,</hi> 12, <hi>Deut,</hi> 7, 1, 2 6, <hi>Neh,</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Joyn not your selves,</hi> saith God, to the wicked, neither in religion nor marriages; <hi>for they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other Gods; so will the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Lord be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddainly. Did not</hi> Solomon <hi>King of</hi> Israel <hi>sin by these things? ye. among many nations was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104299:36"/>
there no King like him who was belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his God,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hear how Paul handleth the point; <hi>This I say, saith he, That the things which the Gentiles</hi> or openly prophane <hi>sacrifice; they sacrifice to Devils, and not to God: And I would not that you should have fellowship with Divels. Ye cannot drink of the Cup of the Lord, and the cup of Divels: Ye cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, &amp; of the table of Divels, Do we provoke the Lord to jealousie? Are we stronger then he?</hi> 1 Cor. 10, 21, 22, 23. I conclude that therefore it is an evil, &amp; a danger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous thing to hold Church-communion with the open prophane, and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It polluteth his ordinances: It violateth his Law: It prophaneth his holyness: It defileth his people; and provoketh the Lord to severe, and terrible judgments.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In many ages indeed it hath been so; but marke, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not such, when first they were received unto Communion neither was they with Gods liking, as such to be retained among them, but in order to their admonition repentance and amendment of life: of which if they failed; God presently threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Church; and either cut them off from the Church, as he did the Idolaters, Fornicators, murmurers, Tempters, Sabbath-breakers; with <hi>Korah, Dathan, Achan</hi> and others: or else cut of them with the Church and all, as he served the ten tribes at one time, and the two tribes at another. <hi>My God shall cast them away, because they did not hearken to him, and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</hi> Exod, 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Neh 13.1, 2, 3, I might here greatly enlarge but I only intend brevity; yet let me tell you, that when <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> understood by the book of the Law of the Lord, that the <hi>Ammonite,</hi> and the <hi>Moabite</hi> should not come into the congregation of God; <hi>they separated from</hi> Israel <hi>all the mixed multitude.</hi> Many have pleaded for the prophane, that they should abide in the Church of God; but such have not considered, that Gods wrath at all times hath with great indignation hath been shewed against such offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and their conceits. Indeed they like not for to plead for them under that notion, but rather as <hi>Korah,</hi> and his company. <hi>All the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is holy every one of them</hi> Num. 16 3. But it maketh no matter by what name they are called; if by their deeds they shew themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly wicked: for names, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104299:38"/>
sanctify not the heart, and nature: they make not vertues of vice, neither can it save such advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, <hi>from the heavy curse both of God and Men. The righteous men they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses; and after the manner of women that shed-blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</hi> Pro. 17.15. chap. 24 24. Eze. 23.45.</p>
               <p>Thus have I shewed you with whom I dare not have communion: And now to shew you with whom I dare. But in order thereto, I desire you first to take notice; That touching shaddowish, or figurative ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; I believe that Christ hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained but two in his Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Water baptism and the Supper of the Lord: both which are of excellent use to the Church, in this world; they being to us representations of the death, and resurrection of Christ, and are as, God shall make them
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104299:38"/>
helps to our faith therein; But I count them not the fundamentals of our Christianity; nor grounds or rule to communion with Saints: servants they are, and our mystical Ministers, to teach and instruct us, in the most weighty matters of the Kingdom of God: I therefore here declare my reverent esteem of them; yet dare not remove them, as some do, from the place, and end, where by God they are set and appointed; nor ascribe unto them more, then they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to have in their first, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive institution: Tis possible to commit Idolatry, even with Gods own appointments: But I pass this, and come to the thing propounded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, then, <hi>I dare have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; Church communion with those that are visible Saints by calling</hi>; with those that by the word of the Gospell, have been brought over to faith and holyness And it maketh no matter to me, what their life was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104299:39"/>
heretofore, <hi>if they now be washed, if they be sanctified. if they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11. Now in order to the discovery of this faith and holyness, and so to fellowship in Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: I hold it requisite that a faithful relation be made thereof by the party thus to be received; yea if need be by witnesses also, <hi>for the satisfaction of the church, that she may receive in faith and judgment,</hi> such as best shall suit her holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. Acts 9.26, 27, 28. 1 Cor. 16.10. 2 Cor. 8.23. Observe it; these Texts do respect extraordinary officers; and yet see, that in order to their reception by the Church, there was made to them a faithfull relation, of the faith and holyness of these very persons; For no man may intrude himself upon, or thrust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon, or thrust himself into a Church of Christ: without the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104299:39"/>
Church have first the knowledge, and liking of the person to be received; If otherwise there is a door opened for all the hereticks in the world; yea for Divels also if they appear in humane shapes. But <hi>Paul</hi> shews you the manner of receiving, by pleading (after some disgrace thrown upon him by the false Apostles) for his own admission of his companions: <hi>Receive us,</hi> saith he, <hi>we have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no man; we have defrauded no man; we have corrupted no man</hi>: and so concerning Timothy; <hi>If</hi> Timothy <hi>come,</hi> saith he, <hi>see that he may be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.2. 1 Cor 16 10. Also when Paul supposed that <hi>Titus</hi> might be suspected by some; see how he pleades for him: <hi>If any do enquire of</hi> Titus; <hi>he is my partner, and fellow helper, concerning you; or our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren be enquired of, they are the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of the Churches, and the glory
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104299:40"/>
of Christ.</hi> 2 Cor. 8.23. <hi>Phaebe</hi> also when she was to be received by the Church at <hi>Rome</hi>; see how he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in her behalf: <hi>I commend unto you</hi> Phaebe <hi>our sister, which is a servant of the Church, which is at</hi> Ceuchrea; <hi>that ye receive her in the Lord, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Saints; and that you assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you; for she hath been a succourer of many, and of my self also</hi> Rom. 16.1, 2 Yea when the Apostles, and brethren sent their Epistles, from Jerusalem to <hi>Antioch</hi>: under what characters do those go, that were the messengers to them? <hi>It seemed good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Saul was in Antioch before, but being brought into suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by false Apostles, he had need of a new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</hi>

                  <hi>unto the holy Ghost, and to us. to send chosen men unto you, with our beloved</hi> Barnabas, <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>men that have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 15.25, 26, 27. Now though
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104299:40"/>
the occasion upon which these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations were written, were not simply, or onely, in order to Church relation, but also for other causes; yet because the persons concerned were of the Churches to be received as faithfull, and such who would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Church priviledges with them, they have therefore, their faith, and faithfulness relate to the Churches, as those that were particularly imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed there. Besides <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> being extrordinary officers, stood as members and officers in every Church where they were received: Likewise <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Saul, Judas,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> abode as members, and officers there where they were sent. 'Twas requisite therefore that the Letters of recommendation, should be in substance the same with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that ought to be made to the Church, by or for the person, that is to be imbodyed there.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104299:41"/>
and power of such an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ordinance then, that is the initiating or entering ordinance as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Doth give to them that partake thereof, aright to; and a being of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, with that particular Church, by which it is administred.</hi> I say; a right to, and a being of member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, without the addition of another Church-Act. This is evident by the Law of circumcision, which was the initiating Law of old; For by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of that very ordinance, the partaker thereof was forthwith member of that congregation, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the addition of another Church-act.</hi> Gen. 17. This is declared in its first institution, and therefore it is called the token of the Covenant: The token or sign of righteousness of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, and of the visible membership of those that joyned themselves to the Church with him; the very inlet into Church-communion; that gave a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104299:42"/>
of membership among them And thus <hi>Moses</hi> himself expounds it; <hi>Every Man-servant</hi> saith he, <hi>that is bought with money when thou hast cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised him, he shall eat of the pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi>: without the addition of another Church-act, to impower him there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; his circumcision hath already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a being there, and so a right to, and priviledge in the blessing of Church-relation: <hi>A Forreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.</hi> (because not circumcised) <hi>but when a stranger that sojourneth with thee. will keep the Passover to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it.</hi> (for then he is one of the Church) <hi>and he shall be as one born in the Laad; for no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised person shall eat thereof.</hi> Exo. 12.43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. Neither could any other thing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of Circumcision, give the devoutest person that breathed, a being of membership with them.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104299:42"/>
                  <hi>He that is born in thine house, &amp; he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised, &amp; the uncircumcised man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, whose flesh of his foreskin is not c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rcumcised, that Soul shall becut off from his people.</hi> Gen. 17.13, 14. Note then, that that which is the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating ordinance, admitteth none into Church-communion, but those that first partake thereof; The Angel sought to kill <hi>Moses</hi> himself, for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to make his child a member without it. Note again, that as it admitteth of none to membership without it, so as I said, <hi>the very act of circumcising them, without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another Church act,</hi> gave them a being of membership with that very Church, by whom they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised. <hi>Exo.</hi> 4.24, 25, 26. But none of this can be said of Baptism: First there is none debarred or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be cutoff from the Church; if they be not first baptized: Secondly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it give to the person bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104299:43"/>
a being of membership, with this or that Church, by whose mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers he hath been baptized. <hi>John</hi> gathered no particular Church, yet was he the first, and great baptizer with water; he preached Christ to come, and baptized with the baptism of repentance, and left his Disciples to be gathered by him. Acts 19.3, 4, 5. <hi>And to him shall the gathering of the people be</hi> Gen, 49.10, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides after Christs ascension, <hi>Phillip</hi> baptized the <hi>Eunuch</hi>; but made him, by that, no member of any particular Church: We onely read, that <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> was caught away from him, and that the <hi>Eunuch</hi> saw him no more, but went on his way rejoycing to his Masters and countrey of <hi>Ethiopia. Acts</hi> 8.35.40. Neither was <hi>Cornelius</hi> made a member of the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by his being baptized at <hi>Peters</hi> commandment at <hi>Caesarea. Acts</hi> 10. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they that were converted
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104299:43"/>
at <hi>Antioch,</hi> by them that were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by their baptism (if they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at all) joyned to the Church at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Acts 11.19. No, they were after gathered, and imbodyed among themselves, by other Church acts. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. What shall I say? Into what particular Church was <hi>Lydia</hi> baptized by <hi>Paul,</hi> or those first converts at <hi>Philippi</hi>? Yea even in the second of the Acts, Baptizing and adding to the Church, appear to be acts distinct: but if Baptism were the initiating ordinance, then was he that we Baptized made a member; made a member of a particular Church, by the very Act of water baptism: Neither ought any by Gods ordinance to have Baptized any, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the admitting them by that Act, to a being of membership in this particular Church. For if it be the initiating ordinance, it entereth them into the Church: What Church?
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104299:44"/>
Into a visible Church; Now there is no Church visible but that which is particular; The Universal being utterly invisible, and known to none but God. The person then that is baptized stands by that, a member of no Church at all, neither of the visible, nor yet of the invisible. A visible Saint he is, but not made so by Baptism; for he must be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Saint before, else he ought not to be baptized <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.33.</p>
               <p>Take it again; <hi>Baptism makes thee no member of the Church, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular nor universall: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it make thee a visible Saint: It therefore gives thee neither right to, nor being of membership at all,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why then were they Baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That their own Faith by that figure might be strengthened in the death and resurrection of Christ. And that themselves might see, that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104299:44"/>
they have professed themselves, dead, and buryed, and risen with him to newness of life. It did not seal to the Church that they were so (their satisfaction as to that arose from better arguments) but taught the party himself, that he ought so to be. Farther, It confirmed to his own conscience the forgiveness of sins, if by unfeigned faith he laid hold upon Jesus Christ. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</p>
               <p>Now then, if Baptism be not the initiating ordinance, we must seek for entring some other way, by some other appointment of Christ; unless we will say, that without rule, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order and without an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, we may enter into his visible Kingdom. The Church under the Law had their initiating and entering ordinance, it must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be; unless we should think that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104299:45"/>
Moses was more punctual and exact then Christ, but that also our Lord hath his entering appointment. Now that which by Christ is made the door of enterance into the Church, by that we may doubtless enter; and seeing Baptism is not that ordinance, we ought not to seek to enter thereby, but may with good conscience enter without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But by what rule then would you gather persons into Church-communion?</p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>Even by that rule, by which they are discovered to the Church to be visible Saints; and willing to be gathered into their body and fellowship.</hi> By that word of God therefore, by which their Faith, experience, and conversation (being examined) is found Good; by that the Church should receive them into fellowship with them. Marke; Not as they practise things that are circumstantial; but as their faith is commended by a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104299:45"/>
word of faith, and their conversation by a moral precept. Wherefore that is observable, that after <hi>Paul</hi> had declared himself sound of faith; he falls down to the body of the Law: <hi>Receive us, saith he, we have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man</hi>; he saith not, I am baptized; but I have wronged no man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>chap.</hi> 7.2. And if Churches after the confession of faith, made more use of the ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to judge of the fitness of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by; they might not exceed by this seeming strictness christian ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness towards them, they receive to communion.</p>
               <p>I will say therefore, that by the word of faith and of good works; moral duties Gospellized; we ought to judge of the fitness of members by, by which we ought also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to fellowship: <hi>Eor he that in these things proveth sound,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:104299:46"/>
he hath the antitype of circumsion, which was before the entering ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. <hi>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumsion which is outward in the flesh. But he is a Jew which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit, whose praise is not of men but of God.</hi> Rom. 2.28, 29. Phil. 3.1.2 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Now a confession of this by word and life, makes this inward circumsion visible; When you know him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be thus circumcised, you ought to admit him to the Lords pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over: he, if any hath a share, not onely in Church communion, but a visible right to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>For the Kingdom of God,</hi> or our Service to Christ, <hi>consisteth not in meats or drinks, but in righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy Ghost; And he that in these things serveth Christ, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, and approved of men.</hi> Rom. 14 18. Deut. 23.47. By which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104299:46"/>
word righteousness he meaneth as <hi>Iames</hi> doth; the royal Law, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Law, which is the moral precept Evangelized or delivered to us by the hand of Christ. <hi>James</hi> 2.8 9. The Law was given twice on <hi>Sinai</hi>; The last time it was given with a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace and mercy of God, and of the pardon of sins going before. <hi>Exo.</hi> 19. <hi>and chap.</hi> 34.1.10 The second giving is here intended; for so it cometh after faith, which first receiveth the proclamation of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness; hence we are said to do this righteousness in the joy and peace of the holy Ghost. Now he that in these things serveth Christ, is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, and approved of men. For who is he that can justly find fault with him that fullfilleth the royal Law from a principle of Faith and Love. <hi>If ye fullfill the royal Law according to the Scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self; ye do well</hi>; ye are approved of men. Again, he
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104299:47"/>
that hath loved another hath fullfilled the Law, for love is the fulfilling of the Law. He then that serveth Christ, according to the royal Law, from faith and love going before, he is a fit person for Church-communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; God accepteth him, Men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him. Now that the royal Law, is the moral precept; read the place. <hi>James</hi> 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. It is also called the law of liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the bondage is taken away by forgiveness going before; and this is it by which we are judged, as is said, meet or unmeet for Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, <hi>&amp;e.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I say; the rule by which we receive Church-members; it is the word of the Faith of Christ, and of the moral precept Evangelized, as I said before, <hi>I am under the Law to Christ,</hi> saith Paul. So when he forbideth us, communion with men, they be such as are destitute of the Faith of Christ, and live in the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104299:47"/>
of a moral precept: <hi>I haue written unto you, saith he, not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or an Idolater, or a railer, or a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or an extortioner, with such an one no not to eat.</hi> He saith not, if any man be not Baptized, have not hands laid on him, or joyne with the unbaptized: these are fictions, scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureless notions. For this, <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adultery; Thou shalt not Kill; Thou shalt not Steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness; Thou shalt not Covet. And if there be any other Commandment, it is briefly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this saying, Thou shalt Love thy Neighbour as thy self. Love thinketh no ill to his Neighbour; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Love is the fullfilling of the Law.</hi> Rom. 13.9, 10.</p>
               <p>The word of Faith, and the moral precept, is that which <hi>Paul</hi> injoyns the Galathians and Philippians; still avoiding outward circumstances:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104299:48"/>
hence therefore when he had to the Galathians treated of Faith, he falls point blank upon moral duties. <hi>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a new creature: And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</hi> Gal. 6 15, 16. As many as walk, according to this rule; What rule? The rule by which men are proved new creatures: The word of Faith and the moral precept. Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, not to walk as other Gentiles, in the vanity of their mind; seeing they had received Christ, and had heard him, and had been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus; that they would put off the old man; what is that? Why, the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, which is corrupt according to the deceitfull lusts; Lying, Anger, Sin, giving place to the Divel, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt communication, all bitterness,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104299:48"/>
wrath, clamor, evil speaking, with all malice; and that they would put on the new man; What is that? That which is created in righteousness and true holyness; A being renewed in the spirit of their mind, and a putting away all these things. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 <hi>For in Christ Jesus,</hi> these words are put in of purpose, to shew us the nature of new Testament administrations; And how they differ from the old: In <hi>Moses</hi> an outward conformity, to an outward and carnal ordinance, was sufficient to give (they subjecting themselves thereto) a being of membership with the Jews: But in Christ <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esus it is not so: of <hi>Abrahams</hi> flesh was the national Jewish congregation; but it is <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith that makes new testament Churches; <hi>They that are of Faith, are the children of faithfull Abraham. They that are of Faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</hi> So then the seed being now spiritual, the rule must needs be spiritual also
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104299:49"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the word of Faith and holyness; This is the Gospel concision knife; sharper then any two edged sword; and that by which new testament Saints are circumcised in heart, ears, and lips. <hi>For in Christ Jesus,</hi> no outward and circumstantial thing; but the new creature; none subjects of the visible Kingdom of Christ but visible Saints by calling; Now that which manifesteth a person to be a visible Saint, must be conformity to the word of Faith and Holyness. <hi>And they that are Christs, have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</hi> Hearken how delightfully <hi>Paul</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth the point? The new creatures, are the Israel of God. The new creature hath a rule by himself to walk by; And as many as walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Philippians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth as much; where treating of his own practice in the doctrine of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104299:49"/>
Faith and Holyness; requireth them to walk by the same rule, to mind the same thing. I desire to be found in Christ; saith he, I reach forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the things that are before; my conversation is in heaven, and flatly opposite to them, whose God is their belly, who glory in their shame; and who mind earthly things. <hi>Brethren,</hi> saith he, <hi>be ye followers together with me, and mark them that walk so</hi>; Mark them; For what? For persons that are to be received into fellowship and the choycest communion of Saints. And indeed this is the safest way to judge of the meetness of persons by. For take away the confession of Faith and holyness; and what can distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish a Christian from a Turk? He that indeed receiveth faith, and that squareth his life by the royal, perfect, moral precept; and that walketh there, in the joy and peace of the holy Ghost; no man can reject him; he cannot be a man if he object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104299:50"/>
against him; not a man in Christ; not a man in understanding. <hi>The Law is not made for a righteous man</hi>; neither to debar him the communion of Saints if he desire it, nor to cast him out if he were in. <hi>But for the Lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane: For murtherers of fathers and for murtherers of mothers; for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slayers, for whoremongers: for them that defile themselves with mankind; for manstealers, for prejured persons; and if there be any other thing contrary to sound doctrine, according to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gospell which is committtd to my trust.</hi> 1 Tim, 1.9, 10, 11. <hi>Paul also,</hi> wen he would leave an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conviction upon the Ephesians concerning his Faith and Holyness; treating first of the sufficiency of Christs blood, and the grace of God to save us; he adds, <hi>I have coveted no mans Silver, or Gold, or Apparell,</hi> he bringth them to the moral precept,

And when men have juggled what they can, and made never such a prattle about religion; yet if their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est excellency, as to the visibility of their Saintship, lyeth in an outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, to an outward circumstance in religion; their profession is not worth two mites. <hi>Let us walk ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, as in the day, not in rioting, and drunkenss; not in chambering and wantonness; not in strife and envy; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.</hi> Rom. 13.13, 14. And it is observable, That after the Apostle had in the 9th and 10th verses of this chapter told us, that the moral precept is the rule of a good conversation; and exhorted us to make no provision for the flesh; he adds (these things provided) we may receive any that believe in Christ Jesus, unto communion with us;

how weak soever and dark in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantialls; and chiefly designs the proof thereof, in the remaining part of his Epistle. For he that is of sound Faith, and of conversation honest in the world; no man, however he may fail in circumstances, may lightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach or vilify him. And indeed such persons are honour of Christian congregations. Indeed he is preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, for want of light in those things about which he is dark; as of Baptism or the like; but seeing that is not the initiating ordinance, or the visible character of a Saint; yea seeing it maketh no breach in a good and holy life; nor intrencheth upon any mans right but his own; and seeing his Faith may be effectual with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and his life approved by the worst of his enemies; why should his friends, while he keeps the Law, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God by breaking of the same? <hi>Speak not evil one of another brethren: he that speaketh evil of his

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But notwithstanding all that you have said: Water baptism ought to go before Church-membership; shew me one in all the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that was received into fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That Water-baptism hath formerly gone first is granted: But that it ought of necessity so to do, I never saw proof.</p>

play the Hypocrite: And besides on marvail though in the primitive times it was so generally practised first, for the unconverted themselves know, it belonged to the Disciples of Jesus Christ. <hi>Joh</hi> 1.24, 25, 26, 27. Yet that all that were received into fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, were even then baptized first, would strain a weak mans wit to prove it, if arguments were close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made upon these three texts of holy scriptures (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14, 15, 16 <hi>Gal.</hi> 37.27. <hi>Rom</hi> 6.3.) But I pass them, and say, If you can shew me the Christi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an, that in the primitive times remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dark about it, I will shew you the Christian that was received wthout it.</p>
               <p>But should I grant more then can be proved; <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptism were the initiating ordinance; and that it once did, as circumcision of old, give a being of membership to the partakers; yea set the case that men were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden then to enter into fellowship without it: yet the case may so bee,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104299:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that these things notwithstanding, men might be received into fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship without it. All these things intailed to circumcision; That was the initiating ordinance; that gave being of membership; that was it without which it was positively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, none should be received into fellowship, <hi>Jos.</hi> 5. Yet for all this more then six hundred thousand were received into the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; yea received, and also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there and that by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> even those to whom the Land was promised, when the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised were cut off. But why then were they not circumcised? Doubtless there was a reason; either they wanted time, or opportunity, or instruments, or something. But they could not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

what ever the hinderance was, it mattereth not; our brethren have a manifest one, an invincible one, one that all the men on earth nor Angels in heaven cannot remove; <hi>For it is God that createth light</hi>; and for them to do it without light would but prove them unfaithfull to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and make them sinners against God; <hi>For whatsoever is not of Faith is sin.</hi> Rom. 14. If therefore <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshuah</hi> thought fit to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with six hundred thousand uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised persons; when by the Law not one such ought to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among them; why may not I have communion, the closest commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with visible Saints as afore descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, although they want light in, and so cannot submit to that, which of God was never made the wall of division betwixt us. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hold communion with such.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> Because the true visible Saint hath already subjected to that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104299:53"/>
which is better; even to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God, which is by Faith of Jesus Christ; by which he stands just before God; he also hath made the most exact and strict rule under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that whereby he squares his life before men. He hath like precious Faith with the best of Saints, and a conversation according to light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, becoming the Gospell of Christ: He is therefore to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, received I say, not by thy light, not for that in circumstances he jumpeth with thy opinion; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Faith which he ought to keep himself before G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. <hi>Conscience I say, not thine own, but of the other; For why is my liberty judged by another mans conscience.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.29. Some indeed do object that what the Apostles wrote, they wrote to gathered Chruches, and so to such as were baptized. And therefore the arguments that are in the Epistles about things circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104299:54"/>
respect not the case in hand. But I will tell such, that as to the first part of their objection, they are utterly under a mistake. The first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> The Epistle of <hi>James,</hi> both them of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the first Epistle of <hi>John,</hi> were expresly written to all the Godly, as well as particular Churches. Again; if Water-baptism, as the circumstances with which the Churches were pester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of old, trouble their peace, wound the consciences of the Godly; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and break their fellowships, it is although an ordinance for the present to be prudently shunned; for the edification of the Church as I shall shew anon, is to be preferred before it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and observe it; <hi>One Spirit, one Hope, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism</hi> (not of Water, for by one Spirit are we all Baptized into one body) one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104299:54"/>
in you all; is a sufficient rule for us to hold communion by, &amp; also to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the maintaining that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to keep it in unity, within the bond of peace against all attempts what soever. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I am bold therefore to have communion with such <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. Because they also have the doctrin of Baptisms: I say the doctrins of them; For here you must note, I distinguish between the doctrin and practise of Water-baptism; The Doctrin being that which by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sign is presented to us, or which by the outward circumstance of the act is preached to the believer: <hi>viz. The death of Christ; My death with Christ; also his resurrection from the Dead, and mine with him to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of life.</hi> This is the doctrin which Baptism preacheth, or that which by the outward action is signifyed to the believing receiver. Now I say, he that believeth in Jesus Christ; that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104299:55"/>
richer and better then that, <hi>viz.</hi> is dead to sin, and that lives to God by him, he hath the heart, power and doctrine of Baptism: all then that he wanteth, is but the sign, the shadow, or the outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance thereof; Nor yet is that des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised, but forborn for want of light: The best of Baptisms he hath; he is Baptized by that one spirit; he hath the heart of Water-baptism, he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only the outward shew, which if he had; would not prove him a truly visible Saint; it would not tell me he had grace in his heart: It is no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristical note to another, of my Sonship with God; Indeed 'tis a sign to the person Baptized, and an help to his own Faith; he should know by that circumstance, that he hath received remission of sins; if his Faith be as true, as his being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized is felt by him. But if for want of light, he partake not of that sign, his Faith can see it in other things,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104299:55"/>
exceeding great and precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Yea as I also have hinted already, if he appear not a Brother before, he appeareth not a Brother by that, And those that shall content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to make that the note of visible Church-membership; I doubt make things not much better, the note of their sonship with God:</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I am bold to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with visible Saints as afore; because God hath communion with them; whose example in the case, we are streightly commanded to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. <hi>Receive you one another as Christ Jesus hath received you,</hi> saith Paul, <hi>to the glory of God.</hi> Rom. 15.1 6. Yea though they be Saints o opinions contrary to you;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est may sometimes be out of the way.</hi>
                  </note> though it goeth against the mind of them that are strong. <hi>We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak; and not to please our selves.</hi> What infirmityes? Those
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104299:56"/>
that are natural are incident to all, they are infirmityes then that are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that cause a man for want of light, to erre in circumstantials; And the reason upon which he ground this admonition is, <hi>that Christ pleased not himself; but as it is written, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of them that reproached thee, have fallen upon me.</hi> You say, to have communion with such weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, reproacheth your opinions, and practise; Grant it, your dulness and deadness, and imperfections also reproach the holyness of God; If you say no, for Christ hath born our sins; The answer is still the same, Their sins also are fallen upon Christ; He then that hath taken away thy sins from before the throne of God; hath taken away their shortness in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to an outward circumstance in religion. <hi>Both your infirmityes are fallen upon Christ</hi>; yea if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thy great sins; thou standest by Christ compleat before the Throne
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104299:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God; why may not thy Brother. notwithstanding his little ones, stand compleat before thee in the Church.</p>
               <p>Vain man! Think not by the streightness of thine order, in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and bodily conformity, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and shadowish circumstances, that thy peace is maintained with God; for peace with God is by Faith in the blood of his cross; who hath born the reproaches of you both. Wherefore he that hath communion with God for Christs sake, is as good and as worthy of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints as thy self. He err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a circumstance, thou errest in a substance; who must bear these er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors? Upon whom must these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches fall? <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10. Some of the things of God that are excellent have not been approved by some of the Saints: What then? Must these for this be cast out of the Church? No, these reproaches by which the wisedom of heaven is reproached
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104299:57"/>
have fal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en upon me, saith Christ. But to return; <hi>God hath received him, Christ hath received him,</hi> therefore do you receive him. There is more solidity in this argument, <hi>then if all the Churches of God had received him.</hi> This receiving then, because it is set an example to the Church is such as must needs be visible to them; and it best described by that word which discovereth the visible Saint: Who so therefore you can by the word, judge a visible Saint, one that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with God; you may judge by the self same word that God hath received him. Now him that God receiveth and holdeth communion with, him you should receive and hold communion with. Will any say we cannot believe that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any but such as are Baptized? I will not suppose a Brother so stupify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore to that I will not answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Receive him to the Glory of God</hi>;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104299:57"/>
[To the Glory of God] is put in on purpose, to shew what dishonour they bring to God who despise to have communion with them; who yet they know have communion with God. For how doth this man or that Church glorify God, or count the wisdom and holyness of heaven beyond them, when they refuse communion with them; <hi>concerning whom, they are by the word convinced, that they have communion with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the God of patience and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, grant you to be like minded one towards another, according to Christ Jesus.</hi> Rom. 15.5. By this word Patience, Paul insinuateth how many imperfections, the choycest Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, do mingle their best performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with. And by this of consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how readily God overlooks, passeth by them and comforteth you notwithstanding. Now that this mind should be in Christians one to another, is manifest; bcause
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104299:58"/>
Paul praies that it might be so. But this is an heavenly gift, and therefore must be fetched from thence. But let the patience of God, and the willingness of Christ to bear the reproaches of the weak, and the consolations that they have in God, notwithstanding, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate your passions and put you upon prayer, to be minded like Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Because a failure in such a circumstatce as Water doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian us; This must needs be granted, not onely from what was said before; but for that thousands of thousands that could not consent thereto, as we have more gloriously, then we are like to do, acquitted themselves and their Christianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, and are now with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of Angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect: What is said of Eating or the contrary may as to this be said of Water bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. Neither if I be Baptized, am I the better, neither if I be not. am I
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104299:58"/>
the worse: Not the better before God; not the worse before men; still meaning as Paul doth, provided I walk according to my light with God: otherwise 'tis false; For if a man that seeth it to be his duty, shall despisingly neglect it; or if he that hath no Faith therein shall foolishly take it up; both these are for this the worse, being convicted in themselves for transgressors. He therefore that doth it according to his light, doth well; and he that doth it not, or dare not do it for want of light doth not ill; for he approveth his heart to be sincere with God: he dare not do any thing but by light in the word. If therefore he be not by Grace a partaker of light, in that circumstance which thou professest; yet he is a partaker of that liberty and mercy by which thou standest. He hath liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to call God Father, as thou: And to believe he shall be saved by Jesus: His Faith, as thine, hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104299:59"/>
his heart: He is tender of the Glory of God as thou art: and can claim by Grace an Interest in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; which thou must not do because of Water: Ye are both then Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans before God and men without it: He that can let him preach to himself by that: He that cannot let him preach to himself by the promises; But yet let us rejoyce in God together; let us exalt his name together, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Baptized can thank God for that, for which another cannot; But may not he that is unbaptized thank god for that which the baptized cannot Wouldst thou be content that I should judge thee, because thou canst not for my light give <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hanks with me? Why then should he judge me for that I cannot give thanks with him for his? <hi>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that no man put a stumbling block, or occasion of offence in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers way.</hi> Rom. 14.1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And seeing the things wherein we exceed each
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104299:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other, are such as neither make nor marre Christianity; let us love one another and walk together by that glorious rule above specifyed, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other in all such circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to our own Master, to our own Faith. <hi>Who art thou that judgest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans servant? To his own Master he standeth or falleth; yea he shall be holden up, for God is able to make him stand.</hi> Rom. 14.4.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, I am therefore for holding communion thus, because the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souls in the Faith and holyness of the Gospell, is of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then an agreement in outward things; I say, 'tis of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with us, and of far more profit to our Brother; then our agreeing in, or contesting for the business of Water-baptism. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 8 <hi>chap.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.10, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. <hi>chap.</hi> 18.1, 2. That the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Soul, is of the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104299:60"/>
is out of measure evident: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause heaven and eternal happiness are so immediately concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Besides, this is that for which Christ dyed, for which the holy Ghost was given, yea for which the Scriptures and the gifts of all the Godly are given to the Church; yea and if gifts are not bent to this very work, the persons are said to be proud or uncharitable that have them; and stand but for cyphers or worse among the Churches of God. Farther, Edification is that that che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth all grace, and maketh the Christians quick and lively, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sin lean and dwindling, and fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the mouth with thanksgiving to God. But to contest with gracious men, with men that walk with God; to shut such out of the Churches; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will not sin against their Souls, rendereth thee uncharitable. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15.20 <hi>Thou seekest to destroy the work of God</hi>; thou begett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104299:60"/>
contentions, janglings, murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and evil surmisings; thou mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strest occasion for whisperings, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings, slanders and the like, rather then godly edifying; contrary to the whole current of the scriptures and peace of all communityes. Let us therefore leave off these contentions, and follow after things that make for peace, <hi>and things wherewith one may edify another.</hi> Rom. 14.19. And know that the edification of the Church of God dependeth not upon, neither is tyed to this or that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Especially when there are in the hearts of the Godly; different perswasions about it: then it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them in the wisedom of God, to take more care for their peace and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; then to widen or make large their uncomfortable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
               <p>Although <hi>Aaron</hi> transgressed the Law, because he eat not the sin offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people; yet seeing he could
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104299:61"/>
not do it with satisfaction to his own conscience; <hi>Moses</hi> was content that he left it undone. <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.16.20.</p>

The edification of the people in the camp was that which pleased <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time; Though the people came to the passover in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due manner; <hi>and did eat it otherwise then it was written</hi>; yet the wise King would not forbid them; but rather admitted it, knowing that their edification was of greater concern, then to hold them to a circumstance

Yea God himself, did like the wisdom of the King, and healed, that is, forgave the people at the prayer of <hi>Hezekias</hi> And observe it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this disorder, as to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; the feast was kept with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord, day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the Lord: yea there was not the like joy in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> from the the time of <hi>Solomon</hi> unto that same time What shall we say, all things must give place to the profit of the people of God. Yea sometimes Laws themselves, or their outward preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; much more for Godly edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; When Christs disciples plucked the ears of corn on the Sabbath (no doubt for very hunger) and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked by the Pharisees for it, us for that which was unlawfull; How did their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Have ye not read, said he, what David did when he was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred; and they that were with him, how he entred into the house of God, and did eat the shew-bread, which was not lawfull for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but for the Priests onely; or have ye not read in the Law, how that on the Sabbath-day, the Priests in the Temple prophaned the Sabbath and were blameless.</hi> Why blameless? Because they did it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the edification of the people. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12, 1. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

If Laws and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of old, have been broken and the breach of them born with (when yet the observance of outward things was more strictly commanded then now) when the profit and edification of the people, came in competition, how much more may not we have communion, Church-communion, no Law where is transgressed thereby.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Therefore I am for holding communion thus, because
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104299:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Love, which above all things we are commanded to put on; is of much more worth then to break about Baptism; <hi>Love is also more discovered when it receiveth for the sake of Christ, and grace; then when it refuseth for want of Water</hi>: And observe it, as I have also said before, this exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Love is grounded upon the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of the new creature; which new creature hath swallowed up all distinctions, that have before been common among the Churches. As I am a Jew, you are a Greek; I am circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, you are not: I am free, you are bound. Because Christ was all in all these, <hi>Put on therefore,</hi> saith he, (<hi>as the elect of God, holy and beloved</hi>) <hi>bowels of mercyes kindness, humbleness of mind, long suffering,</hi> that is, with reference to the infirmities of the weak, <hi>forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, If any man have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye: And above all things put on cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104299:63"/>
which is the bond of perfectness.</hi> Col, 3.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Which forbearing and forgiving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth not onely private and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal injuries, but also errours in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about inclinations and destincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tending to divisions, and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the grounds laid down in <hi>v.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th, which how little soever they now seem to us who are beyond them, were strong, and of weight to them who in that day were intangled with them. Some Saints then, were not free to preach to any but the Jews; denying the word of Life to the Gentiles, and contending with them who preferred it to them: which was a greater error then this of Baptism. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.1, 2, 3: 19. But what should we do with such kind of Saints? Why love them still, forgive them, bear with them, and maintain Church-communion with them. Why? Because they are new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, because they are Christs; For
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104299:63"/>
these swallow up all distinctions. Farther, because they are elect and beloved of God. Divisions and distinctions are of shorter date then election; let not them therefore that are but momentary and hatcht in darkness, break that bond that is from everlasting It is Love, not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism that discovereth us to the world to be Christs Disciples. It is Love that is the undoubted character of our interest in, and sonship with God: I mean when we Love as Saints, and desire communion with others, because they have fellowship one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in their fellowship with God the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2. And now though the truth and sincerity of our Love to God, be then discovered when we keep his commandments, in love to his name; yet we should remember again, that the two head and chief Commandments, are Faith in Jesus, and Love to the brethren: 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 3.23.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104299:64"/>
So then he that pretendeth to Love, and yet seeks not the profit of his Brother in chief; he Loveth, but they are his own opinions and froward notions. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.21. <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law</hi>; but he fulfills it not who judgeth, and setteth at nou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Love therefore is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more seen and shewed, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to urge and press what we know, then in publishing and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. I could not saith <hi>Paul,</hi> (Love would not let me) <hi>speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto Babes in Christ: I have fed you with Milk and not with strong meat, for hitherto you have not been able to bear it; neither yet
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104299:64"/>
now are you able.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.1, 2. The Apostle considered not onely the knowledge that he had in the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Christ; but the temper, the growth, and strength of the Churches, and accordingly kept back, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them, what might be for their profit. <hi>Act</hi> 20.18, 19, 20. So Christ, <hi>I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</hi> It may be some will count these old and threadbare texts; but such must know, that the word of the Lord must stand for ever. <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.8. And I should dare to say to such: if the best of thy new shifts, be to slight, and abuse old Scriptures; It shewes thou art more fond of thy unwarrantable opinion, then swift to hear, and ready to yield to the authority that is unfallible. But to conclude this, when we attempt to force our Brother beyond his light, or to break his heart with grief, to thrust him beyond his Faith, or to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104299:65"/>
bar him from his priviledge: how can we say, I love? What shall I say? To have fellowship one with another for the sake of an outward circumstance, or to make that the door to fellowship which God hath not; yea to make that the including, excluding charter: The bounds, bar, and rule of Communion, when by the word of the everlasting testament there is no warrant for it (to speak charitably) If it be not for want of Love, it is for want of knowledge in the mysteries of the Kingdom of Christ. Strange! Take two Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans equal in all points but this, nay let one go beyond the other far, for grace and holyness; yet this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Water shall drown and sweep away all his excellencies, not count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him worthy of that reception, that with hand and heart shall be given a novice in religion, because he consents to Water.</p>

Eighthly, But for Gods people to divide into parties, or to shut each other from Church communion; though from greater points, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on higher pretences, then this of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-baptism; <hi>hath heretofore been count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed carnal, and the actors herein babish Christians: Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo, Cephas,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> were doubtless higher things then those about which we contend: yet when they made divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions for them; <hi>how sharply are they rebuked</hi>? Are ye not <hi>Carnall, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, Carnall</hi>? For whereas there are among you, envyings, strife, divisions, or factions: <hi>are you not carnall.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.11, 12. chap. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. While one saith I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and another I am of <hi>Apollo; are you not carnall</hi>? See therefore from whence arise all thy, indeavours, zeal and labour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish divisions, among the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Let <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or Christ himself be the burthen of thy song,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104299:66"/>
yet the heart from whence they flow <hi>is carnall,</hi> and thy actions, <hi>discoveries of childishness.</hi> But doubtless when these contentions were among the Corinthians? and one man vilifyed that another might be promoted; <hi>a lift with a carnall Brother, was thought great wisedom to widen the breach.</hi> But why should he be rebuked, that said he was for Christ? because he was for him in opposition to his holy Apostles. Hence he saith, <hi>Is Christ divided</hi>; or separate from his servants Note therefore that these divisions are deserted by the persons the divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were made about; Neither <hi>Paul</hi> nor <hi>Apollo,</hi> nor <hi>Cephas,</hi> nor <hi>Christ</hi> is here. Let the cry be never so loud, Christ, order, the rule, the command, or the like; Carnality is but the bottom, and they are but babes that do it; their zeal is but a puffe, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 4.6. And observe it, the great division at Corinth, was helped forward by Water-baptism:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104299:66"/>
This the <hi>Apostle</hi> intimates by; <hi>Were ye Baptized in the name of</hi> Paul? <hi>Ah Brethren! Carnall Christians with outward circumstances, will if they be let alone, make sad work in the Churches of Christ, against the spiritual growth of the same. But I thank God,</hi> saith Paul, <hi>that I Baptized none of you,</hi> &amp;c. Not, but that it was then an ordinance of God, but they abused it, in making parties thereby. I Baptized none of you, but <hi>Crispus</hi> and <hi>Gaius, and the houshold of Stephanus</hi>; men of note among the Brethren, men of good judgement, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced by the rest; they can tell you I intended not to make a party to my self thereby. <hi>Besides I know not whether I Baptized any other.</hi> By this negligent relating, who were Baptized by him; he sheweth that he made no such matter of Baptism, as some in these dayes do; nay, that he made no matter at all thereof,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104299:67"/>
with respect to Church-communion; for if he did not heed who himself had Baptized; he much less heeded, who were Baptized by others; but if Baptism had been the initiating or entering ordinance, and so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God; no doubt he had made more conscience thereof, then so lightly to pass it over. <hi>For Christ sent me not to Baptize, but to Preach the Gospel.</hi> The Gospel then may be effectually preached, and yet Baptism neither administred nor mentioned. The Gospel being good tidings to sinners, upon the account of free grace through Christ; but Baptism with things of like nature, are dutyes injoyned such a people who received the Gospel before: I speak not this, because I would teach men to break the least of the Commandments of God; but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my brethren of the Baptized way, not to hold too much thereupon; not to make it an essential of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104299:67"/>
Gospel of Christ, nor yet of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints. <hi>He sent me not to Baptize</hi>: These words are spoken with holy indignation against them that abuse this ordinance of Christ. So when he speaketh of the Ministers themselves, which also they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused; in his speaking, he as it were, trampleth upon them; as if they were nothing at all. <hi>Who then is Paul? and who is Apollo?</hi> He that planteth is not any thing; neither is he that watereth: <hi>but God that giveth the increase:</hi> 1 Cor. 3.5: 7. Yet for all this, the Ministers and their ministry are a glorious appointment of God in the World. Baptisme also is a holy ordinance, but when Sathan abuseth it, and wrencheth it out of its place; making that which was ordained of God, for the edification of believers; the only weapon to break in pieces, the love, the unity, the concord of Saints; then <hi>what is Baptism</hi>; then <hi>neither is Baptism any thing</hi> And
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104299:68"/>
this is no new doctrine; For God by the mouth of his Prophets of old; cryed out against his own institutions, when abused by his people: <hi>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to me? saith the Lord, I am full of burnt offerings, of rams; and the fat of fed Beasts: I delight not in the blood of Bullocks, or of Lambs, or of he Goats: When you come to appear before me, Who hath required these things at your hands, to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain oblations, incense is an abominatien to me: The new Moons and the Sabbaths, and the calling of assemblyes, I cannot away with; it is iniqui<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, even the solemn meeting. Your new Moons, and your appointed Feasts my Soul hateth, they are a trouble to me, my Soul hateth, I am even weary to bear them.</hi> Isa. 1.11, 12, 13, 14. And yet all these were his own appointments. But why then did he thus abhor them? Because they retained the evil of their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104299:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doings, and used them as they did other of his appointments. <hi>viz. For strife and debate, and to strike with the fist of wickedness.</hi> chap. 58.4. Wherefore when that of God, that is great, is overweighed by that which is small; it is the wisedom of them that see it, to put load to the other end of the scale; untill the things thus abused, poise in their own place. But to pass this, and proceed.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, If we shall reject visible Saints by calling, Saints that have communion with God; that have received the Law, at the hand of Christ, that are of holy conversation among men; they desiring to have communion with us, as much as in us lyeth, we take from them their very priviledge, and the blessings to which they are born of God: For <hi>Paul</hi> saith, not only to the gathered Church at Corinth, but to all scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Saints that in every place call
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104299:69"/>
upon the name of the Lord: <hi>That Jesus Christ is theirs, That Paul and Apollo, and the World, and Life, and Death, and all things are theirs,</hi> because they are Christs, and Christ is Gods. But saith he, let no man glory in men, such as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> though these were excellent: because this priviledge comes to you upon another bottom, even by Faith of Jesus Christ. <hi>Drink you all of this,</hi> is intailed to Faith, not Baptism: Nay Baptized persons may yet be excluded this; when he that discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lords body hath right, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, 29. But to exclude Christians from Church communion, and to debar them their Heaven-born priviledges, for the want of that which yet God never made a wall of division between us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This looks too like a <hi>spirit of persecution.</hi> Job. 19.25, 26, 27, 28.</p>

               <p>Tenthly, and Lastly. Bear with one word farther: What greater contempt can be thrown upon the Saints; then for their Brethren to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104299:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cast them off, or to debar them Church communion? Think you not that the World may groundly say, Some great iniquity lyes hid in the skirts of your Brethren; when in truth the transgression is yet your own? But I say what can the Church do more to the sinner or open prophane? Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil commerce you will have with the worst, and what more have you with these? Perhaps you will say we can pray and Preach with these, and hold them Christians, Saints, and Godly. Well but let me ask you one word farther: Do you believe, that of very conscience, they cannot consent, as you, to that of Water baptism? And that if they had light therein, they would as willingly do it as you? Why then as I have shewed you our refusal to hold communion with them is without a ground from the word of God.</p>
               <p>But can you commit your Soul to their Ministry, and joyne with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104299:71"/>
them in Prayer; and yet not count them meet for other Gospel p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges? I would know by what Scripture you do it? Perhaps you will say I commit not my Sou to their Ministry, only hear them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally for tryall. If this be all the respect thou hast for them and their Ministry, thou mayest have as much for the worst that pisseth against the Wall. But if thou canst hear them as Gods Ministers. and sit under their Ministry as Gods ordinance; then shew me where God hath such a Gospel Ministry, as that the persons Ministring, may not though desiring it, be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with you to the closest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints. But if thou sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est under their Ministry for fleshly politick ends; thou hearest the word like an Atheist, and art thy self, while thou judgest thy Brother, in the practise of the worst of men. But I say, where do you find this
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104299:71"/>
peicemeal communion with men that profess Faith and Holyness as you, and separation from the World.</p>
               <p>If you object that my Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples lead me to have communion with all; I answer with all as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore described; if they will have communion with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Then you may have communion with the members of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If there be a visible Saint yet remaining in that Church; let him come to us, and we will have communion with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest,</hi> What! Though he yet stand a member of that sinfull num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and profess himself one of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> You suppose an impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; For it cannot be that at the same time, a man should visibly stand a member of two bodys, diametrically opposite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wherefore it must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104299:72"/>
that he who professeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a member of a Church of Christ; must forthwith, nay before, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Antichristian one. The which if he refuseth to do, it is evident he doth not sincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to have fellowship with the Saints.</p>
               <p>But he saith he cannot see that that company to which you stand opposite, and conclude Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, is indeed the Antichristian Church.</p>
               <p>If so: he cannot desire to joyn with another, if he know them to be professedly, and directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite.</p>
               <p>I hold therefore to what I said at first; That if there be any Saints in the Antichristian Church, my heart, and the door of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is open to receive them, into closest fellowship with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:104299:72"/>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But how if they yet retain some Antichristian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If they be such as eat out the bowels of a Church, so soon as they are detected, he must be either be kept out, while out, or cast out, if in: For it must be the prudence of every community, to preserve its own unity with peace and truth: The which the Churches of Christ may do; and yet as I have shewed already, receive such persons as differ upon the point of Water-baptism: For the doing or not doing of that, neither maketh nor marreth, the bowels or foundation of Church communion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But this is receiving for opinion sake; as before you said of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No, We receive him for the sake of Christ, and grace, and for our mutual edification in the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104299:73"/>
Faith; and that we respect not opinions, I mean in lesser matters, 'tis evident; for things wherein we differ are no breach of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among us; We let every man have his own Faith in such things to himself before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I now come to a short Application.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I, Keep a strict separation, I pray you, from communion with the open prophane; and let no man use his liberty in Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as an occasion to the flesh; but in Love serve one another; Looking diligently least any root of bitterness (any poisonfull herb. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.18.) springing up trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you, and thereby many be defiled And let those that before were reasons for my separation; be motives to you maintain the like: and remember that when men have said what they can for a sinfull

mixture in the worship of God, the arm of the Lord is made bare against it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the midst of your zeal for the Lord, remember that the visible Saint is his; and is privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in all those spiritual things, that you have in the word, and live in the practise of, and that he is to partake thereof, according to his light therein. Quarrel not with him about things that are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial; but receive him in the Lord as becometh Saints; if he will not have communion with you, the neglect is his, not yours. But saith the open prophane; Why cannot we be reckoned Saints also? We have been Christened, we go to Church, we take the Communion. Poor People! This will not do; for so long as in Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation you appear to be open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; we cannot unless we sin, receive you into our fellowship:
