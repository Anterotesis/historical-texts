            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19301:8"/>
Pharisees even then desired to doe. For when the Leviticall Priesthood was abolished and abandoned, the next ages and ancient Fathers bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call the Ministers of the Gospell, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Sacerdotes,</hi> proper Priests. But seeing our word, <hi>Priest,</hi> is not derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but from the Apostles <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <hi>Justine Martyrs</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there is lesse reason we should leave a rationall etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, for a reason-lesse fancie, or be ashamed of the Title, when we must discharge the Office.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Scripturist will<note place="margin">2</note> circumcise and confine this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the written Canon onely; all other learning is Pagane, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, unfanctified: but their pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects returne upon their heads. 1. They would banish profane and lewd manners; and what sooner way, then by pulling downe Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, and setting up illiterate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19301:9"/>
teachers, to bring in ignorance, the mother of profanesse &amp; Atheisme? 2. They would have the pure word preached. And what better meanes, then by comparing Translations, and consulting antiquity, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the sense and divide the Word aright? Which cannot be done well without the whole Masse of reall knowledge. But I doubt, there is a loathing in them of what they never knew, and it is not their piety but idlenesse, to condemne all other Authors: and the applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this hath a farther reach in some of their Abettors; the lesse learning, the lesse stipend; and such trifling speakers will accept a tithe of tithes. For in this we agree with them, and shake hands, that the sacred Word must be the <hi>Basis,</hi> the predominant element, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ingredient in all teaching: the divine Scripture must bee the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19301:9"/>
bracelet and frontlet of a Priest, in his hand and in his head, this must close his eyes at night, &amp; awake his thoughts in the morning; that hee may be eloquent and mighty in the Scriptures, like <hi>Apollos, Act.</hi> 18. 24. And repeat as much <hi>verbatim,</hi> if possible, as blinde <hi>John</hi> the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian could in <hi>Eusebius</hi> History, <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. Yet to spoile the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of their ornaments, and dresse up the Tabernacle: to shave and pare the captive woman, and then espouse her: to brandish <hi>Goliah's</hi> sword against the Giant himselfe, was alwayes thought lawfull and laudable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Romanist will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate<note place="margin">3.</note> and restraine this text to the infallibility of their sole Bishop. His salt of manners may be infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but his light of doctrine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obscured. His feet may slip, but his lips cannot erre. What, a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19301:10"/>
man, and infallible? Yes, sayes the Canonist, pronouncing in his chaire. Why what vertue doth his chaire adde to his knowledge? Yes, sayes <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> For now Gods providence attends that hee shall not be rash or deceiving. A bold Fancy, to arrogate more to their Pope, Then <hi>Moses</hi> in his Chaire, or any Prophet, Then Saint <hi>Peter</hi> his predecessor, or Christ himself upon the earth did ever challenge, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To be believed upon his bare word: And a great Fondnesse, To transubstantiate A common Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition into a particular prophecie; A Priest in generall into their <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Prelate; and a Manifest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as <hi>Ribera</hi> confesses, into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of infallible knowledge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Injunction is too often, and easily broken, as the next Verse shews. But just as the Iewish Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue vaunted, <hi>The Law shall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:19301:10"/>
               <hi>from the Priest, Ier.</hi> 18. 18. when they resolved in the same Verse, Not to give heed to any of Gods words: So the flattering Canonists and Parasites then cried up most the Popes unerring judgement, when they did least search the Scriptures, and most abuse the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World with new-coin'd Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, But my doctrine suffers<note place="margin">4</note> more by Practice, then Opinion: When Sacerdotall ignorance as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends the Cathedrall Pulpit; And becomes a great dishonour to the God of Knowledge, A Soul-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the hunger-starved children, <hi>Lament.</hi> 4. 4. And a curse to their own labours; <hi>Toyling all night,</hi> in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; <hi>and taking nothing, as it was, Luk.</hi> 5. 5. Nothing indeed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the wages of <hi>Balaam,</hi> of whom the <hi>Iews</hi> speak in a By-word <hi>The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell coveting Hornes, lost his Eares;</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:19301:11"/>
And <hi>Balaam</hi> loving Hire, of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen-eyed Seer, <hi>Num.</hi> 24. 3. becomes a false South-sayer, <hi>Ios.</hi> 13. 22. So these Mercenary Levites (for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly slothfull ignorance is joyned with busie worldlinesse) seeking themselves most and outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, doe most lose themselves and their native indowments. In this case, you may heare the Lord complayning; <hi>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge;</hi> And then see the Priest degraded, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was not instructed, As <hi>Crates</hi> struck the Master for the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes errour: <hi>Because thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no Priest to me, Hos.</hi> 4. 6. In this case, The Prophets turn Satyrists, <hi>Isai.</hi> 29. 56. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 13. <hi>Hos.</hi> 9. <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. <hi>calling them, Blinde Seers, Drow sie Watchmen; Dumbe Dogges,</hi> of no use to warne the Flocke, or

Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> out-cry, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>And who is suffieient for these things?</hi> For shall the benefit of Printing be revealed, and shall the growth of Learning be decayed?

Shall wee have so many incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from our Prince and Bishops, and shall wee confiscate all by an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ignorance in teaching? So I passe from his <hi>Concio ad Clerum,</hi> to his <hi>Homily ad populum:</hi> when the Priest is throughly qualified, hee may be safely consulted; <hi>And they should seeke the Law at his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The peoples generall duty is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized<note place="margin">2.</note> in three termes. First, <hi>How? They should seeke.</hi> Secondly, <hi>What? The Law.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Where? At the Priests mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:19301:14"/>First, they should seeke it; not lazy in their house, not drowsie in Gods house; but with earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and outward diligence they should search it and pursue after it. They must not only learn the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall precepts of the Law, for the <hi>Israelite</hi> was also bound to catechize his Family at home: nor only come to the publick lection of it in their solemne Assemblies; for (as some think) Synagogues began to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected before the second Temple: But they must continually inquire of it in all doubtfull cases of private actions with customary carefulnesse &amp; pious alacrity. As <hi>Ahab</hi> &amp; <hi>Obadiah</hi> parted the Land, to search for grasse and water in the great drought, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18. As <hi>Ismael</hi> lay gasping for drinke, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.

So they should seeke it with the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> woman, <hi>Sir, Give us this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>

For as Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> wrote to our King <hi>Ethelbert, How shall God heare the Priest praying to him for you, if yee will not heare him speaking from God to you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>They should seeke the</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.</note> 
               <hi>Law.</hi> By the <hi>Law</hi> is directly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, The <hi>Codex</hi> of all <hi>Mosaic all</hi> Ordinances contained in the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch;</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:19301:15"/>
but largely taken, the whole Word of God, as the rule of well and happy living, or all divine Truth necessary for mans salvation. The Priest must have universall knowledge, but the people must seeke substantiall law: the Orbe of his comprehension may be larger then the Spheare of their capacitie. <hi>The Law:</hi> not Cobweb subtleties, not pleasing super fluities, not scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous fancies; but the necessary rules of holinesse and righteousnes: And that awfull Doctrine, which was once proclaimed to the World from the top of <hi>Sinai</hi> with black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and thunders and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Him,</p>
            <q>—Cujus excussum manu Utraeque <hi>Phoebi</hi> sentiunt fulmen domus.</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:19301:15"/>
               <hi>That Law,</hi> which should make both their eares, not itch, but tingle; and pierce between the joynts and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; while the Sword of the Spirit in the mouth of the Priest, sacrifices the soule, and executes judgement upon the conscience by a secret freeingor condemning them, in a modell of Gods owne Tribunall, and the last Assises.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>the Law,</hi> which he speaks, not which hee makes, of which hee is the Lawyer, not the Law-giver. <hi>One is our Rabbi and Master. Math.</hi> 23 <hi>And there is but one Law-giver, who is able to save, and to destroy, Iam.</hi> 4. 12. It is a <hi>Depositum,</hi> intrusted to thee, not invented by thee: which thou hast received, not conceived: a matter not of wit, but doctrine: in which thou art not the auhour but the keeper; as <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> runs upon it in descant.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>the Law;</hi> here admire the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19301:16"/>
order and wisdome of divine Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy, God made his will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by Apparitions and inspired Prophets untill the Law was given: Then as the written Word increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, Miracles and Visions decreased, and at the Captivity <hi>Urim and Thummim</hi> ceased: and now our <hi>Malachi</hi> being to close up the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets also, there remained only this sole office of the Priest to teach the Law: Here then hee tels the people what they must trust to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sai.</hi> 8. <hi>To the Law and to the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> and plainly warnes them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Remember the Law of Moses:</hi> For ye must looke for no more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Prophets, Dreames, or Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; till that great Prophet come, ushered by another <hi>Malachie, Iohn Baptist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>They should seeke the Law</hi>
               <note place="margin">3</note> 
               <hi>at his mouth:</hi> not at a Counsellours mouth to undoe their neighbours
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19301:16"/>
by litigious suites; but at a Priests mouth to save their owne soules by religious duties. To consult the Divine before the Atturney, would end many unchristian controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies; at least it would make us know orderly, what case and cause that is which cannot be regulated by Scripture. It is no praise for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; self-taught, as Saint <hi>Austine</hi> reports of <hi>Antony</hi> the Monke, lest they truly use Saint <hi>Ieromes</hi> word, <hi>Nullum praevium se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens pessimum magistrum memetip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum habeo,</hi> having no leading In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structor, I was to my selfe the worst Schoolmaster: But he must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, taught of God, inwardly by his Spirit, outwardly by his Priest. The Priests mouth is the Lords ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the peoples speaking Law: <hi>Os justi, fons vitae. Prov.</hi> 10. In pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and private matters their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science must be directed by his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and though <hi>Plutarch</hi> so much discommend <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a mouth without a locke or a doore, to let out words, and keep in secrets; yet this mouth is best, when it stands wide open to all the Parish.</p>
            <p>But these three Rivelets fall into one channell, and generall doctrine; <hi>viz. Lay persons with all readinesse should be ruled by the Priest in matters of Religion.</hi> They must not expect visions and heavenly voices, broach Dreames and fained Prophecies; dreame of new Inspirations and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasmes; or challenge the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall spirit of interpretation. They may repeat and ruminate, examine and apply; but not expound the text, much lesse adde any new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in their Conclave or Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. <hi>Interrogate Sacerdotes legem,</hi> as the Lord himselfe gives example, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 11. In a point of law put the case to the Priest: else they keep but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19301:17"/>
a conventicle without either Ephod or Levite, and in stead of obeying the Lord in his Officer at the doore of the Tabernacle, they worship a private god <hi>Lar</hi> in their Halls and Parlours.</p>
            <p>Again, as the Laity is here bound to depend on the Priest for the Law, so the Priest is limited to answere by the Law; which strictly taken as the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> was nationall and temporary; but as it involved the Law of God, expounded amply by the Prophets, finished compleatly by Christ, it is a rule eternall and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall; no wisdome of Senators, no tradition of Romanists, no inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Anabaptists, no invention of men or Angels, being able to adde any point necessary to mans salvation. For it were presumption, to coine a new doctrine since the Sonne of his bosome in these last times hath revealed the whole will of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19301:18"/>
his Father; to looke for better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile, since the wisdome of God hath directed; to speak a new speech since the Word it selfe hath declared; to talke of late revelations, since the Messias hath sealed up Vision and Prophecie: or to adde one word af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Him, who is <hi>Amen;</hi> or one letter after him, who is <hi>Omega.</hi> It remaines then, that the Priest with solid knowledge immediately teach the divine Law; and that the people with humble piety immediatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the Divine Officer, who is <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quester dei &amp; hominum,</hi> sayes Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> their mouth to God, and Gods mouth to them: that so the sacred Scripture may be cleerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, Uniformity maintained, Schisme and Heresie banished, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion increased, Discipline resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the people edified, the Priest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, Gods Law magnified, and God himselfe glorified.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:19301:18"/>Here I am to passe like <hi>Ionathan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Use.</note> betweene two sharpe Rocks, <hi>Bozez, and Seneh,</hi> rightly to bound out, the Priests authority and the peoples spirituall obedience: for there hath been ebbng &amp; flowing, &amp; a mutuall incrochment. First, the Romanist will yeeld to his Prelate absolute submission of conscience, without examination or appeale. Secondly, the Anti-romanist will obey his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor no further then he speaks appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Word of God. Thus too servile or too sawcie, they will be either his fellow or his slave: betweene these two extremes, Truth is the meane proportionall. For it were senselesse to conceive, that by this Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Ordinance, either God should depart from any originall Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or his Word should lose any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall dignity; or that a prime power authenticall were setled in the

Prelate: For (to omit usuall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons) this were to accuse God of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient revelation, to make the Canon variable and subordinate, to exalt a man above divine Law to the danger of an Oecumenicall defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Againe, it were as senslesse and more contradicting my text to maintaine that the people may diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Prelate in spirituall matters, except they plainly know them to bee true; since their knowledge is derived by the Priesthood, as the only ordinary meanes; to which they are bound, except they plainly know the contrary; And the Priest contradict himselfe or the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points of the Law. If him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe might directly binde the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science by his rules, why is <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and Gods <hi>Law</hi> here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to direct him? If they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and judge of the Law, why
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19301:19"/>
are they sent to his Mouth, and not to the Booke it selfe; and so by a more compendious and infallible way, they might have wanted a Priesthood? If the Priest shall be obeyed onely upon expresse warrant of Law already knowne, hee is not their Teacher but Remembrancer, they obey not the person but the Law or their own judgement; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Prophet binds them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the whole regiment of their souls in publick and private, to their living law and Gods lawfull Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>For that the same intensive and conscionable obedience is not due to the Ecclesiasticall as well as to the Civill Magistrate; and to the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall as well as to the Leviticall Priest seemes very improbable: <hi>Let every Soule be subject unto the higher powers. Rom.</hi> 13. 1. And <hi>Obey them</hi>

Wheras now proud Libertines have turned Ghostly Father into Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaker; and the bodie of ancient Discipline is cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged like <hi>Sibyll,</hi> or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho into a meer voice; &amp; the profane vulgar, if a shoo leak, or a wall crack, or an Ague shake, know what trade to resort unto: but let the conscience shake with doubt before the fact, and quake for feare after the fact; let the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19301:20"/>
soule be mortally sick for want of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; let a sinful leprosie require daily direction, and our Saviour to maintain Sacerdotall authority bid them, <hi>Go shew your selvs to the Priests, Luk.</hi> 17. 14. Yet they will venter their lives, their eternall lives, and die in their sinnes; and we may burn all the Casuists, as having no use of that soveraigne Divinity. Dearely beloved, wee are falne into happy times, when nothing doth trouble the conscience of men, or men make conscience of nothing, which is most to be feared. Thus having vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified the power of Priesthood and Christs Episcopall Crosier (as his regal Scepter) in the laws Divine &amp; Ecclesiasticall, in the Sacraments and Sacramentals, as Confirmation, Confession, Penance, Orders, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Visitation, and particular Absolution: We then fondly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19301:21"/>
at the profanenesse of the times, and marvell that preaching does no more good; as if the Flock could be fed, cured, and governed only by the Shepheards Whistle. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer can easily contemne the power of the Pulpit, and divert what is thrown at that distance: For if we teach with authority, it is proud and stately: if reprehend sharply, it is spleen and malice: if instruct meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is not powerfull: if admonish lovingly, why not others? If they like the man indeed, they give him leave to say what hee list, and take leave to doe what they list; but if they like not the man, what they understand they despise; what they understand not, they censure; And with the Donatists in Saint <hi>Austine, quod volumus, sanctum est;</hi> It is not holy doctrine till they approve it.</p>
            <p>The two Duties thus several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, are againe natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19301:21"/>
concorporated, and so affoord us many points and questions incident to the Times, and pertinent to my Text. As, whether the Priest or Clergy may erre in doctrine, &amp; how this may be avoided? Whether Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates according to the Law may make Orders binding the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Whether Clergie-men may not meddle in Civill Iustice, if the Law heere containes the Judiciall part, as well as the Ceremoniall? Whether reading of the Law bee not preaching; and whether preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, be not a publicke declaring of Gods will by persons authorized in due time and place, either <hi>verbatim,</hi> or paraphrastically, or at the most by way of explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and application directly? Not but that other discourses of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may serve for the stall, or the deske, on some extraordinary As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19301:22"/>
What is that eternall Law, without knowledge of which none can be saved? Whether the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> is abolished, or established, or partly altered, and how farre by Christ? Whether Christ hath not delegated as much spirituall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Evangelicall, as <hi>Moses</hi> did to the <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Priesthood? Then by deduction, whether the English Church by her Constitutions hath not sufficiently provided for the salvation of every Parish, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently of every person in the Parish? That so the envy of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence in Priest and Parishioner; The curiosity and partiality of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Word; The fancie of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the meanes of Grace; The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of setled Christians; The giddinesse of unsetled Sectaries; The discouraging conceit of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility in common people, ofe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19301:22"/>
fully knowing the truth and their duties, may be taken away: and obedient livers onely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted religious professours. But I dare not looke upon these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies: I onely observe, there must bee in GODS Church, an order of Priest and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of Clergy and Laitie, of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing, for the perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Religion, for the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Saints, and finishing the Kingdome of Grace: but this point also I dare not prosecute, for the time would faile mee; though a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine most excellent, both in the story and the uses. So I passe from the two Duties, to his perswasive Reason, wrapt up in a short descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Priest, <hi>For hee is the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hosts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I but, <hi>Hee is the Angell,</hi> rather<note place="margin">3.</note> sayes the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and so say, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19301:23"/>
Greek and Latine, <hi>R. Salomon, Junius, Luther,</hi> and the <hi>Spanish,</hi> and hee alludes to his own name, <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> thinkes: At least, he is the Ambassadour, as some modern Translations: But our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> runs low and flat. For though the word, <hi>Malâc,</hi> may largely signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all, yet to speake fitly, a private man sends Messengers, a Prince Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, the Messias Apostles, and the Lord of Heaven Angels. Gods <hi>Nuntioes</hi> are Angels, either celestiall, as <hi>Gabriel, Luk.</hi> 1. 26. Or terrestriall, and then either extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Prophets, as <hi>Iohn Baptist, Mal.</hi> 3. 1. Or usually and ordinary, as the Priest here. Neither is this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony denied him in either Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>An Angell came up from Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Judg.</hi> 2. 1. that is, <hi>Phineas</hi> the Priest, say the <hi>Iews: say not before the Angell, Eccles.</hi> 5. 6. that is, the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19301:23"/>
judging High Priest, say Expositors: <hi>A woman must be covered in the Church 1. Cor.</hi> 11. 10. Because of the Angels, that is, the teaching Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters say <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Drusius:</hi> And <hi>the Angels of the seven Churches, Revel.</hi> 1. 20. are Bishops, say we: or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Superintendents, say they, who cannot pronounce that <hi>Shibbó<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. Dionysius de coelesti Hierarchia, cap.</hi> 12. will give a Reason of this promiscuous naming: An Angell being the lowest order of the Nine in the Church triumphant, and a Priest being the highest order of the seven in the Church militant; They symbolize in nature, and have their names counterchanged: To shew the unity of one totall Church in Heaven and Earth under Christ: <hi>He is called a ministring spirit,</hi> this a spirituall Minister: Hee a celestiall Priest, this a terrestriall Angell: By
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19301:24"/>
a like <hi>Metathesis,</hi> as <hi>John Baptist</hi> is called <hi>Malachi, Chap.</hi> 3. 17. To shew the harmonious transition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of both Testaments. They are those Angels upon <hi>Iacobs</hi> Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ascending by prayer, descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by doctrine: And as in old time, so still, the glory of the Lord appeares from between the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims in the likenesse of winged An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p>Or if they be Ambassadours and Messengers, they are sent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the LORD of Hosts, about a peace betweene God the Father and sinfull Mankind; and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Marriage betweene his Sonne Christ, and the Church of Saints: <hi>Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray yes in Christs stead, beye reconciled to God, 2. Cor. 5. 20. For we are jealous over you with godly</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:19301:24"/>
               <hi>jealousie, For wee have espoused you to one Husband, that we may present you a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, as a chast Virgin to Christ, 2. Cor. 11. 2. Ephes.</hi> 5. 27. But I come to the use of this Description, for it reflects upon the duty of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>First, it teaches the Priest humble<note place="margin">1.</note> Modestie in undertaking this mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. To imitate rather <hi>Moses, I am slow of speech,</hi> or <hi>Ieremy, I am a child, I cannot speake:</hi> Then forward <hi>Ahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maaz, Let me run I pray.</hi> To such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie Novices, <hi>Iohn Pecham</hi> sometime Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> applyes that of <hi>David, 2. Sam. 10. 5. Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te in Jericho donec crescat barba ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra:</hi> And others most fitly that of our Saviour, <hi>Luke 24. 49. Sedete in Ierusalem, quoadusque induamini virtute ex alto.</hi> For what purity? what gravity? what science? what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19301:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prudence? what composed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared elocution may be justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of an Angell? And <hi>how shall they preach, except they be sent? Rom.</hi> 10. sent, first by God secretly exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, then by the Church law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ordaining them, then by their conscience plainly assuring them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it teaches him carefull<note place="margin">2.</note> fidelity in reporting this message. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did signifie a holy Scribe by the Hieroglyphicke of a <hi>Sive;</hi> and wee know Him, whose <hi>Fan</hi> is in his hand, to be the great Sheepheard and Bishop of soules: both are separating instruments, and denote that spirituall discretion, which is the soule of all judgement. That hee neither trust to his owne wit or invention too boldly, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his memory, or nimble tongue too sodainly, nor vent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe too hastily; lest hee speake his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19301:25"/>
own rude words, and not the Lords message. <hi>Here the word at my mouth, and then give them warning from me. Is the tenour of Gods Commission, Ezech.</hi> 3. 17. That hee neither augment, nor diminish, nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, nor confound, nor misplace, the substantiall parts of divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation: But can truly say with the Prophets, <hi>Heare yee the Word of the Lord;</hi> &amp; with S. <hi>Paul, I received of the Lord, what I delivered unto you.</hi> For the Angels are thought to speak no more on earth, then what they heard in Heaven: and the same is well expressed by <hi>Homer,</hi> when he makes the Angels dispatched from his Gods, to receive and to declare the same things by the same lines: Nor is this a needlesse Tautologie, but a most observant veracitie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it teaches him bold<note place="margin">3.</note> magnanimity in discharging this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19301:26"/>
message. I know not how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathe better courage into a Priest then by representing unto him the solemnity of his Ordination. When the Bishop laid his hands upon thy Head; Remember, thou art set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and separated from all common and profane businesses. When thou heardest, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, thou art elevated above this wicked world, and indued with a heavenly power. When thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, <hi>Whose sinnes thou dost forgive, they are forgiven;</hi> O then remember, Thou retain not thy own sins, who art to loose the sins of others. When thou tookest the Bible, with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to preach the Word, and to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the holy Sacraments; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy Commission was sealed in the Court of Heaven, and thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched a messenger from the Lord of Hosts. Be not then flattered or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19301:26"/>
terrified to please the sinfull multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and to abuse thy Masters trust. Keepe thy Angelicall state, retaine the habit and language of thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Citie, conforme not thy selfe to their base vices, and vicious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.</p>
            <q>—<hi>Mitte ostia,</hi> Caesar, <hi>Mitte, sed in magnâ legatum quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re popinâ:</hi>
            </q>
            <p>If they hate thee for this Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and strangenesse, know they hated God and Christ first: <hi>If yee were of the World, the World would love his owne,</hi> as our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces upon his own experience: <hi>But now yee are not of this World,</hi> but yee descend like Angels and heavenly Legates into this lower World; and returning home, yee must expect a reward of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19301:27"/>
sending, not of those forreine and mundane Nations to whom yee are sent: <hi>For yee are the messengers of the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, this description looks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so back upon the people, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did upon <hi>Peter:</hi> And teaches them, First spirituall obedience.<note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your selves, Heb.</hi> 13. If soveraigne Magistrates be Gods, <hi>I have said, yee are gods:</hi> I am sure, consecrated Priests may be counted Angels: And there is a majesticall and more then humane splendor in both Offices, and a dutifull submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion due to the dictates of both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> proviso had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ground, then some may at the first imagine; to reject an Angell from Heaven preaching against his Gospel, <hi>Galat.</hi> 1. For if they will not beleeve one Angel, why should
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19301:27"/>
they beleeve another? If not a <hi>Paul,</hi> why a <hi>Gabriel?</hi> Hast thou then any matter of faith to be resolved, any case of conscience to be cleered, any temptation to be disabled, any suite in heaven to be ended, any petition to Christ to be preferred, any soule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>businesse? Why, <hi>Levies</hi> curse is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the peoples blessing, <hi>Divide them in</hi> Jacob, <hi>and scatter them in Israel, Genes.</hi> 49. God hath his <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sores</hi> and Legier-ambassadours in every Parish: Repaire to thy law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pastor; what he bindes and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with the golden Zone of Christ, what hee shuts and opens with the key of <hi>David,</hi> shall be ratified in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it teaches them respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">2.</note> reverence, <hi>Let the Presbyters that rule well be counted worthy of double honour,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. The Lord could as easily have sent you
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19301:28"/>
true Angels, but hee was pleased in mercy to teach men by men: Yet that his Ministers shold not lose any due respect, the Angels themselves are joyn'd in commission, and attend upon our divine Liturgie. When Christ the Angell of the Covenant began to preach, the Angels came and plaid <hi>the Deacons, Math.</hi> 4. <hi>Send men to Ioppa, and call for</hi> Simon, says an Angell to Cornelius <hi>Acts</hi> 10. As preferring Saint <hi>Peter</hi> before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in this businesse of conversion. And the Angell confesses, that hee was <hi>but a fellow-servant with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel, Revelat.</hi> 22. And indeed the word Evangelist, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses him to be a good Angell. Let then the majesty of his Master, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the defects of his person; let the Law and Message which hee brings, beare out the blemishes of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And let both perswade thee, to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19301:28"/>
give him a loving and heartie wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. If <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> had knowne them to be Angels in the shape of men, they wold (if possible) have given lower obeysance, and higher titles, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> was not so proud and furious, but he would with curtesie salute these Messengers in the very style of our Prophet, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Nor were the <hi>Galatians</hi> so rude &amp; barbarous, though so taxed by Saint <hi>Ierome;</hi> but they received the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Saint <hi>Paul, as an Angell of God, Nay, even as Christ Iesus himselfe. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It teaches them liberall<note place="margin">3.</note> beneficence. Beside their appointed portions by the Lawes of God and Man; If wee did truly love the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how kindly would wee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain his servants? How <hi>Michah</hi> rejoyces, when hee had got a Levite
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19301:29"/>
into his house, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17. How the old man of <hi>Gibeah</hi> bestirres himself, to lodge and feast a Levite, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 19. <hi>Take heed to thy self, that thou forsake not the Levite, as long as thou livest, Deut.</hi> 12. 19. Much more take heed, that thou <hi>Feare the Lord, and honour the Priest, Ecclus</hi> 7. 31. But, <hi>O how beautifull upon the mountains are the feet</hi> of Evangelicall Messengers, cryes the true Church: If their feet be so beautifull, how glorious are their bodies drest up in Sacerdotall ornaments? Let then prophane <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,</hi> and Sacrilegious Hypocrites scoffe at their name, person, office, and attire; Let them send Gods Messengers upon their base errands, place them below their Serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, esteeme them below their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasites; nay, deride and abuse, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute &amp; destroy them for their mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage: But let them know, if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb facs="tcp:19301:29"/>
of Legates hath been so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and bloudily revenged; as the law of Nations, and the Records of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story do fully testifie: If foolish <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nun</hi> lost his Crown, and the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> their lives for misusing <hi>Davids</hi> servants, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. If the King in the Parable sent forth his Armies, &amp; destroyed them, who slue his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters inviting to the Mariage of his Sonne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>Then heare a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous noyse of the Kingdomes of Nations gathered together: The Lord of Hosts mustereth the host of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, Esa.</hi> 13. And will revenge the great indignities done to many of his Messengers: Especially when they bring you good tydings of great joy, a Gospell of peace, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, a promise of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting salvation.</p>
            <p>In one word, let the Priest be as an Angell of God in knowing good
<pb facs="tcp:19301:30"/>
and evill: Let the people piously seeke the <hi>Law</hi> of him, as an Angell sent from God: So shall both Priest and people become <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, like the Angels in purity of holinesse, in perfection of happinesse, in pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall singing that <hi>Trisagium,</hi> Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabaoth; Heaven and Earth are full of the majesty of thy Glory; to whom the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost, bee all power and prayse <hi>Amen.</hi>
