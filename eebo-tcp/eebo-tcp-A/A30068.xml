            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Author</hi> of this little Book having been one, with whom I had an intimate Acquaintance, and ſtrict Friendſhip, for many Years: And he having, upon his dying Bed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the <hi>Copy</hi> to my Peruſal and Care: I hold my ſelf the more concern'd to give the World this ſhort Account of both <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>It.</hi>

               <p>By the Date, it appears to have been written many Years ago: Which may raiſe Inquiry, Why it was not publiſhed ſooner, or in the Author's life-time.

                  <q>That he had read of many, in former days, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſome, in his own time, who had made fair progreſs in the Way of Truth, and had ſaid, done and ſuffered much on behalf of it; who yet had not held out to the end: But, through a too great Security, or Self-confidence, and for want of a continual Subjection to the Power of God (in and by which alone Strength and Preſervation is to be found) have, by the violent Aſſaults, or ſubtle Inſinuations, and myſterious Workings, of the Enemy, been drawn back again under the Power of Satan, to the Invalidating (at leaſt, in the
<pb facs="tcp:45215:5"/>
Eye of the World) the Teſtimonies ſuch had before given to the Sufficiency of the Power of God. And that 'He, having by others Miſcarriages learnt to beware, had, from a Godly Jealouſie over himſelf, ſuſpended the Publication, of the following Sheets, until he could with greater Confidence, and more full Aſſurance, ſay, with the holy Apoſtle (when the time of his departure was at hand, <hi>2 Tim. 4.6.)

               <hi>Mary Baker</hi>'s TESTIMONY Concerning her Husband.</head>
            <p>WE read in the holy Scriptures, that when Jeſus went into the Temple of God, and caſt out the Buyers and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers (the many things that had taken up the room there) and healed the Blind and the Lame, that came to him, the little Children, crying in the Temple, ſaid, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David.</hi> At which the Chief Prieſts and Scribes were ſore diſpleaſed, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Heareſt thou what theſe ſay?</hi> To whom he anſwered, <hi>Yea; have ye never read, Out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings thou haſt perfected praiſe,</hi> Mat. 21.</p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>Power,</hi> which ſo affected the Hearts of thoſe <hi>Little Ones,</hi> to make them cry <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> did affect the Author of this little Book, when he was but a <hi>Little One,</hi> in a Spiritual Senſe, newly delivered out
<pb facs="tcp:45215:6"/>
of the Power of Darkneſs, and brought into ſubjection to the Power of God. The feeling of the <hi>cleanſing Operation</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in his Heart, conſtrained him to bear his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to it, as in this little Treatiſe may be ſeen. Which is now publiſhed, that Generations yet unborn may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited thereby to bow to the <hi>ſame Power,</hi> and to admire the Excellency and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, which he did Experience in the Morning of his Day, when it was writ.</p>
            <p>And as the Sun of Righteouſneſs did ariſe higher and higher in his Heart, by the Light, and comfortable Warmth of the ſame was he guided, and ſtrengthened to go on, in the Spiritual Journey, from one ſtep to another, till his Mouth was opened, by the ſame Power, to bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, in the Aſſemblies of the Lord's People, and to call and invite Others to retire inward, that they alſo might come to Experience the Work of this <hi>divine Power</hi> in their own Hearts: And that ſuch as were come thereunto might watch and wait for the ſtirring and ariſing of this mighty Power, in its further Strength and Glory, which is able to overcome all other Powers, both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45215:7"/>In his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> he was <hi>Zealous,</hi> becauſe his Heart was zealouſly affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. And when any, who profeſt to know the Work of this heavenly Power, turned from, and acted againſt it, his Concern was great for ſuch; labouring to bring them to a ſenſe of their Evil, if by any means they might be recovered: Which, to many, proved effectual.</p>
            <p>His Service in the Church of Chriſt (eſpecially amongſt the Meetings, both Monthly and Quarterly, to which more particularly he belonged) hath a living Remembrance in the Hearts of many Members thereof: And the ſenſe of his abſence hath deeply affected the Spirits of ſome of them.</p>
            <p>His Love was to all the Sons and Daughters of Men: But eſpecially to the Flock and Family of God, the Witneſſes of this Power of Jeſus, their Saviour; amongſt whom his Heart was open, and his Life went freely forth. In their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe was his delight, and he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſay, The Friendſhips and Converſe of the World was a great Hurt to Friends, and drew their Minds too much out: Which thing he kept clear of. And tho' he had Dealings and Concerns in the World, as well as others, yet was always watchful againſt the Spirit of the World, which leads from God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45215:7"/>In the latter part of this good Man's days, it was my Lot to come into ſo near a Relation to him, as to be his Wife; who was a very kind, tender and open-hearted Husband to me: By which means I had the Opportunity to have a Relation of the Courſe of his Life. And he hath oft-times expreſt, how the ſame Power, which (in the following Sheets) he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted at the beginning, had carried him through all Exerciſes, which were not a few. When he had Goods taken from him, for his Teſtimony to the Truth, he has ſaid, that the inward Joy he felt, in that he was <hi>counted worthy to Suffer</hi> for the Truth he profeſt, was beyond what he could ſpeak. And having been a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, with other Friends, for the Truth's ſake, about the ſpace of Two Years, he took delight to ſpeak of that time, often mentioning, how mightily the Lord was with them, and how good a time it was. He would ſay many times, If Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did but know the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> they would not live in the Earth as they did. But (ſaid he) nothing but God's <hi>Spirit</hi> can mortifie the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> And oft would he mention that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die: But if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:45215:8"/>
he would ſay, He had felt the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Work of it, beyond what he could have thought; and that over that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his greateſt Beſetment was, he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a perfect Conqueſt. For which he offered the Thankſgiving and Praiſe to God's Everlaſting Power, who not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begins the Work of Redemption, but is able to carry it on, and finiſh it, to the perfecting of his own Praiſe, which he accepts out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings, Little Ones; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages me thus to appear, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of this little Book, that it may go forth for the Incouragement of all the Weary, and ſuch as are heavy-laden with the Burden of their Iniquity, that they may come to find reſt to their Souls, as this faithful Witneſs did. Who, when he lay on his dying Bed, was kept <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>living</hi> in his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Senſes, and had a ſutable Word to every one's State that came to him; and would often clap his Hand on his Breaſt, and ſay, <hi>All is well here.</hi> The day before he departed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Friends viſiting him, he ſpake ſenſibly to all, and, in great Expreſſion of Love, took his leave of them. And taking his leave of a Child, who wept, he ſaid, <hi>Do not Cry: I am well; my Peace is made with the Lord. If thou Cry, Cry that Iniquity may
<pb facs="tcp:45215:8"/>
be brought down, and Righteouſneſs brought up. The Power and Strength of God is with me. I am going the Way of all Fleſh. I am going before; and others muſt follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So he laid down his Life in the feeling of <hi>that Power,</hi> which at the beginning of his day he bore Witneſs to. Which I here mention for the comfort of thoſe, who are <hi>kept</hi> by it, <hi>through Faith, unto Salvation</hi>; and for the Inviting Others to come, to feel the Work of the ſame: VVhich I felt to be my Stay and Strength, in the parting with ſo near and dear a Relation.</p>
            <p>And as the Children in the Temple cried <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> ſo the Multitude of the Diſciples alſo did <hi>Rejoyce</hi> (when Jeſus came riding on the Aſſes Colt, bringing that into Subjection which before had been at Liberty) ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord: Peace in Heaven, and Glory in the Higheſt,</hi> Luke 19.38. For which ſome of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> would have had him rebuke his Diſciples, ver. 39. To whom he anſwered, <hi>If theſe ſhould hold their Peace, the Stones would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Cry out.</hi> ver. 40. Which cauſes me thus to caſt in my <hi>Mite,</hi> to the Praiſe of him that lives for ever: Who told his Followers, <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:45215:9"/>
live alſo,</hi> John 14.19. Who is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Beginner and Finiſher of the Work of Faith, by his own Power, which this his faithful Servant was a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of. Concerning whom I was preſſed in Spirit to write this ſhort Teſtimony, without which I could not be clear in the ſight of the Lord.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Power of God</hi> Known to be Greater than the Power of Satan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT hath been the Deſign, and ſtill is, of the Enemy of Man's Salvation, to make Men believe they are ſerving God, whilſt they are <hi>actually</hi> ſerving the Devil. And he hath ſo far prevailed with many, that they call <hi>Evil, Good,</hi> and <hi>Good, Evil</hi>; and put <hi>Light</hi> for <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> for <hi>Light.</hi> And being thus blinded by the God of this World, he hath raiſed and fitted them to ſtand up as <hi>Advocates</hi> for his Power: And ſo bold and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent have ſome of them been in their Maſter's Service, that they have in Effect ſaid, Who is able to make War with him, and overcome him? As if his Power were the greater, and his Dominion over all. Now ſeeing he hath ſo far prevailed upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45215:10"/>
many at this Day, as to make them plead, There is <hi>No Perfection here; No Freedom from Sin on this ſide of the Grave:</hi> And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of his <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> do ſtand up ſo boldly, on behalf of their God; I was moved with an Holy Zeal from the Lord, to ſtand up on behalf of my God. And I do here proclaim, that <hi>Greater is my God,</hi> the God of Truth, <hi>than the God of the World</hi>: And his Power is more able to redeem out of Sin, and to preſerve from Sin, than the Enemie's Power is to keep in Sin, or to lead into Sin. And becauſe I have had Experience, in my Meaſure, of the working and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both Powers in me, I do here give my Teſtimony, that <hi>The Power of God is the greateſt.</hi> And, Reader, for thy fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satisfaction, I have freedom to ſet forth, in ſome meaſure, the working of the Enemy in me, until he was caſt out.</p>
            <p>While I was a Child, I had often ſecret deſires raiſed in me after the Lord: But not knowing from whence they came, nor yeilding obedience to that which raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, they ſoon decayed and died. Then the Enemy ſought to get room and entertainment in me: And the Enemy tempted and enſnared me, with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſome Evil, which the Witneſs of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45215:10"/>
God in me, made manifeſt unto me, and reproved in me for it, but by yielding to the Enemy, the Witneſs was quench'd, but I joyning with the Enemy in the Temptation, and continuing in the Evil, diſregarded the Witneſs, and cauſed it to withdraw at that time. But ſoon after it did ariſe again, and condemned me for the Sin I was guilty of, and began to take away that Peace and Delight which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had therein, and told me, <hi>There is no Peace to the Wicked.</hi> Then being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Mind, that I had offended the Lord, the Enemy ſtep'd in to give me a falſe eaſe, and perverting the Scriptures, he ſaid, <hi>God is merciful to a Sinner, at what time ſoever he repents</hi>; And <hi>If we confeſsour Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us:</hi> But he never brought in the following Words, [<hi>And to cleanſe from all Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>] and ſo he led me into a large <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Words,</hi> which I then called <hi>Prayer:</hi> and I could make large <hi>Confeſſions</hi> in Words, and ſo got again into a falſe Reſt and Peace, and committed Sin with delight. But many times, after the committing of it, the Light of Chriſt in me did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and condemn me, that I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Puniſhment upon my Body, for the Sin of my Soul. Then would I ſeek to <hi>heal my Self</hi> with that which I called
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45215:11"/>
my <hi>Prayers,</hi> and with making many large <hi>Confeſſions</hi> without <hi>forſaking.</hi> But while I was in this State, this was brought to my remembrance, <hi>viz.</hi> That I had read of a King of <hi>France,</hi> who uſed, when he had ſworn an Oath, to Kiſs his <hi>Crucifix</hi>; and then <hi>Sware</hi> again, and <hi>Kiſs</hi> it again. And my Condition was repreſented to me to be no better then his (which I concluded was had enough: For I was convinced Swearing was bad, and had always a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of it.) This brake my Peace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, ſo that I could not go on with that Delight I had done before.</p>
            <p>But the Enemy had ſtill ſomthing at hand, to uphold his Kingdom in me, and he brought theſe carnal Reaſonings into my Mind, that moſt People, who knew me, look'd upon me to be a <hi>Sober Man</hi>; and that this was but a ſmall <hi>Sin,</hi> and was no ſcandal to me, nor was it any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or Incouragement to others to Sin: for it was known to none but my ſelf. And that I muſt not expect to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin: For, ſaid he, We do not read in the Scriptures, of any that ever did. Thus he added more Weight to that Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which my poor Soul was weary of before; and all my ſeemingly Religious performances could not eaſe my wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience, being cloſly purſued by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45215:11"/>
the Witneſs of God in me. But not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a true Knowledge of that which did reprove me, and ſo not turning at the Reproof, I did daily yield to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Temptations, and was led Captive by him at his will. And ſo cuſtomary and habitual it was become to me, that I then thought, I could as well have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without Meat or Drink, as without yielding thereunto. So with Pleaſure and Delight I went on longer in the Devil's Service, tho not without <hi>Secret Reprovings</hi> in me. But having heard ſome of the World's Prieſts ſay, ſuch Condemnations proceeded from the Devil, I was ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enſnared. But now I know them to be Lyars that have ſaid ſo; and I te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, there is ſomething of God <hi>in all Men,</hi> which, at one time or other, doth reprove and condemn them for their Sins, in order to recover them out of them. For <hi>the Lord hath not left himſelf without a Witneſs in all Men,</hi> that thereby they might believe, and by believing might come to obtain the Salvation of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls; which my Soul deſired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And tho' the Enemy had ſaid, that none of the Holy Men, who writ the holy Scriptures, were free from Sin: Yet the Witneſs of God ſaid, <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and thou ſhalt not fulfill the Luſt of the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.16.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45215:12"/>Then did the Enemy bring more Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to hold me ſtill under his Power, and by perverting thoſe Scriptures, he raiſed up his ſeeming-religious Props in me, thereby to ſupport his Kingdom, as he doth in many at this day, who make a great Profeſſion in Words, and talk much of God, as I then could do; but did not know him, any more than they do now. For <hi>the natural Man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not the things of God:</hi> It is truly ſo, tho' Men pleaſe themſelves with their own <hi>vain</hi> thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſuggeſted to my Mind, That <hi>the Juſt Man Sins ſeven times a day</hi>; which I then took to be Scripture: But ſince I came to read the Scriptures, in that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by which they were written, I find it is not Scripture, but a <hi>miſ-repreſenting</hi> of that Scripture <hi>(Prov.</hi> 24.16.) which ſaith, <hi>A Juſt Man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth up again, but the Wicked ſhall fall into Miſcheif.</hi> Which falling of a <hi>Juſt Man,</hi> ſome of the better ſort, even of the Prieſts themſelves, have interpreted to be, not a falling into Sin, but a <hi>falling into Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He perverted that Scripture, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we ſay that we have no Sin,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45215:12"/>
we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He urged that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>When he would do Good, Evil was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him, and how to perform that which was Good, he found not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He alledged that <hi>All Men have their Failings,</hi> and <hi>the beſt of Men their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> as may be read in the Scriptures; inſtancing <hi>David,</hi> and others. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of theſe Scriptures, I may well call <hi>Satan's Props,</hi> for he propped up his Kingdom in me a great while by them, and ſo begat me into the World's belief. That there is <hi>No Perfection here, no Freedom from Sin to be expected on this ſide the Grave</hi>: And then I began to <hi>make merry over the Witneſs</hi> of God in my ſelf. But the Lord did not leave me there, but in tender compaſſion viſited me, and his holy Witneſs began to ariſe again in me and to ſtrike at thoſe Props which the Enemy had ſet up in me. And this holy Witneſs ſaid, that unleſs <hi>I was regenerated and born again, I could not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Then I began to ſee, there was <hi>nothing but Purity and Holineſs could ſtand before the Lord</hi>: For all things are naked and bare before him. And then I cried out for a <hi>Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> one that could <hi>redeem</hi> me from that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45215:13"/>
which was too great a Burden for me to bear; as one once ſaid, <hi>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> Prov. 18.14. But I could then ſee no way of Deliverance; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceedingly troubled, I went from <hi>Mountain</hi> to <hi>Hill,</hi> from hearing this ſort of People, to the other: But among them all, there was none did ſpeak Peace to my weary Soul; nor could, unleſs I could have had Peace in my Sins, which I could not. For all of them cryed out, <hi>No Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Sin on this ſide of the Grave.</hi> But I felt a neceſſity for it, elſe I could not injoy Peace with the Lord; which made me ſtill <hi>cry out for a Deliverer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this great diſtreſs, being turned with my Face Sion-ward, and inquiring the way thether, I was at length (through the abundant Goodneſs of the Lord, who led me) inclined to go to a Meeting of the People called Quakers, where I did hear a Servant of the Lord declare, that That which reproveth and condemneth a Man, in himſelf, for Sin, and will not let him go on in Sin without reproof, is the Light of Chriſt, who is the <hi>Light of the World, which enlightneth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> that all Men through him might believe, and ſo come to be ſaved from Sin. And that this Light, which doth convince of Sin, Obedience
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45215:13"/>
being yielded to it, will redeem out of Sin, and preſerve and keep from Sin. And I having a Witneſs for God in me, it did teſtifie to the Truth of what was declared; and I was then by it convinced, that That was the Way of God, and Thoſe were the People of God.</p>
            <p>But I thought I ſaw a <hi>Lion</hi> in the Way, and that there was a great Croſs to be taken up: Yet I found, if I could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that, which was ſo great a Burden to me, I could be contented to undergo a great deal. From that time forward, I ſtill kept to the Meetings of the People of the Lord, who are at this time diſtinguiſh'd by the Name Quakers, as the People of the Lord were in Ages paſt called Chriſtians. Which Name is now given to <hi>Drunkards</hi> and <hi>Swearers,</hi> and all manner of <hi>prophane Perſons,</hi> and by the Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> one to another; ſo that the Name <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is become a reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that are called <hi>Heathens,</hi> through the Blaſphemy of thoſe, that have covered themſelves with the Name <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but do not live the Chriſtian Life.</p>
            <p>Now keeping to the Meetings of the Lord's People, I did there hear many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, teſtifying to the Power of the Lord, what it had wrought for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in this Age, and likewiſe what he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45215:14"/>
do for all thoſe who are faithful and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, in this day of his Power; Yet ſtill Sin remained in me, and that was my great Weight and Burden.</p>
            <p>But now, knowing where Strength and Power was, a <hi>Secret Hope</hi> wat raiſed up in me, and a <hi>Belief,</hi> that <hi>All things are poſſible with the Lord.</hi> So I committed my Self and Cauſe to the Lord, having had Experience, that my own Strength was altogether in-ſufficient: For, when the Judgments of the Lord have been upon me, I have often made large Promiſes in my own will, that I would reſiſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy when he came; but I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevail by my own ſtrength, or any thing ſet up in my own will, while that was ſtanding.</p>
            <p>But now, having liſted my ſelf under an another Commander, my <hi>old Maſter</hi> was enraged, and comes with his uſual Boldneſs and Confidence, to demand En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; and being denied, he makes uſe of his former Weapons, but was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and driven back by the Power of the Lord; Glory be unto his holy Name for ever.</p>
            <p>For I keeping (or rather, being kept) to that, which did make it manifeſt to me to be Sin, it furniſhed me with this Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon againſt him, viz. <hi>Walk in the Spirit,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45215:14"/>
and thou ſhalt not fulfill the Luſt of the Fleſh.</hi> And ſo the Enemy was chaſed away, by the Spirit of the Lord, who had lifted up a <hi>Standard,</hi> in me, againſt him. And he being thus put to flight, there did ariſe Joy unutterable in my Soul, feeling the work of the Lord begun in me. And ſo continuing faithful and obedient to the Lord, he hath, by his mighty Power, redeemed me from that, which once I did believe I could never be redeemed from. Praiſes, Praiſes be given unto the <hi>Omnipotent</hi> God, who reigns for ever. For that which formerly was ſo <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>delightful</hi> to me, and was as my Meat and Drink, is now become <hi>hateful</hi> and <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> in my thoughts; Glory be to the Lord for ever, whoſe Mercy is over all his works, and is not to be forgotten by thoſe that have taſted of it.</p>
            <p>Yet the Enemy would not leave me ſo; but going up and down, like a roaring <hi>Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> he comes and preſents his Temptations again, though the main Pillar of his Kingdom was broken down in me. So now he goes another way to work, and ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me the difficulty and ſtraitneſs of the <hi>Way</hi> I was to walk in: For my neareſt and deareſt Relations would be great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to me, and would ſlight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45215:15"/>
me, whereas before, I was well beloved and eſteemed by, and amongſt, them, and they were ready and willing to do me what kindneſs they could. And if I would now turn fool at laſt, and diſoblige my Friends, and ſo leave my Wife and Children to the Mercy of the World, who would pity me! For <hi>he that takes not care for his Family, is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> And (ſaid the Enemy) if thou wert of any other Religion, but a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, thy Relations would be contented; but that is the moſt <hi>contemptible</hi> Religion in the World, and <hi>laden with Reproaches.</hi> O ſee the <hi>Deceit</hi> of the wicked Enemy, and avoid it, as I did, by keeping to the Meaſure of the Grace of God in my ſelf. And as my mind was turned inward, to conſider and ſee what the Lord had done for me, this ſprang up in me, as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the Enemy, <hi>If I have not done thoſe mighty works for thee, which no other could do, believe me not, elſe believe me for my works ſake.</hi> Then did the Enemy vaniſh at the <hi>Brightneſs</hi> of the coming of the Lord, who hath preſerved me out of the Mouth of the <hi>Lion,</hi> and out of the Paw of the <hi>Bear,</hi> and out of the hand of that uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> that once had encompaſſed me about; Praiſes be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the Lord for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:45215:15"/>O <hi>Friend!</hi> Let me beſeech thee, let not the Enemy of thy Soul deceive thee, under what pretence ſoever, though he ſhould <hi>guild</hi> his <hi>Bait,</hi> and <hi>cover</hi> his <hi>Temptations</hi> over with never ſo many Scripture-words; But keep thou to that <hi>true Light</hi> in thee, which <hi>makes all things manifeſt.</hi> And by taking heed to that pure Witneſs of God in thee, thou wilt come to ſee Satan's Devices, which they of Old, who were led by the Spirit of God, were not ignorant of; as ſuch now are not.</p>
            <p>And now I have this Teſtimony to bear for the Lord, with many Thouſands more, That <hi>Perfection,</hi> or <hi>Freedom from Sin, is to be obtained on this ſide the Grave, through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And I do Teſtifie and Declare, That <hi>in this Life</hi> is the time of working out our <hi>Salvation</hi>: For, <hi>where the Tree falls, there it ſhall lie</hi>; and in what State <hi>Death</hi> leaves a Man, in that State <hi>Judgment</hi> will find him: For, <hi>in the Grave there is no Repentance.</hi> Now true <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> through a godly Sorrow, is a <hi>Change</hi> from Sin and Iniquity, to ſerve the <hi>Living God</hi> in the <hi>New Life,</hi> or in the <hi>Newneſs of Life</hi>: Not in the <hi>Oldneſs</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> which too many are found in at this day; but in the <hi>Newneſs</hi> of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> For, <hi>it is the Spirit that giveth Life; the Fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> John 6.63.</p>

               <hi>Reader,</hi> If thou are a ſtranger to Truth, and to the right Way of the Lord, and haſt been led <hi>Captive</hi> by the <hi>Enemy</hi> at his Will (as I was, while ignorant of the <hi>Light</hi> of the Lord in me) and art now come to a ſenſe of the Burden and Weight of thy Sins, and haſt a deſire to be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed</hi> from them: To thee, and for thy ſake chiefly, are theſe Lines written, that thou mayſt here ſee the <hi>Myſterious Working</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and take Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in time, whilſt the Spirit of the Lord ſtrives with thee: For the <hi>Spirit of the Lord will not always ſtrive with Man.</hi> But be not diſcouraged at the Greatneſs or Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thy Sins: For <hi>all Power in Heaven and in Earth is given to Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Only <hi>Faith</hi> in him, and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to what he makes manifeſt is thee, is re-required of thee. And if thou haſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Sin, thou ſhalt ſee them, in the <hi>Faith,</hi> to vaniſh away: For it is <hi>The Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and the Obedient ſhall eat the good of the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if thou are one that has known, in any meaſure, the Work of the Lord car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in thy Heart, I have this further to ſay, for thy Incouragement, from my own Experience, That thou haſt to do with a <hi>Tender-hearted Father,</hi> who gently leads thoſe that are but young in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45215:16"/>
Truth, and his Lambs he will carry in his Arms, and will lead thee no faſter than thou art able to follow. But be ſure, whatever he maketh manifeſt to thee to be Evil, Give up to the Lord in Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Obedience, and <hi>the Lord will give thee Power over it.</hi> For the End, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord doth manifeſt Sin to be Sin, is, that he may Redeem out of it. And as thou are faithful in the <hi>ſmall</hi> thing, thou wilt be made <hi>Ruler over more.</hi> And as thou ſtandeſt in that Faith, which is the Gift of God, thou wilt find nothing too hard or difficult for thee; but thou wilt be able to ſay (as the Servants of God did in Days paſt, and do now in this Age) <hi>All things are poſſible with him, with whom we have to do.</hi> And thou wilt feel the ſame Power to work, and beget the ſame Faith in thee, as it did in them: For <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> whatever Men may pretend to in words. There are many Pretenders in our day, to the Worſhip and Service of God, as there were in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges paſt: But what avail their Pretences, or Performances, while they are fain to confeſs, their Worſhip ends in <hi>Imperfection,</hi> and that their beſt Duties are Sin; or they Sin in performing their beſt Duties; Sin in Praying, Sin in Preaching, Sin mixt with their moſt holy Duties. That it is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45215:17"/>
ſo with them I do not deny: But my Heart is grieved at their Captivity, Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and Miſery, becauſe they believe it never can be otherwiſe: And, indeed it never will be otherwiſe with them, ſo long as they content themſelves, with large Confeſſions of their Sins, and come not to forſake them. Would they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves, that the time paſt is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that they have wrought the Will of the Gentiles, there would be ſome ground to hope, that they were as willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Sins, as to confeſs them; and ſo might come to have Faith in the Gift of God, with whom all things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; which thing many have formally in words acknowledged, who in works have denied it. But I teſtifie, If they, who make ſuch large Confeſſions of their Sins, do not come to that Gift of God in them, which can enable them to forſake their Sins, their Condition is no better than his, who <hi>knew his Maſter's Will, and did it not</hi>; who was to be <hi>beaten with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stripes.</hi> For the Lord hath made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his Unerring Way, and he is daily calling and inviting the Sons and Daughters of Men to walk therein, and to be reconciled unto him, that they may know their Sin blotted out. For the Lord hath no delight in the Death of a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45215:17"/>
Sinner (of which I am an Inſtance and a Witneſs) but is willing that all ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Return, and come to the Knowledge of his Truth and be ſaved. For he hath not Ordained Men to Reprobation, ſo that they cannot be ſaved: Neither hath he ſo abſolutely Elected a certain Number of Perſons to Salvation, that what Evil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they do, they cannot miſs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as many do falſly believe. Which dangerous Doctrines have, on the one hand, thrown many down to the Bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit of Deſpair: And on the other hand, raiſed too many up into a Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Security. <hi>Reader,</hi> my deſire is, that thou wouldſt come to the Witneſs of God in thy ſelf, that thou mayſt ſee and learn the Myſtery of theſe things. For the Grace of God, which hath ſo manifeſtly appeared in this our day, hath brought mighty things to paſs, which many will not believe, though it hath been often declared. It hath wrought the ſame Works now, as it did in the Apoſtles days, in teaching <hi>to deny Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts</hi>; and alſo <hi>to live Soberly, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly and Godly in this preſent World,</hi> Tit. 2.12. And there be many Witneſſes, that have been raiſed from the Dead (or out of the Spiritual Death) who do declare of it; who were once dead in Treſpaſſes and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45215:18"/>
Sins: But the Goodneſs of the Lord hath led them to Repentance, and raiſed them to Life. Now the Reaſon why many will not believe, is, becauſe they love their Evil Deeds: Therefore they hate the Light, and will not bring their Deeds to it, leſt by it they ſhould be Reproved. <hi>For this is the Condemnation, That Light is come into the World, and Men love Darkneſs rather than Light</hi>; and ſuch have ignorantly called the Light, Darkneſs: But <hi>they that love the Light,</hi> and know what it is, they do <hi>bring their Deeds to it, that they may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God,</hi> John 3.19, 20, 21. For the Light makes all things manifeſt; yea, the hidden things of <hi>Eſau</hi> are made manifeſt by the Light. My Advice and Counſel to thee is, in the Fear of the Lord, Bring thy Deeds to the Light, if ever thou intendeſt, or deſireſt, to be Everlaſtingly Happy. Let not the Enemy of thy Soul deceive thee any longer: For it is better to <hi>Suffer Affliction with the People of God, than to injoy the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sin, which are but for a ſeaſon</hi>; though they be never ſo much applauded by the Sons and Daughters of Men. <hi>Such as Men ſow, they muſt reap: They that ſow to the Fleſh, muſt of the Fleſh reap Corruption; and they that ſow to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Life Everlaſting,</hi> Gal. 6.7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:45215:18"/>Conſider well thoſe words, ye Proud and Haughty Ones, and be no longer joyned to the Spirit of this World: For the Lord God hath a Controverſie againſt it. And he hath determined the Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal of the Man of Sin; which many have witneſſed already fulfilled in themſelves: And the Lord is now fitting and preparing them for himſelf. For it is not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's right to rule in Man: But it is the Lord's right alone to rule there, and he will have no Sharers with him in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Let none put the Day of the Lord afar off; for this is the Day of the Lord: And unleſs thou knoweſt him to rule in thee now, who alone can deſtroy the Devil and his Works, thy believing he ſhall rule hereafter (if Satan continues to rule in thee here) will ſtand thee in little ſtead; fot that Belief will not purifie thy Heart, and it is only <hi>the pure in Heart that can ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5.8. Heb. 12.14. <hi>For Chriſt Jeſus was made manifeſt for this very End, that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil,</hi> 1 John 3.8. And although the Men of this World have ſet themſelves in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt this Truth of the Lord, and have pleaded for the Continuance of Sin, and therein for the Devil's Power; yet we know in whom we have believed,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45215:19"/>
and in the Light of the Lord they are ſeen, and their Fruits have made manifeſt whoſe Servants they are: <hi>For his Servants they are to whom they obey, whether of Sin unto Death, or of Obedience unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 6.16. And tho' many of them have promiſed (or others have promiſed for them) to forſake the Devil and all his Works, and to keep God's Holy Will and Commandments all the days of their lives; yet they are ready to cry out Blaſphemy, when they are told, <hi>Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit Sin,</hi> tho' they are the plain words of Scripture, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. So Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are they for their Maſter's intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou art one, who hath been taught for Doctrine Mens Precepts, as too many now are, let me perſwade thee to come to the Witneſs of God in thee, and try which is the beſt Teacher. For that Inward Teacher teacheth ſafe and ſure, neither can it be removed into a Corner: <hi>And if thou turn'ſt to the right hand, or to the left, thou ſhalt hear a Word behind thee</hi> (from this Inward Teacher) <hi>ſaying, This is the Way, walk in it,</hi> Iſa. 30.21. This is the plain Man's Path, wherein (though a Fool in the Worlds eſteem) he <hi>ſhall not err,</hi> Iſa. 35.8. What tho' the Lord leads his People in a way, contrary to the Wiſdom of the World, which makes them the Scorn and Deriſion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45215:19"/>
of the World! Be not diſcouraged; for how can it be otherwiſe, it being <hi>the ſame way</hi> which the holy Men of God walked in, in Ages paſt? But our Rejoycing is this, <hi>The Teſtimony of a good Conſcience:</hi> And we do know (as God's faithful Servants did of old) The <hi>Reproaches</hi> for Chriſt are <hi>greater Riches</hi> than any there are in <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Land; which is a <hi>Place of Darkneſs.</hi> But we have known the Lord to Redeem us out of that <hi>Bondage</hi> and deep <hi>Captivity</hi>; and now we can ſing <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings</hi> unto our God, who is over all, both in Heaven and in Earth, bleſſed for ever and for evermore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friendly Reader,</hi> I have here, out of Love and Good Will to thee, and to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, declared unto thee <hi>the Goodneſs of the Lord</hi> unto my poor Soul, that thou mayſt be incouraged <hi>to walk in the Light of the Lord,</hi> which he hath made manifeſt in this our day: For it concerns thee moſt to know the Lord's Work <hi>in thy day,</hi> that thou mayſt have a ſenſe of the Operation of the Power of God <hi>on thy Heart,</hi> before thou goeſt hence. O let not the Enemy of thy Soul prevail with thee, to plead for the continuance of Sin term of Life. Did Men but know how they do thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Kingdom of the Enemy of their Souls, they never more would open their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45215:20"/>
Mouths on Sins behalf, unleſs they are like thoſe of old, who ſaid, <hi>We have made a Covenant with Death, and with Hell are we at an Agreement,</hi> Iſa. 28.15. For they who deny <hi>Perfection,</hi> or <hi>Freedom from Sin,</hi> deny the very End and Purpoſe for which <hi>Chriſt</hi> came, and was manifeſted in the Fleſh, which was, <hi>to deſtroy the Works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> 1 John 3.8. which all, who profeſs Chriſtianity, do agree, is <hi>Sin.</hi> And his Name was <hi>therefore</hi> called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe <hi>He ſhould ſave his People from their Sins,</hi> Mat. 1.21. Not <hi>In</hi> their Sins; mark that, thou Unbelieving Profeſſor. Why ſhould this be thought Impoſſible, ſeeing <hi>All things are poſſible with God,</hi> Mat. 19.26? It was the Command of the Lord to <hi>Abraham, Walk before me, and be thou perfect,</hi> Gen. 17.1. And to incourage him thereunto, he brings it in with theſe words [<hi>I am the Almighty God.</hi>] The holy Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.16. And <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phil. 4.13. And <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.14. Such cannot plead for Sin, becauſe they have <hi>Fellowſhip one with another</hi> in the Light, and <hi>the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth them from all Sin,</hi> 1 John 1.7. From whence then doſt thou think the <hi>Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45215:20"/>
do ariſe? (for ſome have ignorantly ſaid, It is <hi>Impoſtble</hi> ever to be Perfect, or Free from Sin, on this ſide the Grave) If thou canſt not tell (as ſome Tender-hearted Ones could not) I will tell thee, It is <hi>from the Man of Sin, who rules in the Hearts of the Children of Diſobedience:</hi> From him proceeds theſe Thoughts of <hi>Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> and not from the Lord.</p>
            <p>And now, let the Witneſs of God in thee judge between the <hi>Precious</hi> and the <hi>Vile</hi>; between thoſe who ſerve the Lord, and them who ſerve him not. For a <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> there muſt be; the Lord will no longer be <hi>mocked</hi> with an <hi>Hypocritical</hi> Pretence of Zeal for him, while the <hi>Devil</hi> hath the <hi>Heart.</hi> They that pretend the Scripture is their only Rule, why will they not come to it, and walk according to it, that we might ſee their Fruits to be agreeable thereunto? They have made uſe of the Scriptures to plead for Sin term of Life, and have raked up the Failings of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men of God recorded in them, thereby incouraging others to Sin, which never was the End they were written for: But they were given that Men might come to be <hi>Perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good Works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.17. And it was the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Apoſtles, to <hi>preſent every Man Perfect in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Col. 1.28. The Holy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45215:21"/>
Scriptures were not written for Men to make a <hi>Trade</hi> of, as in <hi>Buying</hi> and <hi>Selling</hi> the Words of the Holy Men of God, who <hi>ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>as the Spirit gave them Utterance:</hi> No, but that Men might come to the <hi>ſame Word</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which they teſtifie of. And if thou, <hi>Reader,</hi> comeſt to that, thou wilt come to know the <hi>Word of God, which lives and abides for ever:</hi> And then the Scriptures will be indeed precious to thee, as thou comeſt to ſee the fulfilling of them in thy ſelf; and ſo thou wilt have Unity with that Spirit which gave them forth: And the right End for which they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thou wilt ſee; which they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, who go from the true Light, the Holy Witneſs in themſelves. The want of keeping to <hi>that,</hi> makes them run into ſo many <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Heaps</hi> of <hi>Confuſion</hi> as they are; one calling <hi>This</hi> the Way, another ſaying <hi>That</hi> is the Way: So that Mankind is <hi>out of Order,</hi> by refuſing to be led by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> which would bring all things <hi>into Order</hi> again. And was it not ſo in the Apoſtles days? Did not <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and the Multitude, make an Uproar, though the <hi>moſt part knew not wherefore they came together?</hi> But they all agreed to cry up, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians! For by this Craft</hi> (ſaid <hi>Demetrius)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45215:21"/>
we have our Wealth.</hi> And is it not the ſame in effect now, tho' they have got more Plauſible Words to cover themſelves withal, that they might not be diſcovered. Do not both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People</hi> cry out now, Great is the Devil's Power! Great is the Strength of Sin! So great, that <hi>it is Impoſſible to be ſet free from Sin on this ſide the Grave?</hi> And hath not the World ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the <hi>Whore,</hi> becauſe ſhe hath had a <hi>golden Cup</hi> in her hand, by which ſhe hath deceived, and doth deceive the Nations? O that Men would be ſo wiſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to come to that which would open an Eye in them to ſee the Enemy of their Souls, and would help them to work againſt him, before <hi>the Night comes, wherein none can work!</hi> For it is the <hi>Light</hi> that <hi>makes</hi> things <hi>manifeſt,</hi> and by that Light thou mayſt ſee the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Iniquity</hi> ſtill working, under the pretence of <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God (as Men call them) but they will not come to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom God hath <hi>Ordained</hi> to be a <hi>Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of his People Iſrael,</hi> Luke 2.32. But as <hi>Backſliding Iſrael</hi> made to themſelves a <hi>Golden Calf</hi> in old time: So theſe will needs have ſomething that may appear glorious to their <hi>fleſhly Eye,</hi> which many in their <hi>Imaginations</hi> have made and ſet up, and ſo are worſhipping
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45215:22"/>
the Works of their own <hi>Inventions,</hi> as they of old did the Works of their own <hi>Hands.</hi> For whatſoever Man forms, and ſets up between Chriſt and his Soul, is an <hi>Idol,</hi> and muſt be broken down, before <hi>Redemption</hi> can be truly witneſſed. But are there not many now a-days, who perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are Redeemed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> from their Sins, whilſt they <hi>live in their Sins?</hi> O! what an unheard of Redemption was this in the Apoſtles days! He ſaid, <hi>When ye were the Servants of Sin, ye were free from Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 6.20. And, <hi>What Fruit</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>had ye then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed,</hi> ver. 21? That was not the Redemption which Chriſt Jeſus came to purchaſe for his People: But <hi>to purifie to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works</hi>; and <hi>to redeem them from all Iniquity,</hi> Tit. 2.14. That <hi>they might ſerve him in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Righteouſneſs, all the days of their lives,</hi> Luke 1.75. This was the End or Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Redeeming Power of the Lord in Ages paſt. And I give my Teſtimony for God, it is the ſame now in this Age, and works the ſame Effect, even to <hi>redeem from all Sin.</hi> Let the <hi>Enemy,</hi> and his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,</hi> be never ſo much inraged at us, for bearing Teſtimony to the Truth, we matter not; for we are <hi>Witneſſes for God</hi> againſt them all, and have <hi>boldneſs,</hi> in

the <hi>Strength</hi> of the Lord, to Publiſh to the World the <hi>Greatneſs of the Power of our God,</hi> and <hi>of his Chriſt,</hi> who hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that <hi>Sin and Iniquity ſhall have an end, and Everlaſting Righteouſneſs ſhall be brought in,</hi> Dan. 9.24. Which is believed, and waited for, by the <hi>Upright in Heart,</hi> who have turned their Faces <hi>Zion</hi>-ward.

            <p>And <hi>friendly Reader,</hi> If thou deſireſt to die the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Righteous,</hi> and to have thy latter End to be like his (which moſt Men do) thou muſt live the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Righteous:</hi> For there is not another way that is certain. What, though Men have cut out Ways to themſelves, and have made large and pleſant Paths to walk in; and ſay, Come, walk in our Way, or be of our Society; for it is the Way of the Lord. Before thou ventureſt into it, ask them this Queſtion, <hi>Have you found out a Way to overcome Sin?</hi> If they anſwer, <hi>No</hi>; that cannot be expected on this ſide the

Grave: Then I teſtifie, It is <hi>not the Way of the Lord</hi>; neither art thou to walk in it. But thou art to walk in <hi>the Light of the Lamb,</hi> which <hi>all the Nations of them that are ſaved, ſhall walk in,</hi> Rev. 21.24. <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and Gladneſs for the Upright in Heart,</hi> Pſalm 97.11. And <hi>the Lord will keep him in perfect Peace, whoſe Mind is ſtay'd upon him.</hi> Which words are often ſpoken by the <hi>Hireling Prieſts</hi>; but the thing can never be experimentally Witneſſed by thee, till thou comeſt to give up thy ſelf wholly to be led by the Lord: Which if thou do, then will the Lord take delight in thee, to do thee good, and hard things ſhall be made eaſie to thee. And as thou abideſt in the Faith, thou wilt ſee over all the Ways of the World, and the Foundations whereon they ſtand, and thou wilt ſee cauſe for ever to Praiſe the Lord, for that he hath redeemed thee out of thoſe Paths that <hi>lead to the Chambers of Death,</hi> and hath built thee upon the <hi>ſure Foundation,</hi> which cannot be ſhaken, the <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Ages,</hi> and of many <hi>Generations,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, the chief <hi>Corner-Stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had I the Tongue of Men and Angels, I could not demonſtrate unto thee, in words, the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in walking in the Way of the Lord: For <hi>in his Preſence there is fulneſs of Joy,

and at his right hand are Pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Iſa. 16.11. O, Come away, come away, for the Lord's ſake, and thy poor Soul's ſake; and <hi>partake not with the Wicked in their Sins, leſt thou receive of their Plagues,</hi> Rev. 18.4. Let not a little <hi>momentary Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> beguile thee into <hi>Eternal Miſery.</hi> The Lord having redeemed me out of the hands of my Soul's Enemy, I am moved with the Bowels of Pity and Compaſſion, to beſeech thee to come and <hi>be reconciled to the Lord:</hi> For I teſtifie, he is more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive thee, than thou art to come: Why then wilt thou not come, that thou mayſt be Everlaſtingly Happy? For the Door of Mercy is ſet open, ſo that all that will come, may come freely, <hi>without Money,</hi> or <hi>without Price,</hi> Iſa. 55.1.
