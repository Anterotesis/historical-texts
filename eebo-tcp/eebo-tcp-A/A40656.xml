         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Know then three Eſſentials did
conſtitute a Centurion. 1. He muſt be a
<hi>Souldier.</hi> 2. The Captain of an hundred
men (whence his name Centurion.) 3. He
muſt be a Gentile by extraction. For at
this time the Rom. Emperor had took the
Militia out of the hands of the Jewes, who
politiquely would not truſt that peeviſh

                  <p>2. Now it is generally complained of
<hi>Souldiers,</hi> that they are cruell, and (<hi>Luke</hi>
3. 4.) too prone to <hi>do violence.</hi> It is charged
on <hi>Officers,</hi> that they are <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>inſolent</hi>
in improving their places, and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are
accuſed of <hi>ignorance</hi> towards God, and
wickedneſſe in their converſations. All
which obſervations are croſſed in the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi>

                  <p>3. Inſtead of taking away, and invading
the Propriety of others, He, ver. 2. parted
with what was his own in much almes to
the poore. Inſtead of being proud to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others, in much humility he mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
himſelf with faſting (<hi>v.</hi> 30.) Inſtead
of being guilty of Ignorance and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
he feared God with all his houſe.
Let none hereafter envy this <hi>Centurion</hi> the

ruling over a <hi>hundred,</hi> ſeeing he was a man
of a <hi>thouſand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Let not any look on the Military

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65677:6"/>
not conceive the principles of fearing of
God, and fighting with Men ſo oppoſite,
that they cannot meet in the ſame perſon.
Seeing on enquiry it will appeare, that all

either <hi>good</hi> men, or leſſe bad than many of

good, what needed S. <hi>Peter</hi> to be ſent to
him for his further converſion? What

of a <hi>Jewiſh Proſelyte:</hi> he looked

for him to receive; <hi>Peter</hi> is ſent to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65677:7"/>
inform of <hi>Chriſt come,</hi> and to clear his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
into a diſtinct ſaith.</p>
                  <p>7. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
him in his Sermon with the perſon
and practiſes of our Saviour, though cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the <hi>breviate</hi> onely, and <hi>chief heads,</hi>
and not all his diſcourſe at large, is opened
by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and my text is a principall
part of our Chriſt his compleat character,
<hi>Who went about doing of good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Obſerve in the words, Firſt, Chriſts
Humility, <hi>He went</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, His Induſtry.—No ſmall
way, but <hi>About.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, His Charity. <hi>Doing of good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Humility, <hi>He went,</hi> and that <hi>pedes
ambulavit,</hi> he conſtantly <hi>footed</hi> it. Indeed
he was brought from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the place
of his Conception, to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where
he was born, in the womb of his Mother,
and when forced to <hi>flie</hi> before he could
<hi>go</hi>) into <hi>Egypt,</hi> probably was carried in
the armes of his parents, otherwiſe he
alwaies travailed on foot, one time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
when not ſo much out of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
as Myſterie, not ſo much to eaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65677:8"/>
as perform the propheticall predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He (<hi>Mat.</hi> 2.) rode alternately on the
Aſſe, and the Aſſe Colt, o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>herwiſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
(ſuch his humility) <hi>he went.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. Secondly, His Induſtry, <hi>About.</hi> But
here it will be demanded, whether this did
not ſomething treſpaſſe on our Saviours
gravity, and that ſtaidneſſe which he uſed
in other actions. Did not this ſavour
ſomething of an erratical and circumfra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
motion? Sure it was contrary to
the counſell he gave his Diſciples, <hi>Into
what town or city ye enter, there abide,</hi> Mat.
10. 11. <hi>Goe not from houſe to houſe,</hi> Luke
10. 2. Had not therefore our Saviour, in
like manner, better have fixed himſelfe in
one place, than thus to wander up and
down when he <hi>went about?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. I anſwer, three ſatisfactory reaſons
may be rendred of our Saviours frequent
removals, though the firſt ſo ſufficient in
its ſelf, it will give a diſcharge to the other
two, as added onely for Ornament, not
Neceſſity: 1. Therefore our Saviour went
about <hi>per force,</hi> becauſe he had no certain
habitation of his own, therein conſtantly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65677:8"/>
to <hi>recide,</hi> but was faine to make uſe of
the houſes of his friends therein to abide.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>The foxes have holes, and the
birds of the aire have neſts, but the ſon of
man hath not where to lay his head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. By the way let me beſpeak the
thankfulneſſe of many perſons (whom I
behold in this Auditory) to whom God
hath not onely given <hi>Agurs</hi> wiſh, <hi>Prov.</hi>
30. to be fed with food convenient for
them, but alſo ſo large eſtates, that they
have plenty of Places, exchange of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
variety of Habitations; How ought
ſuch to lay out their ſoules in thankfulneſs
to God! it faring in this point farre better
with them, than with our Saviour himſelf,
who for want of a dwelling, was fain to <hi>go
about.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. Secondly, Our Saviour went about,
ſo the better to decline and eſcape the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of thoſe who ſought after his life.
Any man can at a near diſtance hit a <hi>dead
mark,</hi> whilſt he muſt be a good <hi>marks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
indeed who can hit a <hi>flying Fowle.</hi>
Chriſt therefore was alwaies in motion,
that he might not give a ſteddy aim to his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65677:9"/>
enemy's malice. When <hi>Herod</hi> the Fox
deſigned his death in <hi>Galilee,</hi> then he took
his private progreſſe into <hi>Judea,</hi> and
when thoſe in <hi>Judea</hi> projected to murder
him, he made his ſecret return into <hi>Galilee,</hi>
or elſe retreated (<hi>John</hi> 11. 54.) to a City
called <hi>Ephraim,</hi> in the wilderneſſe, and
continued there.</p>
                  <p>13. He was unfit to be a Saviour of
mankinde, who would not by all pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
wayes be a Saver of himſelf. Though
he would not <hi>decline</hi> death when his hour
was come, he would not <hi>court</hi> it before
that time, he would <hi>lay</hi> his life down, not
<hi>throw</hi> it down, patiently <hi>give</hi> himſelf, not
wilfully <hi>cast</hi> himſelf away for mankinde.
Otherwiſe, if he had refuſed to embrace all
lawful wayes of ſelf-preſervation, untill
his appointed time was come, he had died
a Malefactor, not <hi>made</hi> by God a <hi>ſin</hi> for
us, but being a <hi>ſinner</hi> of himſelf, no better
than <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> guilty of his own deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>14. Thirdly, Chriſt went about, ſo the
more conveniently to diſperſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence
his doctrine and miracles, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65677:9"/>
the more people might enjoy the benefit
thereof. If the Sun ſhould alwaies ſtand
ſtill in one place, that part of the earth
would be <hi>fryed,</hi> and the reſt <hi>frozen,</hi> that
would be parched with heat, and the reſt
pinched with cold; wherefore the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Nature hath ſo ordered and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed
it, that the Sun ſhall take his circuit
through the Zodiack, that ſo his light and
heat may be communicated to the more
Countreys. Chriſt in like manner, that
Sun of Righteouſneſſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2. ariſing
with healing in his wings, made his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
through the <hi>twelve Signes,</hi> I mean the
twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ſo the more
places might participate of his Preſence,
Preaching, and Miracles.</p>
                  <p>14. Paſſe we now from his <hi>Humility</hi> to
his <hi>Charity, Went about doing of good,</hi> and
that in ſeveral conſiderations,
<list>
                        <item>in reſpect of
<list>
                              <item>All times.</item>
                              <item>All places.</item>
                              <item>All perſons.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>In endeavouring whereof may my weak
endeavours, and your intentions, as well
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65677:10"/>
as we may obſerve our Saviours motion,
and <hi>go about</hi> after him. <hi>Sequiturque Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem
non paſsibus aequis,</hi> and though in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
motions it matters not where we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
ſo be it we continue moving, till we
returne where we began; yet for methods
ſake we will firſt handle the firſt point, in
reſpect of all times.</p>
                  <p>16. Let us take notice of a Diurnall, or
daies work of our Saviour, He was no
large <hi>lier on bed,</hi> but a <hi>timely riſer</hi> about
his <hi>fathers work,</hi> John 8. 2. <hi>And early in
the morning he came again into the Temple.</hi>
As he roſe early, he went late to bed,
eſpecially on the Sabbath day, the day of
his greateſt imployment: for when he
had wearied himſelf all the day long with
preaching his Word, at night when his
work was ended, his work was new begun.
People then preſsing upon him afreſh
(forbidden before by the ſuperſtitious
Phariſees) to be healed by him. As he
roſe earely and went late to bed, ſo all the
day long was he buſied in doing of
good.</p>
                  <p>17. If any time of the day may ſeem to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65677:10"/>
be priviledged from Employment, and
exempted from Induſtry, ſure it is, the
<hi>time of Refection,</hi> when Men in midſt of
the <hi>Terme</hi> of all their worke, may and
muſt make a <hi>Vacation</hi> to themſelves, the
better to refreſh their hungry and weary
bodies therein. But even at thoſe
times, was <hi>Chriſt</hi> intentive in doing of
good. True it is, it was <hi>meat and drinke</hi>
unto him, to doe his Fathers work,
[<hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 32.] So zealous in proſecution
thereof, that ſometimes he faſted from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
food. <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 20. <hi>He could not ſo
much as eate bread,</hi> for the crowding of
the company about him; but when Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
was allowed him to take his repaſt,
he improved his time in doing good, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
his demeanour at the table of the
Phariſee, who invited him to dinner, as
<hi>Luke</hi> 14. where he received not ſo much
temporall food from the entertainer, as
he beſtowed Spirituall counſell upon
him, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>Then ſaid he alſo to them
that bad him,</hi> &amp;c. He put forth a parable
to them that were bidden, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. and
upon the occaſion of theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65677:11"/>
is he that ſhall eate bread in the Kingdome of
God,</hi> uttered by a fellow gueſt, he put
forth a moſt heavenly Parable.</p>
                  <p>18. One demanded how a Man might
make himſelfe welcome at a Feaſt? to
whom it was anſwered, <hi>ne ſis, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
come not thither without paying thy ſhot,</hi>
leſt otherwiſe he be beheld as a clogge,
or burden to the company. Another an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
much to the ſame effect, <hi>Sit not
there as a ſtone upon a ſtoole,</hi> that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
if not <hi>money,</hi> yet <hi>mirth</hi> to the
company, bring ſome ingratiating quality
with thee, that may make thee acceptable
to thy fellow gueſts. Sure I am our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was not indebted to the company
where he dined, bringing with him, though
no carnall mirth, which ends in ſadneſſe,
yet ſpiritual joy, contained in that holy
counſel which he ſo freely beſtowed.</p>
                  <p>19. Secondly, In reſpect of all places,
He did good whereſoever he came, at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi>
where he was conceived, <hi>Bethleem,</hi>
where he was born, <hi>Jordan,</hi> where he was
baptiſed, <hi>Galilee,</hi> where he converſed,
<hi>Getbſemani,</hi> where he was betrayed, <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batha,</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65677:11"/>
where he was condemned, <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatha,</hi>
where he was crucified, and
which was the more to their ſinne and
ſhame, ſuch places which did partake
<hi>most</hi> of his corporall preſence, did reap
the <hi>leſſe</hi> benefit by his ſpirituall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
witneſſe <hi>Bethſaida, Corazin,</hi> and
<hi>Capernaum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. Thirdly, In reſpect of all perſons,
1. to thoſe that were above him in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
reſpect, namely, to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his
Officers, not onely preaching of
Obedience, and payment of Tribute
to the Emperour, but alſo putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to the expence of a Miracle,
(<hi>Matthew.</hi> 17. 27.) rather than <hi>Caeſar</hi>
ſhould have his <hi>Toll-mony</hi> unpaid. 2. To
ſuch as were beneath him, as poorer
than himſelfe, becauſe not having ſo
good friends to relieve them. Thus
though he himſelfe held all that he had
in <hi>Frank-Almonage,</hi> and lived on the
<hi>poore mans box,</hi> beholden to the charity
of <hi>Joanna, Suſanna,</hi> and other his good
<hi>Benefactors</hi> for his Maintenance, yet
<hi>of a little, he gave a little,</hi> it being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65677:12"/>
his conſtant cuſtome (eſpecially about the
good time of the <hi>Paſſover</hi>) to diſpence his
almes to the poore. Otherwiſe when he
ſaid to <hi>Iudas</hi> (John 13. 27.) <hi>That thou doſt,
do quickly.</hi> The reſt of the Diſciples could
not ſo quickly have commented on his
words: that he deſired him, the <hi>bag-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi>
to give ſomething to the poore; had
not the ſame been conformable to Chriſts
common practiſe on ſuch occaſions, He
did good to thoſe about him, his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
to thoſe beſide him, the ordinary
Jews, to thoſe againſts them, the very Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſent to attach him, witneſſe curing of
<hi>Malchus</hi> his eare, ſtrucken off by <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. But I meet with a double objection
againſt Chriſt going about to do general
good; the one being a ſin of <hi>omiſsion,</hi> the
other of <hi>commiſsion,</hi> charged on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
I begin with the firſt, which thus
may be urged againſt him, He who hath
<hi>ability</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> to do right, and
omitteth the ſame, is guilty of doing
wrong, or the pretermitting of a benefit
in ſuch a caſe, is the committing of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.
Now our Saviour was ſolemnly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65677:12"/>
queſted and preſſed (<hi>Luke</hi> 12. 13.) to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
their Inheritance betwixt the two
brethren, &amp; yet he declined the doing of ſo
acceptable an office, and gave the Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
unto him in that kinde, a flat deniall.</p>
                  <p>22. I anſwer, Both perſons intereſted in
the Divident of the land, did not ſue unto
him, but ſo that it was onely a <hi>ſingle moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
not the <hi>joynt petition</hi> of both Brethren
intereſted therein. 2. Chriſt, a <hi>ſearcher of
hearts,</hi> might diſcover in him, who made
the motion, a <hi>covetous inclination,</hi> and
perchance a <hi>litigious diſpoſition,</hi> not to
ſtand to any agreement. Laſtly, and
chiefly, he had no calling to meddle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
being a private perſon, and captious
people <hi>lay at the catch</hi> on any ſhadow of a
fault to accuſe him, for invading the office
of a Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>23. It is confeſſed, it is an honourable
work to accommodate differences accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our Saviours own principles,
<hi>Bleſſed are the peacemakers,</hi> eſpecially to
compremize diſcord betwixt ſo neer rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as two Brethren. Hereby, haply,
our Saviour might have prevented long
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65677:13"/>
and tedious ſuits, ſaved them the expenſes
of a coſtly proſecution in Law, and which
was more, might have ſuppreſſed many
uncharitable Animoſities, and quenched
heart burnings betwixt them. But one
thing was wanting, A Commiſſion to
intermeddle therein, <hi>A good deed is an
ill deed, do by him who hath no calling to do
it,</hi> The <hi>Courts</hi> were open, and <hi>Judges</hi>
therein appointed, to <hi>heare and determine
Cauſes</hi> of this nature. They both, if ſo
diſpoſed, might ſue out what was equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to our <hi>writ</hi> of <hi>partition</hi> in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, to part the Inheritance in
equall portions betwixt them, whilſt our
Saviour juſtly refuſed to interpoſe in the
Controverſie, made a Mediatour betwixt
<hi>God and Man</hi> in matters of higher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
but not betwixt <hi>Man and
Man</hi> in things of temporall concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>24. Such therefore will find themſelves
much miſtaken, who having little <hi>ability,</hi>
and no <hi>authority,</hi> adventure on the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall
function</hi> to <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>baptize,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
they ſhall be <hi>juſtified</hi> and <hi>born</hi> out
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65677:13"/>
in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> by the integrity of
their <hi>intentions</hi> to employ their parts to
<hi>Gods</hi> glory, whereas more is requiſite to
the legitimation of a publique act, and
making it good, when done by a private
perſon, namely, a lawfull commiſſion to
doe it, for want whereof our Saviour ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
to intermeddle as a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi>
though, he went about doing of good.</p>
                  <p>25. And here, by the way, let me inſert
another caution: Our Saviours going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
from place to place, not fixed in a
certain ſtation, nothing favoureth or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendeth
the practice of ſuch, who refuſe
to reſide on <hi>Parochiall charge,</hi> but muſt
have a whole <hi>Province,</hi> or <hi>Principality</hi> for
the circuit of their <hi>plancticall preaching.</hi>
Theſe pretend to ſuch prodigious parts,
such <hi>Paramount gifts</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> above
the <hi>ſtandard</hi> of other men, (and we muſt
believe they have ſuch ſignall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<hi>for they ſay to themſelves,</hi> That they
conceive if pity ſuch <hi>Talents</hi> ſhould be
<hi>buried</hi> in one <hi>Pariſh,</hi> and ſuch ample abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
be ſtifled within the narrowneſſe of
one Cure: and hence it is, theſe <hi>ambulatory
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65677:14"/>
Preachers</hi> remove from place to place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to be ſetled in a certain habitation:
But it is to be feared theſe men go about,
ſowing of Schiſm, ſetting of Errors, and
ſpreading Faction, whilſt our <hi>Saviour</hi> went
about <hi>doing of good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. The next is a fault of <hi>commiſſion</hi>
charged on our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that he went not
alwaies about <hi>doing of good,</hi> by his owne
confeſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 34. <hi>Think not I am
come to ſend peace on earth; I came not to
ſend peace, but a ſword. For I am come to
ſet a man at variance againſt his father,</hi> &amp;c.
Now ſuch who come to <hi>bring aſword</hi> to
any place, ſurely their <hi>room</hi> is more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
than their <hi>company,</hi> and it can no
way be intitled to be a <hi>good work,</hi> when
one (contrary to the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> it ſelf)
ſhall ſet variance betwixt ſo near and dear
relations.</p>
                  <p>27. I anſwer, Our <hi>Saviours</hi> words, <hi>I
come to ſet a man at variance,</hi> are not ſo
to be underſtood, as if it were his <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
purpoſe</hi> and <hi>originall intent,</hi> out of
<hi>premeditate plot,</hi> and <hi>ſet deſigne</hi> to
make theſe unnaturall differences, but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65677:14"/>
that ſuch ſad effects, <hi>de facto,</hi> would come
to paſſe, <hi>per accidens,</hi> through the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
in mankind: For the <hi>preaching</hi> of
the <hi>Goſpel</hi> would meet with ſuch oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>carnall mindes,</hi> that our <hi>Saviour</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
foreſaw ſuch <hi>domeſticall Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi>
would inevitably follow the ſame.
Thus, as the <hi>Sun</hi> intended by <hi>nature</hi> to
lighten clear eyes, and ariſing daily for
that purpoſe, yet occaſioneth the ſmarting
of ſuch who are <hi>ſore,</hi> or <hi>blear-ſighted:</hi> So
<hi>Chriſt</hi> being a <hi>Peace-maker</hi> and <hi>Mediatour,</hi>
by his <hi>meſſage, employment,</hi> and <hi>deſire,</hi>
proved againſt his own will through mens
default, the generall incendiaries in <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi>
and by conſequence in <hi>Cities,
Countries,</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> though he went
about <hi>doing of good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. Two eminent inſtances may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65677:15"/>
Chriſt</hi> makes <hi>dead Girus</hi> his daughter and
<hi>Lazarus live.</hi> But if <hi>Chriſt</hi> was pleaſed to
manifeſt himſelf in a deſtructive way, no
<hi>rationall creature</hi> ſhall be made the object
of his anger, but a <hi>Fig-tree</hi> is ſound out
(and that but a barren one) <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 19. to
be curſed; <hi>Hoggs</hi> are found out (and thoſe
the <hi>beaſtlieſt</hi> of all Beaſts) <hi>Mat.</hi> 32. 8. to
be drowned, to ſhew that if <hi>God</hi> in the
<hi>vindication</hi> of his own honour, doth devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
from his naturall pronity and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to mercy, and is neceſſitated, <hi>ſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendendo,</hi>
to appear in a revenging way: it
is our <hi>barrenneſſe</hi> in <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> and <hi>beaſtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
in <hi>badneſſe,</hi> which inforceth him to
what is contrary to his owne inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>29. Secondly, we may obſerve, that
ſome of our <hi>Saviours miracles</hi> were double
ones, one growing within another. Thus
<hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 19. it was the chief intent of our
<hi>Saviour</hi> to raiſe the <hi>daughter</hi> of the <hi>Ruler,</hi>
when <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>obiter,</hi> as in the way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he did almoſt as great a <hi>miracle</hi> in
curing her, who was long troubled with
an Iſſue of blood. Thus as cunning <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deners</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65677:15"/>
are ſaid to have a <hi>myſterie,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
(by inoculating one <hi>flower</hi> on another)
they make them grow double: ſo our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
had <hi>Twin-miracles,</hi> and occaſionall
ſpringing up in the midſt of an intentional
<hi>miracle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30. But here a queſtion may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
not coming within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of thoſe condemned by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi>
2 Tim. 2. 23. <hi>For fooliſh and unlearned that
do gender strife;</hi> but ſuch the anſwering
whereof may give ſome <hi>light</hi> to our <hi>heads,</hi>
and <hi>heat</hi> to our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>affections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. Seeing our <hi>Saviour</hi> was a <hi>Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
generall</hi> to all perſons and places
where he came, how came it to paſſe that
he was not the <hi>minion</hi> of mankind, <hi>deliciae
humani generis, the darling of the world,</hi>
ſeeing he deſerved no leſs, by his favours
conferred upon it? how came men ſo
generally to hate him, ſo often to <hi>plot,</hi> and
at laſt to <hi>practiſe</hi> his deſtruction?</p>
                  <p>32. I anſwer, ſeverall reaſons may be
rendred, ſome <hi>nearer,</hi> ſome more <hi>remote,</hi>
why our <hi>Saviour</hi> could never be popular,
though no man more merited the ſame;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65677:16"/>
Firſt, becauſe had he been univerſally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
it would have hindred the grand
deſign of mans ſalvation, no <hi>Judas</hi>
would have been found to betray him, no
falſe Witneſſes to accuſe him, no <hi>Pilate</hi>
to condemn him, no Souldiers to execute
him, and therefore of neceſſity Chriſt was
to incur many mens diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>33. Secondly, he was to have not onely
a notionall, but alſo an experimentall, yea,
which was more, a meritorious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all miſeries, to which humanity
was ſubject, of <hi>hunger, Mark</hi> 11. 12. of
<hi>thirſt, Iohn</hi> 4. 9. long and painfull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
with little profit, becauſe of peoples
unbelief, <hi>wearineſſe under paine,</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
upon</hi> the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> as alſo of the
cauſleſſe and undeſerved hatred of people
from thoſe on whom he had conferred
great favours, that ſo he might the better
know to pray for pity, and believe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
in the ſame condition.</p>
                  <p>34. Thirdly, though <hi>our Savior went about
doing of good,</hi> yet ſome <hi>wicked men</hi> hated
him, meerly becauſe they were <hi>wicked
men;</hi> there is a generation of people, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65677:16"/>
drive a trade (whereby they will never
grow ſpiritually rich) of <hi>receiving good,</hi> &amp;
<hi>returning evil. David,</hi> as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> yea,
a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> complained of ſuch, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
35. 12. <hi>They rewarded me evil for good, to
the ſpoyling of my ſoule.</hi> Some men have
ſuch foul ſtomachs, as to turn all <hi>honey</hi>
into <hi>choller,</hi> converting courteſies they
have received into anger and malice.</p>
                  <p>35. Fourthly, <hi>Chriſt, though generally
doing good,</hi> was diſtaſted of many, becauſe
the <hi>Doctrines</hi> he delivered, were either
<hi>above their underſtanding,</hi> or <hi>againſt their
humour and inclination;</hi> it was ſaid of
<hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Neminem à
ſe dimiſit tristem, He ſent no man ſad away
from him.</hi> A happineſſe denied to our
<hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, for when (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 22.)
<hi>he adviſed the young man to ſell all that he
had and give it to the poore, and come and
follow him; it is ſaid, he went away ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
for he had great poſſeſsions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>36. Laſtly, <hi>Christ,</hi> though generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiating
himſelf with his <hi>good deeds,</hi>
could never arrive to be univerſally belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
becauſe he told people of their ſins,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65677:17"/>
and foretold them of their ſufferings,
eſpecially the 23. of S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel,
where he pronounceth <hi>eight woes,</hi> and
every woe <hi>three fold</hi> (four and twenty in
all in effect) againſt Scribes, and Phariſees
and Hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>37. It was ſaid of <hi>Will: Naſſaw, Prince</hi>
of <hi>Orange,</hi> (<hi>Father</hi> to the late <hi>Maurice</hi>)
the firſt Founder under <hi>God,</hi> of the Low-country
mens liberty, being a <hi>popular
Prince,</hi> courteous in his carriage to the
meaneſt perſon, that he never put off his
hat to a <hi>Peaſant,</hi> or <hi>Boar,</hi> but with that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> loſt a Subject, and
a free Member was gained to the united
<hi>Provinces,</hi> how well they will requite his
kindneſſe to his family, <hi>poſterity</hi> will take
notice, and <hi>ſucceeding generations</hi> will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                  <p>38. But our Saviour never pronounced
one of the aforeſaid woes, but inſtantly
he loſt the affections of ſome, who became
his enemies for telling them the
truth: Here a <hi>Hyppocrite</hi> hated him, there
a <hi>Scribe</hi> ſcorned him; here a <hi>Lawyer</hi> left
him, there a <hi>Phariſee</hi> forſook him; and at
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65677:17"/>
one time, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 66. many of his Diſciples
went back, and walked no more with
him.</p>
                  <p>39. And here it is worth our obſervation
to take notice of the difference between the
preaching of <hi>Moſes</hi> and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> the
former promiſed all outward <hi>happineſſe</hi> to
ſuch as kept <hi>Gods lawes,</hi> how they ſhould
be, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> in the <hi>field,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi>
in the <hi>city, bleſſed</hi> in their <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi>
in their <hi>ground,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> in their <hi>cattel,
bleſſed</hi> in their <hi>basket,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> in their
<hi>ſtore,</hi> in a word, on condition they would
obſerve <hi>Gods commandements</hi> he <hi>preached</hi>
and <hi>promiſed</hi> unto them all external <hi>peace,
plenty,</hi> and <hi>proſperity,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>40. <hi>Our</hi> Saviour'<hi>s</hi> Sermons <hi>were of a
different, yea, contrary nature, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by that paſſage,</hi> Mat. 5. 44. But I ſay
unto you, love your enemies, bleſſe them that
curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and
pray for them which deſpightfully uſe you
and perſecute you?</p>
                  <p>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is 1. Suppoſed, That the ſervants of
God notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their walking <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
righteouſly,</hi> and
<hi>godlily,</hi> to the utmoſt
of their endeavours,
ſhall have many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
cruſers, and
perſecutors.</p>
                  <p>2. Impoſed, That <hi>Goſpell princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
oblige ſuch who
will be the followers
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>bleſſe</hi>
thoſe who are their
moſt profeſſed <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are two hard ſayings together,
and is able to bear them ſeverally, &amp; aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
this mauled <hi>Christ</hi> his <hi>popularity,</hi> that
notwithſtanding all his <hi>heavenly Sermons,
holy life,</hi> and <hi>happy miracles,</hi> he was hated
by carnall men, chiefly on this account,
becauſe ſuch as followed his <hi>Doctrines,</hi>
muſt be ſure of <hi>perſecution</hi> here, and waite
for a <hi>reward hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>41. Let not the Miniſters of the Goſpel
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65677:18"/>
be diſheartned, and diſcouraged, if
with all their painfull preaching, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
living and courteous, carriage to, and
good uſage of their people, they can never
get, nor gaine their generall <hi>good will.</hi> The
<hi>Diſciple</hi> is not greater than his <hi>Maſter,</hi> nor
the <hi>ſervant</hi> than his <hi>Lord,</hi> let us know to
our comfort that Chriſt himſelf could
never be long in <hi>peaceable</hi> poſſeſſion of a
generall good eſteeme, but for the reaſons
aforeſaid, fell into peoples diſpleaſure,
<hi>though he went about doing of good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>42. Now to make ſome uſe of the <hi>Text</hi> in
generall, and firſt, is it ſo that our <hi>Saviour
went about doing of good?</hi> ſerveth in this
the firſt place to confute ſuch, who will
not at all go about, but immure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a <hi>Cloiſter,</hi> pent within the walls
thereof, and then pride themſelves in this
their will-worſhip, as the higheſt and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſtate of perfection, though there they
zily wither on the ſtalk they grew on, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
contributing any thing by their paines
and parts to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth:</hi>
May not both Church and State,
as their creditors, juſtly ſue them on an
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65677:19"/>
Action of Debt, for imbezilling theſe their
part; or, if you will, ingroſſing them to
themſelves alone, wherein the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Saints doth claime a joynt and
publique intereſt; ſure I am, our Saviour,
that grand Exemplar of Holineſſe, did not
confine himſelf to a Cell, but <hi>went about
doing of good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>43. Secondly, confuteth ſuch <hi>who goe
about,</hi> but how? not to do good, but to
do miſchief, every place they come at fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the worſe for their company: Thus
as a <hi>Snaile</hi> may be traced by the <hi>ſlime</hi> ſhe
leaveth behinde her, ſo theſe men may be
tracked whitherſoever they remove, by the
ſootſteps of their own wickedneſſe. Here
they have a wanton ſpeech, there a drop,
an uncharitable paſſage; there they
ſcatter a profane expreſſion, they may be
followed and found out by their bad
words in one place, and worſe works in
another; theſe leave <hi>Satan</hi> for their <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne,</hi>
or <hi>chief of their order,</hi> Job 1. 7.
<hi>Who came from going to and fro in the
earth, and from walking up and down in it.</hi>
But what to do? The <hi>Apostle</hi> telleth us,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65677:19"/>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Walking about ſeeking whom he
may devoure.</hi> Lazineſſe is better than ſuch
labour, idleneſſe than ſuch employment,
<hi>to go about doing of evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>44. Thirdly, it confuteth ſuch, who (to
give them their due) <hi>do ſome good,</hi> and <hi>go
doing of ſome good,</hi> but they <hi>go</hi> not <hi>about,</hi>
their motion is circular, but ſemicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
at the beſt, they are onely beneficial
to ſome of their own gang, of their own
party, of their own faction, their goodneſs
is not generall and univerſall, to all the
true and proper objects thereof.</p>
                  <p>45. What ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 6. 10. <hi>As
we have therefore opportunities, let us doe
good to all men, eſpecially to them who are of
the houſhold of faith;</hi> thoſe indeed are to
have a <hi>Hanna</hi>'s part of our Favour, a
<hi>Benjamine</hi>'s portion of our Bounty, yet ſo,
as all in extremity, are the objects of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
we are to <hi>baulk</hi> none who come in
our way, not to ſay that ſome of plentifull
eſtates are bound to ſeek out ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
for their liberality.</p>
                  <p>46. It is obſerved, that the diſeaſe called
S. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s <hi>fire,</hi> or the <hi>Cingles,</hi> (becauſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65677:20"/>
it clippeth and ſurroundeth the body in
faſhion of a girdle) is never mortall, till it
wholly compaſſeth the waſt, both ſides of
the inflammation meeting together; but
on the contrary, Charity is never Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
effectually, and cordiall to purpoſe,
untill it finiſheth its full circuit, and taketh
its compleat compaſſe, going about to do
good.</p>
                  <p>47. It is an uſe of comfort to the <hi>Saints</hi>
and <hi>ſervants</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> conſidering that
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> who on <hi>Earth went about doing of
good,</hi> now in heaven, <hi>antiquum obtinet,
keeps his old wont,</hi> ſtill retaineth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
mercifull and bountifull diſpoſition,
he hath not leſſe goodneſſe, for having
more greatneſſe, leſſe grace for having
more glory, yea, rather now he doth
greater and better things for us, <hi>becauſe he
is gone to the Father,</hi> John 14. 12. Whilſt
on earth his power was limited and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
his luſtre was clouded and eclipſed
with his humanity, whereas now he is put
into a better capacity to expreſſe himſelf,
and aſſiſt us, able to work what we wiſh,
and doe what we deſire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65677:20"/>
48. But now he doth not <hi>goe about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of good,</hi> becauſe after his long weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
on earth, he is repoſed in eaſe and
honour, and fixed at the right hand of his
<hi>Father</hi> in <hi>heaven,</hi> yet ſtill in ſome ſence
he may be ſaid <hi>to goe about doing of good,</hi>
ſuch the extenſiveneſſe of his providence,
through the whole circle of <hi>Creation,</hi> from
<hi>Angels</hi> to <hi>worms,</hi> though the <hi>Maſter-piece</hi>
of his <hi>mercy</hi> is the daily making of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
to <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>ſervants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>49. Some difference there is amongſt
learned men about the manner of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
interceſſion, ſome conceiving it done
onely with his mouth, others onely really
by vertue of his merit, probably it may be
done both waies, the rather becauſe our
<hi>Saviour</hi> hath a <hi>tongue</hi> (as alſo a whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but glorified) in heaven, and it is not
likely, that the mouth w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> pleaded for us
on earth, is altogether ſilent for us in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but in what manner ſoever this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
be made, it is ſo done, as makes it
both acceptable to God, and effectuall
for us, by him who now reigneth in glory,
and formerly <hi>went about doing of good.
Amen.</hi>

therein. Such needleſſe <hi>feares</hi> and <hi>Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi>
the <hi>Devil</hi> ſtarts in mens apprehenſions.
The Jewes were afraid in caſe they did

it had been the onely way to prevent

that the <hi>giving of their hearts to God</hi> will
<hi>marre</hi> their mirth, and deſtroy their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
for the time to come, whereas on the
contrary, it is the onely way, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,

                  <p>4. True it is, it will retrench that <hi>Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirth</hi>
which ends in mourning, that <hi>joy</hi>

                  <p>7. Anſwer. This <hi>flamme</hi> hath as much

<hi>Give thy heart to God,</hi> and he will return it
unto thee <hi>during thy life,</hi> (and what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

thy Relations better than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
A heart <hi>given to God</hi> will <hi>rule</hi> thy

loyall unto her without any wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65677:25"/>
In a word, it is ſo <hi>given to God,</hi>
that it is ſtill <hi>kept to thy ſelfe,</hi> to perform
all thoſe offices, which are according to
<hi>Gods command.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Third <hi>flamme,</hi> But my heart is ſo bad,
it is not worthy <hi>Gods</hi> acceptance, who
juſtly will caſt it away, both the <hi>gift</hi> &amp; <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
thereof. All the bad <hi>Epithets</hi> given to
a <hi>heart</hi> in the <hi>Scripture, center</hi> and <hi>unite</hi>

conſtitution thereof. <hi>An obſtinate heart,</hi>
Deut. 2. 30. <hi>A froward heart,</hi> Pſal. 101. 4.
<hi>A proud heart,</hi> Pſa. 101. 5. <hi>A perverſe heart,</hi>

                     </gap>. 5. And what elſe ſoever is
found in <hi>Scripture</hi> ſounding to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
thereof. If therefore I ſhould <hi>give</hi>
ſo bad a <hi>heart to God,</hi> he would <hi>refuſe</hi> it,
and <hi>returne</hi> it <hi>to me</hi> in his juſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>9. I anſwer, if this <hi>flamme</hi> cometh from
a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> and <hi>Diſſembler,</hi> it is utterly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65677:26"/>
unworthy that any anſwer ſhould be affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thereunto. But if it come from a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
ſoule,</hi> ſadly ſenſible of its own bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
(as in charity we are bound to believe
the beſt) it deſerveth a better name then a
<hi>flamme,</hi> yea, is a hopefull and happy
<hi>ſymptome</hi> (though of weake) of true grace
in the party propounding it. Happy that
man, bleſſed that woman, who from a
feeling of their own unworthineſſe, make
this ſincere complaint.</p>
                  <p>10. Be it known then to their comfort,
that if they had a better heart, then this,
whereof they complain, and did begrudge
and repine to beſtow it on <hi>God,</hi> yea, did
keep and reſerve the ſame for the ſervice of
<hi>Satan,</hi> and their own wicked luſts, then
this were in them notorious and unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<hi>Hypocriſie.</hi> But if this (as bad as it is)
be the beſt heart they have, they may,
yea muſt <hi>give it to God,</hi> and from him ſhall
receive the ſame in a <hi>New edition</hi> bettered
and amended. Thy <hi>obſtinate heart</hi> ſhall be
made <hi>obedient;</hi> thy <hi>froward heart, forward</hi>
in <hi>Gods ſervice;</hi> thy <hi>proud heart, humble;
perverſe heart, plyable; haughty heart, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65677:26"/>
ſtout heart, complying heart; ſtony
heart, fleſhy; hardned heart, ſoft; heart
ſlow, quick to believe; uncircumciſed heart,
circumciſed; impenitent heart,</hi> repenting,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The onely way to get thy heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
is, to <hi>give it to God,</hi> who will
create a new heart in thee, according to
<hi>Davids</hi> deſire.</p>
                  <p>11. Let us inſtance in three motives to
quicken our performance in this duty. The
firſt may be drawne from the dignity of
the party deſiring it; <hi>God,</hi> who <hi>might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>
ſeemes in ſome ſort in the <hi>Text to
requeſt.</hi> Theſe laſt ten yeares have made a
ſad change in many mens conditions.
Such who formerly relieved others, have
ſince received reliefe from others. Need
hath taught many an ingenuous tongue, a
language, wherewith formerly it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted.
It may move a miſers heart
to pity to heare them beg, (not thorough
default of their own) who had a hand and
heart to diſtribute to others. But ought
we not to be affected with the motion
made in the <hi>Text,</hi> wherein the great <hi>God</hi>
of <hi>Heaven</hi> ſeemeth in ſome ſort to wave
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65677:27"/>
his <hi>Might</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> and in <hi>Triall</hi> of our
<hi>Towardneſse</hi> and tenderneſſe, becomes in
the nature of a Petitioner unto us, <hi>my Son
give me thy heart,</hi> or at leaſt wiſe, doth
onely deſire, what he may <hi>demand</hi> as his
due, yea <hi>command</hi> as his right belonging
unto him.</p>
                  <p>12. Second motive may be drawn from
the deſerts of the Party, <hi>he is worthy</hi> (ſay
the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of the <hi>Centurion</hi> to <hi>Christ)
For whom thou ſhouldſt do this thing, for he
loveth our Nation, and hath built us a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,</hi>
Luke 7. 5. Many and great are the
<hi>indearments</hi> and <hi>obligations,</hi> which <hi>God</hi>
hath put upon us, <hi>he loadeth us daily with
benefits,</hi> Pſal. 68. 19. (though we make but
light of that load) as appeareth by our
conſtant ingratitude.</p>
                  <p>13. The laſt motive may be taken from
the danger of denyal: for be thou well
aſſured, if thou refuſe to <hi>give God thy heart,</hi>
it wil not remaine thine long, to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
If any ſpeciall friend, ſo <hi>honeſt,</hi> that
he would not deceive thee with falſe
frights, and ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> that he could not
therewith be deceived by others, ſhould
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65677:27"/>
ſeriouſly informe thee, that this <hi>Night,</hi>
thou ſhould be plundered of a <hi>Jewel</hi> of
great value, which thou haſt in thy houſe,
&amp; ſhould requeſt it of thee, to <hi>ſecure it</hi> for
thee (in the <hi>best acceptation</hi> of the word)
promiſing ſafe keeping, and ſeaſonable
reſtoring thereof; Surely thou ſhouldſt
diſcover little diſcretion to run the hazard
of a <hi>Robbery,</hi> and refuſe ſo faire and civill
a motion for thy own advantage. Know
in like manner, the <hi>world, fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Devil,</hi>
one or <hi>all</hi> of them, will purloine thy heart
from thee, and imbezle it to thy deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In prevention whereof, do thou <hi>make a
Friend</hi> therewith, and ſpeedily beſtow it,
where it may be preſerved for thee. <hi>Adam</hi>
himſelf, though armed with <hi>Originall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,</hi>
how ill he kept his own heart, we
his <hi>Poſterity</hi> may ſadly bemoan: deſpaire
thou therefore to be the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> of thy
own heart, thou canſt not lock it ſo faſt,
but <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>Satan</hi> by <hi>force</hi> or <hi>fraud,</hi> will
<hi>command</hi> and <hi>cozen</hi> thee out of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of it, if it be not ſolemnly <hi>given to
God himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. And now, as once the <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſaid
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65677:28"/>
to <hi>Philip,</hi> Acts 8. 36. <hi>See here is water,
what doth hinder me to be baptized?</hi> ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
here all the requiſites to a <hi>deed of gift,</hi>
what is it that debarreth us, but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
this tranſaction of our hearts may
be compleated? Here we the <hi>Granters</hi>
are preſent, and I charitably preſume have
our hearts in a <hi>ſpirituall ſenſe,</hi> here within
us; here is <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Grantee,</hi> who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
where two or three are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his name, to be in the midſt of
them; here are <hi>witneſſes</hi> enow, ſeeing
he who as party to one deed (wherein
himſelf is concerned) <hi>may be a witneſſe</hi>
to the <hi>grant</hi> of <hi>another,</hi> and <hi>legally</hi> atteſt
the <hi>truth</hi> thereof. Nor is there any need of
<hi>counſell</hi> of <hi>publick Notaries</hi> to draw up and
ingroſſe an inſtrument herein, ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is required to the <hi>giving of the heart</hi>
ſave the <hi>giving of the heart;</hi> the more <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi>
the more <hi>ſurely</hi> it is pefrormed.</p>
                  <p>15. O the commendable ſimplicity of
former <hi>Ages,</hi> and their plain <hi>dealings</hi> in <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains</hi>
and <hi>ſeals:</hi> what their <hi>hearts</hi> thought
then <hi>tongues</hi> ſaid; what their <hi>tongues</hi> ſaid

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65677:28"/>
dough</hi> held better to all <hi>purpoſes</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi>
than ours of the moſt <hi>tenacious wax:</hi>
how <hi>many Manours</hi> in thoſe dayes were
conveyed in <hi>few words, From me and mine,
to thee and thine;</hi> where, as now, a <hi>ſpan</hi> of
<hi>ground</hi> can ſcarce be conveyed under a
<hi>ſpan</hi> of <hi>parchment,</hi> ſuch is the litigiouſneſſe
of <hi>our Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. But know, in <hi>giving our hearts,</hi> we
are to deal with him who is the <hi>ſearcher</hi> of
the hearts, and who hateth all ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
complements, preferring <hi>down-right
ſincerity.</hi> Indeed, if the <hi>head</hi> was to be
given, ſome might conceive it fit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that the <hi>tongue</hi> and <hi>brains</hi> thereof
ſhould be imployed in making a large and
eloquent Oration at ſuch tranſactions; but
the <hi>heart</hi> being now to be given, it may be
done with <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>ſincerity,</hi> with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
promiſe, from this very moment to
conſecrate the ſame totally and finally to
<hi>Gods ſervice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. I have read of <hi>Iames the fourth,</hi> King
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that on his death-bed he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
his <hi>heart</hi> to the Lord <hi>Douglas,</hi> to
carry the ſame to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and to ſee it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65677:29"/>
buried by the <hi>grave</hi> of <hi>our Saviour,</hi> which
the Lord performed accordingly; and in
avowance thereof, the <hi>Honourable Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
of the <hi>Douglaſſes</hi> at this day, give a
<hi>heart proper</hi> in the <hi>Baſe-point</hi> of the <hi>Shield.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. Some will praiſe the <hi>officiouſneſs</hi> of
a <hi>Servant</hi> in doing his <hi>Maſters</hi> command,
but none can excuſe the <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> of the
<hi>Maſter,</hi> ſave onely by charging it on the
<hi>erroneous devotion</hi> of thoſe <hi>dark daies</hi> he
lived in: but let not us delay it till our
death, but in our life-time in the <hi>height</hi> of
our <hi>health, wealth,</hi> and <hi>proſperity,</hi> let us
not <hi>ſend by others,</hi> but <hi>give our ſelves,</hi> not
our <hi>carnal, corporeal heart,</hi> but our <hi>ſpiritual
heart,</hi> (I mean, all the <hi>powers</hi> and <hi>faculties</hi>
of <hi>our ſouls</hi>) not to be interred in the <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
grave</hi> of <hi>our Saviour,</hi> but to be buried
with him in true <hi>mortification,</hi> which will
be truly to <hi>practiſe</hi> the <hi>precept</hi> given in my

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo men doe not more differ
one from another, than the-ſelfe
ſame man at ſeverall
times, differs from himſelfe.
Behold a Chriſtian at the High-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-mark,
when 'tis Spring-tide of Grace
with him, and how full is he fraught with
pious Meditations? Good Thoughts,
godly Words, gracious Works, ſo that
one would think he would inſtantly ſtere
from Holineſſe to Happineſſe. (The
Top of Grace confines with the Bottom
of Glory) and wonders to ſee ſo much
Triumphant Sanctity in a Militant Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.
But now look on the ſame Man,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65677:31"/>
at Ebbing Water, when left to himſelfe in
the Agony of a Temptation, and how
much ſhall we find him diſguiſed from
himſelf? All his former good motions
dead and buried, and in their room ariſeth
another Generation, which never knew
<hi>Joſeph.</hi> Diſmall Thoughts, deſperate
Words, damnable Deeds, one would
feare he would ſuddenly fall into the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs
pit, but one Haires breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and Hell. Wofull the ſoul who
comes ſo neere, yet bleſſed the ſoule who
never comes neerer. We need not go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a pregnant proof thereof, than to
the Example of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in this Chapter.
How promiſe-valiant was He, never to
forſake his Maſter? And yet in the time of
triall, how baſely did he behave himſelfe?
Thus every one can conquer a Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but He who is aſſaulted with it, and
when it is brought home to our heart,
There is the Man, yea, there is more than
the Man, yea, there muſt be a God to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the Man, to ſubdue and overcome it.</p>
                  <p>2. But as the ſickneſſe of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſo the
ſinne of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was not unto death,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65677:31"/>
but for the Glory of God. <hi>Rejoyce not
over me, O mine enemy; for though I fall,
yet ſhall I riſe againe.</hi> Soone after the
Lord look't, the Cock Crew, and the day
dawn'd in the heart of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> out he
haſts of the High Prieſts Hall; Privacy
complyes beſt with Repentance. No ſuch
company for a Penitent, as onely himſelf
and his God, and now all alone he gives
himſelf over to Lamentation. He ſmote
the ſtony Rock alſo, and waters guſhed
forth; ſo that rivers Ran in deſolate pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<hi>Cephas</hi> a ſtone, <hi>Peter,</hi> a rock, ſmitten
with the ſence of his ſinnes, flowes with
plentifull rivers of Sorrow. O Happy day
of his Repentance! day, which had a fair
afternoon, but a very rainy morning, <hi>And
he went out and wept bitterly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>And wept bitterly.</hi> The Text contains
the Cure for the falling ſickneſſe of the
Soule, and is ſo ſhort that it needes no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,
onely (to avoid confuſion) I will
handle it, firſt, in reference to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
then in application to our ſelves; meane
time let none be offended at me, that clean
thorough my diſcourſe, I call him S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65677:32"/>
though then in the midſt of his miſery
whom ſome will not ſtyle ſo, though now
in the heigth of his happineſſe. Sure their
taking of the Saintſhip from thoſe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
hath added no more holineſſe to
themſelves on earth. But, ſuch <hi>Honour</hi>
have all his Saints, that they are to be
mentioned with honour. And ſee the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of <hi>Peters</hi> Saint-ſhip penned with his
teares in my text, written out ſo much the
more fairely, by how much it was the
more blurred. <hi>And wept bitterly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. In reference to S <hi>Peter,</hi> three pertinent
Queſtions muſt be propounded, &amp; anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
The firſt, Why did S <hi>Peter</hi> take on ſo
heavily, ſeeing ſo much may be ſaid for leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening
his fault? and though not wholly
to excuſe, in great degree to extenuate his
offence. For firſt, it was but a ſin of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
done beſides, yea, againſt his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and intention. He did not with a
high hand tempt a temptation: but alas!
his Heart was too great for his Heart, his
Will to promiſe too great for his power
to perform. Secondly, a forcible Motive
moved him thereunto, namely, feare to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65677:32"/>
loſe his life. It was not S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>S.
Peters</hi> Paſſion which denied his Maſter, or
rather, he did but reſerve himſelf to confeſs
him at a fitter opportunity. Thirdly, As
the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſleep,
but my heart waketh;</hi> So Saint <hi>Peter</hi> might
ſay, <hi>My mouth renounceth my Maſter, but
my minde doth retein him.</hi> The Deniall is
but from the teeth outwards, <hi>ore, non cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</hi>
Laſtly, the lameneſs of his Lie may be
hidden or helped, by lending it the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Staffe of an equivocation, <hi>Verily
I know not the Man,</hi> that is, I know him
not with intent to tell you of him; or I
know no ſuch <hi>meer man</hi> as you mean, for
my <hi>Maſter</hi> is both <hi>God and Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. The Anſwer to this Objection is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie:
For, S. <hi>Peter</hi> did not looke on ſuch
Paſſages, as might leſſen his Fault, but
onely obſerved ſuch Circumſtances, as
tended to the Heightening, Extending, and
Aggravating thereof. As for Equivocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that ſluggiſh Piece of Popery, could not
be ſo early a riſer, as to be up in the Church
in the twy-light, and firſt dawning of the
Goſpel. For firſt, S. <hi>Peter</hi> did conſider,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65677:33"/>
that he was <hi>forewarned,</hi> and therefore
ſhould have been forearmed. He could not
plead that he was ſurprized on a ſudden,
Chriſt having given him before a Caveat
thereof. Secondly, He did it againſt his
free Promiſe, and flat Proteſtation; as if
<hi>Childs play,</hi> too mean for men, were good
enough for God, faſt and looſe, bind and
break, ſolemnly ſay one thing, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
do another. Thirdly, He did it
Thrice: Once may be imputed to Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitancy,
Twice aſcribed to Infirmity, but
Thrice is uncapable of any charitable
Comment. So that Favour it ſelf muſt be
forced to condemn it for a wilful Offence.
Laſtly, It was not a bare Deniall, but a
Denial imboſſed with Oaths, and embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with Curſes, ſuch is the Conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenation
betwixt one Sin and another. The
Naturaliſts report of the Providence of
the Piſmire, that when ſhe ſtoreth up
Grain for the Winter, ſhe biteth off both
the ends of the Corn, thereby to prevent
the growing thereof. But if we ſhould be
ſo unhappy as to commit one Sin, O let
us with ſpeedy repentance ſpoile the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creative
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65677:33"/>
power thereof, before that One
Sin hath begot another: for how quickly
did S. <hi>Peter</hi> adde Swearing to Lying, and
Curſing to both?</p>
                  <p>6. Thus the Eares and Eyes of S. <hi>Peter</hi>
were onely open to heare and ſee ſuch
matters as moſt made againſt him: learn
we from him, to meaſure the dimenſion
of a ſin, and not to liſten to what Fleſh and
Blood may prompt us, for the leſſening of
our Offences. Mattereth it not then,
though we cannot meaſure the Compaſs
of the Earth, take the Height of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
if we can, by the <hi>Jacobs Staff of Gods
Word,</hi> take the true <hi>Altitude</hi> of our hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
tranſgreſſions: If there be any Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
which tend to the extenuating
of our Faults, though we ſhould chance
to loſe them, Gods goodneſſe will finde
them; and if we ſhould forget them, he
would remember them. Let us look ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
on ſuch things as render our faults
the fouleſt; following the Example of S.
<hi>Peter</hi> in my Text, Looking upwards, he
ſeeth God threatning, downwards, the
Devill inſulting within him, his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65677:34"/>
raging without him, Good men
mourning, Bad men mocking, that the
firſt of the Apoſtles, S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick'ſt
of Places, the High-Prieſts Hall,
before the Prophaneſt of Perſons, the
High-Prieſts Servants, at the Weakeſt of
Motives, the Summons of a Maid, did the
worſt of Actions, Deny his Maſter, Once,
and not touch'd thereat, Twice, and not
troubled thereat, Thrice, but there he
ſtopt, but there he ſtay'd, but there he
ſtinted: <hi>And he went out and wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. <hi>The ſecond Queſtion here to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
is this,</hi> Wherein conſiſted the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
and efficacy of the weeping of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
that thereby he obtained his Pardon?</p>
                  <p>8. To this we anſwer, Firſt Negatively.
The vertue of his Weeping did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in his Weeping, for by the bare Deed
done, did redound neither Good to him,
nor Glory to God. If God be thirſty, he
will not tell us, nor drink of the buckets
of our teares. For all the Rivers of the
Field are his, and ſo are the Fountaines
on a thouſand Hills. I could both ſigh
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65677:34"/>
and ſmile, at the ſimplicity of ſome Pagan
People in <hi>America,</hi> who having told a
Lie, uſed to let their tongues blood in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
thereof. A good Cure for the
Squinancy, but no Satisfaction for Lying.
And if not Red teares, then much leſſe
White teares, are in themſelves, any wayes
expiatory of the leaſt ſin. Now, Poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Herein was the vertue of St. <hi>Peters</hi>
Weeping, which procured his Pardon,
that his Weeping was waſhed in the blood
of his Saviour: In vaine had <hi>Peter</hi> wept,
had not Chriſt firſt bled for <hi>Peter.</hi> Could
the eyes of a Penitent vie moiſture with
the Month of <hi>April?</hi> All were to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
without relating by Faith to Chriſt;
ſuch Prodigall weeping would ſooner
drown the Sinner, than waſh a Sin. It was
not the <hi>Water,</hi> but it was that <hi>Sope, Malac.</hi>
3. 2. which did <hi>rinſe</hi> the ſoul of S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. By the way we muſt obſerve, that
all people are not bound to weepe
for their ſinnes, becauſe ſome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
by reaſon of naturall impediment.
There is <hi>genus ſiccoculum,</hi> people, whoſe
eyes by nature are like the Pit, into which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65677:35"/>
                     <hi>Joſeph</hi> was put, wherein there was no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Others there be, whoſe grief is too
great to be managed by weeping. And
as the teares are even ready to ſalley out
of their eyes, they are countermanded
back again with amazement and ſtupefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
therefore thoſe Mothers, who
want Milk, are not bound to ſuckle their
own Children, but either to bring them
up by hand, or to provide a Nurſe for
them; ſo God expects not that thoſe
ſhould weep, whoſe eyes are drie Nurſes,
but that ſome other wayes they expreſſe
their ſorrow for their ſins. And common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch people, though they are water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
yet will not be wind-bound too,
but what they ſpare in teares, they ſpend
in ſighs. Such perſons are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
but pitied, as lacking an outlet
for the exportation of their ſorrow; &amp; it is
to be feared, that Grief will wrong the
Veſſell the more, for lacking a vent; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
which Nature afforded to St. <hi>Peter</hi>
in my Text: For <hi>He could go out and weep
bitterly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. The third and laſt Queſtion to be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65677:35"/>
propounded, is this: Suppoſe S. <hi>Peter</hi> had
died ſuddenly, immediately after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
of his Maſter, and juſt before his
Repentance; <hi>What then had become of the
ſoule of S.</hi> Peter?</p>
                  <p>11. I anſwer: Firſt, <hi>As is the Mother,
ſo is the Daughter:</hi> an Impoſſible Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath begot and brought forth an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
Concluſion. Suppoſe that the
Sun had been quite put out in the laſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clips,
whence then ſhould the torch of the
Moon, and the taper of the Starres be
lighted? Suppoſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> had
really ſacrificed <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when he did but
offer him, who then had been the Father
of <hi>Iacob?</hi> To come cloſer to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It was impoſſible for <hi>Peter</hi> to die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Repentance; not but that he was
mortall in himſelf (any Arrow in Deaths
Quiver might have wounded him to the
heart, a Feaver burn him, a Dropſie drown
him, any deadly Diſeaſe ſurprize him)
but becauſe his life, as well naturall, as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
was hid with Chriſt in God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3.
whoſe wiſdom, as it had permitted his Fall,
ſo his goodneſs had decreed his Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:65677:36"/>
The Bones in the bleſſed body of
our Saviour, were <hi>frangibilia,</hi> but not
<hi>frangenda;</hi> they were <hi>breakable</hi> in their
own nature, but could never actually be
broken, as being ſecured from all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of fracture, by that Prophecy premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<hi>A bone of him ſhall not be broken.</hi> In
like manner, ſeeing God had determined
the ſalvation of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> Heaven and
Earth might ſooner paſſe away, than he
fall finally, in ſpight of Sickneſſe, and
Death, and Sin, and Satan, and Hell it
ſelf, he muſt riſe, he muſt ſurvive, he muſt
recover. But, not forced with the ſtrength
of the Suppoſition, but out of good will,
to gratifie ingenious Adverſaries, be it
granted, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had died ſuddenly,
after his ſinne, and before his explicite,
actual repentance for this particular fault;
yet I ſay, his ſoule had gone to Heaven.
For, conſider firſt, Though the Boughs
of his ſinnes ſpred wide, and Branches
ſprouted high, yet the Root thereof was
but humane Infirmity, conſiſtent with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Grace. And though he denied his
Maſter Thrice, yet it was but Once in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effect,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65677:36"/>
All in one continued Hot blood,
his ſoule being never cooled, or re-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with new thoughts. Secondly, He
had in him true repentance, <hi>quoad princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium
gratiae,</hi> an habitual Repentance, which
through Gods Mercy, and Chriſts Merits,
was ſufficient for his ſalvation. If any
diſſent from me herein, becauſe I make
Habitual Repentance, like <hi>Janus,</hi> to look
as well forward as backward, effectuall
for the remiſſion of future, as well as paſt-ſinnes;
let ſuch conſider with themſelves,
Firſt, they cannot, but muſt die. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they cannot, but muſt ſin, and it is
poſſible they may ſuddenly; guilty of
ſins of infirmity, actually unrepented of.
In ſuch a caſe their judgement will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Purgatory: Their will cannot indure
Hell, Heaven is the place which they hope
and deſire to go to, wherefore what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
they expect for themſelves, let them
charitably allow to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> But what go
we about to do? the Text takes away the
ſubject of the Queſtion, whereof we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute,
<hi>Peter</hi> did revive, and recover, witneſs
his <hi>ſighing,</hi> his <hi>ſobbing,</hi> his <hi>weeping,</hi> his <hi>wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
in my Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65677:37"/>
12. The uſe of this might ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the cenſoriouſnes of many in this Age,
who ſeeing their Brother guilty of a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
ſinne, preſently condemn him for A
<hi>Reprobate and Caſtaway.</hi> Thus the Poore
mans Soule, caſt by his owne ſinnes to
Hells Brinke, is throwne down by other
mens Cenſures to Hells Bottom. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
of <hi>Iohn Duns Scotus,</hi> the great
School man, that being in a ſtrong fit of
an Apoplexy, the ſtanders by conceived
him to be dead indeed. Whereupon, out
of the cruell kindneſſe, and over-officious
forwardneſſe of his Friends and Kindred,
he was buried as yet being alive, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
knockt out his brains againſt the
ſides of the Coffin. Thus the precipitate
haſtineſs of ſome cenſorious people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
their brother in a deſperate ſinne,
or deep temptation, bring no Cordials,
but call for a Coffin, vote him ſpiritually
dead, and inſtead of rubbing him, fall a
winding him. They conclude, there is no
hope, there is no help, he's paſt ſenſe, he's
paſt ſaving, he's gone, he's given over to a
reprobate minde, no way with him but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65677:37"/>
one, and that is eternall damnation. Thus
they bury mens ſoules alive, and (as much
as lies in their power) tumble them into
the bottomleſſe pit; though the beſt is, ſuch
uncharitable carriage more hurteth the
Doers than the Sufferers. Whereas men
ſhould know, that every wound in the
ſoule, which is <hi>Mortale,</hi> is not <hi>mortiferum;</hi>
And that it cometh to paſs in the Chriſtian
Combate, what often happeneth in Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Battels. Fames Trumpet kills more
than the Sword, and many, reported by
People to be ſlain over-night, are found
alive in the morning, though (perchance)
ſorely wounded, or taken Captives.
<hi>Sorely wounded!</hi> but ſo as they may be <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Taken captives!</hi> but ſo as they may be
<hi>freed</hi> by Gods <hi>pardon</hi> on their <hi>repentance,</hi>
like S. <hi>Peter</hi> in my Text, who <hi>went out,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>13. So much of the Text, in reference
to S. <hi>Peter:</hi> Come we now to the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
unto our ſelves. The Pope preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to be the onely Succeſſor of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
but in this reſpect we all are his Succeſſors;
we all have followed him, we all have ſate
in his <hi>Chair,</hi> we all have denied our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65677:38"/>
though not Formally, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi>
yet Equivalently, and it is to be feared,
ſome of us Tranſcendently. There be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
degrees, and different manners of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
of Chriſt; ſome deny him Totally,
as Apoſtates; ſome Partially, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
people; ſome in his Eſſence, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts;
ſome in his Deity, as Arians;
ſome in his Humanity, as Neſtorians; ſome
in his Merits, as ſome Proud Papiſts; ſome
in his ſpirituall Dominion over them, as
all Licentious People. <hi>If I be a maſter,
where is my fear? ſaith the Lord of Hoſts:</hi>
Mal. 1. 6. ſo that they who call God Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
with their mouths, and do not honour
him in their hearts by their lives, doe in
effect Deny him, and Un-maſter him, as
much as lieth in their power.</p>
                  <p>14. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth, (<hi>Titus</hi> 1.
laſt ver.) of ſome who profeſs that they
know God, but in works they deny him.
And S. <hi>Peter</hi> comes cloſer (ſecond Epiſt.
Cap. 2. ver. 1.) <hi>even denying the Lord
that bought them.</hi> And the ſame reproof
is ecchoed by S. <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>turning
the grace of God into laſciviouſneſſe, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65677:38"/>
denying the onely Lord God, and our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The beſt of us all, in
ſome meaſure, have been guilty hereof,
and have abuſed our Chriſtian Freedome,
the more freely to abuſe Chriſt who gave
it us. Wherefore, as we have been like
S. <hi>Peter</hi> in Sinning, let us be like S. <hi>Peter</hi>
in Sorrowing, let us <hi>go out,</hi> not with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Moving, but inward Mending; not
ſhifting our Place, but changing our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
go out of our Sinnes, goe out of our
Selves, go out to our Saviour, go out and
<hi>weep bitterly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>15. Yea, but may ſome man ſay, I never
could, nor ſhall <hi>weep bitterly for my ſins.</hi>
I am affected for outward afflictions, like
<hi>Rahel weeping for her children, and would
not be comforted.</hi> If I have a Ship ſunk in
the Sea, I can almoſt again drown it in
my weeping. But alas! when I am to
ſorrow for my Sinnes, no Teares, as Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntaries,
profer themſelves to my ſervice.
And I have much adoe to Preſs any to
bewaile my Wickedneſs, yea, I have
grieved more for one Temporall Croſs,
than for all the Sinnes I ever Committed:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65677:39"/>
which makes me to feare, that for want
of bitter weeping here, I ſhall go to the
place of weeping and wailing hereafter.</p>
                  <p>16. If any penitent Soule doth ſtagger
with this Objection, let him ſtay himſelfe
with theſe following Meditations. Firſt
know, that Sorrow for Sufferings muſt of
neceſſity be more Violent and Paſſionate,
than our Sorrow for our Sins. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not only a Pure, Virgin, &amp; Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
Sorrow, but hath much of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Impatience, Diſcontentment, and
Rebellion againſt Divine Providence.
And theſe make the Sorrow more Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
Clamorous, and Obſtreperous.
Secondly, becauſe we Sorrow for our
Sufferings, <hi>with the whole man;</hi> and for
our Sins, but with <hi>half the man,</hi> onely our
Regenerate Part, our Sanctified Moity.
For our Fleſh, all the while, laughs at Sin,
and delights in it. Thirdly, becauſe Sorrow
for our Sufferings makes an immediat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
upon our bodies, whereas ſorrow
for our Sins works directly on the Soul, and
on the Body, but <hi>by the by,</hi> and at the <hi>ſecond
hand,</hi> Now, although all Sorrow doth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65677:39"/>
flow from the Soul, as the Fountain; yet
becauſe it runneth through the Body, as
the Channel, and from thence is furniſhed
with outward Expreſſions (as Teares,
Sighs, Cries, rending the Haire, wringing
the Hands, and the like) hence cometh it
to paſſe, that Sorrow for Sufferings is beſt
ſtored with plenty and variety of outward
lamentations.</p>
                  <p>17. For a ſecond Comfort take this.
Though Sorrow for Sufferings be more
Paſſionate, Sorrow for Sinnes is more
Permanent. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 3. <hi>And
my ſinne is ever before me.</hi> As the Sin, ſo
the Sorrow of a Saint is ever before him,
morning, evening, early, late, day, night;
he may go away with it, but cannot run
away without it. Again, Sorrow for Sin
doth grieve more, though it doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
leſſe, which will appeare by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Two ſick Perſons, one having the
Tooth-ach, the other the Conſumption:
He that hath the Tooth-ach, cries out
moſt, even to the diſturbing of the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by; and no wonder, if where the
mouth be Plantiff, it <hi>complaineth</hi> aloud of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65677:40"/>
its own grievances: and yet all know the
Tooth-ach not to be mortall; it hath
raiſed many from their Beds, ſent few to
the Grave, hindred the ſleep of many,
haſtned the death of few: Whereas he
who hath the Conſumption, doth not
roare, nor rage, nor cry out, and the little
breath left in his bad lungs, he layeth out,
rather than in living, than in ſighing. And
yet ſure his grief is the greater, as knowing
that he carrieth, though the eaſieſt, yet
the ſureſt death about him. And ſuch is
a Saints Sorrow for his Sins, low and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
the leſſe grieving he keeps, the more
grieving he keepes; the leſſe he expreſſeth
the more he retaineth. It is a <hi>continuall
dropping,</hi> and you know it is the <hi>ſober rain</hi>
which maketh the <hi>earth drunk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. Third and laſt Comfort. Know,
that our Sorrow for our Sins, though little
in it ſelfe, is great in Gods acceptance and
Appreciation. Well doth any wiſe earthly
Prince know how to value the liberality
of his loyall Subjects, who ſhall aſſiſt him
in his great want with a ſmall ſumme of
money, eſpecially if he knoweth that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65677:40"/>
they are deeply impoveriſhed &amp; ſtruggle
with their neceſſity, which makes his
gracious goodneſſe to interpret a ſmall
gift a great one, comming from a large
Heart, confined to a narrow Eſtate. But
farre better doth the King of <hi>Heaven</hi>
know how barren we are in Grace, how
beggarly in Goodneſſe, ſo that ſorrow
for our Sinnes comes from us with
great difficulty and diſadvantage, we
are faine to ſtrive and ſtruggle againſt
our corruptions, before one teare be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spigellius</hi> in his Booke of Anatomy,
telleth us, That many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mothers
and Nurſes have a fooliſh cuſtome to
ſwaddle the breaſts of their new-borne
Babes over-hard, and ſo ſtraiten their
ſtomacks, that their lungs cannot dilate
themſelves in breathing: and this (by the
way) doth he ſay is the cauſe why more
die of the Conſumption in <hi>England,</hi> than
in any other Country. Sure I am, that
by the wilfull folly of our firſt Parents,
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> before we had our Birth,
when firſt we had our Being, we were ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65677:41"/>
ſoule-bound with ſin, and hard tied with
the bands of Originall Corruption, that it
hindreth the ſpirituall breathing of all our
affections. Yet God is pleaſed to take
our Widows Mite of Sorrow in good
worth, knowing it proceds from pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
yea, which is more, Heaven can ſmile
to ſee a ſinner grieve, that he cannot
grieve for his ſins; and God is pleaſed to
ſee him ſqueeze the bottles of his eyes,
though he can wring no moiſture out of
them. Twiſt theſe ſeverall Cords toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into one Cable of comfort, which
tied to the Anchor of hope, will keep the
penſive ſoule from ſinking in deſpaire,
though he cannot weep ſo bitterly for his
ſinnes, as he doth for outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>19. However, ſeeing it is the bounden
duty of all, to endeavour to ſorrow for
their ſinnes; this ſerves to confute the jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of this Age. Wherein, inſtead of
weeping bitterly, we have laughing hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and quaffing conſtantly, and faring
daintily, and talking wantonly, and lying
horribly, and ſwearing hideouſly, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65677:41"/>
living lazily, and dying deſperately. <hi>In
thoſe dayes the Lord began to cut Iſrael,
ſhort,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 23. And God now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to cut <hi>England</hi> ſhort, ſhort in men
ſhort in meat, ſhort in money, ſhort in
wealth, ſo that it is to be feared, that
Great <hi>Britain</hi> will be Little <hi>Britain,</hi> and
remain great onely in her Sins and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.
And is this a time for men to leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
themſelves, when God doth ſhorten
them! Is this a time for people to affect
fond faſhions, when it is to be feared we
ſhall be all brought into the ſame faſhion
of Ruine and Deſolation? A ſtrange
People! who can dance at ſo dolefull mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique,
as the <hi>Paſsing-bell of a Church and
Common-wealth?</hi> Take heed, Atheiſme
knocks at the doore of the hearts of all
men, and where Luxury is the Porter it
will be let in. Let not the multiplicity of ſo
many Religions as are now on foot, make
you careleſſe to have any, but carefull to
have the beſt.</p>
                  <p>20. O Beloved, take the Fruit, though
you ſhould throw away the Basket though
you ſhould ſlight the Preacher, embrace
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65677:42"/>
his Counſel. Think not that Chriſt will
call each of you immediately from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as he did, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſcutest
thou me?</hi> or that with S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> you ſhall
here a voice ſaying to you, <hi>tolle &amp; lege,
take up thy book and read:</hi> or that with St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> before wee repent, the cock muſt
literally crow, and Chriſt Corporally
look upon us. Every reproofe of the
Preacher, is the crowing of the Cock, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
check in your Conſcience, is the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Cock, every ſpectacle of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
preſented before you, every afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
inflicted upon you, every motion to
Repentance ariſing within you, is the
crowing of the Cock. Theſe you muſt
liſten to, and obey. And yet we read of
the <hi>Sybarites,</hi> a luxurious people in <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
who, that they might better enjoy
their caſe, and quiet, commanded that no
Cocks ſhould be kept in their City, that
ſo they might ſleep the more ſoundly, not
having their heads troubled with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
of thoſe Heraulds of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
So I am afraid there be ſome that
could wiſh, that there were no more Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65677:42"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> then at one time there
were <hi>ſmiths</hi> in <hi>Iſraell,</hi> no Cocks to crow,
no wayes to waken them out of the ſleep
of their carnall ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>21. But I hope better things of you, and
ſuch as accompany ſalvation. Neitherneed
I to uſe any other motive to incite you
to ſpirituall ſorrow, then the very words
of our Saviour, Mat. 5. 4. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe
that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted. Peter</hi>
was comforted afterwards, yea, <hi>he had an
expreſſe</hi> of <hi>Comfort</hi> diſpatch'd and addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to him in particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mark. 16. 7. <hi>But
goe your way, and tell his Diſciples and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that he goeth before you into Gallilee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22. Yea, all Gods Saints ſhall taſte of
ſpirituall comfort. As <hi>Joſhua</hi> when he
entred to <hi>Jericho</hi> was carefull to ſpare
her houſe, at whoſe window the Red Lace
did hang out, ſo God will be carefull to
preſerve ſuch, at whoſe windows, at whoſe
eyes, Redneſſe made by their mourning,
as a ſigne of their ſorrow doth appeare,
and at the laſt day, as it is <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 25. 8.
<hi>The Lord God will wipe away teares from
all their faces.</hi> The Papiſts have a tale,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65677:43"/>
that as our Saviour ſweated with carrying
his Croſſe, a worthy woman, one <hi>Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi>
met him, and gave him a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
therewith to wipe his face. Which
ragge (they ſay) ſtill remaines at <hi>Rome,</hi> fit
therein to wrap up the reſt of their <hi>Apocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
Traditions.</hi> Grant it a tale that this
Saint gave a handkerchief to him, it is a
truth, that he will give one to every good
Saint, to take away their teares, and he
will wipe the face of that <hi>Magdalen,</hi> who
wiped his feet.</p>
                  <p>23. It is reported of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that great
Philoſopher, that being unable to unriddle
that myſtery of nature, the <hi>motion of the
Sea,</hi> impatient of his ignorance, he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
drowned himſelfe in that water
which Poſed him, with theſe words, <hi>Quid
ego non capio te, tu capias me,</hi> becauſe I
cannot conceive thee, thou ſhalt containe
me: no little fooliſh deed of a great carnall
wiſe man. But ſeeing that the happineſſe
Heaven mounteth ſo High, that it cannot
enter into the heart of man to conceive it,
let us labour ſo to live here, that in due
time going hence, we may enter into thoſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65677:43"/>
Joyes, which cannot enter into us, and be
received by that Bliſſe, which cannot be
conceived by our braine, Where amongſt
many other worthy Saints we ſhall meet
with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> though not in the <hi>Penſive
posture</hi> wherein we find him my Text,
then <hi>Singing ſweetly,</hi> who in my Text <hi>went
out and wept bitterly.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe foure Pſalmes which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
follow one another,
we may find the ſoul of <hi>David,</hi>
preſented in all the ſeveral po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
of Piety, <hi>lying, ſtanding, ſitting, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
In the 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> he is lying all along,
falling flat on's face, low groveling on the
ground, even almoſt entring into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of diſpaire. Speaking of himſelfe in
the Hiſtory, of Chriſt in the Myſtery, <hi>My
God, my God, why hast thou forſaken
me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. In the three and twentieth <hi>Pſalme,</hi> he
<hi>ſtanding,</hi> and through Gods favour; in
deſpite of his foes, <hi>trampling</hi> and <hi>trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing</hi>
over all oppoſition, <hi>The Lord is my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65677:46"/>
ſheepherd, therefore ſhall I lack nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. In the 24 <hi>Pſalme</hi> he is <hi>ſitting,</hi> like a
Doctor in his Chaire, or a Profeſſor in
his place, reading a Lecture of Divinity,
and deſcribing the Character of that man,
how he muſt be accompliſhed, who <hi>ſhall
aſcend into the holy hill,</hi> and hereafter be
partaker of happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>4. In this 25 <hi>Pſalme</hi> he is <hi>kneeling,</hi> with
hands, and voice lifted up to God, and on
theſe two hinges the whole <hi>Pſalm</hi> turneth,
the one is a hearty beſeeching of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
the other a humble bemoaning of his
own miſery. Lent is a ſeaſon for ſorrow,
this Week is the ſuburbs of <hi>Lent,</hi> this day
the leader of this weeke, <hi>Shrove-Sunday,</hi>
antiently uſed for penitents confeſſing of
their ſinnes. Wherefore what doctrine
more needfull in it ſelfe, more uſefull to
us, more ſuitable to the Seaſon, then to
ſhrive our ſelves to God on Shrove-Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
joyning with <hi>David</hi> in his paeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
devotions, <hi>Remember not O Lord the
ſinnes of my youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Which words containe <hi>Davids Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi>
to the <hi>King of heaven,</hi> that he would
be pleaſed to paſſe an <hi>ACT OF OBLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VION,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65677:46"/>
of the ſinnes of his youth. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
we this, that God cannot properly
be ſaid either to remember or forget, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all things alwayes preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as preſent unto him. But in Scripture
phraſe, God is ſaid then to <hi>remember</hi> mens
ſins, when he doth <hi>puniſh</hi> them, then to
<hi>forget</hi> mens ſins when he doth <hi>pardon</hi>
them. Thus as <hi>Moſes</hi> vailed his face, that
he might be the better beheld, ſo God to
allay the purity of his imcomprehenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
with meaner mettall, namely with
expreſſions <hi>after the manner of men,</hi> to
make it work to our capacities, let us
praiſe God for his goodneſſe herein, that
whereas we could not aſcend to him, he
doth deſcend to us, and let us pray him,
that as here he doth cloud the object, to
make it fitter for our eyes, ſo hereafter he
would cleare our eyes to make them fitter
for the object, when in heaven we ſhall ſee
him as he is.</p>
                  <p>6. Before we come to the principall
point, we muſt firſt cleare the Text from
the Incumbrance of a double objection.
The firſt is this, it may ſeeme (may ſome
ſay) very improbable, that <hi>David</hi> ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65677:47"/>
have any ſins of his youth, if we conſider
the Principalls whereupon his youth was
paſt. The firſt was <hi>Poverty,</hi> We read that
his Father <hi>Jeſse</hi> paſſed for an <hi>old man,</hi> we
read not that he paſſed for a <hi>rich man,</hi> and
probably his ſeaven proper ſonnes, were
the principall part of his wealth. Secondly,
<hi>painefulneſſe: David,</hi> though the youngeſt
was not made a darling, but a drudge,
ſent by his father to follow the Ewes big
with young, where he may ſeeme to have
learned innocence and ſimplicity from the
ſheep he kept. Thirdly, <hi>Piety,</hi> Pſal. 71.
5. <hi>For thou art my hope, O Lord God, thou
art my trust from my youth.</hi> And again in
the 17 verſe of the ſame <hi>Pſalme, O God
thou hast taught me from my youth: David</hi>
began to be good betimes, <hi>a young Saint,</hi>
and yet croſſed that peſtilent Proverb, was
<hi>no old devill.</hi> And what is more ſtill, he
was conſtant in the fornace of affliction,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 15. <hi>Even from my youth up thy
terrors have I ſuffered with a troubled mind.</hi>
The queſtion then will be this, how could
that <hi>water be corrupted,</hi> which was <hi>daily
clarified?</hi> how could that <hi>steele gather ruſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65677:47"/>
which was duly <hi>filed?</hi> How could <hi>Davids</hi>
ſoule in his youth be <hi>ſooty with ſinne,</hi> which
was conſtantly <hi>ſcoured with ſuffering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. But the anſwer is eaſie, for though
<hi>David,</hi> for the maine were a man after
Gods own heart, (the beſt tranſcript of
the beſt copy) yet he, eſpecially in his
youth, had his faults and infirmities, yea
his ſinnes and tranſgreſſions. Though the
Scripture maketh no mention of any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
ſin in his youth, the buſineſſe with
<hi>Beerſheba</hi> being juſtly to be referred to
<hi>Davids</hi> reduced, and elder age. I will not
conclude that <hi>David</hi> was of a wanton
Conſtitution, becauſe of a reddy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.
It is as injurious an inference, to
conclude all bad which are beautifull, as
it is a falſe and flattering conſequence, to
ſay all are honeſt who are deformed. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we may collect <hi>Davids</hi> youth guilty
of wantonneſſe, from his having ſo many
Wives and Concubines. But what goe I
about to doe? Expect not that I ſhould
tell you the particular ſins, when he could
not tell his own, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>Who can tell
how oft he offendeth?</hi> Or how can <hi>Davids</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65677:48"/>
ſinnes be knowne to me, which he
confeſſeth were unknowne to himſelfe,
which made him to ſay, <hi>O Lord cleanſe
me from my ſecret ſinnes.</hi> But to ſilence
our curioſity, that our conſcience may
ſpeake. If <hi>Davids</hi> youth which was poor,
painfull, and pious, was guilty of ſinnes,
what ſhall we ſay of ſuch whoſe education
hath been Wealthy, Wanton, and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
and I report the reſt to be acted with
ſhame, ſorrow, and ſilence, in every mans
conſcience.</p>
                  <p>8. The ſecond objection hath more
difficulty in it, which is this, this may
ſeeme but a ſuperfluous prayer of <hi>David.</hi>
For whereas in Charity it may and muſt
be preſumed, that <hi>David</hi> long ſince had
beg'd pardon for his youthfull ſinnes, that
upon his begging, God had granted it,
that upon his granting God never revoked
it. What need now had <hi>David</hi> to preferre
this petition for pardon of antiquated
ſinne, time out of mind committed by
him, time out of minde remitted by
God?</p>
                  <p>9. To this Objection I ſhape a foure-fold
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65677:48"/>
anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> though <hi>David</hi> no
doubt, long ſince had been truly ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for his youthfull ſinnes, yet he was
ſenſible in himſelfe, that if God would
be extream, to marke what was done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,
though he had repented of thoſe
his ſinnes, yet he had ſinned in that his
Repentance. <hi>Secondly,</hi> though God had
forgiven <hi>Davids</hi> ſinnes ſo farre forth, as
to pardon him eternall Damnation, yet he
had not remitted unto him temporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
which perchance preſſing upon
him at this preſent, he prayeth in this
Pſalme, for the removing or mitigating
of them. So then the ſence of his
words ſound thus, <hi>Remember not Lord
the ſinnes of my youth,</hi> that is, Lord lighten
and leſſen the afflictions which lye upon
me, in this mine old age, juſtly inflicted
on me, for my youthfull ſinnes. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
Gods pardon for ſinnes paſt, is ever gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with this condition, that the Party ſo
pardoned, is bound to his good behaviour
for the time to come, which if he breaks,
he deſerves in the ſtrictneſſe of Juſtice to
forfeit the benefit of his Pardon. Now
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65677:49"/>
                     <hi>David</hi> was guilty afterward in that grand
tranſgreſſion of <hi>Beerſheba</hi> and <hi>Uriah,</hi> which
might in the extremity of Juſtice have
made all his youthfull ſinnes to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
afreſh upon him. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Grant <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
certainly aſſured of the Pardon of his
youthfull ſinnes, yet Gods Servants may
pray for thoſe bleſſings they have in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
not for the obtaining of that they
have, that is needleſſe; but for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what they have obtained, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.
Yea, God is well pleaſed with
ſuch prayers of his Saints, and interprets
them to be praiſes unto him, and then
theſe words, <hi>Remember not the ſinnes of my
youth,</hi> amount to this effect, Bleſſed be
thy gracious goodneſſe, who haſt forgiven
me the ſins of my youth. However, here
we may ſee that in matters of Devotion,
too much caution cannot doe amiſſe, in
the point of Pardon for ſinnes, we cannot
ſeek too oft, ſhut too ſafe, binde too ſure.
And therefore <hi>David</hi> who prayes elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<hi>Lord remember David in his Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
he could well be contented God
would remember <hi>Davids</hi> Perſon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65677:49"/>
it, <hi>Davids</hi> Piety to reward it, <hi>Davids</hi>
Miſery to remove it, wrong done to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
to revenge it; but as for <hi>Davids</hi> ſinnes,
and eſpecially the ſinnes of his youth, here
he lyes at another Guard, <hi>Remember not
Lord the ſinnes of my youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. Come we now to the principal point,
which is this, youth is an age wherein men
are prone to be exceſſively ſinfull. By
youth I underſtand that diſtance of age,
which is interpoſed betwixt infancy, and
the time wherein nature decayes; all the
time, that a man in his ſtrength is in his
owne diſpoſing. Now the reaſons, why
youth rather then infancy or old age
ſhould be prone to wickedneſſe are theſe:
Firſt, becauſe that in youth they firſt
breake looſe from the command of their
maſters, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1. Now I ſay, that the
heire, as long as he is a child, differeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from a ſervant, though he be Lord
of all, but is under Tutors, and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
untill the time appointed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which time, though long a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
when it comes at laſt, is very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to young men. <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaid in his heart,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65677:50"/>
the dayes for the mourning, for my father
<hi>Iſaac</hi> will come ſhortly, then will I ſlay
my brother <hi>Jacob.</hi> Thus young men plot,
project, and promiſe to themſelves, The
dayes will come, when my Father, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
or Tutor, will die, either naturally,
or legally, will deceaſe, either in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or power over me, and then I'le roare,
and revell, and gad, and Game, and Dice,
and Drink, and what not? In a word,
young men thinke, that they juſtly may
have an action againſt their parents, for
<hi>falſe impriſonment,</hi> becauſe they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
curbed, and confined their wills; and
though they dare not lay their action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Parents, yet to make the beſt
amends they may to themſelves, whom
they conceive heretofore wrong'd with
too much reſtraint, they will hereafter
right with too much liberty.</p>
                  <p>11. Secondly, becauſe youth is an age,
wherein mens paſſions are moſt head-ſtrong,
violent, and impetuous, ſo that it
may be called the <hi>Midſommer Moone,</hi> or if
you will rather the <hi>Dog dayes</hi> of mans
life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:65677:50"/>
12. Thirdly, becauſe as in youth, mens
mindes are moſt ſtrong to deſire, ſo their
bodies are moſt able and active to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
any wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>13. Laſtly, becauſe young men put the
day of death farre from them. For there
is nothing that more frights men from
profaneſſe and into piety, then the ſerious
apprehenſion of death appearing, with
the Arrerages thereof, eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in caſe the party dieth not in the faith
and favour of God. Now whereas old
men ſee death <hi>in plano,</hi> as under their eyes,
death is repreſented to young men in
<hi>Landskipt,</hi> as at a great diſtance from
them. And when old men diſcourſe to
young men of death, young men are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to anſwer them, as the High Prieſt did
<hi>Judas</hi> in a different caſe, <hi>what is that to
us? looke you unto it.</hi> The dayes of a man
ſaith <hi>David</hi> are threeſcore yeares and ten.
Now what ſome men poſſibly may live
to, young men thinke they certainly muſt
live to, they will not abate a day, nor a
minute, nor a moment of threeſcore and
ten, they have calculated their owne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65677:51"/>
and ſo long they are ſure they ſhall
live.</p>
                  <p>14. As for the ſinnes whereof youth is
moſt properly guilty, they are theſe: Firſt
<hi>Pride,</hi> and indeed, though they, and
none elſe, have any juſt cauſe to be proud,
yet they have the beſt ſeeming cauſe to
fleſh and blood. For young men have
health, and ſtrength, and ſwiftneſſe, and
valour, and wit, and wiſdome too, as they
thinke themſelves, though indeed the
more fooles becauſe they thinke ſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>15. Secondly <hi>Prodigality,</hi> for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
where their Fathers did end, and are
(the eldeſt ſonne eſpecially) in matter of
Worldly wealth, as good men at their
ſtarting, as their fathers were at the ending
of their Race. And commonly it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to paſſe, that where the father like
<hi>Logick</hi> had his fiſt contracted, the ſonne
like <hi>Rhetorick</hi> hath his hand expanded.</p>
                  <p>16. The third ſinne of youth is <hi>Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
For as old men, becauſe they are
acquainted with the Changes and chances
of the world, when they goe about any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65677:51"/>
great Action, ſtart all doubts, dangers,
and difficulties, probable, and poſſible,
whereby ſometimes it comes to paſſe, that
by their tedious tarrying on cauſeleſſe
caution, they loſe the advantage of great
Actions, which are made to goe off with a
ſpring of ſpeedy execution; ſo on the other
ſide, young men who know litle, and feare
leſs, being loath to confeſſe the poverty of
their experience by borrowing councell
from others, raſhly runne on, often to
their hurt, alwayes to their hazard, as if
ſucceſſe was bound out of duty, to attend
their moſt deſperate deſignes. Yea, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
himſelfe cannot be excuſed from this
ſinne of Raſhneſſe, witneſſe his words to
<hi>Abigail,</hi> the 1 of <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 34. <hi>As the Lord
God of Iſrael liveth, except thou hadſt haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and come to meet me, ſurely there had
not been left unto Nabal, by to morrow light,
any that piſseth againſt the wall.</hi> A preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
project, what if the maſter was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
muſt all the ſervants be wofull? what
if <hi>Nabal</hi> had been too niggardly of his
meate, muſt <hi>David</hi> be too prodigall of his
ſword? Yea, and he bindes it too with an
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65677:52"/>
oath, ſo that either he tooke Gods name
too vainely in jeſt, or the innocent blood
too ſadly in earneſt. Raſhneſſe is the third
ſin of youth.</p>
                  <p>17. Diſobedience to Parents, followeth
in the fourth place, a great ſin to which
young men are much ſubject, eſpecially
if their parents be feeble, and froward, and
fooliſh too, perchance as doting by age,
then they are ready to deſpiſe them.</p>
                  <p>18. The fift and laſt ſinne we inſiſt on
is wantonneſſe, the proper and paramount
ſinne of youth, and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>Flee youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
luſts.</hi> One might thinke this precept,
to <hi>Timothy</hi> might well have been ſpared,
conſidering that <hi>Timothy</hi> had a weake bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
ſubject to often infirmities, and ſuch
ſick folke are likely to thinke rather of a
Winding ſheete, then Wantonneſſe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>Timothy</hi> was temperate in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
daily drinking nothing but water, and
ſuch cold liquor was likely to quench all
heate of luſt, and yet becauſe <hi>Timothy</hi>
though a good man, though a weake,
though a temperate man, yet but a man,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65677:52"/>
and a young man, S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought the
precept not improper for the perſon, <hi>Flee
youthfull lusts.</hi> Luſt is the fift ſinne of
youth.</p>
                  <p>19. All theſe five are the ſinnes of
youth. Would I could ſay but as truly
theſe five are all the ſinnes of youth. But
alas, youth is capable of, and ſubject to
all ſinnes whatſoever. And yet, though
youth be too bad in it ſelf, let us not make
it worſe then it is; With the faſhion of the
World, when an offender is guilty of
more then he can anſwer, to charge him
with more then he is guilty. Youth may
commit all ſinnes, yet all ſinnes are not
the ſinnes of youth. A young man may
be covetous, yet Covetouſneſſe is no
young mans ſinne. Old men would be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
if they might not keep that vice to
themſelves. Though perchance they will
call it by a more mannerly name of
thriftineſſe. The reſult of all is this. Theſe
five ſinnes are the <hi>waiters in ordinary,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
on youth. So that all young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are guilty of them in ſome meaſure,
except God give them a better Proportion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65677:53"/>
of reſtraining grace. As for ſinnes extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
waiters on youth, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable,
being as many as any other
age hath, either inclination to deſire, or
ability to commit.</p>
                  <p>20. We come now to make a two-fold
Application of what hath been ſaid, the
one to young men, the other to old men.
But you will ſay, where ſhall middle age
People be placed? Shall they be wholly
neglected in the diſpenſation of this dayes
doctrine? I anſwer, middle age People,
ſhall have free leave and liberty to rank
and reduce themſelves, either amongſt the
young, or old perſons, according to their
owne Chriſtian diſcretions. But I know
where I ſhall find them all, for naturally
we all would be young, and therefore to
them, amongſt the young people, I thus
addreſſe my diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>21. You young people, ye have heard how
youth is an age wherein men are prone
to be exceedingly ſinfull, wherefore as
you tender the Glory of God, the health
of your bodies, the ſaving of your ſouls,
let me intreate you to be carefull to avoid
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65677:53"/>
the ſins of youth. It will be your own ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day. Remember what <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, though
no doubt an excellent man, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 26.
<hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and
makeſt me to poſſeſſe the iniquities of my
youth. Thou makeſt me to poſſeſse the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of my youth.</hi> If you lead diſſolute lives
whilſt you are young, other poſſeſſions I
cannot promiſe you, for your Lands may
be loſt, your goods gone, but this poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ye ſhall be ſure of, (a ſtrange Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
often purchaſed by Prodigality)
you ſhall poſſeſſe the ſinnes of your
youth, and (if you live ſo long) in your
old age ſoundly ſmart, for the luxury and
intemperance of your youth. Remember
alſo what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 11. 9.
<hi>Rejoyce, O young man in thy youth, and let
thy heart cheere thee in the dayes of thy
youth, and walke in the wayes of thine heart,
and in the ſight of thine eyes: but know
thou, that for all theſe things, God will
bring thee unto judgement.</hi> Which words
conſiſt: The firſt a Conceſſion, The ſecond
a Commination; the firſt a Conceſſion,
for it is no poſitive Command, or rather
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65677:54"/>
it is but an interpretative Connivance, not
ſo much given as gotten, and indulgent to
the frailty of humane fleſh, <hi>Rejoyce, O young
man in thy youth, &amp;c.</hi> The ſecond is a
Commination, contrary to good Muſick,
it is harſheſt in the cloſe, I ſhould like the
Indentures well but for the condition:
<hi>But know thou that for all theſe things
God will bring thee unto judgement. Will
bring thee,</hi> which words import two
things. Firſt, the unwillingneſſe of youth
to come to judgement, Secondly, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidableneſſe,
that youth muſt come to
judgement; And how ſoon you ſhall come
to judgement, is known to God alone.
Flatter not your ſelves with a fond conceit
of immortality. For though the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
ſaith, <hi>a horſe is but a vain thing to ſave a
man,</hi> yet a very mote is no vaine thing to
deſtroy a man. And whoſoever ſhall be
pleaſed to count the number, and mark
the age of this Sacrifice in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſhall find more Kids and Lambs
offered, then Goats and old Sheep.</p>
                  <p>22. But young men will ſay, preach
you what you pleaſe, we will doe what we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65677:54"/>
liſt. Your perſwaſions ſhall not befoole us
out of the pleaſures of youth. Yea, this is
but an envious diſcourſe. Have ye not
read of a Tyrant who having had one of
his eyes accidentally put out, cruelly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
an eye of every one of his ſubjects to
be bored out, that they might not mock
at his deformity? And ſo ſeeing youth is
taken away from you, you would put it
out in others, perſwading them if you
could prevaile, to deprive themſelves of
thoſe pleaſures, to which youth doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
them.</p>
                  <p>23. If any ſuch there be that heare me
to day, who faſten ſuch envious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on my innocent doctrine, I ſay if
any ſuch there be, as I feare there be
ſome, and hope there be few, and wiſh
there were none, to ſuch I ſay in the holy
Irony of the Prophet <hi>Michaiah</hi> to King
<hi>Ahab, Goe up and proſper.</hi> Larde your
ſoules with delight, may your own mind
be the onely Meaſure of your Pleaſure,
carve what you pleaſe, and eate what you
carve, and much good may that doe you
which you eate; if it be not bad in it ſelfe,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65677:55"/>
it ſhall never be made worſe by my wiſhes.
But as God ſaith to <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 12. the
laſt, in reſpect of his Propheſie, <hi>But thou,
O Daniel, ſhut up the words, and ſeale the
book, and goe thy way till the end be, for
thou ſhalt reſt, and stand up in the lot at the
end of dayes:</hi> So ſay I to my Sermon this
day, though onely in relation to ſuch as
count it an envious diſcourſe; Sermon
ſleep for ſeven and ſeven yeeres, yea let the
doctrine delivered this day, die for ſo long
time, and when that time is expired, when
it is probable enough that the Preacher
ſhall be dead, the Sermon ſhall new live,
and then have a reſurrection in the beliefe
of thoſe young men, who now leſſe believe
it. The inſtructions now laught at, will
then be long'd for. For indeed, this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
will grow the beſt when it is ſowen
in thoſe furrowes, which age hath made in
the face. Till then, my Sermon will be
contented to bear the burden of Envy, and
then they that accuſe it, muſt beare the
burden of Folly, when they ſhall freely
acquit it, and flatly condemne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65677:55"/>
24. I come now in the ſecond place
(and I hope with better ſucceſſe) to you
aged perſons, nor let it be interpreted any
diſloyalty againſt the crowne of your old
age, that I addreſſe my ſelfe to you in the
laſt place; for (if I miſtake not) the laſt, is
the firſt, the cloſe and concluſion the
higheſt place in the Sermon. Let me in all
humility adviſe you, not to repine at Gods
Providence, becauſe your Youth is paſt.
Coorſe Complements were exchanged
betwixt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> at their laſt
meeting, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> began,
<hi>Get thee gone, look to thy ſelfe, ſee my face
no more. Moſes,</hi> though meek, not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh,
returned as ſhort an anſwer, <hi>Thou haſt
well ſpoken, I will ſee thy face no more.</hi> The
bargaine is eaſily driven, where both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
deſire it. I, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> cares not for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Moſes</hi> cares as little for <hi>Pharaohs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
In like manner labour to be as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to loſe youth, as that hath been to
leave you. Never ſeek by unlawfull waies
to wooe it to ſtay one minute longer. Let
the departing thereof coſt thee not a ſigh
the more, or a ſmile the fewer. Is youth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65677:56"/>
gone with the ſweet thereof? then it is
gone with the ſin thereof: Is it gone with
the delight thereof? then is it gone with
the danger thereof: As hereafter your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
delight will be the leſſe, ſo your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
joy will be the more, if the fault be
not in your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>25. Secondly, deſire not, that as the
Sun went back ten degrees on the diall of
<hi>Ahaz,</hi> ſo that thou mighteſt be ten dayes,
ten Weeks, ten Moneths, ten yeares youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then thou art. Such wiſhes I am ſure
are vaine, I ſuſpect are wicked. What
Souldier having eſcaped a deſperate fight,
deſireth himſelfe againe in the midſt of
it? What ſea-man having eſcaped the
Sands and Shelves, wiſheth himſelf there
again? and ſeeing ye have paſſed <hi>ſalum
juventutis,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> termes it, the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Sea of youth; why ſhould you wiſh
your ſelves in it again? Neither thinke to
ſay within your ſelves, O if we were
young againe, the time which formerly
we miſpent in riot, we would hereafter
improve in piety. The truth hereof will
plainly be perceived, by your well hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65677:56"/>
the life which is left you to Gods
glory. For he that will not be faithfull in
a little, will not be faithfull in much. He
will not be a good husband on the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
would be a bad one, if he had the
whole Cloath. It is therefore to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that in your deſiring to be young
againe, you only make the pretence of
Piety, the Pander to your owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe.</p>
                  <p>26. Beware therefore that in your old
age ye be not guilty of the ſins of youth.
Gardiners can tell you, that when Roſe-trees
are clipt in the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> ſo
that then they cannot bring Roſes, they
doe commonly bring them in the Autumn

is poſſible, if you have been reſtrained, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by ſickneſſe of body, or naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
or want of opportunity, or reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grace, from the excreſcencies of
youth, when you are young, I ſay it is
poſſible, that you may be viſited with ſuch
gueſts in your old age, and make them
welcome at your own perill.</p>
                  <p>27. And this let me commend unto
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65677:57"/>
you, when you ſurvey the ſinnes of your
youth, take heed of miſtaking your Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion,
for Innocence, and thinking your
ſelves free from committing thoſe ſinnes
which ye cannot remember. For were we
at this inſtant arraigned for ſome ſinnes
we have done, we would plead, <hi>Not guilty.</hi>
Not that we would be ſo impudent as to
deny them if we did remember them, but
we have as clearly forgot them, as if we had
never committed them. Lord, thou layeſt
ſuch a ſinne to my charge, there is ſome
error, ſome miſtake, ſome other may be
guilty of it, but it is not I. But O what is
ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. in the deſcription of
the Generall judgement, <hi>And the books

The firſt leaf in the Book is <hi>Originall ſin,</hi>

how ſhall we clear our ſelves? God hath
found out the iniquity of thy ſervants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>29. One word more and I have done,
and I hope none will cenſure my Sermon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65677:58"/>
to be too long for this paſſage that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,

Parentage: ſon of <hi>Amittai.</hi> Men are
differenced in the Bible, 1. by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:

this Prophet was ſon to the widow of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta,</hi>
I believe no more, than that <hi>Dinah,
Jacob</hi>'s daughter was wife to <hi>Job.</hi> Or that
<hi>Ruth</hi> was daughter to <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab:</hi>

leap from the Loom to the Pulpit. I muſt
confeſſe, an Aſſes head was good food in
a famine; courſe meat is dainty when no
better can be had. But now (thanks be to
God) great is the company of Preachers,
able and learned, and for ought I ſee, the
Univerſities afford more Vine-dreſſers,
than the Countrey can yeeld them Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards.
No neceſſity therefore, that ſuch

The Commiſſion, <hi>Ariſe.</hi> As if he had
ſaid, Thou haſt long preached in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to
little purpoſe: Great the pains, Small the
profit of thy Miniſtery. I will therefore
tranſplant thy preaching, to ſee if it will
bring more fruit in another ſoyle. It is a
ſigne of a ruine of a Church, when their
Paſtors are called from their Flocks to go
to Forraigners. As <hi>Ionah,</hi> who was here
made Non-reſident againſt his will. When
the eye-ſtrings are broken, the heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings
hold out not long after. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are called <hi>Seers,</hi> their departure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſageth,
that their Pariſhes ſoon after will
dye and decay. For ſure the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> proſpered not long after, that <hi>Ionah</hi>
a ſtarre of the firſt bigneſſe was falne from
that firmament to <hi>ariſe</hi> into the horizon of
<hi>Nineveh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Goe to</hi> Nineveh <hi>that great City.</hi>] It is
more than probable that this City being
the Metropolis of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> was not a little
proud of the greatneſſe of it, as able there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to out-face the judgments of God, and
to blunt the edge of his revenging ſword
with the populouſneſſe of her Inhabitants,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65677:63"/>
before it could cut clean through them.
But let no City, though never ſo great,
thus preſume upon her multitudes; the
greater, the fairer mark ſhe is for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
of Gods judgements (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
nothing ſeems great in his eyes ſave
that man that ſeems little in his own:)
and God can quickly ſubſtract in a day by
ſword, plague and famine, what health,
peace and plenty hath multiplied in ſeven
yeares. This Iſland ſince the ends of two
Kingdomes, were made the middle of one
Monarchy, hath got the addition of <hi>Great
Britain,</hi> yet if compared to the Continent,
we may ſay of it, as <hi>Lot</hi> of <hi>Zoar, Is it not a
little one?</hi> Iſa. 40. 15. <hi>Behold the Nations
are as the drop of a bucket, and are counted
as the ſmall duſt of a ballance, he taketh up
the Iles as a very little thing.</hi> Let us the
Inhabitants thereof not be proud of the
greatneſſe of it, which probably puffed up
<hi>Niniveh</hi> the great City.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And cry againſt it.</hi>] Miniſters muſt not
mutter, but publickly and ſtrongly cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſinners: Firſt, becauſe <hi>ſinners are
afarre off:</hi> Iſa. 59. 2. <hi>But your iniquities
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65677:64"/>
have ſeparated betwixt you and your God.</hi>
Mat. 15. 8. <hi>Their heart is farre from me.</hi>
Epheſ. 2. 13. <hi>You who ſometimes were afarre
off.</hi> Secondly, becauſe they are <hi>deafe.</hi>
Thirdly, <hi>aſleep.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>dead.</hi> If any
object, why then it is loſt labour to cry
againſt ſinners, Preaching to the Dead
is as unprofitable as Praying for them. I
Anſwer, Not ſo. For it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 25.
<hi>The hour is coming and now is, when the
dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God,
and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> Too blame
then are thoſe that are cruelly kinde unto
their people in ſowing pillows under their
elbowes. Honey-dewes, though they be
ſweet in taſt, doe blaſt and black the corn:
And ſmoothing of people in their ſinnes,
though pleaſant to the palate of fleſh,
damneth and deſtroyeth the ſoule. And
yet this command <hi>to cry</hi> no whit favours
their practice, who change the ſtrength of
matter into ſtentoriouſneſſe of voice. Such
peeces make a great report with powder,
but are charged with no ſhot, and are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
to the beating down of ſin. And it
may be ſaid of their <hi>crying,</hi> that they doe
but whiſper whilſt they hollow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65677:64"/>
                        <hi>For their wickedneſſe is come up before
me.</hi>] What the particular ſin of <hi>Nineveh</hi>
was, is not expreſt. Some think, had that
City been arraigned for the ſins of <hi>Sodome,</hi>
it would have been found guilty: And no
doubt <hi>Sorcerie</hi> the ſin of the <hi>East,</hi> was no
ſtranger in her own Countrey, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Ninevites thereto much addicted.
But that <hi>Oppreſsion</hi> was certainly their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
ſin, may be gathered out of the
third of <hi>Nahum,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>O bloody City, it is
full of lyes and robbery, the prey departeth
not.</hi> Not content to be a Queen of thoſe
Countreys ſhe had ſubdued, ſhe was a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
So then we ſee, all ſins but <hi>Oppreſsion</hi>
eſpecially, though naturally they tend
downwards to their centre, and with their
weight preſſe ſinners to Hell; Yet they doe
mount upwards by their cry and clamour,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 10. &amp; 18. 20. It were then an advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
way for us to make ſome counter-ſounds
to drown the noiſe of our ſins, that
God may not hear them. Firſt, by ſending
up ſighs from a penitent heart. Secondly,
prayers and almes, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 41. Cornelius
<hi>thy prayer is heard, and thine almes are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65677:65"/>
had in remembrance in the ſight of God.</hi>
Thirdly, by pleading Chriſt his merits;
That the loud language of his blood may
out-noiſe and ſilence the cry of our ſins.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. Yet let Oppreſſours take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that theirs being the ſin of <hi>Nineveh,</hi>
as it is of an higher nature, ſo is it of an
higher cry than other ſins. And let the
remorſleſſe Extortioner take this into his
conſideration: Hand-mills, though they
grinde not ſo much, yet they grinde as
much to powder as either Winde-mills or
Water-mills, which are farre greater:
though theſe Oppreſſors doe not miſchief
to ſo many as <hi>Nineveh</hi> did, yet to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as comes within their clutches; they
ſhew as mercileſſe cruelty, and this is a ſin
will come up before God.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65677:66"/>

S. <hi>Paul</hi> more than S. <hi>Paul?</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 13.
<hi>I was a Blaſphemer, and a Perſecuter, and
an Oppreſſour.</hi> We learn from S. <hi>Stephen,
Acts</hi> 7. 22. That <hi>Moſes</hi> was learned in all
the wiſdome of the Aegyptians, but in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
in his own writings, we finde no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

his Brother, the murmuring of <hi>Miriam</hi>
his Siſter, the prophaneneſſe of <hi>Nadab</hi> and
<hi>Abihu</hi> his Nephews. This amongſt other
reaſons may be one to prove, that no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is of private interpretation, but that
holy men of God wrote it, as they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
by Gods holy Spirit. Whereas the
Books of Heathen Writers are nothing elſe
but the Inventories of their own vertues.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65677:66"/>
What are <hi>Caeſar's</hi> Commentaries, but
commentaries on the text of his own va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour?
But for a man thus farre to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mann'd,
as to baniſh ſelf-love from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and with <hi>Ionah,</hi> to put his own flight
and fault into the Calendar of Eternity.
Who ſees not the finger of God in <hi>Ionah</hi>'s
hand writing this prophecy?</p>
                     <p>Sundry carnall reaſons may be alledged
for <hi>Ionah</hi>'s flight: Firſt, fear of extreme
and cruell uſage from the wicked Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.
Secondly, deſpair that his preaching
barren in <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be fruitfull in <hi>Aſhur.</hi>
Thirdly, the ſtrangeneſſe of the meſſage,
diſtaſtfull to a Jewiſh palate, to be ſent to
the Gentiles. Fourthly, a zeal to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
he might perceive that the converſion
of the Gentiles would be the everſion of
the Jewes; and therefore he was loth to
be acceſſary to the deſtruction of his own
Nation. Fiftly, that reaſon alledged by
himſelf in the fourth Chap. and ver. 2. He
feared to be diſproved, becauſe God was ſo
mercifull. But let his reaſons, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

it.</p>

                        <hi>To flee.</hi>] God bids <hi>Ionah</hi> goe, and he
flyes, he ſupererogates, but in a wrong
worke. In him the Proverb findes truth,
<hi>The more haſte, the worſe ſpeed.</hi> We ſee

The Elders of the Jewes (probably
aged Grandſires) how late were they up
that night our Saviour was betrayed? How
early did they riſe that morning he was
condemned? How duly did they attend
the whole day he was crucified? who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
(no doubt) would have been in

not therefore the greatneſſe of the ſtrides,

                        <hi>From the preſence of the Lord.</hi>] It were
great ignorance in us to charge <hi>Ionah</hi> with
ſuch ignorance, as if he thought it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
poſſible to flye from Gods preſence:
And if he had been ſo erroneous, he made
the moſt unadviſed choice, to flye to the

Here a difficult Objection may be ſtarted.
How could it ſtand with Gods juſtice to
put ſo many innocent Mariners in hazard
and jeopardy of their lives for the ſinne of
<hi>Ionah</hi> alone? But theſe Sheep, what have
they done? Will God deſtroy the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
with the wicked? Shall not the Judge
of all the earth doe righteouſly? I anſwer,
firſt at large. In God's proceedings what
we cannot conceive to be good, we muſt
not condemn to be bad: But ſuſpect our
ſelves, ſuſpend our cenſures, admire his
workes, which are never againſt right,
though often above reaſon. To come nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:
God need not pick a quarrell with
man, he hath juſt matter enough at any
time to have a controverſie with him, and
to commence actions againſt him. Theſe
Mariners, though not guilty with <hi>Ionah</hi>
in this particular act; yet had deſerved this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65677:71"/>
puniſhment of God, for their former ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
tranſgreſsions, from which no man
is free.</p>
                     <p>Yet God haſtened this puniſhment upon

their own faults, and know that though
they be innocent in this particular, yet they
have deſerved this puniſhment of God for

came Caſting away of goods. Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
they are the hardieſt of all people,

are eſteemed the <hi>Nazareth</hi> of the world,
out of which cometh no good; Yet ſee,
they pray. They are generally covetous,
venturing their lives for lucre: yet ſee, they
caſt away their goods. Whence we may
learn, that afflictions are able to affright

let us labour that we be as good,
when afflictions are removed, as when they

as well affected in health, as in ſickneſſe,

ſteep'd in teares, bedew'd with mourning.
Thirdly, perſevering in ſinne beſots men,
and makes them inſenſible of the greateſt
dangers. It makes men like <hi>Nabal,</hi> their
heart dyes within them, and they become
like a ſtone; ſo frozen in their ſinnes, that
no fear of Hell-fire can thaw them. Thus
<hi>David,</hi> when he kill'd <hi>Uriah,</hi> ſeem'd to kill
his own conſcience. How was he bereſt

by degrees, and in the progreſſe

                        <hi>So the Ship-master.</hi>] The Ship-maſter
that was, (but now no Maſter of it, the
Tyranny of the tempeſt Commanding
both it and him) begins to beſtirre him.
Great men muſt not thinke to be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
from danger by the eminencie
of their place. <hi>Mordecai</hi> to <hi>Hester:
Think not thou ſhalt eſcape in the Kings
houſe more than all the Iewes.</hi> Yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Great men are in the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
they are moſt aimed at, <hi>Fight neither
againſt ſmall nor againſt great, ſave onely
against the King of</hi> Iſrael, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 31.
Now ſithence there was a Governour in a
ſhip, it teacheth us that no company can
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65677:77"/>
long ſubſiſt without order and ſuperiority
one above another: From the Courtiers
to the Priſoners, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 22. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had all
the Priſoners in the Priſon committed to
to his hand. Ten is but a ſmall number,
yet <hi>Moſes</hi> made Governours over ten,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 21. Yea, as there is <hi>Michael</hi> the
Archangel in heaven, ſo is there <hi>Beel Zebub</hi>
the Prince of Devils in Hell: So much
order there is in the very place of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Away then with the Anabaptiſt, who
would ſet all men at odds by making all
men even. For a Common-wealth to want
Chiefe, it is the chiefe of all wants, every
man will doe what he liſt, few what they
ſhould: too much liberty would make men
ſlaves to their own ſelf-will. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be ſubject to the higher powers, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there are no powers but of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Came unto him, and ſaid.</hi>] Every one
in authority ought to look unto thoſe
which are under their command; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they ſhall anſwer to God for ſuch
faults as thoſe commit which are under
their charge, through their over-ſight and
neglect. Chriſt is ſaid to have baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65677:77"/>
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 23. And yet it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 2.
That he himſelf baptized not, but his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.
We ſee that the deed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
being done by the countenance and
command of the Maſter, is attributed and
aſcribed to his Maſter as his own proper
work. If the Maſter hears of his Servants
drunkenneſſe, and puniſheth it not, it is the
Maſters drunkenneſſe. If the Maſter hears
of his Servants prophaneneſs, and reproves
him not for it, it is his prophaneneſſe.
Blame-worthy then are thoſe Magiſtrates
who would have the profit, not the pain;
the credit, not the care of their place and
charge: ſo that they deale with thoſe that
are under them, as <hi>David</hi> did with <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah,</hi>
they will not ſo much as trouble
themſelves to ſay to Offenders, <hi>Why doeſt
thou ſo?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>What meaneſt thou, ô ſleeper!</hi>] See here
the Gentile teacheth the Jew, the Pagan
preacheth to the Prophet, and he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to hear him. How faulty is their pride,
who count it an imbaſing of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to liſten to the advice of others, who
in any reſpect are their inferiours, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.

ver. 34. Yet <hi>David</hi> hearkned to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>Abigail, Abraham</hi> to the counſell
of <hi>Sarah, Apollos</hi> to the inſtruction of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila</hi>
and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> yea <hi>Solomon</hi> (the wiſeſt
of earthly Kings) had a Council of Aged
men which ſtood before him. Neither
need any man think much to learn of the
meaneſt of men, who may be taught by
Piſmires and Lillyes. Yet when inferiours
on juſt occaſion adventure to counſel thoſe
that are above them, that their counſell
may better reliſh, Let it be ſeaſoned with
theſe three ingredients, firſt, Secrecie. This
alone was good in <hi>Peter</hi>'s reproving of our
Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 22. <gap reason="foreign">

took him aſide.</hi> Secondly, Seaſonableneſſe.
<hi>Abigail,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 36. told drunken <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
neither more nor leſſe, till the next
morning: ſhe thought her phyſick would
work the better, if ſhe gave it him faſting.
Thirdly, Humility. <hi>Naaman</hi>'s Servants:
<hi>Father, if the Prophet had bid thee ſome
great thing, wouldſt not thou have done it?</hi>
2. Kings 5. 13. They brought not onely
good Logick, reaſoning from the greater

                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65677:78"/>
Theſe cautions obſerved, meaner perſons
by Gods aſſiſtance, with hope of ſucceſſe,
may take upon them to adviſe their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſe, and call upon thy God.</hi>] He doth
not onely reprove him for what he had
done amiſſe, but alſo directeth him in what
he ſhould doe well. They are miſerable
Guides, that tell the wandring Traveller,
that he hath loſt the way, but tell him not
how to finde it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſe.</hi>] Men muſt put away all lazineſſe,
when they prepare themſelves to prayer.
Indeed, when in ſickneſſe we are Gods pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
then we can only rouſe up our ſouls
and not ariſe in our bodies; then, with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi>
we may lye on our bed and pray,
pleading to God, as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> to <hi>David,</hi>
that <hi>his ſervant is lame:</hi> But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<hi>Curſed is he that doth the work of the
Lord negligently.</hi> The firſt fruits of the
Aſſe was not to be dedicated to God in the
Leviticall Law, but the neck thereof was
to be broken. Let us break the aſſes neck,
let us baniſh all ſloth and lazineſs when we
goe about to perform any ſervice of God,

                        <hi>Call upon thy God.</hi>] Becauſe perchance
the Ship-maſter had a great opinion of the
ſufficiency of <hi>Ionah</hi>'s God, or becauſe he
might have a conceipt that <hi>Ionah</hi>'s prayers
might be more prevalent than his owne.
<hi>Aeſchinus</hi> ſaid unto his Uncle <hi>Mitio,</hi> in the
Comedie:</p>
                     <lg>

                     <p>Or elſe he onely aimed at a generall col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection

of moſt ſeverall cords.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If ſo be that God will think upon us, that
we periſh not.</hi>] It is worth our ſearch to
know, when theſe words, <hi>If ſo be God will,</hi>
are to be inſerted into our prayers, and
when they muſt be omitted. When we
pray for pardon of our ſins, then we muſt
omit them: For God hath ſaid, <hi>At what
time</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will put all his wickedneſſe out of
my remembrance.</hi> Now let us not diſpute
of what is determined ſuſpect what is ſure.
<hi>God</hi> ſaith, <hi>he will.</hi> Let us not ſay, <hi>If ſo be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65677:79"/>
God will.</hi> If our repentance be unfaigned,
our pardon may be undoubted: In ſuch a
caſe, Let us come to the Throne of Grace
with boldneſſe in the aſſurance of faith,
with reaſoning, truſt perfectly in grace. But
when we pray for the removall of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then theſe words are no Parentheſis,
but an eſſentiall part of our prayers, then
we muſt ſubmit our ſelves not our wills,
but <hi>thy will be done;</hi> then with children
we muſt not cry to carve our own meat,
but eat that which God our Father cuts
for us, though it be untoothſome for our
palats to taſt, it is never unwholſome for
our ſtomachs to digeſt.</p>

The apprehenſion of the preſent danger,
was the cement that did glue and unite
their different judgments and affections, to
reſolve on that, which they conceived was
for their generall good. It is likely that
the beaſts in the Arke when they were in a
common danger of drowning did agree
together, and for that time diſpence with
their mutuall Antipathies. Grant then that
we have ſeverall tempers, humours, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious;
yet the apprehenſion that we have
one grand unpartiall enemy, the Devil,
who like a roaring Lyon ſeeks to devour
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65677:80"/>
us: This ſhould make us centre our votes
in ſuch reſolutions, which are behoofull
for all our goods.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Come let us caſt lots.</hi>] The uſe of Lots
was very antient amongſt both Jewes and
Gentiles. They were of three natures, 1.
The Lot Divinatorie, uſed by <hi>Haman,
Heſt.</hi> 3. 7. And as for this kinde of Lot, it
is utterly unlawfull, <hi>We have no ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
nor yet the Churches of God.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Diviſorie, <hi>Obad.</hi> 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 35. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Conſultory, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7. 18.
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 42. Theſe are lawfull, if uſed
lawfully, with theſe cautions: Firſt, in
matters of difficulty; As quickſilver in the
<hi>Iliaca paſsio,</hi> when nothing elſe can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twine
the gutts; in perplext and intricate
cauſes. Secondly, in matters of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
otherwiſe there may <hi>difficiles nugae;</hi>
Riddles not worth the reading. Hard ſhells
without a kernell not worth the cracking.
Difficulties which deſerve not the reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
Thirdly, they are to be uſhered with
prayer, as in the choice of <hi>Matthias, Act.</hi> 1.
Fourthly, that nothing therein be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Chance, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 33. <hi>The lot is caſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65677:81"/>
into the lap, but the whole diſpoſition thereof
is from the Lord. Whole.</hi> Fortune, that
God of mans making; is a meer Idol of
<hi>Dagon:</hi> and falls down at the approach
of the Arke of GOD's providence: Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
both head and hands, power both to
plot and perform. It is not Fortune blinde
through ignorance that cannot ſee, But
Divine Juſtice blinde through impartiality
that will not ſee, which ordereth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Laſtly, no couſenage or deceit is to be
uſed in them. Lots are Gods ſcales, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he weigheth matters of ſeeming equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and ſhowes which preponderates: they
therefore that falſifie this ballance of the
Sanctuary, muſt needs be abomination in
the ſight of God.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe Lots may ſay to Cards,
what <hi>Naomi</hi> ſayd to <hi>Boaz, They are neer
unto us, and of our affinity;</hi> ſomething alſo
of the uſe of them. It were no great harm
if there were no other Cards uſed, than
thoſe of Clothiers about wooll, and of
Mariners in the ſhip. But as for Cards to
play with, Let us not wholly condemn
them, leſt lacing our conſciences too
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65677:81"/>
ſtraight, we make them to grow awry on
the wrong ſide.</p>
                     <p>Such Recreations are lawfull if we uſe
them as <hi>Ionathan</hi> taſted the honey, putting
forth the end of his rod he touched a little
of it, and his eyes were cleared. But let us
take heed of a ſurfeit, into which thoſe doe
fall who either play out of covetouſneſſe,
or for more than their eſtates can bear, or
conſtantly and continually; all their meat
is ſauce, all the dayes in their Almanack
play-dayes, though few Holy-dayes. The
Creation laſted but a Week, but theſe
mens Recreations all the dayes of their
lives; ſuch uſing of lawfull exerciſes is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unlawfull.</p>
                     <p>

evil is upon us.</hi>] The beſt man in the ſhip
carried ſinne enough about him to drown
himſelf, ſhip, and paſſengers. But this milk
we ſuck from the breſts of our mother
