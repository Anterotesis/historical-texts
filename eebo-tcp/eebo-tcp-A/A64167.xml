            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of our most Gracious Soveraigne, at his returne from
<hi>Scotland</hi> to this Honourable City of <hi>London.</hi> How some other Kings
and Princes, of our own and other nations have been formerly entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Lord Major and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> it is (as I have read in
our <hi>English</hi> Histories) set downe by me in short; towards the end of this Discourse.</p>
            <p>On thursday the 25. of this instant <hi>November,</hi> 1641. Mr. Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Garret,</hi> and his brother in office Mr. Alderman <hi>Clarke</hi> being both
Sheriftes of <hi>London,</hi> with 72. of their men in Scarlet Liveries, road four
miles towards <hi>Theobalds</hi> to meet his Majesty, with the City Trumpets
14. in number, and they conducted his Majestie in state untill such time
as they came where the Lord Major, did attend, and was attended to
welcome his Majestie as followeth. About eight of the clock in the
morning, the Aldermen, with Mr. Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> all in Scarlet
Gowns, with the City Councell, came all on horse-back to the Lord
Majors house in the old Jury, and there they attended his Lordship
some little time, till being all ready they road in brave Equipage to
Moore-fields (the Lord Major being in a most sumptuous Gowne of
Crimson velvet) where 500. of the Companies all in coats of Velvet,
every man of them having a Chaine of gold; Also every Horseman had
a foot-man to attend him clad in a footmans Jacket and breeches accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all trim'd and set out with the colours that belonged to those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45790:2"/>
which they were free of. Also every Company had a horse-man
which road severally in the front of each of them, which horse-man
did likewise beare the Armes of such a one Company as hee attended,
he being in all parts suited <hi>Cap ape</hi> accordingly.<figure/>
            </p>
            <p>All these attended his Lordships comming and then they all road in
order to the further grounds joyning upon <hi>Kingsland,</hi> where they met
his Majesty, with the Queen, the Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi>
with the Princesses, Prince Palatine, Dukes, Marquesles, Earles, Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
Barons, Lords, Knights, Gentlemen-Pentioners, Ladyes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
together with 20. Scotish Lords and others; with his Majesties
Guard, and others of his followers, with the spectators of all degrees,
sexes, Ages, and sizes, were innumerable: The bankes hedges, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
streets, stalls, and windowes were all embroydered with
millions of people, of all sorts and fashions.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>And all the way the boyes did climbe up trees,</l>

lighted and refreshed himselfe, and a learned Speech made by Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Gardner</hi> the Recorder, which done, his Sacred Majesty without
delay of time Knighted the Lord Major and the Recorder; the said
Horse-men humbly saluted his Majesty, and in a most commendable
and worthy manner brought his Majesty into the City at <hi>Moore-gate,</hi>
where all along by <hi>London</hi> Wall as far as from thence to Bishops<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate:
some of the Companies stood in their Livery, within places<figure>
                  <head>Gratious Soueraigne</head>
               </figure>
conveniently railed with Timber, their standings being adorned with
Flags, Banners, Pendants, and Escouchions, and other hatchments,
with blew cloth on the railes untill such time as they came as far as St.
<hi>Laurence</hi> Lane end in Cheape-side, downe which Lane his Majesty
turned to the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> where he dined in a most Royall manner,
where no cost was spared, and where his Majesties gracious Presence
and acceptance was acknowledged by the Lord Major, and the whole City to the best cheare.</p>
            <p>The rest of the Companies of <hi>London</hi> were all placed in their stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
from the west end of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> Lane through Cheape-side,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45790:3"/>
and up Pleer-street to Temple Barre, adorned and set forth with such
accoutrements as was done by the other Companies before.</p>
            <p>After his Majesty was passed to the Guild-Hall, the 500. men and
horse, with their footmen, they passed up Cheap-side, and there in
<hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard they did set themselves in their former order; and
attended till his Majesty had dined.</p>
            <p>Note that the Kings Majesty with the Queen, the Prince, and the rest
of the Royall off-spring that were there, did dine at the east-end of the
<hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> in a place called the <hi>Hustings</hi> Court: The rest of the
Lords, Ladies, and others also dined in the Hall.</p>
            <p>After dinner, the Lord Major, with his brethren the Aldermen and
the 500. Horse conducted his Majesty from the Guild-Hall, with 14.
Trumpets with Banners in Scalet Cloaks, Sac-Buts, Cornets, and all<figure/>
instruments of musick usuall, with bells ringing at 121 parish Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
where there was no failings in expressions of love and loyalty by
the people, as appear'd by their shouts and acclamations: As also all the
Conduits in the City as his Majesty passed by ran with Claret wine &amp;
Sack with drinking of innumerable healths to his Majesty (which healths
I hope will not prove sicknesse to any.) In this magnificent manner (the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45790:4"/>
Lord Major, with the rest before mentioned, every one of the 500. foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that attended the 500. horse-men having a guilded Truncheon in
the one hand, and two Torches in the other; they brought his Majesty
to his Palace of white Hall, where the Lord Major and the rest
most humbly tooke their leaves of his Majesty, who gave them all
hearty thanks for their so large demonstrations of their loves and loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
This being done, the said 500, horse-men, with foot-men and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
returned back, attending the Lord Major to his house, of whom his
Lordship most kindly took his leave, and every man retired to his home.</p>

                     <p>WHose Royall presence doth now againe revive our once dejected
hearts, beeing overwhelmed with sorrow for your Majesties so
long absence: Behold, behold most royall Soveraigne, how your
loyall subjects, and wel affected people tryumph, making such acclamations
of joy, as not only happy of your Majesties returne, but safe returning; their
hearts, hands, and countenances speak that which their tongues are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to expresse. True subjects are joyfull whilst ill-affected Traytors, bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rush
like, bow down their heads, as being fearfull to behold so sacred a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
as your royall selfe, whose pious &amp; religious actions are no lesse then
quotidian Lectors to be read to all Christian Princes abroad, and a pattern
to all your Subjects at home, <hi>Pompey</hi> is forced to fly, when mighty <hi>Caesar</hi>
once doth come in place, so let all your enemies fly and bee consumed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your sacred person. Welcome, welcome, dread Soveraign, upon which
words should my tongue for ever harpe, yet would my heart still confesse
that expression were wanting unto my loyall desire: Blessed, and for ever
let them be happy, those loyall, and our well affected brethren, the <hi>Scots</hi> I
meane, which gave so good entertainement to so royall a Prince, whose
Raigne, your well-affected Subjects here present; do pray to the Heavenly
Iehovah, who hither to hath been your Majesties Protector and defender,
may be as long as happy, which Conjunction will prove a happy Vnion.
So the great God of heaven blesse your sacred Majesty, your royall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort,
and our most hopefull Prince, and the rest of the Royall Progeny with
health, peace, and happinesse in this World, and eternall joyes in the next.</p>
