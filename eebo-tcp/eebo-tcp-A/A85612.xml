            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Great NEWS from the KING's Camp at Namurre, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>YEſternight when we opened the Trenches, we began to fire from one of our Batteries, and the reſt will be ready this Week to Play upon the Place with 200 Cannon and 60 Mortars, ſome of them throwing Bombs of 700 Weight. We deſign to attack none of their Works, till the breaches be ſo great as the Defendants may have but little advantage of the Aſſailants. The Circumvallation of the Camp is about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Leagues in Circumference, and ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as that the French cannot hinder the Siege, tho' they had an Army able to attempt it. The King views the Enemies Works every day, and as he view'd one of their Works yeſterday, they fired hard upon him, and one Bullet came very near him. Deſerters come by 30 and 40 in a day from their Out-works, and tell us that the Garriſon are very buſie fortifying themſelves. And it's thought by ſome that <hi>Boufflers</hi> who is ſtill in the place with ſome Ingineers and a great number of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers, and the 1000 Dragoons that he brought with him, will quickly tire the Souldiers out, by the too great fatigue which he puts them too.</p>
            <p>Our heavy Cannon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is arrived from <hi>Maſtrich</hi> tho' the French did all they could to prevent it, particularly by with-holding the Water by one of their Sluces at <hi>Dinant. Boufflers</hi> hath granted a Paſs-port for the Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> the Governour, to go and ſee his Lady, ready to Lie in. The Garriſon is now ſaid to conſiſt of 15 Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions Regular Troops, 7 of Country <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> and 5 Regiments of Dragoons. The Palliſado's which they had in ſtore in their Fortifications, were burnt on the <hi>7th</hi> at night, but how we know not.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> made a Sally upon the <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> night, but were repulſed with the loſs of 1000 Men as we are informed, and at the ſame time we became Maſters of a ſmall Out-work. The Prince <hi>de Vaudemont</hi> with the Allies, and <hi>Villeroy</hi> with the French, keep ſtill in their old Poſts. Some Incendiaries pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be Deſerters, ſet fire to the Souldiers Hutts, and burnt a conſiderable number of them in the Prince's Camp, thinking the fire ſhould have reached the Magazine, but were diſappointed in that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pignerol. July</hi> 3. The Allies opened the Trenches before <hi>Caſal</hi> on the <hi>27th,</hi> and are already far advanc'd. We hear that the Garriſon made a ſucceſsful Sally, and kill'd abundance of men in the Trenches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paris.</hi> 11. It's ſaid that the King or Dauphin will attempt the relief of <hi>Namurre</hi> being much ſurprized with that Siege. That 14000 men are ordered thitherward from <hi>Germany,</hi> and 12000 from the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſts. <hi>Caſtle-Follet</hi> is at the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity for want of Proviſions. <hi>Vauban</hi> hath rais'd a new Battery of 60 Guns at <hi>Brest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Turin,</hi> July 2. The Allies have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced 250 Paces nearer <hi>Caſal</hi> with their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and fire on it from their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. The D. of <hi>Savoy</hi> miſs'd little of being kill'd by a Cannon Ball, ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers falling by his ſide; whereupon we have intreated him not to hazard his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon any more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hailbron,</hi> 9. Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> is march'd with the Army to <hi>Sintsheim</hi> to joyn the <hi>Munſterians, Heſſians,</hi> &amp;c. and will be near 50000 ſtrong.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> are now within an hour of <hi>Phillipsbourg,</hi> and <hi>de Lorge</hi> being better, prepares to repaſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and hold on the defenſive; and it's not doubted but the Prince will follow him, his Army being weakned by detachment to the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> and <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Allies are now within 2 hours of the <hi>French,</hi> but they are poſted advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vienna, July</hi> 2. Our Army is ſtill aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling at <hi>Baya.</hi> Letters from <hi>Poland</hi> to day ſay, that the Muſcovites have Beſieg'd <hi>Aſoff,</hi> taken the two Forts at the Mouth of the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> and that two Coſack Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals are marcht to Invade the <hi>Crimee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Toulon, June</hi> 26. Yeſterday Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> appear'd in ſight of this place, and made as if he would have Landed ſome men, but is this day put to Sea again. And one of our Fiſhers who was carried on board, ſays, that many of their men are Sick, that they are in ſome want of Proviſions, and had met with a great Storm on the <hi>24th.</hi>
