            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Doth the man ſpeak truth, when he calls it a <hi>calumniation,</hi> truly and faithfully, and without any <hi>falſification</hi> in the leaſt, to tranſcribe or report the ſayings of men? He is not able to prove that I have wronged the Authors he ſpeaks of, nor any one of them, in the leaſt tittle or iota, in any thing I have cited from them. And if <hi>their ſouls abhor'd the Doctrines</hi> he ſpeaks of, they are in a twofold reſpect, blame worthy; 1. Becauſe <hi>their ſouls abhor'd</hi> ſuch <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which are the manifeſt truths of God. 2.

            <p>Item (towards the foot of the ſame page) why the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>8</label> of <hi>ſuch an unchangeableneſs,</hi> and <hi>any unchangeableneſs,</hi> ſhould be <hi>in ſence the ſame,</hi> he adds (in the ſecond place) this reaſonleſs reaſon. <hi>The true reaſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>why the</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49423:4"/>
               <hi>word ſuch was left out, was becauſe it was a relative term</hi> [and was not this an offence, deſerving the puniſhment of being baniſhed from the ſentence?] and <hi>ſo if it had been expreſſed it would have neceſſitated the Tranſcription of a far larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwins words,</hi> &amp;c.

Now what is <hi>wilfulneſs,</hi> but the fulneſs of the will? and when is the will fuller, then when a thing is willed, or reſolved to be done, upon conſideration, and in order to the effecting or procuring of ſome beloved end? 3.

For is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to repreſent a mans ſaying as errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, without declaring unto the Reader, in what ſence that word, wherein the error is ſuppoſed to lye, is meant or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by him, in caſe it be ambiguous?</p>

And hence it is, that the Apologiſt, and other Miniſters and Preachers of his judgment about the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs of the love of God,</hi> &amp;c. ſeldom preach, but that

            <p>Item (p. 6. 7. 8.) he reaſons moſt abſurdly from the looſe <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> ground of his diſtinction of <hi>a two fold love in God, a love to righteouſneſs, a love to perſons.</hi> For ſpeaking of that <hi>love,</hi> about which only the queſtion ſticketh between the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49423:5"/>
and his opponents, <hi>viz.</hi> a love of complacency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the perſons of men, God loves no mans <hi>perſon</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially or ſimply conſidered, but onely as qualified with <hi>righteouſneſs:</hi> as on the contrary, he hates no mans perſon, with an hatred oppoſite to this love, ſimply conſidered (this being the workmanſhip of his own hands) but onely as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with ſin and unrighteouſneſs. So that when God <hi>loves</hi> a righteous perſon, he doth not love him with a twofold <hi>love</hi> (as the Apologiſt weakly ſuppoſeth) with one, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> another in reſpect of his <hi>perſon;</hi> but he loves the <hi>perſon, mediante juſticia,</hi> or becauſe of that <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> which he findes in him: and would not <hi>love</hi> him (I ſtill mean, with that kind of <hi>love</hi> mentioned) if <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> were not found in him. The reaſon is, becauſe this love of his to <hi>righteous perſons,</hi> formally <hi>[i. e.</hi> as righteous] and concretely conſidered, is uniform and <hi>unchangeable:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any other object of it, but onely a perſon, or perſons, ſo qualified. From hence likewiſe it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, how impertinent the ſimilitude is, upon which the Apologiſt, for want of better ſupports, ſtatuminates his cauſe. <hi>A Prince</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that loves a Loyal and faithful ſubject, but when he proves diſloyal, he hates him. Will any man deny that the Princes affections are changed? And yet he continues to love loyalty, and hate diſloyalty.</hi> Who with half an eye, ſeeth not, but that if this Prince were like unto God in his love to a <hi>loyal and faithful ſubject</hi> [i. e. could love no <hi>ſubject,</hi> but him that is <hi>faithful and Loyal,</hi> nor hate any, but him that is contrary] it were unproper to ſay that his <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in this kind, either were in the caſe put, or could be in any other changed. And that there is a ſence, wherein the <hi>Love</hi> of God to men, may be ſaid in ſome caſes, to be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch a ſence as that wherein he is ſaid to <hi>repent,</hi> is I ſuppoſe the ſence of all that underſtand themſelves in theſe controverſies. But this ſence doth not ſuppoſe any change, or changeableneſs, in the Nature or Eſſence of God, which is really the ſame with his <hi>love,</hi> but onely a change and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs in his diſpenſations in reference to ſuch and ſuch perſons, which all divines with one mouth affirm may be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed and changed, and this in reference to the ſame perſons,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49423:6"/>
without the leaſt ſhadow of variation, or change in his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And if 1. the love of the <hi>Prince</hi> in the Apologiſts fable, were his nature and eſſence; And 2. This eſſence of his ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely unchangeable, though he ſhould expreſs himſelf according to the different manner of love and hatred towards his ſubject ſpecified, under the different deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Loyalty, and diſloyalty, yet could not his affections, at leaſt in any proper ſence, be ſaid to be changed (which is the ſence wherein I conſtantly deny any change of affection in God, although he ſhould one while love a perſon with a love of complacency, and afterwards, <hi>(viz.</hi> upon his turning aſide from righteouſneſs unto ſin) not love him, but hate him with an hatred contrary to his former love.</p>
            <p>But theſe things are argued to the ſatisfaction of all inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and unprejudiced men, in the pages, and paſſages of my Book of Redemption, lately directed unto. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt ſtands declared on the left hand: and there is little hope of bringing him over to the right, unleſs his company were willing to come along with him. <hi>How can ye beleeve</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt) who receive honour one of another? Joh.</hi> 5. What the Apologiſt adds, p. 7. 8, and part of the 9. <hi>ſibi et muſes canit,</hi> or however it paſſeth my intelligence.

            <p>Item p. 9.

If he underſtands the words in the common and beſt known ſignification, I may reaſonably ſuppoſe he onely read Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> piece againſt me, and not my anſwer to him; and by the far worſe then <hi>ſcurrilous-language</hi> againſt me, which he found there, preſumed that ſomewhat <hi>ſcurrilous,</hi> at leaſt, would be drawn from me thereby, in caſe I ſhould make any reply to him.

If by it he means an exemption of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, from ſubjection unto men, or their Doctrines, or ſayings, 1. He gives it a ſcurrilous nick-name, in terming it <hi>a Monſter.</hi> 2. The Scriptures need not be <hi>ſet on the rack</hi> for maintaining it: they voluntarily, yea zealouſly, and with expreſneſs of plea, plead for it. But whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt makes mention of <hi>conſcience</hi> here, if (in his tittle page) where he confeſſeth himſelf to be <hi>nullius nominis,</hi> inſtead of <hi>nominis,</hi> he had put in, <hi>conſcientiae,</hi> he had given a better and truer reaſon of his non-ſubſcribing his name to his Apologie. For I verily beleeve that his inward thought was, not that he was a man of <hi>no name (i. e.</hi> of no credit or eſteem with men) but that he was a man of too much credit, to adventure it in the crazy bottom of ſuch an Apologie.</p>

But this man would have the world beleeve, that my not <hi>anſwering a matter before I heare it,</hi> is folly and ſhame unto me. So that <hi>Solomon</hi> and he, are of two minds. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther book of the Author he ſpeaks of, intituled <hi>Antapologia,</hi> the greateſt part of it written in the ſame argument, which Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> (a man of more learning, I beleeve, and of a more profound judgement, then the Bookſellers Proctor) proclaimed <hi>unanſwerable,</hi> I did anſwer, and this <hi>ſatisfyingly, and convincingly in the judgement of any impartial man.</hi> And if God ſtood by me to encounter and ſlay that <hi>Lyon,</hi> I ſhould have been able (I queſtion not) by the ſame aſſiſtance to overcome that uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtine</hi> (if the <hi>Goliath</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>in vivis,</hi> which I much queſtion) in whom the Apologiſt ſo much rejoyceth. But in impoſing upon me his will and pleaſure, what books I ſhall, or ought to anſwer, and what not, (whether my health, ſtrength, or occaſions otherwiſe, yea or life it ſelf, will permit me to anſwer any, or no) he acteth the part of High-Presbytery <hi>to the life</hi> (as his Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers phraſe is.) But all books written, either by the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologica facultas</hi> of High-Presbytery, or in defence of the groſſeſt <hi>contra-remonſtrantiſm,</hi> muſt be <hi>unanſwerable</hi> by the verdict of this faculty. The Anſwer in the Preſs to my <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans Debt and Dowry,</hi> muſt needs be <hi>unanſwerable,</hi> becauſe it is written indefence of the common error againſt the truth. But for his <hi>two acute and learned Doctors,</hi> Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Kendal, whoſe labours</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>have had the high approbation of divers learned men,</hi> enough of their wrirings have been anſwered already by men as <hi>acute</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> as they (whom I name in my Animadverſions upon his clients Epiſtle) whoſe <hi>labours</hi> likewiſe (I doubt not) but <hi>have had</hi> (I am ſure deſerve) <hi>the high approbation</hi> of ſundry <hi>learned men.</hi> However, in caſe I ſhall not anſwer the writings of either of them, ſhall the man, or any of his complices, have any more reaſon, upon ſuch an account to conclude me <gap reason="foreign">

I onely cite a few words out of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> one of which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, <hi>bound.</hi> But in caſe Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> hath ſuffered <hi>bands,</hi> and it be <hi>Barbariſm</hi> to mention them, it ſeems there was a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous great difference between the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> bonds, and his: For <hi>Paul</hi> oft mentioneth his <hi>bands</hi> as matter of honour unto him; yea and commends other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> unto their fellows upon the account of their <hi>bands, Heb.</hi> 13. 3.

            <p>Item p. 12.

They are Heretiques, but againſt their knowledge, they are ſo in our opinion, but not in their own, for they think themſelves ſo far to be Catholique [or, Orthodox] that they defame us with the title of Hereſie. Therefore what they are in our opinion, we are in theirs. We are ſure they do wrong to the divine generation, in ſaying, The Son is leſſe then the Father. They beleeve that we do wrong unto God the Father, in holding that the Son is equal to him. The truth is with us, but they preſume it is with them. The honour of God is with us; but they are of opinion that by their beleef they honour the God-head. They are officious amiſſe, but what they do, they judge to be the chief duty of Religion. They are impious, but they think it to be true piety. They erre, but they erre with a good mind, not out of hatred, but out of affection unto God, beleeving that by this they honour and love their Lord. Though they have not the right Faith, yet they think this is the perfect love of God: and how <hi>they are to be puniſhed at the day of judgement for this errour</hi> of a falſe opinion, none knows but the judge himſelf. In the mean time, as I think, God lendeth them his patience, becauſe he ſees, that though they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve aright, yet they erre out of an affection to a pious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
