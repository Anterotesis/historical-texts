            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the forward earneſtneſſe and zeal to the
ſervice in my Lord of <hi>Inchequid,</hi> Collonel
<hi>Vavafor</hi> Captain Jerpſon, and the reſt of the
Officers of the ſmall army here, hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
ſome exploits wherof you
may pleaſe to receive the enſuing relation,
I being beſieged on the north ſide of the
City by my Lord <hi>Muskoy,</hi> M. <hi>Carty Lath,</hi>
and all the reſt of the weſtern forces, and
having notice that my Lord <hi>Roche,</hi> my
Lord of <hi>Ikarn Donbay,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
M. <hi>Richard Butler,</hi> and all the tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perary
forces were drawing uptobeleager
me on the south, I dispatched away the
two Troops then newly landed, under the
<pb facs="tcp:64266:4"/>
command of my Lord <hi>Inchequid</hi> and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Jephon</hi> into the Lord <hi>Roches</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
inexpectance to divert him from
his intended courſe hitherwards, which
ſorted to ſo good purpoſe, as that I ſince
underſtand the tipperary forces have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
him, and that he remains himſelf
upon his keeping in his own Country.</p>
            <p>During the ſtay of theſe Troops there, they were
deſired to the relief of a Caſtle called Rathgogan by
one M. Mead. which M. Iephſon having performed
with a Squadron of each troop, and 80 Muſquetiers
drawn out of his houſe and mine. In his retreat hee
was encountered by two or three Companies from
Mimeallock, onwhom he with a horſe, and another
officer with a foo<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> charged in ſeverall places, and
routed them, ſlaying above 150 beſide 50 ſlain in
relieving the Caſtle. On the 13. of this inſtant my
Lord of Muskry (who hath kept this Camp a long
time at Rochforts Town 3. miles from this City)
cauſed a part of his army to chaſe home our ſcouts
to the very Suburbs where in a bravado they made
a ſtand, wherat my Lord Inchequid, Collonel Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour,
and the reſt of the Officers being much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed,
obtained my leave to iſſue forth immediatly
with 300. Muſquetiers, and two Troops of horſe:
upon the ſallying out they found the enemy retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and purſued him to his quarters, where the main
<pb facs="tcp:64266:5"/>
body conſiſting of 36 Colours as they were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
forthwith appeared, and after ſeverall parties
ſent from the main body to skirmiſh with our men
had bin beaten back, they began to pack up their
Baggage, and forſook their Camp, after whom our
men made all the ſpeed they might: and having
chaſed them two or three miles, charged upon the
Rear routed the whole Army, which betook it ſelf
to flight, and took all their Carriage and Luggage,
wherof the Lord of Muskeries own Armour Tent,
and Trunks were apart. ſlew about 200. of their men
that took to firm ground, and retired without loſſe
of a man, &amp;c.</p>
