            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any will perhaps wonder, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo many famous Authours,
Antient and Modern, who have
written of <hi>VIPERS,</hi> I ſhould
yet undertake to labour in an
Argument, which in all likelihood they ſhould
have exhauſted. But if reflexion be made
on the many wonders, that are found in the
Body of this Animal, it will be eaſily granted,
that it cannot be inquir'd into with too much
exactneſs, and that it is not a work, that can
be finiſh't at one or two ſittings.</p>
            <p>What Obſervations have been left us by
knowing men, although they be not carried to
their perfection, may be very uſeful to thoſe,
that are come after them, to make them diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
what had eſcaped their diligence. And
without this aid, I ſhould not have had the
<pb facs="tcp:60888:4"/>
confidence of undertaking this Work; in which
I have propos'd to my ſelf three main things,
that may much contribute to the illuſtration
of the Hiſtory concerning <hi>Vipers.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi>
is, to examine ſundry Obſervations of the
Antients, which have hitherto paſs'd for
true, though moſt of them are not ſo. The
<hi>ſecond,</hi> to give an accompt of other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
which have been unknown to our
Predeceſſors. The <hi>third,</hi> to find in the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
which cauſeth ſo many miſchiefs, Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Remedies againſt its Biting, which
had not been diſcover'd before, and may
ſerve to overcome many troubleſom Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
which the ordinary Remedies were not
able to conquer.</p>
            <p>The Enterpriſe, certainly, is bold; and,
I confeſs, I ſhould never have compaſs'd it,
what hope ſoever I might have conceived
of it, had I not been aſſiſted by ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Phyſitians, whoſe light hath been very
helpful to me.</p>
            <p>Their Modeſty permits not, I ſhould here
name them; it ſufficeth the Publick to
know, that a good part of the rare things
in this Treatiſe is due to them. They had
the kindneſs to meet often at my Houſe for
the ſpace of three months, and there to ſee
<pb facs="tcp:60888:4"/>
made exact Diſſections of <hi>Vipers,</hi> which by
my care were brought to me from all Parts
of this Kingdom; and to ſee alſo Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
tryed of their biting, upon divers A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
and to examine their Bodies, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
open'd after their death, to diſcover
the true cauſe of it; and to preſcribe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
anſwerable to their Conjectures,
and to take notice of the ſucceſs of the
ſame.</p>
            <p>In diſſecting all theſe <hi>Vipers,</hi> we were
willing to ſee the parts, which Authors have
taken notice of, and which have alſo been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
in the Books of ſome of them:
And comparing them with the Natural ones,
that were before our Eyes, we found great
omiſſions of very conſiderable parts; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
of ſome imaginary ones, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
and ſcituations of ſeveral that
were ill deſigned, and ill enough placed. It
was thought fit, I ſhould endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
ſomething more accompliſh't: And
Monſieur <hi>Boſſe,</hi> whoſe skill and dexterity in
the Art of Deſigning and Graving is known
and eſteem'd of all the World, in things of
a far ſublimer nature than the Anatomy of
<hi>Vipers,</hi> being happily preſent at one of our
meetings, and taking great pleaſure to oblige
<pb facs="tcp:60888:5"/>
his Friends, expreſſed from that very time,
that he was very willing to ſecond my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions:
And having received from me
a ſufficient number of Subjects, hath taken
the pains to deſign them after the life, and
thereupon to grave all the conſiderable parts
of this Animal. In a word, I have omitted
nothing of what might render my Deſign an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to the wiſhes of all Learned and
Curious men.</p>
            <p>Now as thoſe, who, ſpeaking of a matter
that hath been often handled by others, cannot
but muſt often repeat again, what hath been
already ſaid of it; I thought, I was not to
ſcruple to enlarge my ſelf a little, that I
might not give an imperfect Anatomy of
the <hi>Viper,</hi> of which it was fit enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
as well the great number of the true
parts, that have been known to our Anceſtors,
as the new ones, by me found after them.</p>
            <p>I ſay nothing of my way of Writing.
From a perſon of my profeſſion, you are not
to expect the Elegancy and Purity of our
Tongue. I thought it enough for me, to
deliver my ſelf clearly and intelligibly,
which is, in my opinion, all that could be
expected from me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60888:5"/>
For the reſt, I think, I am the firſt, that
hath given to <hi>France</hi> a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
in its Native Language. Thoſe who
underſtand no other Languages, may think
themſelves obliged by it, in regard they
would elſe have been ignorant of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of things, that deſerve to be known.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know not, what ground
the Antient Writers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Animal had, to
ſay, that in the Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
the Male did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
his Head into the
throat of the Female, and
there emitted his ſeed, thence falling into
her <hi>Matrix,</hi> where ſhe firſt did form Eggs
and then Young Vipers: That the Female,
finding a titillation from the emiſſion of
the ſeed, ſnapp'd off with her teeth the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60888:14"/>
head of the Male, and ſo kill'd him; and
that the Young Vipers, being ready to be
brought forth, did pierce the Womb and
the ſides of their Damm, to make a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
for themſelves; ſo that by killing her,
they revenged in ſome manner the death of
their Sire.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, that this Story, or Tale rather,
having neither reaſon nor experience on its
ſide, I cannot take the part of thoſe Authors.
I eſteem, that a Viper, which is a kind of
creeping Serpent, is indeed procreated by
the conjunction of Male and Female; but this
is done by means of the Organs deſigned for
Generation; of which we ſhall make a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
in their proper place, and which
this Animal hath common with all others,
and that more in number, than moſt Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
               <p>The Viper differs from other Serpents,
not only in this, that it creeps more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and jumps not; but chiefly herein, that
its little ones receive their perfection in the
womb, and come forth alive after the uſual
manner; whereas the Femals of other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
lay Eggs, which they incubate,
and hatch, either in the Sun, or in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60888:14"/>
The Viper is by many taken for an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of malice and cruelty; but in reality
ſhe is guilty of no ſuch thing, if ſhe be not
hurt or vex'd; for, if ſhe be, ſhe becoms fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
aud bites very piercingly: but ſhe
never aſſaults Man or beaſt, except ſhe be
angred. And if at times it happen, that
ſhe bites ſome perſon or other ſleeping in
the field, certainly that Body muſt have
thruſt or otherwiſe hit her; for elſe ſhe
would never have bit him.</p>
               <p>It may very well be ſaid, that by that
means the Stratagem of <hi>Annibal</hi> ſucceeded,
when he cauſed a quantity of earthen Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
fill'd with Vipers to be thrown into the
Shipps of the King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
in regard that on the one hand the
Pots being broken, did hurt and anger the
Vipers, and ſtirr'd them up to bite whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was within the reach of their teeth; and
on the other, the ſight of theſe creeping
Creatures, ſcattered about here and there in
the Ships, frighted the Souldiers and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd
them, ſo that they could not fight.</p>
               <p>Mean time a Viper attacks and kills thoſe
Animals, which ſhe means to devour for
her nouriſhment, as Spaniſh Flyes, Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Froggs, Mice, Moles, Lizzards and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60888:15"/>
like; which ſhe ſwallows whole, after ſhe
hath kill'd them with her bigger Teeth.
The ſmaller prey ſhe ſends down whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her ſtomach; the bigger ſhe partly lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in her ſtomach, partly in her wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
               <p>There can hardly be made any perfect
digeſtion in the Stomach of Vipers, both
becauſe the heat is there not well united, by
reaſon of the great aperture, there is at the
mouth, where the Oeſophagus or Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ends; and becauſe they have not moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
enough to help the fermentation and
the Concoction of food. But yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not * the conveyance of the Juyce and
of the fineſt part of the ſwallow'd animals
into all the parts of their body for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Which is not performed but in the
ſpace of many days, during which, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
and ſuperfluities of the nutriment
are carried into the Gutts, whence the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
parts of them are caſt out again by the
mouth. This we have lately obſerv'd in a
great part of the body of a Lizzard, which
a Viper vomited up twelve days after ſhe
was taken; where we ſaw, that, of the head
and of the fore-leggs, and of that part of
the body contiguous to them, and which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60888:15"/>
could conveniently be placed in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
of the Viper, there reſted little more
than the Bones; but that a great part of
the trunk, together with the hind-leggs,
and the whole taile, were in a manner in a
condition, as if the Viper had ſwallow'd
them that day, as appears in the 2d Figure.
But we were ſurpriſed, among other things,
to ſee, that the parts, which could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the ſtomach, and had remained in the
<hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> had kept ſo long well, I mean,
without ſuffring any alteration in the skin;
although thoſe underneath had contracted
ſome lividneſs, which perhaps was an effect
of the venemouſneſs of the biting.</p>
               <p>Vipers can live for many months without
any food, and after they are once taken,
they eat no more, living then only upon
the Air, they take in. And although they
be greedy enough of Lizzards, when at
liberty, yet I have found, that having
thrown Lizzards alive into a barrel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I kept a good number of living Vipers,
and leaving them there whole days and
nights, the Vipers did no hurt at all to the
Lizzards.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance of Vipers is viſcous and
compact, and periſheth not but very ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60888:16"/>
and difficultly. Their Skin is ſcaly, which
defends them from the injuries of the Air,
and maketh that the Spirits unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo firmly to the body, that 'tis hard
for them to quit it; and we ſee, that they
remain yet many hours in the Head and in
all the parts of the trunk, after tis flead,
emptied of all the gutts, and cut in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pieces: And this is the cauſe, that the
motions and windings ſo long continue in
them; that the Head is able to bite, and
its biting as dangerous, as when the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
was entire; and that the Heart, even
after it is pull'd out of the body, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from the other inward parts, keeps its
beating for many hours. Whence it may
be concluded, that the Viper, which is
compoſed of parts ſo cloſely united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in which are found ſuch perfect
Spirits, can impart to Man what it hath
moſt accompliſht and in ſo great abundance:
So that we need not wonder, if we find the
remedies, we draw from its body, are of a
not-ordinary vertue.</p>
               <p>A Viper voids not much excrement,
and what ſhe voyds is not offenſive, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
that of <hi>Snakes</hi> ſtinks much, and hath the
ſmell of ſtale and corrupt Urine. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60888:16"/>
have we ever found any ill ſmell in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
the veſſels, wherein we uſed to
keep Vipers alive, unleſs ſome viper or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had been dead and putrifyed. For my
part, I have never received any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from any ill air, which ſome pretend to
iſſue forth at the opening of thoſe Veſſels.</p>
               <p>Vipers make no holes in the Earth to hide
themſelves in, as other Serpents do; but
ordinarily they hide themſelves under
ſtones or old ruines, where they may be
often found heaped up and wound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in cluſters. When 'tis fair weather, they
love to lurk under buſhes and tufted plants.</p>
               <p>They commonly couple twice a year, the
firſt time in the month of <hi>March;</hi> and they
goe with their young ones 4. or 5. months;
which being perfect, come forth one after
another by the common opening of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi>
and in great number, even to twenty and
twenty five. They draw out with them, in
coming forth, a ſmall tegument faſtned
to their navil, like an after-birth, which
the damm by little and little ſeparateth
with her tongue, as they are born one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another.</p>
               <p>Vipers caſt a skin every Spring, and
ſometimes even in Autumne: which hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60888:17"/>
occaſioned a belief, that they have a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
able to make young again, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the ſtrength of thoſe, who uſe them
either for a preſervative or a remedy.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of its external Figure.</head>
                  <p>THe Vipers, Males and Females, that
we have in <hi>France,</hi> being of their
full growth, are in the middle of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60888:17"/>
a good inch thick; but that of Females
is bigger, when they are with young, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
when the young ones are ready to
come forth. They are commonly two
good foot long; and there are ſome, that
are ſomewhat longer. Their head, which
is flat, hath a kind of border round about
the edges of its upper part, and in that
they differ from <hi>Snakes,</hi> which have all
that round bared and taken down, and
the Head ſharper and narrower, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their Body.</p>
                  <p>The Head of a Viper is in all an inch
long, and towards the top thereof it is 7
or 8 lines broad; and then leſſening by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, it is not above 4 or 5 lines
broad about the Eyes, and 2 lines onely
about the end of the Noſe. It is about 2
lines thick.</p>
                  <p>The Neck, taken where it begins, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the bigneſs of a mans little finger.
That of Males is ordinarily a little thicker
than that of Females: Yet there are ſome
of the Females, which, when full, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to have a Neck even thicker than that
of Males.</p>
                  <p>The Tail of Males is always longer and
thicker than that of Females, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60888:18"/>
the parts of generation double; and in
their Interſtices there are alſo two ſmall
bladders ſomewhat long, ſerving for a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatory
of their ſeed, which make their Tail
bigger. This of the Males is about four
fingers ſquare long; but that of Females not
much longer than three. The upper part
of the Taile of Males is, at its beginning,
about the bigneſs of their Neck, and ends
ſharp, as doth alſo the Tail of Females.
Neither of them ſtings, nor have they any
venom in them.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the Skin of Vipers.</head>
                  <p>NO Vipers are ſeen, but they have
their skin ſpotted: but the ground
of the colour is different enough; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
'tis whitiſh, ſometimes reddiſh, in
ſome 'tis gray, in others yellow, in others
tawny. This ground is always ſpeckled
with black ſpots, or at leaſt much darker
ones than the reſt; they appear like diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
cyphers or characters, ranged in ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
even enough, and anſwering one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
eſpecially on the top and the ſides
of the Body. Some of them are alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60888:18"/>
the Head, and among the reſt, two
in the form of Horns, which take
their riſe between both Eyes, and open
themſelves and reach towards the two ſides
of the top of the Head, and are ſometimes
4. or 5. lines long, each of them, and
halfe a line broad. Oppoſite to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of theſe two horns, there appears a
ſpeck of the bigneſs of a ſmall Lentile,
being ſhaped like the Iron of a Pike: And
this is that, which is, as 'twere, the firſt and
principal of all theſe ſpecks, ſeeming to
guide them all along the Back-bone.</p>
                  <p>The Skin is all cover'd with Scales, the
greateſt, ſtrongeſt and moſt conſiderable
of which, are thoſe under the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and ſome under part of the Head.
Their bigneſs and force is neceſſary for
them, to fortify the Viper in the place
that is feebleſt and leaſt capable of defence;
beſides that they ſupport the Animal, and
ſerve it, inſtead of feet, for creeping, and
for carrying its Body to and fro. Theſe
great Scales are alwayes of the colour of
Steel, from one end to the other, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from thoſe of Snakes, which are
commonly mark'd with a yellow colour.
They open, and ſtick, according as the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60888:19"/>
Viper will recoyle, or ſtop. The extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of theſe great Scales is, as 'twere,
ſow'd beneath the other little Scales, which
cover the whole Body. Thoſe under the
Head, reach in their breadth towards the
two Jawes; they are leſſer, ſtreighter and
ſofter than thoſe under the Belly, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
at other ſmaller Scales, which go
on to cover the whole undermoſt part of
the Head, and, beginning their ranks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ends before, continue them at
the ſides of thoſe ranks as far as towards
the bottom of the Jaws.</p>
                  <p>From the beginning of the Neck unto the
beginning of the Tayl, there are as many
great Scales, as there are <hi>vertebraes</hi> or
Joynts of the Back-bone; and as each
<hi>Vertebra</hi> hath on each ſide a Ribb, each
Scale meets by its two ends the points of
both, and ſerves them for a defence and
ſtay: the ſame abuts alſo on each ſide at
the end of one rank of litle ſcales, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the reſt of the Body is covered, and
it ſeems, that 'tis placed there to receive
them. Theſe ſmall ſcales are admirably
well ranged, they lying upon one another,
and repreſenting each as 'twere halfe a round
towards their extremity. Their ranks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60888:19"/>
always ſloping, whether you look on
them from the right ſide to the left, or
from the left to the right; ſome what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of the ranks of ſmall Slate,
that are cut in a halfe round, in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſeen in olthe tops of houſes. Theſe
Scales are more or leſs great, according as
the part of the Body, they cover, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or leſſer. The Symmetry of them is
always very exquiſite and even; and is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the great Scales, united to their
ranks beneath. There are alſo obſerv'd on
the top of theſe Scales, and all along the
Back, many fine and diſtinct Lines, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſtreight along from the hind-part of the
Head unto the end of the Tayl.</p>
                  <p>The Scales, that are under the Tayl from
the beginning of it to the end, are divided,

                  <p>The Skin of the Head is alſo covered
with ſmall ſcales, and at the end of the

the Skin of a Viper: the biggeſt is that of
its Throat; the other four are thoſe of the
two Noſtrils, and of the two Eyes; the
laſt is that, which is at the lower-moſt end
of the Belly, where is the beginning of the
Tayl, which incloſeth not only the hole of
the Gut for voiding the excrements, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
thoſe of the organs of Generation, as
well of Males as Females. This laſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is ſhut by the laſt of the great ſcales,
which is advanc'd in the form of a half
round, and opens in falling lower at the
time of copulation, as it alſo doth at the
time of the young Vipers being caſt, and
of the excretion of their dung. The Throat
opens and ſhuts at the will of the Animal;
the Noſtrils remain alwayes open, and
the Eyes have Eye-lids to cover them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occaſion. There is no aperture in the
skin to give any paſſage for Hearing; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it ſeems, ſerving herſelf of the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the Noſtrils for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Vipers ordinarily caſt their ſcaly Skins
twice a year, under which they are furniſht
with another, quite formed, which at
firſt appears much fairer, and of a more
vivid colour, than that which is caſt off.
And there is alſo inſenſibly forming an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

new one, againſt the time it is to

                  <p>This <hi>External</hi> deſcription might be

The former is made up of a Bone ſome

accompanied with ſome ſmall veins and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.
This Bone is alſo cover'd with the

two points advancing, which in part embrace
that Bone; it is in the ſuperior part ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded

the faſhion of a Corniſhe; it is notch'd on
both ſides, where the Eyes are ſcituate, and
there forms their round holes, of which the
hind-part reaches out to a point, to which
anſwers that before. The whole Skull in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60888:22"/>

the Skull a-croſs behind the two Eye-holes;
the third, ſeparates it alſo croſs-ways

may be obſerv'd the figure of an Heart well

                  <p>There is alſo another great Suture, round
about the nethermoſt lateral parts of the
Skull, by which it may be divided into two
bodies, an upper and lower. This latter is
made in the form of a turn'd back, going
long wayes, hollow in the middle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
the ſhape of a Culter, which
hath a kind of little wing on its ſides, and

                  <p>ON each upper ſide of the middle of

the Skull, there is a little flat Bone, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a line and an half long, that is
firmly articulated to it, which following
and adhering to the ſame ſide of the Skull
as far as to its hind-part, becomes to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulated
anew to another flat Bone, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and ſtronger, and forming there as
'twere an Elbow. This latter Bone goeth
downwards, and is ſtrongly jointed to the
inward end of the lower Jaw; in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of which articulation, the upper Jaw
terminates, and is there jointed, but not ſo
firmly, becauſe it hath other articulations,
which the lower hath not. Theſe Bones,
which are like <hi>Clavicles,</hi> ſerve both for a
ſupport to the Jaws, and to open and ſhut
them; and for this purpoſe they are aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Nerves and Muſcles, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath provided them with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60888:25"/>
There is alſo at each advancing end of
the Eye-hole a little flat Bone, being about
a line and an half long, which is ſtrongly
articulated with the root of the Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooth,
and by its other end is alſo firmly
jointed to the middle of the upper Jaw, as
well to ſupport it, as to make it advance
together with the great Tooth, when it is
raiſed to bite.</p>
                  <p>The upper Jaw is divided in two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and is ſeparated, by the griſtly Bone,
from the Noſe, where its two ends are arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
on each ſide. Theſe two Jaws are
much more inward than thoſe below, and
the great Teeth are ſeated without their
rank and at their ſide, tending outward,
and do ſerve them for a defence. They are
made up, each of one only Bone, that is
about ſix lines long.</p>
                  <p>The lower Jaw is alſo divided in two.
Theſe Jaws are annexed, before, one to
the other, by a Muſcle, which opens or
ſhuts them at the pleaſure of the Animal;
and they have no other articulation but
that, we have ſpoken of about their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
end, <hi>viz.</hi> with the Clavicle coming

Jaws is compoſed of two Bones, articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
together towards the middle of the
Jaw; that which is before, embraces
above and below that which is behind, and
can bend it ſelf outward in this place, when
the Viper will bite, and is a little curved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
toward its extremity; and 'tis upon
this Bone alone, that the lower Teeth are

                  <p>THe Opinions of the Antients have
been very differing about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the great Teeth of Vipers, and moſt
have held, that in this the Female exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Male, and that the plurality of the
great Teeth was the chief mark, whereby
to diſtinguiſh her from him. I have been
careful to inform my ſelf about it, and have
taken pains to grovel with a great deal a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
in the gums of innumerable Vipers;
but all being well examined, I have not
found, as to this point, any true difference
of one Sex from the other, but ſometimes
more, ſometimes leſs Teeth in one and the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60888:26"/>
other. I have caſually met on each ſide
with two great Teeth fixed, placed very
near together, and on the ſide of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
as well in Males, as Females; but in
moſt of both Sexes I have found only one,
fixed on each ſide, cover'd, to two thirds
of their height, with a Tunicle or Bag ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
thick, fill'd with a yellowiſh juyce,
which is tranſparent and pretty fluid; and
in this Veſicle, in the midſt of this juyce,
and under the great and main Teeth, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
number of Teeth ill ſet, ſome longer
than others, and all hooked, of which I
have counted, in ſeveral Vipers, from two
to five, ſix and ſeven, on one and the ſame
ſide, under the ſelf-ſame Tooth, and in the
ſame Bag.</p>
                  <p>Theſe great Teeth are only in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part, ſtanding on the ſide, and without
the Jaws of the Animal, where they are
like Bulwarks. They are about two lines
long, hooked, white, hollow, and diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
throughout, as far as to their ſharp
point, which is very ſubtle and exceedingly
piercing. They have many little Cavities
towards their Root, in which the other
Teeth are planted. Theſe Teeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
remain lying along the Jaw, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60888:26"/>
their point appears not but at the moment
the Viper will bite; for then it raiſeth
them, and advanceth them jointly with the
upper Jaw, drawn by the Bone, which at
one end is articulated in the middle of it,
and at the other, to the root of the great
Tooth.</p>
                  <p>The yellow liquor, contained in the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicle,
ſerveth not only to moiſten the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and to make them fit for the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Teeth, but alſo to nouriſh them,
and to make thoſe grow, that are there as
'twere in a Nurſery, and are, if we may ſay
ſo, in expectation to ſerve inſtead of the
many Teeth, whether theſe come to fail in
their force, or fall out of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>All the Jaws, both upper and lower, are
fortify'd with bent Teeth, that are hollow,
pellucid and ſharp, as the bigger Teeth, but
that they are much ſmaller. Their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is uncertain enough, whether it be, that
Nature produces ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
leſs of them, or that that fineneſs
maketh them apt to break. There is little
difference, as to the number, in thoſe above
from thoſe below. Ordinarily there are
eight Teeth in each Jaw, but at times I
have found nine, ten, eleven in each. Thoſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60888:27"/>
that advance moſt, are a little bigger than
the deepeſt; and juſt as thoſe below anſwer
in ſcituation to the Dog-teeth, that are
above them, they have at the end of each
ſide one Tooth, that is a little bigger than
all thoſe of the other Jaws, and another,
leſſer, at the ſide, at the end of the part
bent inwards.</p>
                  <p>There is a great difference in the Teeth
and Jaws of Vipers, from thoſe of Snakes:
for, <hi>theſe</hi> have no Dog-teeth; and although
their Jaws are all divided in their foremoſt
part like as in Vipers, yet they exceed them
in the number of Jaws, and in the number
of Teeth; for, they have four Jaws above,
and two below; two of thoſe above are
ſituated all along and cloſe to the rim of
the Lip, and ſerve for a defence to the two
other Jaws, that are ſeated in the ſame
place, where thoſe in Vipers are. Beſides,
I have counted 13 Teeth in each exterior
Jaw above, and as many in each of the
Jaws below, and 20 in each ſuperior inward
Jaw; ſo that I have counted of them to
92 Teeth in one Snake, and all theſe Teeth
are bent, fine, hollow, white and tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
like thoſe in Vipers.</p>

Gums.</p>
                  <p>Theſe great differences of the qualities
in the one from the other, made me believe
that there was a great diverſity in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them, as well as in their ſource; and
I believed at firſt, following Signor <hi>Redi,</hi>
that there might be <hi>Salival</hi> Veſſels in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60888:29"/>
as there have been lately found in
Man, and divers other Animals; ſo that
after many reſearches, made with attention
and patience enough, in many Vipers
Heads, I diſcover'd at length ſuch <hi>Glands,</hi>
proper to form this juyce, and to convey it
to the Gums; and after I was well perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of it my ſelf, I ſhew'd them to divers
of thoſe knowing Phyſitians, that had
met at my Houſe the laſt Year. Theſe
perſons had a mind to ſee with their own
Eyes, and after they had well examin'd the
parts which I ſhew'd them, they not only
found them true, but they there alſo ſaw a
greater number of ſmaller veſſels, than had
appear'd to me, of which ſome, that are
Arteries and Veins, paſs above the <hi>Glands,</hi>
and others, that are <hi>Lympheducts,</hi> run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
ſo that they judged, that I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
aſſert and deſcribe theſe <hi>Glands,</hi>
which I call <hi>Salival,</hi> and which they had
acknowledged together with me; though
Signor <hi>Redi</hi> durſt not ſpeak <hi>poſitively</hi> of
them, becauſe he had not diſcover'd them,
neither had they been deſcribed by any
Author of their knowledge, nor by any
one of mine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60888:29"/>
Theſe <hi>Glands</hi> are found in all the Heads
of Vipers, both Males and Females; they
are ſeated on both ſides, and joining to the
Skull, in the hind-part of each round of
the Eyes, and at the ſame height with
them. There are many ſmall ones join'd
together, which may be call'd <hi>Conglomerate
Glands,</hi> which are eaſily diſtinguiſhable by
their form and colour, which is different
from the Muſcles, neighbouring to them,
and of which there is one, that may be
call'd <hi>Temporal,</hi> which in part covers them
by its extremity. This heap of <hi>Glands</hi>
appears there of the bigneſs of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Eye, and extending it ſelf in length,
continues its progreſs in the Orbite of the
Eye, below, and in part behind the Eye.
Each <hi>Gland</hi> hath its little Lymphatique
Veſſel, which parts from it as from a little
Teat, and goes diſgorging it ſelf into a
greater Veſſel, that runs all along and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
theſe <hi>Glands,</hi> and paſſeth into the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicle
of the Gum, and terminates in the
midſt of the Articulation, which the root
of the great Teeth maketh with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
corner of the ſaid Orbite, and with the
little Bone, which by its other end is articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in the middle of the upper Jaw. This
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60888:30"/>
principal veſſel, which, being conſidered
alone, is very little in appearance, but is
not ſo in effect, ſeing it receives the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of all the ſmall veſſels, that come
from each <hi>Gland,</hi> empties it ſelf into the
Bag of the Gums, and carries thither that
<hi>Salival</hi> Juyce, which may have qualities
approaching to thoſe of the <hi>Saliva</hi> or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of man, or of the foam or drivel of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other Animals.</p>
                  <p>The Nerve, which ſerves in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils
for the faculty of <hi>Hearing,</hi> runs for
ſome ſpace along theſe Glands, which are
alſo, as I have already ſaid, ſmal Veins and
Arteries.</p>
                  <p>But having well conſidered the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
quality, and ſituation of theſe
<hi>Glands,</hi> we judged their formation not to
be in vain; but that their Uſe, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood,
was to receive the humidities
both of the Brain, the Eyes, and the
neighbouring parts; and that their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
was very convenient and even very
neceſſary to the parts, which receive that
liquor, as well for moiſtening the ligaments
of the great Teeth, and to keep them in
a condition of bending, at ſuch time when
the Viper will bite, and to increaſe the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60888:30"/>
Teeth, which Nature hath made and ſet
in the midſt of this Juyce.</p>
                  <p>For the reſt, examining and taſting the
<hi>Glands</hi> as well as the Juyce, we found a
Taſte altogether like that of the Gums,
which Signor <hi>Redi</hi> hath deſcribed, namely
very near the taſte of the Oyle of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
without any bitterneſs, though it
leave, a while after, a little acrimony in the
mouth, ſuch as may be diſcerned in all kind
of Spitle.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſmall <hi>Glands,</hi> which Signor
<hi>Redi</hi> hath obſerved at the bottom of the
Veſicles that contain this Juyce, I can
ſay, that I have with great care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
ſearched them, and that, 'tis true,
I have there found the appearances of
Glands, but having opened them, I ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them but ſmall teeth which were
faſtned there, and are of the number of
thoſe, which I have called <hi>Expectants,</hi>
without finding any thing of a Glandular
nature there, nor that did, in the leaſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the ſhape, ſubſtance or qualities
of the <hi>Glands,</hi> which I have been deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing.</p>
                  <p>The Viper is not the onely among Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
that hath <hi>Salival Glands;</hi> for I have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60888:31"/>
alſo found of them in the Head of Snakes,
which Glands were heaped together long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
and ſcituated near each outward
upper Jaw, ſerving them for a defence, in
a manner, as the Dog-teeth do to Vipers.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations, ſupported by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Experiments, made by us, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
hereafter, have induced me to call
theſe Glands <hi>Salival,</hi> and to aſcribe to
them the very ſource of that yellow Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
which hath been ſo much decryed,
and with-all ſo little known, and is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but a pure and very innocent
Spittle. I hope, that thoſe, who ſhall take
the pains of carefully examining, after me,
theſe <hi>Glands,</hi> and this juyce of the Gums
will not ſtick to give me their ſuffrages.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Tongue,</hi> which the Viper darts
out and draws in often and very
quick, preſents her ſelf firſt of all.
She is placed between the two
Jaws below, and compoſed of two Bodies,
fleſhy, long and roundiſh, and terminating
in very ſharp and flexible points. Theſe
two Bodies are contiguous, and adhere to
one another all along, from the place <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The Tongue may be, in all, an inch and

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60888:33"/>
lower than the bottom of the Throat;
and 'tis firmly annex'd, below the Neck, to
two tendinous bodies, which are two or

                  <p>There are ſome Vipers, whoſe Tongues
have three points, and ſome alſo, that have
four. Theſe points, though often darted
out, prick not, nor hurt any body; though
perhaps they may frighten the ignorant.
They chiefly ſerve Vipers to catch theſe
ſmall creatures, which they have a mind
to devour. The Tongue is envelop'd by
a kind of ſheath from one end to the other.</p>

<hi>pericardium,</hi> which conſiſts of a ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thick tunicle. It hath two Ventricles,
one on the right, the other on the left ſide:
it alſo hath two apertures. The Blood,
which comes from the <hi>vena cava,</hi> enters
into the right ventricle, and being paſſed
into the left, iſſues thence by the <hi>Aorta,</hi>
which preſently is divided into two great

its length and breadth are unequal

bedew'd by the <hi>vena cava,</hi> which ſeems
to ſeparate them all along into two bodies,
and which makes even a ſeparation in their

ſerving to joyn them together in one body:
The upper half of the Liver is continued,

                  <p>The Trunk of the <hi>vena cava</hi> is divided

membrane, very ſoft, and eaſy to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and which may be ſwell'd even to the

firſt receives the animals, the Viper hath
killed with its great teeth, and ſwallowed
whole, it being proper for that purpoſe, both
by its large capacity, and by its length,
which is of a good foot.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Stomack,</hi> which is next, is as 'twere

but one Body with the <hi>Oeſophagus;</hi> but

                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:60888:37"/>
for it cannot much exceed the bigneſs of

it grows ſtreighter, and is commonly very

                  <p>The length and capacity of the <hi>Oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
and the largeneſs of the entry of the

the-nature of the Viper, which ſends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                  <p>THE <hi>Inteſtins</hi> of Vipers are ſituate in
the midſt of the Body, under the
Back-bone, and immediately after the
bottom of the Stomach. I have onely
obſerved three of them, of which the firſt
and narroweſt may be called the <hi>Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi>
the ſecond, which is larger, and full
of many windings, may be called the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi>
and the third and laſt, the <hi>Rectum,</hi>
which alſo is very large and very ſtreight;
and hath its aperture below and near the
beginning of the tayle, at which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
paſs away.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Inteſtins have, at their ſides, <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles,</hi>
together with their veſſels, both of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60888:38"/>
the Males and Females, and the two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the <hi>Matrix</hi> of the latter, which we
ſhall ſpeak of hereafter. They contain alſo
the <hi>kidnys</hi> with their veſſels, which part from
thence, and are accompanied of their veins
and arteries, as alſo all veſſels ſerving for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;
and the Inteſtins themſelves are
not deſtitute of them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>kidneys</hi> are placed below the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
they are made up of many glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
bodies, contiguous, and ranged long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
one after another. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
two inches and an half long, and
two l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nes and an half large upon the round,
which is a little flat. They are of a pale-red
colour. The right kidney is alwayes ſeated
higher than the lower in both ſexes. They
have alſo their <hi>Ureters,</hi> at which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the ſeroſities near the extremity of
the Inteſtin.</p>
                  <p>All the Inteſtins, the Teſticles, and the
kidneys are covered with a very white and
very ſoft <hi>Fat,</hi> which being melted hath
the form of Oyle. At times alſo there is
ſeen in ſome Vipers a little Fat about the
Heart, the Lungs, the Liver, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cloſe to the Gall, and near that part,
which ſome take for the <hi>Spleen,</hi> and others
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60888:39"/>
for the <hi>Pancreas.</hi> All theſe parts are wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
about with a ſtrong Coat, that is firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
faſtned to the extremities of the Ribbs,
which might paſs for the <hi>Epiploon,</hi> if the Fat
were joyned to it: but as the Viper, which
is a kind of Serpent, paſſeth not but among
the imperfect animals, I ſhall not determine
the name of this Tunique, to which the
more Intelligent may give what name they
ſhall think moſt proper.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the Parts of the Male.</head>
                  <p>THE Male hath two Teſticles, which
are ſomewhat long and roundiſh, and
ſharpen a little toward both ends. Their
colour is white, and their ſubſtance glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
Their length is unequal, the right being
longer by an inch, than the left, and this
alſo ſomewhat leſs in thickneſs. They are
not thicker than the quill of the wing
of a great Capon. Their ſituation is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
for, the right begins near and beneath
the Gall, whereas the left begins about
eight lines lower than the right. They are
both ſuſpended in their upper part by two
ſtrong membrans, coming from below the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60888:40"/>
Gall, and are ordinarily covered with fat,
which maketh them hardly diſcernable, by
reaſon of the likeneſs of colour they have
with this fat.</p>
                  <p>From the midſt of each of theſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
from the inward part, one may ſee iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
forth a little Body, long and ſlender, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
enough, and even ſomewhat whither than
the ſubſtance of the Teſticles, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends,
and is faſtned to them all along as
far as to their lower end. It may be called
the <hi>Epididymis.</hi> There appears at the
end of each, the beginning of a ſmall ſtrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
veſſel, that may be called <hi>ſpermatique</hi>
becauſe of its office; which is a little flat,
very white, and ſhining enough, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
filled with ſeed, having the form of
a milky juyce. This veſſel is ſufficiently
delicate, and winds in its paſſage, after the
ſhape of many S<hi rend="sup">s</hi> joyned together, very
pleaſant to behold. From thence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
between the Inteſtin and the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
whoſe <hi>Ureter</hi> it follows unto the hole
of the laſt Gut, at which the Excrements
paſs away. It is alſo accompanied of veins
and arteries from one end to the other, as
well as the Teſticles, and it ceaſeth to be
winding a little before it comes to the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60888:40"/>
of the Gut. Each of theſe two ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique
veſſels comes to rendevouſe at its
proper receptacle of ſeed; of which there
are two, that may be called <hi>Paraſtates,</hi>
which are like white kernels, each of the
length, bigneſs and ſhape of a grain of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus
benedictus</hi> ſeed. Theſe kernels are
ſeated longways below and between the
two natural parts: they are always full of
a milky juyce, and altogether like that of
the ſpermatique veſſels, juſt now deſcribed:
and to furniſh for ejaculation at the time of
the <hi>Coitus,</hi> they tranſmit the ſeed, which
they contain, into the ejaculatory pipes of
the two natural parts, neighboring to them.</p>
                  <p>I may ſay on this occaſion, that thoſe
who have taken theſe two Conſervatories
of ſeed for other Teſticles, have much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
themſelves in the opinion, they
have entertained, that, there being two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
parts, there muſt alſo be for each of
them two teſticles: But their ſubſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quite different from the true teſticles,
by us deſcribed, and their office being to
receive, and not to form, we do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
them but for <hi>Paraſtates,</hi>
which by little and little receive the
Seed, ſent thither by the Teſticles, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60888:41"/>
it, and keep it ready for the time of
copulation, and to perform that in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſeaſonably, what the ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
Veſſels would not be able to execute
ſo ſoon, nor ſo well, becauſe of their length
and windings.</p>
                  <p>The Male hath two <hi>Penes's</hi> altogether
alike, which being pulled out are each as
long as the Tayl of the animal. Their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
cometh from the extremity of the
Tayle, under which they are ſeated all
along, the one by the other. They go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
in bigneſs, as the Tayle does; at
the beginning of which they end, and they
have their iſſue near and at the ſide of one
another, and cloſe to the opening of the
Inteſtin, which maketh in a manner their
ſeparation.</p>
                  <p>Each of theſe is compoſed of two long
and fiſtulous bodies, ſeated together one
by the other, and which joyn towards their
top in one body, which is environed with
its prepuce, and hath its Muſcles <hi>Erectors,</hi>
as many other Animals have. Theſe parts
are within full of many ſtings or pricks, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
white and hard, and very ſharp, ſo ſet,
as that they have their ſharp end variouſly
turned; of which the bigneſs and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60888:41"/>
anſwers to the place of the natural
part, where they are ſet, ſo that as the top
is bigger and thicker, the ſaid ſtings are ſo
too; and they advance and appear not
but when the prepuce, which covers them,
ſhrinks down at the time of the animals diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the coit.</p>
                  <p>Theſe natural parts are ordinarily hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and they ſwell not, nor come forth,
but for the coit; unleſs it be, that, the
animal being taken, they be forced out by
preſſing them; for in that caſe one may ſee
them both come forth equally, each about
the thickneſs of a <hi>date,</hi> and of the length
of two thirds thereof, and their top is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
covered and quite beſet with theſe
pricks, like the skin of a Porcupin; and
theſe ſtings retire and hide themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the prepuce, when one ceaſeth to preſs
them.</p>
                  <p>The iſſue of theſe two parts is environ'd
with a very ſtrong and thick Muſcle, to
which the skin is firmly faſtned, and in ſuch
a manner that it is very difficult to ſeparate
it therefrom: which ſame Muſcle ſerveth
alſo to open and ſhut the Inteſtin.</p>

ſerve for Generation.</head>
                  <p>THe Femal Viper hath two Teſticles,
as the Male; but they are longer
and bigger. They are ſeated on the ſides
and near the bottom of the two Bodies of
the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and the right is higher than
the left, as 'tis in Males. Their Subſtance
and colour alſo are very like them. The
right is about one inch and an half long, and
two lines and an half large; the left is
ſomething leſs. They have their <hi>Epidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymis,</hi>
and their Spermatique veſſels, that
convey the ſeed into the two Bodies of the
<hi>Matrix,</hi> and which are much ſhorter than
thoſe of the Males. Yet I obſerve, that
theſe Teſticles appear not always ſuch in all
Females, eſpecially in thoſe that are emaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
either by ſickneſs, or by long keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for, their Teſticles ſhorten, ſtreighten,
and dry, like as in thoſe, whoſe Eggs are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
great; having obſerv'd, that in theſe
the Teſticles are much ſhortned and dryed
up, as alſo that they are deſcended lower,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60888:42"/>
although the right be alwayes found high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the left.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matrix</hi> begins in a body pretty
thick, which is compos'd of two ſtrong tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,
and which being ſeated above the
inteſtin, hath in the ſame place its orifice,
which is large, and doth eaſily dilate, to
receive at one and the ſame time, by the
ſame aperture, the two <hi>Penes</hi>'s of the
Male, in the Copulation. This Body is
about the bigneſs of a nail of a middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſized
finger, and is divided very near its
beginning into two ſmall baggs open at
the bottom, and fram'd by Nature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and embrace the two members of
the Male in the coit. Their interiour coat
is full of rugoſities, and very hard, as is
that of the whole body, which we have
ſpoken of; ſo that ſhe ſuffers, and alſo feels
pleaſure from, the pricking of the little
ſtings of the Male's members, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hurt thereby, although their points be
very ſharp.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matrix</hi> begins by theſe two little
ſacks or baggs to be divided into two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which aſcend each on its ſide along
the kidneys, and betwixt them and the
inteſtins, as farr as to the bottom of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60888:43"/>
Stomach, where they are ſuſpended by
ligaments, which come from about the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
being alſo ſuſtained, from ſpace to
ſpace, by divers ſmall ligaments, that come
from the Back-bone. Theſe two bodies
are compoſed of two tunicles, that are ſoft,
thin, and tranſparent, being one within
th' other, Their beginning is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of thoſe two ſmall bags, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the two members of the male, from
whence they receive the ſeed each from its
ſide, to breed Eggs of it, and ſo young
Vipers, by the conjunction of their own
ſeed, which the teſticles ſend thither.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Bodies of the <hi>Matrix</hi> do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eaſily dilate themſelves, that they may
contain many young Vipers, unto the time
of their perfection: notwithſtanding the
opinion of ſome, who have affirm'd, that
the <hi>Matrix</hi> of a Viper had but one onely
body; that it was ſeated in the midle, and
all along the Back-bone, and that there
were in it diſtinct Bodies to hold the Eggs,
and the young Vipers, which bodies were
dependants of this <hi>Matrix.</hi> But, I believe,
that the ground of their miſtake hath been,
in that thoſe true bodies of the <hi>matrix</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very delicat and very tranſparent, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60888:43"/>
when they are ſwell'd and diſtended
by the Eggs, or the Vipers, by them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
have not paſſed in their opinion for
true bodies of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> and that they
have taken for it the inteſtins, which are
ſeated in the middle, and appear pretty
bigg and thick, and ſeem to make but
one and the ſame body with the firſt thick
body of the <hi>matrix,</hi> under which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the firſt inteſtin is faſtned and
ſeated.</p>
                  <p>The Viper is not the onely animal, that
hath her <hi>matrix</hi> divided into two like Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
equally placed each on its ſide, and
along the Guts, which ſeparate them; for
I have obſerv'd the ſame thing in many
<hi>Snakes,</hi> which I have open'd purpoſely to
know the truth hereof.</p>

                  <p>BY the particular deſcription, we have
made of the parts ſerving the Viper
for generation, is is eaſy to renounce all
the Fables we finde in Books, concerning
the copulation of Vipers, and the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the young Vipers: ſo that I ſhall
not trouble the Reader any further with
them, but onely intimate, That by the
means of the inſertion of both members
of the Male into the two baggs of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix;</hi>
by the ejaculation of the Seed, made
of them both together, into the two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the ſaid <hi>Matrix,</hi> which are united
at the bottom of the baggs; and by the
concurrence of the Femals own ſeed which
her teſticles emit at the time of the coit;
the Eggs are firſt formed in both the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the <hi>Matrix:</hi> that each is covered
by its little tunicle; that the Eggs of each
body of the <hi>Matrix</hi> are altogether wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
up in one common membrane, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60888:44"/>
called the <hi>Ovarium;</hi> that all is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
in its proper body, the <hi>Matrix;</hi> that
the Eggs there take their increaſe; that the
young Vipers are there formed and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that thence they come forth one after
another by the ſame paſſage, where the
ſeed of the Male went in; and that they are
produc'd alive, as many other animals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any need of the intervention of the
dam's death.</p>
                  <p>We can aſſure the truth of all theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
having verified them by an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
examination of all the parts, at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times, and upon a great number of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and having ſeen the extenſion and
ſwelling of thoſe two bodies of the <hi>Matrix,</hi>
even at the time when the young Vipers
were perfected and ready to come forth;
and laſtly having ſeen the paſſage free, by
which they were to come abroad, and the
young ones actually produced without any
danger to the Dam.</p>
                  <p>We have noted, that the right body of
the <hi>Matrix</hi> of the Viper is ordinarily fuller
of Eggs and young brood, than the left;
that the number of Eggs is pretty unequal;
that at times there are twenty or twenty
five, ſometimes but half ſo many; that the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60888:45"/>
young Vipers take their form and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the Egg; that there they are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and entangled divers wayes, and after
a very pleaſant manner; that they have
each within their Egg a kind of after-birth
depending from their Navil, by which they
draw their food; that in coming abroad
they train it after them, and in part are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
with it; and that their Dam frees
them thereof, and cleanſeth them by lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them when they are born.</p>
                  <p>But although we have, as exactly as we

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Month of <hi>June</hi> of the
year 1668, I procured a great
number of live Vipers, Males
and Females, to put the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in execution, I had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to my ſelf; Which was, to know in
truth all the good and all the evil, a Viper
was capable of. I was happy enough in
exciting the Curioſity of many intelligent
Perſons, and amongſt others, of ſome
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60888:50"/>
Phyſitians of my acquaintance, very
knowing and ſagacious, who were pleaſed
to take the pains of coming to my houſe
every day, to aſſiſt in theſe experiments,
and to impart to me their directions.</p>
               <p>The firſt Meeting of all proved a ſad
one by a ſurpriſing mis-fortune. A certain
Forrainer, drawn to ſee our Experiments
by his own curioſity, felt in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
contrary to his expectation, a great
part of the grievous accidents, which may
be cauſed by Vipers, and furniſht us, ſore
againſt our wills, with an Experiment,
which was followed with circumſtances
too conſiderable to be ſuppreſſed; and I
thought my ſelf obliged to recite them
firſt of all, becauſe it was not onely the
firſt, but the onely, that hath furniſht us
with more remarkable things, than all the
reſt.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman, of 25 years of age,
had been by chance the day before at my
houſe, when five or ſix douzen of Vipers
were brought thither. He would needs
ſee them immediately, and I, being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to ſatisfie his Curioſity, drew out of
the Veſſel one of the Vipers. He was not
contented to ſee her, but took her in his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60888:50"/>
hand, and kept her there for about a great
quarter of an hour, ſuffering her to turn and
winde herſelf about his hand and arm, the
Viper not ſo much as offering to bite him.
Then he tyed her about her neck, and ſo
having hanged her, pulled off her skin, and
emptied her of her Guts to examine them.
I am aſſured, that he would have been
ſoundly bitten at that time, if the Viper
had been vexed; but not having been ſo,
and being pleaſed to breath another air
than that of the Veſſel, where ſhe had been
long ſhut in, ſhe let herſelf be tyed, after
which ſhe could not do that miſchief, which
certainly ſhe would have done, if ſhe had not
been tyed.</p>
               <p>But this proved quite otherwiſe the next
day; for this ſtranger being come again to
my houſe at the hour of the Aſſembly, he
ſaw one of the Vipers upon the Table,
which had been held a long while between
Pincers, and was much angred. He would
take her with his naked hand, though he
was earneſtly warn'd to forbear, it being
repreſented to him, that he had been too
bold already the day before. He had no
ſooner taken her in his hand, but ſhe turn'd
her head to bite him, and with one of her
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60888:51"/>
great bent teeth, ſhe laid hold on the late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inward part of his right thumbe, a little
above the ſituation of the nail. The prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appear'd no more than that of a pin;
and it ſeem'd to us not deep, and on the
ſurface we only ſaw a very ſmall hole with
a very little redneſs; ſo that it was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
but by its colour. There was not
<hi>upon,</hi> nor <hi>about</hi> this litle hole, any ſign of that
yellow liquor contain'd in the baggs about
the great teeth, and which is wont to be
ſhed upon the wound, when a Viper biteth
deep; yet the pricking cauſed ſome pain to
him at the very firſt, but the finger ſwell'd
not of it, no intumeſcence appearing but
ſome hours after, as we ſhall relate more
amply in the ſequel.</p>
               <p>It was found proper to ſcarify the part
wounded, and to make ſtrong ligatures
above the place bitten, both to ſtop the
effects of the Venom, and to diſcharge
the wounded part of the ſame; but the
Patient oppoſed theſe means, not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them neceſſary; and he could very
hardly be perſwaded to endure any ſcarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
after which, he endured alſo an
iron ſpatule very hot and heated over and
over again, held very near to the prick't
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60888:51"/>
place; which was done, to keep the pores
open, and to fetch back and draw out ſome
part of the poyſon: Mean while, we made
the Patient take two drachms of Theriaque
in half a glaſs of Wine.</p>
               <p>In leſs then half a quarter of an hour
after the pricking, the patient felt ſome
debility, and call'd for a chair; he wax'd
at the ſame time very pale, and his pulſe
was found very low, very quick, and even
interrupted. Theſe accidents were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by convulſive motions, and by a ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his whole body, and chiefly of his
neck, and the muſcles of his head: he then
alſo complain'd of a very great pain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Navil; and there appear'd a
coldneſs in his extreme parts, and in the
whole face, which was covered with little
drops of cold ſweat: his lips alſo were
ſwell'd, eſpecially the lower. And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf urged by the pains about his
Navil, and a diſpoſition to go to ſtool, he
roſe, and having voided ſome excrements,
he vaniſh't away, and at the ſame time
vomited not only all the Theriaque he had
taken, but all he had eaten at dinner,
which was yet un-digeſted. We made
haſte to ſuccour him, and found him ſo fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60888:52"/>
that he was not able to goe up again
to the chamber, whence he was come
down. And in regard his pulſe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
weak, low, quick, and unequal, and his
ſwoundings frequent, as well as his cold
ſweats, it was thought ſeaſonable to give
him a drachm of Viper-powder in <hi>Theri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal</hi>
and <hi>Carduus Benedictus</hi> water, and to
apply to him a great Plaiſter of Theriaque
upon the Heart and Stomach, but he ſoon
rejected what he had taken. One alſo
came to give him ſome of the <hi>Orvietan,</hi>
mixt with new powder of Vipers, but
he vomited up that alſo, and deſired to be
put upon a bed, and to have other help ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
to him. During all which time,
he neither wanted his ſenſes, nor the uſe
of reaſon, notwithſtanding all the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Body; and he had had great
averſion to the <hi>Orvietan,</hi> having no faith
at all in it, and not conſenting to take it,
but out of reſpect to ſome of thoſe that
were preſent, who had preſſed it upon
him.</p>
               <p>This vomiting not giving time to the
remedies to convey and communicate their
vertue to the noble parts, it was judged
very proper to have recourſe to the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60888:52"/>
Salt of Vipers, becauſe that being
very volatile and exceeding fit to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conveyed to all the parts, even the moſt
remote, the Patient might thence feel the
effects with more ſpeed and efficacy, than
from all the other groſſer remedies, which
having been rejected as ſoon as they were
taken, had not had time to be made effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
by the ſtomach, nor to impart their
vertue where need required.</p>
               <p>We therefore cauſed to be diſſolv'd a
drachm of this volatile Salt of Vipers in
Theriacal and <hi>Carduus</hi> water, and gave
him about a quart of this mixture; he kept
it a little while, and then caſt up a part of
it, mingled with ſtore of phlegme very viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous.
We made him take another like
quantity of the ſame mixture, which he
alſo kept for ſome time, and then vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up, what might have remain'd of it in
his Stomach, and amongſt it much phlegm.
We continued to give him ſtill more of
the ſame compoſition as faſt as he vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it up; and there were alſo given him
ſeveral Clyſters, to appeaſe the violent and
ſtubborn pains, which he felt about his
Navil.</p>
               <p>His lips remained ſtill ſwolne, his pulſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60888:53"/>
naught, and his ſweat cold, as well as his
faintings continued very long; but having
perſiſted in the uſe of the Volatil Salt of
Vipers, his vomiting ceaſed, and he kept
the eighth <hi>doſe</hi> in his belly, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him about four hours after he received
the miſchief: the ſymptoms leſſen'd from
that time, the cold began little by little to
retire, and gave place to the natural heat,
which appeared ſufficiently about five
hours after the pricking; his pulſe retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and was even and ſtrong, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
high.</p>
               <p>It was about ten of the clock at night,
that the moſt troubleſome accidents diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear'd,
the Patient was happy in his
unhappineſs, in being ſpeedily and rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuccour'd. I left him not, before his
mortal accidents had ceaſed; and then he
was carried to his lodgings, whether I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
him, and he was put to bed;
and by the advice of thoſe perſons, that
frequently viſited him during his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
I made a mixture of one drachm of
Confection of <hi>Hyacinthe,</hi> and of as much
of the Confection of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> and of one
ounce of Syrup of Limons, and of four
ounces of <hi>Carduus</hi>-water, which was giv'n
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60888:53"/>
him at three times, from three hours to
three hours. There were given him Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
to ſmell to, and from time to time
ſome ſlices of them ſugred. He took good
broths, and drank ptiſan made with <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonera</hi>-roots,
and the ſhavings of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,
mingled with Syrup of Limons, he
alſo drank ſometimes a little wine, and
there was diſſolved of the Confection of
<hi>Alkermes,</hi> ſometimes in his broth, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in his ptiſane.</p>
               <p>This is a thing remarkable enough, that
during all the great accidents, his finger
was not changed, and there appeared not
any ſwelling upon it, but that began,
when thoſe accidents ceaſed. In the mean
time, the pains about the navil continued,
though they were in ſome little degree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated;
which obliged the Phyſitians often
to preſcribe him Clyſters. His belly was
a little ſtiff, but not ſwelled; his tongue
was whitiſh, but not dry; his eyes faint and
wan; his countenance pale, and his lips
ſtill ſwelled.</p>
               <p>The ſwelling of the finger extended it
ſelf that night over the whole hand; which
was often anointed with the Oyl of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,
compoſed by <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> and mixt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60888:54"/>
with the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Hungarie's</hi> water, but,
notwithſtanding this anointing, the tumor
paſſ'd onto the arm the next day, with pain
and redneſs, and advanced to the Eye. It
was thought fit to apply fomentations
made with the roots of <hi>Angelica, Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoria,
Carlina,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtolochia,</hi> and with
the tops of <hi>Scordium, Centaurium, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
St. Johns wort, Calamint,</hi> boyled in
White wine, and withal to continue the
anointing with the ſaid Oyle of Scorpions
among theſe fomentations. Although this
was done with great care, yet there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no great effect upon it; the Patient was
ſqueamiſh, and once vomited up even his
broth; but this vomiting continued not.
He alwayes uſed the ſame internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
remedies, and the ſame food; but
although he found his other limbs in a
good condition, and his pulſe very equal
and moderate, nor had any drought, heat,
or pain in the reſt of his body, yet was that
of the Navil obſtinate; and the ſwelling
and the redneſs of the hand and arm ſtill
increaſed; and from the beginning of the
third day, it had ſeiſed on the ſhoulder of
the ſame ſide, and deſcended to the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
upon the whole breaſt, and all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60888:54"/>
parts, and even the whole region
of the Liver, notwithſtanding the continual
uſe of the fomentations, and the Oyle of
Scorpions.</p>
               <p>All theſe conſiderations, joyned to the
hot ſeaſon, wherein we were, made us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
leſt the gangrene ſhould ſtrike to
thoſe parts. It was believed, that, ſince
the outward remedies which had been jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
moſt expedient, had proved ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
recourſe muſt be had to internal ones;
which induced the Phyſitians to give him,
in the evening of the third day, a drachm
of the root of <hi>Contra-yerva</hi> in powder, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
in cordial waters, with as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of <hi>Alkermes:</hi> but we ſaw no abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the redneſs, ſwelling, or pain; on
the contrary, we obſerv'd, that the ſwelling
ſeem'd to ſeize on the left ſide.</p>
               <p>After we had well examin'd all things, we
found it very neceſſary to return to the uſe
of our firſt inward remedy, which had
ſtruck the great ſtroke, and had had a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
good operation; I mean, the <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Salt of Vipers.</hi> This was in the morning
of the fourth day after the biting. So we
gave him half a drachm of that Salt, diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in four ounces of <hi>Carduus</hi> water, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60888:55"/>
we order'd that he ſhould be well covered,
to make him ſweat. This medicine did
work according to our expectation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
for the Patient not onely did ſweat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,
but found a very conſiderable
amendment in all the ill Symptoms that
had remain'd. His pain about the navil
was almoſt not ſenſible; the tumor of his
Lips, and that, which was in the region
of the Liver, Breaſt, and under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
vaniſh't, and that of the ſhoulder, Arm
and Hand was much abated, as well as the
redneſs and pain.</p>
               <p>We thence judg'd, that we ſhould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cure the reſt; and to compaſs it, we gave
the next morning to our Patient a like doſe
of that Volatil Salt of Vipers, which made
him ſweat again very largely; the pain of
the Navil ceaſed altogether; the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the ſhoulder was wholly gone; and
that of the whole arm and hand was yet
much more abated, as well as the redneſs
and pain. And not to leave the cure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
though the patient found himſelf
exceedingly amended, we gave him the
next day another ſuch doſe again, and the
day following one more, whereby the
whole ſwelling, all the redneſs, and all the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60888:55"/>
pain of the arm, hand, and the finger it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
were diſſipated; Mean while there
was applyed to the finger a little plaiſter
to cicatrize the inciſions, that had been
made there, and which were healed three
or four dayes after. Which did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Patient to goe abroad, and to doe
his buſineſs, as well as if he had never been
bitten by the Viper.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that ſhall read this Hiſtory, and
examine all the circumſtances of it, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
and ſurpriſing accidents of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Viper, which we ſaw, and the
effectual operation of the remedies, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to remove them, will therein find
ample matter to exerciſe their reaſoning
upon, and will ſoon judge, that we had
cauſe, accurately to inquire, as we have
done, into all the parts of a Viper, <hi>to</hi>
know them well, and what they can doe;
<hi>to</hi> make a great number of Experiments
upon all its parts, and <hi>to</hi> apply ourſelves
to the preparation of the excellent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that may be drawn from the body of
this Animal.</p>
               <p>The Extraordinary effect of its Volatil
Salt, in ſtopping and in overcoming, firſt
of all the Venome, which ſo violently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60888:56"/>
its tyranny over the natural heat,
and all the noble parts, and which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
would have altogether triumphed over
them: the activity, penetration, and force
of the ſame Salt, going to find out the
poyſon, and expelling it from the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
parts of the body, where it had
fortified itſelf, and whence it endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to regain the place it had loſt, and
where, in the mean time, it ſeem'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
the ordinary moſt powerful remedies.
All this, I ſay, is ſufficient to make it to
be wondred at; and men will, doubtleſs,
averr, that the ill, which Vipers are able
to cauſe, and which every one may eaſily
avoide, is nothing in compariſon of ſuch
a remedy, as the ſame Vipers can furniſh,
and which may ſerve, not onely to heal
their bitings, but alſo to overcome many
other obſtinate diſeaſes, againſt which the
ordinary remedies perform nothing; not
to ſpeak of many other good preparations,
made of Vipers, which we intend to deſcribe
hereafter.</p>

it will not be thought amiſs, if we begin
with the recitation of the Experiments,
by the Examples of its effects. And not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60888:57"/>
to be tedious to the Reader; having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed

ſhall confine my ſelf to what I think de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
moſt to be communicated, what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
moſt to our purpoſe, and what may
give moſt ſatisfaction to the Curious.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt conſiderable Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
was made on a <hi>Dog,</hi> which was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by an angred Viper at the upper lipp.
The dog was not much moved at it at firſt,
but little by little grew ſad, and his jaw
began to ſwell: a little while after he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
up the laſt food he had taken, and
dunged. Then ſome bread, fleſh, and
water being offred him, he would touch
none of it, he remain'd in a proſtrate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
without complaining, the place of
the pricking waxed livid, and this livid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
extended it ſelf to the neck, and as
far as the breaſt, as did alſo the ſwelling.
At length he dyed, but not till fourty
hours were paſt after the biting. His bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear'd not ſwoln, and without we
obſerv'd nothing extraordinary but the
tumour and lividneſs in the part prick't,
and thereabout. The Dog being opened
after his death, we found in the tronc of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60888:57"/>
the <hi>vena cava</hi> a little bloud curdled, and
we noted, that the reſt of the bloud, in this
place, in the heart, and every where elſe,
was of a dark colour, and of a very ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
as if it were blood in part diſſolv'd
and corrupted. The Stomach appear'd of
a darkiſh colour, but the Meſentery and
the Gutts were darker. We found no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in the Heart, Liver, Lungs, nor
the Spleen; all theſe parts being of a
very fine colour, and in their natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>

                  <p>THis Dog howled from the time he
felt the biting, and continued his
howling for half an hour; then he ceaſed
to howl and to complain. The place
prick't wax'd livid, and ſwell'd, as alſo
did the Neighbouring parts. This dog
vomited not, but voided ſome excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which ſeemed natural. He would
neither eat nor drink, no more then the
firſt, and he ſoon dyed, having liv'd no
longer then twenty four hours after he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60888:58"/>
had been bitten. We ſaw outwardly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
un-common, but the lividneſs and
ſwelling at the neighbouring part, and
thereabout. But having opened him, we
found all the inward parts in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
with thoſe of the former dog. 'Tis
true, we did not finde in this dog any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated
blood, neither in the heart, nor
the <hi>vena cava,</hi> nor elſe where, but it was
of an obſcure colour, and of an odd conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,

                  <p>WE had a Dog bitten by an irritated
Viper at the tip of his Noſe, the
dog howled, when he felt himſelf bitten,
but was ſoon appeaſed, falling to lick

bitten became ſomewhat black and blew,
but ſwell'd not; and a little while after the
dog drank and eat, as if he had never

ſwelled much, and was very livid, and the

Two dayes after, to be more certain of the

yet at laſt he received therein a deep bite

extremely, ſo as to be heard afar off, and
ſo continued, toſſing and tormenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

We opened him alſo, and although
the Heart, Liver, Lungs, and Spleen were
in a very good condition, his tongue was
exceedingly livid; his meſentery cover'd
all over with black ſpots, ſome of which
were blacker then lentils, under which
there was coagulated blood; the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and Guts were alſo blacker than

black, and beginning to coagulate in the

                  <p>This laſt Experiment gave us great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
informing us fully of the effects
of the venomous biting of a Viper, and
ſhewing us, that the poyſon goes not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the noble parts, ſeeing we never
obſerv'd any alteration therein, but that
'tis chiefly the bloud it works upon, ſince
it corrupts the ſubſtance thereof, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth
it, or ſeparateth its parts, diſturbs
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60888:60"/>
its circulation; and at the ſame time hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the communication of the Spirits
through the whole body, depriving the
noble parts of them, as well as of the pure
bloud, which was wont to bedew them,
and deſtroying them indirectly, by cauſing
this privation of Spirits and of the good
liquor, whence depends their ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</p>
                  <p>We alſo found thereby that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of the venom of a Vipers biting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
depends from the place bitten, and
from the bigneſs of the veins or arteries,
which the teeth hath lighted on. For, the
tongue of the Dog being full of veins and
arteries, 'tis no wonder, if the Venom,
meeting with them, and finding in them a
large way, very ſhort and very free to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over the bitten animal, did ſoon
produce its effects, and cauſed death much
more ſpeedily, than that, which met on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with ſmall, ſlender and winding branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
by which its way was ſtraighter, more
about, and longer; though it failed not to
do execution at laſt; which it would have
done ſooner, if the paſſage had been
freer.</p>
                  <p>We may judge by the effects of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60888:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Vipers biting in thoſe dogs,
and eſpecially in the laſt, that the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting,
and the extreme pains about the
Navil, which befell the Gentleman, above
diſcourſed of, proceeded partly from the
bloud which was coagulated or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to coagulation in its courſe, and which
could not freely circulate; and partly
from this, that the ſpirits, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the bloud in the circulation, finding
obſtacles in their paſſage, endeavoured to
make way for themſelves, and to that
end, doing violence to the lateral parts
in their way, cauſed in thoſe places the
extreme pains, which the Patient felt
there; which might alſo be augmented
by the bloud, that probably was coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
out of the great veſſels, and might
be diſperſed in the form of ſpots in the
Meſentery, or elſewhere, juſt as in the
body of the Dog.</p>
                  <p>We may conclude alſo, that the cold
ſweats, the convulſions and the faintings,
wherewith the Patient was moleſted, came
from nothing elſe, but the defect of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
commerce of the ſpirits with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parts, and from the goodneſs and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the bloud deſtinated to bedew them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:60888:61"/>
Concerning the ſucceſs of the remedies
employed to cure the ſaid Gentleman, we
ſhall declare our thoughts thereof in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele
of our Experiments, after we ſhall
have given proofs ſufficient to ſupport
them.</p>
                  <p>As to the Dogs, that were cured by lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wound, I think that that was a
good means to recall and draw back the
venom; and I am much of their opinion,
who believe, that if the perſon bitten, or
ſome friend for him, ſhould for a good
while and ſtrongly ſuck the wound, it
would be cur'd, provided that the teeth of
the Viper have not lighted upon ſome
great veſſel, whereby the progreſs of the
venom may prevail over the force of ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I am alſo perſuaded, that theſe ſucked
and recall'd Spirits are incapable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
him who ſucks them, partly becauſe
they have been weakn'd by the action they
have been upon, partly becauſe they are
then deſtitute of the inſtruments proper
to convey and ſecond their action, to wit,
the teeth of the Viper.</p>

               <p>THE Experiments made upon <hi>theſe</hi>
Animals have likewiſe been very
uſeful to us, to know the effects
of the Biting of Vipers, which have been
very like in both.</p>
               <p>We cauſed a <hi>Pigeon</hi> and a <hi>Pullet</hi> to be
bitten by a vexed Viper, almoſt at the ſame
time, in the moſt fleſhy part, namely in
that under the breaſt. We ſoon after ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in both a very thick and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
beating of the heart, which went on
ſtill increaſing, and in ſuch a manner, that
both Pigeon and Pullet were dead in leſs
then half an hour. We ſoon opened them,
and found in both of them a little bloud
coagulated in the heart and the <hi>vena ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
and all the reſt of the bloud blackiſh,
diſpoſed to curdle, and as 'twere turn'd and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60888:62"/>
corrupt; but the Heart, and Liver, and all
the inward and outward parts of a very
good colour, and in a very good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſave that a little lividneſs appear'd upon
the place bitten.</p>
               <p>We have frequently obſerv'd the ſame
thing in many Pullets and Pigeons: But it
will not be amiſs, here to relate the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſucceſs in two Pigeons, we cauſed to
be bitten equally and in the ſame place by
an angred Viper. One of them we made
to ſwallow the weight of about half a
crown of Theriack, a moment before it was
bitten, giving nothing to the other. The
former being bitten, went to and fro in the
room, ſo as not to ſhew any ſign of illneſs,
but the latter was dead in leſs than a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour We afterwards cauſed the
former to be bitten again in the leg; and
then it grew ſick by little and little, and
dyed half an hour after. We found the
place of the firſt pricking much more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
then that of the Pigeon, which dyed
in a quarter of an hour; and even more
then the place of the leg, which was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
afterward. We judged, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
ſpirits unable to penetrate into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
defended by the Theriaque, had
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60888:62"/>
wrought upon the outward part, and
round about the place bitten, where they
had coagulated the bloud, and cauſed the
lividneſs; whereas the like ſpirits, having
met with no reſiſtance in the other Pigeon,
had gained and wrought upon the inner
parts, having left and as 'twere deſpiſed
the place, at which they were entred. We
alſo wondred not, that the Theriaque,
which had vigorouſly repulſed the Spirits
introduc'd by the firſt bite, could not reſiſt
the latter but for half an hour, and that at
laſt it was forced to yield, in regard that the
number of the enemies was great, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weakn'd by the conflict, it had but now
endured, had not force enough to bear up
againſt the new aſſault of the latter.</p>
               <p>We did alſo prick ſeveral times, and
pretty deep, dogs, pigeons and pullets,
with the long teeth of Vipers, ſome pull'd
out of the throat of dead ones, others out
of ſuch as were alive. There was alſo one
of the company, who handling a dead vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
head, had a mind to prick his finger,
and actually did ſo, with one of the great
teeth, ſo that the bloud iſſued. I alſo my
ſelf thruſt into my hand one of them,
and ſo deep, that a piece of it remain'd more
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60888:63"/>
than half an hour in my fleſh; but in all this
we found not the leaſt appearance of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,
nor any ill, but ſuch, as might be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the pricking of a Pin, or ſome ſuch
thing.</p>
               <p>We alſo deplum'd a Pigeon at the moſt
fleſhy place, and holding with both our
hands the jawes of a Viper open, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her raiſe her great teeth, we preſſed
both the jawes at once againſt that fleſhy
part, and cauſed the teeth deeply to enter
into it, and order'd the matter ſo, that the
yellow liquor of the Gums had time enough
to paſs into the wounds, which the teeth
had made. We at the ſame time ſaw, that
the bloud iſſued out of the wounds, and
mingled it ſelf with the yellow juyce,
which remained there. We had then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
a little ſtone, come from <hi>Portugal,</hi> which
thoſe of that Country call the <hi>Snake-Stone,</hi>
being pretty black, ſhining, roundiſh,
and flat, about the bigneſs of a French piece
of five <hi>Sols,</hi> but three times thicker;
which we preſently applyed to the place
bitten, which was cover'd with bloud, and
with the yellow liquor mingled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
The ſtone immediately was faſtned
to the wound, and we perceived nothing,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60888:63"/>
extraordinary in the Pigeon. We might
have believed, that this ſafety of the Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was due to the vertue of this Stone,
which they would aſſure us was infallible
againſt the bitings of Vipers and all kinds
of Serpents, if we had not ſome dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tryed the like Stone upon a Pigeon,
bitten in the ſame place by an angry Viper,
and if that wound had not been follow'd
by the death of that Pigeon, a quarter of
an hour after. We thought, this very
well deſerved another experiment; and
having ſtill the ſame Stone by us, which
ſeem'd to have ſaved the former pigeon,
and ſuch another, which the Lord Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour
of <hi>Spain</hi> had truſted his Phyſitian
with, we by one and the ſame enraged Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
cauſed to be bitten two Pigeons of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
bigneſs and fleſhineſs, each in the
ſame place, well freed from its feathers.
The bloud was ſeen upon both wounds;
but there appear'd but little of the yellow
liquor. We ſoon applyed both the Stones,
one to each Pigeon; they preſently ſtuck
faſt to the places pricked; but we ſaw im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
in both a very high and thick
beating of the heart, which was follow'd
by the death of both Pigeons, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60888:64"/>
at one and the ſame time, in leſs than
a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>We had alſo a mind to know, whether
the Venom, that had ſo much force upon
the bloud, were alſo able to make ſome ill
impreſſion upon the noble or ſolid parts of
the bitten animals, which parts appear'd
to us very fair and very well conditioned.
We gave alſo a Pigeon, dead of a Vipers
biting, to be eaten by a Cat that was very
lean, which fed very greedily upon it; and
the ſame did afterwards eat many more, and
Pullets alſo; upon which ſhe grew very
fat, ſo far was ſhe from finding any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
thereby.</p>
               <p>Moreover we had a deſire to learn, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one and the ſame Viper was able to
kill by its biting divers animals wounded,
one preſently after another; and whether
the Venom was exhauſtible, ſo that the
animals, bitten laſt, might be free from its
miſchievouſneſs. To know the truth
hereof, we cauſed to be bitten five Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
one after another, by the ſame Viper,
which we angred every time ſhe was to
bite: All theſe Pigeons ſoon dyed; and we
particularly obſerved, that the laſt bitten
dyed firſt of all. And as to the Bloud,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60888:64"/>
and all the inward and outward parts, they
were in a manner alike with thoſe of the
Pigeon, that was bitten firſt.</p>
               <p>The various Experiments, we have been
relating, do inſenſibly oblige us to deliver
our thoughts concerning the Venom of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and its operation. We think this to
be a proper place to declare ourſelves here,
and afterwards to employ the reſt of our
main experiments for the defence of what
we ſhall have advanced upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

               <p>THE Antiens, prevented by the
opinion, that there were very
few parts in a Viper, that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
of poyſon, have but very ſlightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60888:65"/>
to the Venom, believing, that the
ſeat thereof was in the Gall, they there
alſo ſetled that of the poyſon, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that the taſte of the Gall, very ſharp
and very bitter, was an argument of its
malignity, and that the veins and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which paſs near the Gall, and may
be followed as far as into the jawes, and
appear the ſame through the whole body,
above and below the Gall, were the pipes,
which Nature had purpoſely form'd to
carry the juyce of the Gall into the Gums,
and that it was that liquor, which cauſed
all the mortal Symptoms, and death it
ſelf.</p>
               <p>But they have not conſidered, <hi>that</hi> this
Choler of the Viper reſideth not in the
Gall; <hi>that</hi> the Galls of innumerable other
Animals have a taſte very approaching to
that of a Viper, and yet are not veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;
<hi>that</hi> the veins and arteries, which
paſs near the Gall, and ſeem to part
thence and extend unto the Gumms, and
all the parts of the Body, are veſſels deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned,
onely to convey the blood, which
have not their origin in the Gall, and
which cannot carry a juyce, which they
could not receive: <hi>that</hi> there is not any

taſte of Gall in all thoſe imagined Veſſels,
no more than there is in the liquor of the
Gums, nor in all the reſt of the Body above
the Gall: and <hi>that</hi> in the whole Bladder
of Gall there is but one veſſel, that is any
thing conſiderable, though it be very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which iſſuing, as we have ſaid, from
the internal ſide of the upper part of the
Gall, deſcends (ſo far is it from aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
and diſcharges it ſelf into the firſt

               </p>
               <p>But not to ſtay upon principles ſo
ſlightly eſtabliſh't, and ill maintain'd, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as we have on our ſide a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Experiments, upon which we are
grounded; We ſay, That the <hi>Gall</hi> of a
Viper is not at all Venomous, but <hi>that</hi> on
the contrary it contains a Vertue, that is
Balſamick and cleanſing, and very proper
for many good uſes; <hi>that</hi> there is no Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
which carries its juyce to the Veſicles,
that are about the great teeth; <hi>that</hi> the
yellow liquor, therein contain'd, is in all
things very different from that of the Gall,
excepting that they are both equally free
from Venom; <hi>that</hi> that yellow liquor is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60888:66"/>
and form'd by the <hi>Salival Glands,</hi>
above deſcribed; <hi>that</hi> it is carried into
thoſe Veſicles or Baggs by the <hi>Lymphatick</hi>
veſſels which part from thoſe Glands; <hi>that</hi>
this juyce is nothing but a pure and plain
<hi>Saliva,</hi> of which we have already obſervd
the uſe; and <hi>that</hi> this juyce contributes
nothing to the venomouſneſs of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
ſince, being taſted and ſwallowed (as
we have often experimented) it does no
hurt neither to man nor beaſt; and ſince
alſo, being put upon open wounds, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
inciſions made in the fleſh, the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rubb'd therewith, and mingled with the
bloud, it annoyes nothing at all: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the judgment of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
very intelligent, and particularly in
this ſubject of Vipers, wo aſſures to have
made a great number of Experiments;
which being contrary to ours, the great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
we have of the abilities and the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that famous man, hath obliged us
to employ the more care and exactneſs, and
to confirm ourſelves, by a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Experiments, which have alwayes
been found alike, in the truth, we here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
and of which we ſhall make evident and
irrefragable proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:60888:66"/>
We ſay further, that there is no other
venom in all the other parts of the Body;
and more, that there is none even in the
great teeth, if the Viper be not alive, and
the biting not accompanied with vexed and
<hi>enraged Spirits.</hi> The hurt, which the
teeth doth, when the Viper biteth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
chiefly in that it opens a door to the
angred Spirits, without which irritation
the Biting of the teeth is not mortal, and
ought to be no further conſider'd then for
the deep and direct wound, which a tooth,
ſo ſharp, ſo long, and ſo ſlender, of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
animal whatſoever, might make. In
which circumſtances, the great number of
Experiments, by us made, hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
us knowing; in regard that we
have obſerved a quite manifeſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the Biting of a Viper angred,
from that of a Viper, which was made
to bite by holding its jaws, and by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
its great teeth into the body of
ſome animal: becauſe this forc'd action
ſerves rather to make the Viper retain its
ſpirits, then to let them out; for which
the freedom of the animal is neceſſary,
the ſpirits not being able to part, but the
imagination and the Choler of the Viper
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60888:67"/>
muſt immediately precede and thruſt them
out. For this way of biting, by holding
the jaws, and thruſting the teeth into ſome
animal, although it emit more of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
liquor upon the part bitten, than the
biting made by an angred Viper, left to it
ſelf, is not followed by any ſiniſter acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and is healed like a ſimple wound,
whereas the other is attended with death,
in caſe we want means of preventing it.</p>
               <p>The effect therefore of the venom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether of a ſpirituous nature, and
not working but according as the ſpirits
are more or leſs iritated and puſh't on,
and according as they finde more or leſs
free paſſage, we have reaſon to impute it
to the exaſperated Spirits, having found
no footſtep of it, neither real, nor appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in all the viſible parts. But the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to maintain this our aſſertion, we ſhall
here give you our thoughts concerning the
action of the enraged Spirits.</p>
               <p>Theſe Spirits then, puſh't on by the
choler, which the Viper had conceived,
finding the apertures, made by the Teeth,
follow their inclination, and as it is their
property, to advance and penetrate, they
at the firſt ſeek out all wayes for it, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60888:67"/>
they advance more or leſs, according to the
facility or difficulty, they meet with.
Thence it is, that the Biting is much more
dangerous, when the teeth light upon
the greater veſſels, than when they only
light upon Fleſh, or the little branches of
the veins and Arteries. So that the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Spirits of a Viper, meeting with the
bloud and Spirits contain'd in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of the bitten animal, puſh and preſs
them to make way for themſelves, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſſing
the particles that compoſe the
bloud, cauſe there a coagulation or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which diſturbs the ordinary Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by this means hinders the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of the Spirits, to the principal
parts, from which depends their ſubſiſtence
and life. And by reaſon of this privation
they muſt ſuccumbe, either for having
been attack't in their fort by theſe vexed
Spirits and infected by them, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
theſe ſpirits of the Viper have made
themſelves maſters of the <hi>avenues,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
the paſſages, by which the blood
and the ſpirits were communicated to
them.</p>
               <p>We conclude therefore, that the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of the Viper being irritated by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60888:68"/>
the <hi>idea</hi> of revenge which ſhe had fram'd
to her ſelf, gives a certain motion to the
Spirits which cannot be expreſſed, and
puſhes them violently, through the nerves
and their fibres, towards the cavity of the
teeth, as into a funnel; and that from
htence they are convey'd into the blood of
the animal, by the opening, which they
have made, there to produce all thoſe
effects, of which we end eavour to give a
reaſon. Others, more able than we, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
carry their reaſoning farther.</p>
               <p>For the reſt, ſome have thought, that
thoſe enraged Spirits have in them a ſecret
acidity, capable to coagulate the bloud,
and to hinder the Circulation, whence the
mortall accidents proceed. But ſince that
this acidity may have been produced in the
maſs of the Blood by its own parts, which
come to be diſſolved and ſevered, when
they are tainted by the venom, and ſince
corruption ſlides into it, as into milk,
which ſowreth and corrupteth of it ſelf,
without mixing any acid thing therewith;
it is not neceſſary to ſearch for a coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
Acid in the Spirits of the Viper,
which cannot be perceived by the taſte to
know the truth of its exiſtence therein;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60888:68"/>
and that the leſs, becauſe <hi>that</hi> Acid may be
naturally formed in the Bloud of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
bitten, without looking for it in the
Viper, as if it had come from thence.</p>
               <p>How-ever this be, we muſt agree here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that this irritation in the phanſy or in
the ſpirits of the Viper is the main cauſe
of the activity and piercingneſs of its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,
and that without it the biting would
not produce ſuch ſurpriſing effects, as
thoſe are, of which we have related ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Examples. Nor is a viper the onely
animal, whoſe biting is mortal: Dogs,
Wolves, and Men themſelves prove that;
and not to go from our Subject, the biting
of Serpents, of which the Viper is a <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi>
is more or leſs malign, according to
the nature of their ſpirits, and eſpecially
according as they are angred and exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>It ſeems, that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in this matter, when ſhe, intending to
kill herſelf, commanded to be brought her
two <hi>Aſpes</hi> in a fruit-basket, and pricked
them with a golden needle, which ſhe pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of her hair-dreſs, and made her
ſelf be bitten immediately by one of thoſe
Aſpes in the right arm, and by the other,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60888:69"/>
in her left breaſt; knowing (as a famous
Author ſaith) that their natural fierceneſs
and cruelty was not ſufficient to execute
well what ſhe deſired, and that it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
this pricking ſhould ſerve to provoke
the ſpirits to bite to purpoſe, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the wound mortal; if at leaſt it be
with <hi>their</hi> biting, as it is with that of our
Vipers, who alſo have this particular qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that not onely they are ſoon angred,
but that in the very moment of the irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they bite with a ſtrange ſwiftneſs;
which ſpeaketh much the ſubtlety and
impetuouſneſs of their ſpirits, whence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
their ſtrength and activity. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
alſo, that in diſtilling Vipers bodies,
we thence draw very ſubtile and very pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
parts, and in much greater quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in proportion, than from any other
animal.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the obſtacle, which
theſe irritated ſpirits of the Viper give to
the communication of the ſpirits of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
bitten, nor the coagulation, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
which they cauſe to the bloud,
are not of that force, that ſpecifique
remedies ſhould not maſter them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
the animal unto that Condition,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60888:69"/>
wherein it was before it was wounded.
Which is that, we ſhall prove in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele
by divers Experiments; where we
hope to ſhew in what manner the remedies
do overcome the powerful action of thoſe
enraged Spirits.</p>

theſe ſix Vipers: At the ſame time we
gave this ſlice of bread to a faſting Dog,
to eat, who was no more inconvenienced
thereby, than if he had eaten a piece of
dry bread, that had imbibed nothing of
this juyce.</p>
               <p>We have alſo often made divers Pullets
and Pigeons to ſwallow pieces of bread dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

that none of theſe animals had any miſchief

               <p>I my ſelf had the curioſity to taſte of
this juyce, which I have divers times
done in the preſence of many perſons,
without waſhing my mouth before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And ſeveral Phyſitians alſo have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted

and to be aſſur'd of the harmleſsneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and 'tis certain, that they were no

               <p>And becauſe it hath been believed, that

by Men or other Animals, that had no
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60888:70"/>

that it was quite another thing, when it
did accompany a Biting, and entred into

the ſame being put upon an Ulcer, a wound,
or a ſimple excoriation made on the skin,
was mortal, and failed not to produce its
effect, three or four hours after it had been
put upon the wound; and that as well upon
Men, as all other ſorts of Animals, without
exception; we reſolved alſo to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Experiments upon this account.</p>
               <p>I can therefore ſay, in the firſt place,
that I have taſted of it my ſelf, at ſuch
times, when my mouth was excoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
upon which I obſerved, that even
my ſpittle was a little ting'd with bloud,
without having perceived any acrimony,
or extraordinary heat. We alſo made a
Tryal upon a Pigeon, which we wounded
under the wing, and in the leg in the ſame
moment of time; and we let into each
wound ſome of this yellow liquor, which
we juſt afore had drawn from the gums of
two enraged Vipers; then we re-joyned
the skin, well to incloſe the ſaid liquor,
and we bound both wounds over with a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60888:71"/>
band, that nothing might run out. We
can aſſure, that the Pigeon felt not any
inconveniency from it, and that we even
found upon the wound, made on the leg,
a coagulated drop of the juyce, round, and
of the ſame colour, as we had put it there,
and the bloud of the place dryed, and that,
ſoon after, both wounds were dryed up, and
heal'd of themſelves.</p>
               <p>We alſo made the like Experiment upon
a Cat, which we purpoſely wounded in
the leg, but he received no harm at all by
it. We have alſo often experimented it

               <p>The ſame tryal hath been thrice made

one day, upon a dog, whom we had woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

and no miſchief at all followed upon it.</p>
               <p>We cannot but adde here an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and we did this ſo often, that not only that
juyce was altogether exhauſted, but that
the bloud began to come out of the gums.
At the ſame time we vexed the Viper,
and made it bite a Pigeon in the moſt fleſhy
part; and we obſerv'd, that indeed the
effects of the venom of the biting were
not ſo quick, the Pigeon not dying but an
hour and an half after it had been bitten;
but then we found alſo, that the teeth of
the Viper were in a manner cover'd with the
crums of the bread, from the force of its
having bitten at it, and that that had hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
them from making a deep entrance,
and that having half ſtop'd up the pores of
the tooth, a good part of the angred Spirits
could not come forth; ſo that the death
of the Pigeon could not follow ſo faſt,

and afterwards rubbed with the Gall of a

gall to be free from all venom, as well as the

of which we often have made good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities

ſome of which have eaten thereof with
greedineſs, when they could light upon't;
and none ever hath felt any trouble after

broyled, and yet hot. The dog, that was
hungry, and felt not ſo ſoon the effects
of the bitings, immediately ſeized on the
head, bruiſed it between his teeth, and
ſwallowed it down: after which we ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a pretty while to ſee, whether the three
bitings would prevail over the devoured
head and neck; but the Dog was free, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ſome blewneſs and a little tumor, he
had at the places bitten, but which little
by little vaniſh't in three or four dayes.</p>
               <p>We made alſo a dog to be bitten three
times in the ſame place, and without broy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the head of the ſame Viper that had
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60888:73"/>
bit him, we caſt it to him, hoping that
he would eat it, becauſe he had not eaten
any thing for many hours before; but the
dog would not touch it. Upon that we
bruiſed and ſtamp'd that head in a mortar,
and ſo cramm'd it down the dogs throat;
rubbing alſo the bitten places with the
bloud of the ſame Viper: which done,
we expected the ſucceſs; which was, that
this head, raw and bruiſed, and if you will,
aſſiſted by the blood of the Viper, being
applyed to the part bitten, had produced
the ſame effects with the former, which
had been ſo ſlightly broyl'd; in regard that
this dog was free, excepting thoſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
the former ſuffer'd, and was, after
that as ſound, as if he had never been bitten.</p>
               <p>If theſe two Experiments had been
made, before that Gentleman, above
diſcours'd of, was bitten by the Viper, we
ſhould have been in much leſs anxiety for
his preſervation. But it was enough, that
we were able to ſecure him from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
effects of the biting, by wayes
grounded upon reaſon, and by remedies,
that were more proper for ſuch perſons, as
could not well reſolve to eat the bare fleſh
of Vipers.</p>

made upon
Vipers.</head>
               <p>WHereas we gave but little credit
to what divers Authors have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
to be true, namely, that the Head of
a Viper bruiſed and applyed to the biting
of it would heal the ſame; we made a
Pigeon to be bitten in the moſt fleſhy
part of its body, well freed of its feathers,
and we cut, bruiſed, and applyed to the
place bitten, the head of the ſame Viper,
that had wounded the Pigeon, and took
care to have it held upon it with a hand.
We alſo cut the head of a living Viper, and
had it ſlightly broyl'd, then bruis'd and
laid hot to the wound of another Pigeon,
which had been newly bitten in the ſame
place, to find, whether by the heat of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60888:74"/>
broyling, the parts of the head being more
open'd, and the ſpirits more ſet at liberty,
they would work better; but the ſucceſs
was not more beneficial for one Pigeon,
than the other; for they both dyed half a
quarter of an hour after they had been bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
and their bodies being open'd, we
found in them, what we did in others, kill'd
by Vipers, namely a blackiſh blood, in part
coagulated, and half corrupted, in the heart
and the great veſſels; but we took notice,
that there was leſs black &amp; blew about the
place bitten; which was perhaps all the
effect, that theſe bruiſed heads had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
which had not been able to carry
their virtue any farther.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo, (to ſay that on the by)
with the pricking of a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> which being
bruiſed on the part ſtung, ſerves for an
Antidote, and cureth: for which this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
may be alledged, that the venom of
a Scorpion, not working ſo briskly, and
not piercing with ſo much quickneſs unto
the inward parts; the Spirits, that iſſue
from the bruiſed Scorpion, have leiſure to
make way for themſelves, and to go and
find out the venom, to joyn with it, and
to make it come forth; whereas the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60888:75"/>
of the Viper goes immediately to
taint the maſs of the blood, and the
parts which it bedeweth; as was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in our Gentleman, who had no pains
nor ſwelling in his arm, but after all the
other accidents; contrary to the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Scorpions Venom, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it paſſeth further, acteth upon the
part prick'd by benumming, cold, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or by inflammation, and very great
pains; as thoſe Authors, that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thereof, and the perſons, that have
been prick'd by them, doe aſſure.</p>
               <p>We have found very true, what Signor
<hi>Redi</hi> hath ſaid of the effects of the Eſſence
of <hi>Tobacco</hi> upon Vipers; That, running
their skin through with a thred dipp'd in
that eſſence, and leaving the thred in the
skin, the Viper dies in leſs than a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour, and becomes as hard as
braſs, but ſoon after ſupple and plyant.
We have alſo tryed, that a little piece of
Tobacco in the roll, held in the throat of a
Viper, and the ſmoak of Tobacco blown
into its throat produce the like effect,
but a little more ſlowly; and that both
do cauſe convulſions, and extraordinary
contractions in a viper, which are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60888:75"/>
with death; and that, when all the
other parts of the body are deprived of
motion, the heart yet beats about half an
hour after; and that Tobacco, or its eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
kills Snakes as well as Vipers. I know
not, whether this will do with other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
ſince, having run a thred dipt in the
eſſence of Tobacco, into the skin of the
under-belly of a Dog, he immediately how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
very much, and continued ſo to do for
half a quarter of an hour, running round,
then lying down, and then riſing again, and
in the mean time purging above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and voyding excrements more liquid
then ordinarily. He would eat nothing,
and onely drunk now and then a little, after
which he vomited; but this was all the
trouble he had, which inſenſibly went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and ſoon after, without any other
accident.</p>
               <p>We have vexed a viper, and made it to
bite another viper, which on purpoſe we
held within the reach of its teeth. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſhe open'd her throat, and put her
ſelf into a poſture of biting, yet ſhe refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſunk not her teeth deep into the
body of the other; which moved us to
thruſt them our ſelves by preſſing her jaws;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60888:76"/>
but the bitten viper received no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
from it. Yet we have obſerved,
that a viper which was made to ſwallow
ſome of the eſſence of Tobacco, and which
we yet held by the neck with pincers, did
bite herſelf; but as the eſſence alone fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to kill her, ſo there was no reaſon
to impute her death to this kind of biting,
which was probably an effect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive
motions cauſed by the eſſence of
Tobacco.</p>
               <p>We alſo pierced twice, in the day-light,
with the point of a pen-knife, the head
of a live viper in the midſt of the Brain,
from the top to the botom; one thruſt
long-wayes, the other croſs-wayes, and
in ſuch a manner, that the blood run out
both above and below; but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the viper, being let looſe, crept
about as before, and as if ſhe had not
been wounded; but ſhe ſtill loſt bloud by
the wounds, and at laſt dyed at the end of
an hour, but her heart did ſtill beat and
continue to do ſo two hours after. Which
Experiment ſufficiently argues the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
vivacity of the Spirits of the
viper.</p>
               <p>We have alſo put into a glaſs-veſſel, a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60888:76"/>
living viper, together with three live <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,</hi>
and there left them together four
dayes; but found them in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
in which they were, when we put
them in, though there be Authors that
aſſure, that theſe Animals kill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being ſhut up together in one and
the ſame veſſel. Mean time a viper will
kill Scorpions, as well as Lizzards, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
animals to devour them and feed upon
them, but that ſhe doth only, when ſhe is
at liberty, and not when impriſon'd; for
then ſhe ceaſeth to take food.</p>
               <p>We have likewiſe found the contrary
to what Authors have affirm'd of the
<hi>Waſpe's</hi> attaching a Viper, and that the
former would fix its ſting into the head of
the latter, and quitted her not, till ſhe were
dead.</p>
               <p>Divers Authors have aſſur'd, that all
the remedies, which are reputed Alexite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
or Preſervatives againſt poiſon, did
kill Vipers, by their vertue contrary and
oppoſite to their venom. To be certain
hereof, we forced a Viper to ſwallow half
a drachm of <hi>Theriaque,</hi> diſſolved in <hi>Cardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Benedictus</hi>-water; and having laid her
aſide, we perceived not any change in her,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60888:77"/>
except that the ſurface of her skin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
for a while a little moiſt; but ſhe
grew more vivid upon it, and more ready to
bite than before.</p>
               <p>We had alſo a minde to know the effect
of <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> upon a Viper. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made one ſwallow about a drachme of
it; which thereupon was preſently ſtun'd,
and then fell into ſtrange agitations; but
ſeeing that that ceaſed little by little, we
gave her another doſe of the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
which not onely caus'd in her
the like agitation, but afterwards made
her almoſt un-moved, and ſo inebriated
her that ſhe ſeem'd to be half dead. She
remain'd about three hours in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but at length ſhe began to ſtir again,
and was like the former, more brisk, and
more diſpoſed to bite than before. We
put alſo a living Viper into a bottle almoſt
full of Spirit of wine, and we ſaw, that ſhe
turned to and fro therein, now ſwimming
on the top, then in the middle, and by and
by at the bottom of the bottle, and that
ſhe reſiſted a good hour, before ſhe was
choaked therein.</p>
               <p>We cauſed likewiſe a Viper to ſwallow
ſome ſugar, part of which was in powder,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60888:77"/>
and the other part diſſolv'd in water. She
kept the whole for a while with her, but
afterwards vomited it up; and having laid
her aſide, to ſee, what would become of
her, we found her dead four and twenty
hours after.</p>
               <p>We have often ſpit into the throats of
many Vipers, even when we were faſting,
but they ſoon after caſt up our ſpitle, and
had not any hurt thereby; though there
be Authours affirming that Vipers become
tabid or conſumptive thereby; which yet
may very well happen, not from thence,
but rather from the abſtinence and ſadneſs,
after a long impriſonment.</p>
               <p>Many Authors have mentioned, that
Vipers have a great Antipathy to <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
and that, if a live Viper were put
within a round, made, one half, of the leaves
of Aſh, and the other half, of kindled
coales, the Viper would rather expoſe
herſelf to be burnt, then to come near the
Aſh-leaves. But having made a whole
round of ſuch leaves, which had about
three foot in diameter, we put a Viper in
the midſt, which preſently hid herſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thoſe leaves.</p>
               <p>Whileſt I had live Vipers in my houſe,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60888:78"/>
ſeveral Women with child came to me,
ſome deſignedly to ſee them, others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having any ſuch thought, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſurpris'd at, and abhorring the ſight of
them; but none of them having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenienced
by it; ſo far were they from
miſcarrying thereupon, as certain Authors
would beare us in hand they would do.
Not that ſuch a thing may not chance to
happen to ſome woman or other extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
fearful, and of a temper ſo delicate,
that a much leſs occaſion might produce
ſuch an effect; but that ought not to paſs
for a general rule.</p>
               <p>We have often preſſed ſome Vipers,
both Males and Females, at the place,
where be the <hi>Paraſtates,</hi> or the Bladders
containing the ſeed, namely under the tail,
and near the openings, which ſerve for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;
and have ſo much and ſo long
preſs'd them, that a white liquor came
forth; but we never perceived there any
piercing or ill-ſented ſmell, no more than
we did in opening thoſe <hi>Paraſtates</hi> with a
lance though we held our noſe cloſe to it:
which is alſo directly contrary to what ſome
Authors have aſſured thereof.</p>

Vpon all we have experimented.</head>
               <p>THE great care and attention uſed
by us in the Experiments, we have
hitherto deſcribed, and in thoſe,
we have thought fit to ſuppreſs, hath
made us to profit of all the occaſions, that
preſented themſelves; and we have taken
pleaſure to obſerve all the effects, that
have appeared to us, and carefully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
them, and inquired into their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
afterwards, that we might make our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
thereon.</p>
               <p>The Biting of the Viper, which hapned
to the Gentleman Stranger, began to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
us with much matter; and at that
time we knew the Venom by its effects,
which ſeem'd to proceed from a very ſlight
cauſe, it being nothing but a little prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and onely the cut of a tooth, which
was not any thing deep, and the ill of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60888:79"/>
which did not ſeem to us increaſed by any
of the yellow liquor of the Gums, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
of which was not yet fully known
to us. In the mean time the mortal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
came on in great number, whilſt
continued vomitings hinder'd the effect
of the remedies, which could not be
kept in the Stomach, to communicate
from thence ſome of their vertue to the
parts affected. It was well enough known,
that there was ſomething very ſubtile, very
quick, and very powerful in this Venom;
and it was alſo preſumed, that that reſided
in the Spirits; but the nature of it, or by
what means, or how, or on what parts it
acted, was not known ſo well.</p>
               <p>Yet we muſt avow, that on an occaſion
ſo preſſing, ſo dangerous, and ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
we could not take our meaſures bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than by having recourſe to the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Salt of Vipers. The cauſe being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and ſpirituous, there was required a
remedy of the like nature, that might be
able to make haſte to finde it out, to joyn
with it, and to draw it to the extremities
of the body, and to make it come forth
by the wayes, it had opened for it. But
then, the continual vomiting demanded
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60888:79"/>
the aid of ſuch a remedy, that could
work in a moment, or execute at leaſt by
ſeveral takings, what it was not able to do
at the firſt. The happy ſucceſs, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the uſe of this Volatile ſalt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
acquainted us with the ſufficiency
thereof, and ſhowed us the maſtery it had
over the malignity of thoſe Spirits. It alſo
begot in us a deſire to know aright, in what
manner it produced ſuch good effects, and
to be enabled ſo to diſcourſe of it, as that
others might have no reaſon to reject our
ſentiments.</p>
               <p>We eſteem therefore, <hi>that</hi> this Salt,
by its ſubtile, volatile and piercing quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is very proper to diſſolve the coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Bloud, and to ſever the parts,
which therein were congeal'd or fix'd, (if
we may ſo ſpeak) and caus'd the diſorder
and confuſion of its motion; <hi>that</hi> it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
this in the Blood of the ſaid Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
which it reſtor'd to its former
condition, and ſo gave again to the parts
the free communication of the Spirits,
which they had loſt. We believe alſo,
that this Volatile Salt, by the facility it
had to hook and faſten it ſelf unto thoſe
vexed Spirits, as being of the like nature,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60888:80"/>
did eaſily joyn with them, and drove them
to the extremities of the body, drawing
them forth through the pores of the skin,
and iſſuing out with them by the way, it
had open'd for them.</p>
               <p>The Ligatures made about the place
bitten, the Scarifications, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the well heated iron-ſpatuls to
the wound, were to ſerve to ſtay the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſneſs
of thoſe irritated Spirits, and
to give them an out-let at theſe openings,
rather than that they ſhould go farther:
And the exhibition of the Theriaque, the
Viper-powder, and the like, was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to drive them back, as it might have
done, if theſe remedies had ſtay'd in the
Stomach. As alſo the <hi>Epithemes</hi> of
Theriaque upon the Heart and Stomach
might have ſerv'd much, if the action of
the enrag'd ſpirits had been more ſlow,
and if at the time of their application
thoſe ſpirits had not been too farre ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
               <p>But the Uſe of this Volatile Salt was to
carry the Bell, as it did, from all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remedies; and thoſe, that were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
afterwards and in the intervals of
its exhibition, were nothing, if we may
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60888:80"/>
ſo ſpeak, but Souldiers aſſiſting their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
ſuch as the Confection of <hi>Alkermes</hi>
and of <hi>Hyacinthe,</hi> which were very proper
to fortify the noble parts; as alſo were the
Syrup of Limons, and the Decoction of
Scorzonera, and the ſhavings of Ivory.</p>
               <p>The Slices of Citron, which might
ſeem to ſome by their acidity capable to
augment the coagulation of the blood,
were not given till after the Volatile Salt
had uſed its force to diſſipate it; and they
ſerved to recover the Stomach, debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by continual vomiting, and by their
acidneſs to reſtore the loſt appetite, and
to help the concoction of the aliments, and
their diſtribution into the parts, that had
need of them. Beſides that Citrons have
a ſpecifique vertue againſt the poyſon of
Vipers, if we will believe thoſe Authors,
that have written of it; and is a great
friend to the Heart and the other noble
parts.</p>
               <p>The Anointing with the Oyle of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
of <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> and with the water of
the <hi>Queen of Hungary,</hi> made upon the
ſwell'd parts, and the application of Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
fomentations, ſhould in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
have ſerv'd much; but the ſequele
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60888:81"/>
ſhew'd, that there was nothing but that
Volatile Salt, which could make thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Spirits ſurrender, and ſo was to take
the honour of all.</p>
               <p>The Experiments, which we afterwards
made upon a great number of differing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
have given us a much greater
knowledg of the effects of Vipers-poyſon,
of the parts on which it works, and of
thoſe that ſeem to be exempt from it,
though at laſt they do ſuccumbe: We
have ſet down the moſt conſiderable of
them, making ſome reflexions on the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of ſeveral Doggs, done by Vipers;
but there remain'd ſtill for us to diſcourſe,
Why and How the parts of Vipers, being
eaten, can ſtop and overcome the Venom
of their biting.</p>
               <p>We ſay therefore, that all the parts of
a Viper abound chiefly in Volatile Salt,
which in diſtillation is found partly alone;
partly in the form of a Spirit, which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is nothing but a Salt diſſolved in ſome
portion of Phlegme; and partly in the
form of an Oyle, which alſo is but a Salt
mix't among the unctuous part of a Viper.
We ſay alſo, that in the digeſtion, made
in the Stomach, of the parts of a Vipers
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60888:81"/>
body, that have been ſwallowed down,
this ſame Volatile Salt, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
is ſeparated, and afterwards diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to all the parts that need them; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if of theſe parts there have been
ſwallow'd enow, to furniſh that quantity,
which is neceſſary, of this Salt; and ſo we
need not doubt, but that this Salt will
produce an effect like that of the Volatile
Salt, which was given to our Gentleman
bitten; Unleſs it ſhould be ſaid, that this
ſame Volatile Salt of thoſe parts of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
body, which have been ſwallowed,
being of the ſame nature with the irritated
Spirits, attracts them to it ſelf, and by
this union changes their maligne quality,
and ſo tames them, that they have no
power over the bitten Animal; which, in
my opinion, is hard enough to conceive,
and perhaps eſtabliſhed upon unſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
               <p>We hope, that among the many Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
thoſe of the Five Pigeons, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
one after another, by one and the ſame
Viper exaſperated, and of which the laſt
bitten dyed firſt of all, when the Viper was
moſt vexed, and moſt exhauſted of its yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
liquor; and that of the Pigeon bitten by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60888:82"/>
Viper, which we had cauſed to bite ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times into bread before, and that even
till bloud came forth, to the end that the
Juyce might be well emptied of it, and
which notwithſtanding was followed by
the death of the Pigeon; Theſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I ſay, will prove on one hand,
that the yellow liquor contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the poyſon; and on the other,
that theſe incenſed Spirits, aſſiſted by the
openings which the great Teeth had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them, are the ſole and true
cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>The wound, made by a Viper not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed,
whoſe jaws were held in, and whoſe
teeth were at the ſame time thruſt into the
body of a Pigeon, which alſo was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with ſtore of the yellow juyce, and
yet not attended with any ill accident;
as alſo the pricking, made by the great
teeth, pulled out of a live Viper, or by
ſuch, as ſtuck yet in the head of a dead
Viper, and did no hurt at all, do ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirm this truth, viz. that the cauſe of
the Venom is to be imputed to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
enraged, and not to any other thing
or parts in the Vipers body.</p>
               <p>I have not undertaken to reaſon upon
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60888:82"/>
all the Experiments, we have made, as I
have done upon the Bitings, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that is beyond the Sphere of a man
of my profeſſion, and becauſe I deſigned
onely to confine my ſelf particularly to

               <p>For the reſt, if in the Treaty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Theriaque, which I have lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht,
I have advanced any thing not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
to what I have declared here,
touching the action of the Venom, I
am to be excuſed therein, foraſmuch as
I had not then had the occaſion, well to
know the nature and the effects of the
Bitings of Vipers, and referred my ſelf to
the moſt approved Authors about it.
But yet all we have there ſaid, dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
in nothing from the preparation of
Vipers for Theriaque, which we have
there laid down, and which was in that
Book our main deſign, as well as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
ſeveral other preparations, that
ſeemed not reaſonable to us: That which
now remains to be done by us, is, to ſpeak
of the Remedies to be drawn from Vipers,
which may ſerve to heal their bitings,
and to cure many other evils.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the different choyce that
may be made of the parts of
a Viper.</head>
               <p>THere is nothing in Nature, to
which can be given more juſtly
the title both of <hi>Aliment</hi> and
<hi>Medicine,</hi> than to a Viper, ſince it affords
equally very good Nouriſhment and very
good Remedies. It alſo hath in its Body
not one part, which is not very uſefull,
and of which Artiſts may not draw ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60888:83"/>
that is good; their chief difference
conſiſting in this, that the ſubſtance of the
one is more or leſs cloſe, then that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Yet, as in all Bodies of Animals,
there are parts preferable to others, ſo
we may make a diſtinction of thoſe in a
Viper, eſpecially if we mean to eat them,
or to reduce them to powder, to take it
at the mouth, alone, or mingled with other
medicaments.</p>
               <p>In this caſe, it will be well, to uſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Heart, the Liver, and the Trunk,
I mean, the Body emptied of its guts,
without head and tayle. Not that, if you
would make uſe of the head and taile,
any ill would attend it, or that you need
to fear any ill quality in them, no more
than in all the other parts of the body;
but the Heart, Liver and Trunk are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
as thoſe that are moſt eſteem'd, and
which are taken before the reſt, out of
the body of ſuch Animals, which men
uſe to feed upon. Thoſe alſo, that
would nouriſh themſelves with Viper-fleſh
boyled and ſeaſoned, may do well, in
eating of it, to ſeparate the bones there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and to leave them uneaten: but if
they bruiſe them between their teeth,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60888:84"/>
and ſwallow them down together with the
fleſh, they would afford them a like, and
even a ſtronger nouriſhment than the
fleſh: for, we have found by Diſtillation,
that the Bones yield the ſame parts, that
the Fleſh does and even in greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.
For the ſame reaſon, the Bones of
the trunk are not to be caſt away, when
you will prepare the powder of Vipers, and
that the rather, becauſe they are in that
way very eaſy to ſwallow. One may alſo
very uſefully dreſs the fleſh of Vipers with
their own fat, as one would do with but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or with the fat of other animals. The
Skin it ſelf, if men would, might be boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and eaten with benefit; but that it
would not be ſo ſavory, as the principal
parts we have been ſpeaking of.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Chymical</hi> preparations, all
the parts of Vipers may be therein em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
and I would not except from them
the Stomach it ſelf, nor the Inteſtins, if they
were well clear'd of Worms, and all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</p>
               <p>I alſo know no difference, as to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
of one Sex from the other, although
moſt Authors have preſcribed the uſe of
Females: On the contrary, if there be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60888:84"/>
any ſuch difference, I would preferre the
Males to the Females, when theſe are full
of Eggs, and big, foraſmuch as then they
are too much waſted for the feeding and
increaſing of their Eggs.</p>
               <p>As to the Seaſons, in which they are to
be taken and uſed, I almoſt equally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumne;</hi> for the times
wherein men need them, ought to carry
it in the behalf of thoſe who have a mind
to feed on them. But care muſt be had
to chuſe ſuch Vipers, as are bigg, fat, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
and active; and not to keep them
very long after they have been taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they grow leaner and leſſer every
day, both out of Melancholy, and want
of food, which after that time they uſe
not to take. I alſo make no difference
between thoſe Vipers of <hi>France,</hi> that are
bred in one Province, and thoſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for thoſe of <hi>Poitou</hi> and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
parts are as good as thoſe of <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi>
and about <hi>Lyons,</hi> and in other places.
The place therefore is not to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
but for the quantity, and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of getting them, in regard that
they are not wont to be found in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
places, which are the onely, that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60888:85"/>
Authors have diſapproved for Vipers,
upon the belief, that the fleſh of Vipers,
taken in them, did cauſe thirſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

there.</p>

Vertue.</head>
               <p>THere is ſcarce an Author, that hath
written of Vipers, but affirms, that
in ſeveral parts of the World, many
perſons, and even whole Nations, have fed,
and ſtill feed upon the fleſh of Vipers;
in ſomuch that in great and coſtly Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
they made exquiſite and very
conſiderable diſhes of it. There are alſo,
that have alledged for an example ſome
Nations, which by the uſe of Viper-fleſh,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60888:85"/>
have extraordinarily lengthn'd their life,
even to 140. years. It is needleſs, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
here the teſtimonies of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
on this ſubject; the Curious may
finde them in Books. We content our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to affirm, that many perſons do ſtill
uſe it at this time in divers Countries, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be from Cuſtom, or to ſatisfie their
appetite, or by the Advice of knowing
Phyſitians, and that upon occaſions they
finde wonderful effects thereof. I alſo
doubt not, but that the uſe of it would
be more frequent among us, if the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of Vipers were well known, and if one
could diſlodge out of the minde of people
the horrour and natural antipathy, they
have againſt this animal. For the taſte of
Viper-fleſh is very like that of Eeles;
whence it is, that in ſome Countries Vipers
are called <hi>Eeles of the Mountain;</hi> and one
finds ſomething in them even more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
than in Eeles. I know perſons,
who well knowing the moſt inward parts
of Vipers, have out of merriment, and in
company, made good meals of them, and
found it very ſavory meat. But thoſe
that have too much averſion from this
kind of food, may find very convenient
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60888:86"/>
wayes to benefit themſelves by the vertue
of them, ſo as not to be diverted from it by
any abhorrency of the animal: for they
may feed Capons and Pullets with the
fleſh of Vipers cut in ſmall pieces, which
thoſe Creatures eat very greedily; and
continuing for ſome time to feed them
therewith, it will certainly communicate
the vertue of the Vipers to the body of
thoſe Animals; which may be eaten, as
we eate other Capons or Pullets, the taſte
of which will be very ſavoury, becauſe
that of Viper fleſh is ſo.</p>
               <p>Neither ought we to doubt, that the
qualities of Vipers paſs into the bodies of
thoſe animals, ſince there are innumerable
others, the fleſh of which hath not onely
the vertue, but even the taſte of the
things, they are fed with. The fleſh of
the Birds, that live on Juniper-berries,
and of thoſe, that live onely upon Olives,
hath not onely their qualities, but alſo
their taſte and bitterneſs, and that ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that one can ſcare eat them. In the
Countries, where Silk-worms are bred,
it is obſerved, that in their ſeaſon, which
is chiefly in the months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi>
the Eggs of Hens, that eat thoſe Worms,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60888:86"/>
have a taſte and ſmell of them, as well as
their fleſh; inſomuch that nice perſons
feed their Poultry a part, and hinder them
from eating any Silk-worms. It may be
taken notice of, to this purpoſe, that 'tis
a cuſtome to give to Nurſes the medicines,
which young Children cannot be made
to take, to the end that their vertue may
paſs from the body of the Nurſe to that of
the Child; and it hath been often obſerv'd,
that the Urine of the Babe hath had the
ſent of the Druggs the Nurſe had
taken.</p>
               <p>But yet ſome might phanſy, that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
cannot take the good from the good
parts of the things eaten by them, but
they muſt at the ſame time receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of the ill ones, that are there;
and it might even be objected, that Liz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
Scorpions, Cantharides, and the
other Creatures, on which Vipers do feed,
ſhould impreſs in their bodies the ill quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
they have, as, among the reſt, the
Cantharid, its Cauſtique quality. But
notwithſtanding all this, the Experience
we have of the harmleſsneſs of Vipers-bodies,
and alſo of their good qualities,
furniſhes us with a contrary argument, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60888:87"/>
to deſtroy that phanſy; and it
teaches us, that the ſtomach of Animals
converteth into good all the ill qualities,
to be met with in the bodies, it receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to digeſt; and that it uniteth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriateth
the good ones to the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Animal that hath eaten
them: Whence it comes to paſs, that it
is as 'twere transformed, or at leaſt very
much changed by thoſe good qualities;
and is upon that account capable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
them to other animals, into
whoſe ſtomach it enters to be there digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
We ſay beſides, that there are
divers Examples of Bodies, that would be
altogether poyſonous in the ſtomach of
men, which yet ſerve for food to, and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
other animals, which afterwards yield
good nouriſhment to men. Such are <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore</hi>
and <hi>Hemlock,</hi> which nouriſh and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Quailes and Goates, which afterwards
are uſefully employed for the nouriſhment
of men; and this is it, what <hi>Lucrece</hi> hath
very well obſerved in theſe Verſes;

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe, that have no averſion from
Vipers-fleſh, may take of them the Heart,
the Liver, and the Trunck, and having wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
them well, they may then accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
them to their own taſte in the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
Where they are to take care, not
to make the fleſh too hot by too much
ſpice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially pepper; but yet they are
allowed to put to it ſome aromatique
herbs, as Garden- and Wild-Thyme, and
the like; or a little Nutmeg, Cinamon,
Cloves, to raiſe the taſte. They muſt alſo
avoid the fault, committed by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
whipping and vexing the Vipers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they killed them; leaſt this irritati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould cauſe ſome ill impreſſion in their
body, which by it ſelf hath no venom at
all in it. Let them alſo not caſt away the
broth, wherein the Vipers have been boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
becauſe it retaines the greateſt vertue
of them. Neither do I ſee, why one ſhould
ſtint the quantity, or limit the time of the
uſe of it; that depending from the degree
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60888:88"/>
of the illneſs, and from the conſtitution of
the perſons, that will make uſe thereof.
And although we know Vipers to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Alterative Medicine, and that their
chief uſe is onely for their Medicinal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
yet if taken as an Aliment, there
is no danger at all to eat of their fleſh, or
to drink of their broth, ſomewhat more
or ſomewhat leſs. It is alſo to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
ſalted; and thoſe that have any of
the Fixed Salt of Vipers, ſhall do well to
employ it. You may alſo adde to it ſome
of its Volatile Salt, if you will have the
Fleſh of Vipers work more powerfully.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Vertues</hi> of Viper-fleſh, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the conſent of innumerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
whoſe opinion is ſupported by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and truth, confirmed by many Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments;
we can ſay, that they are very
great, and that there is no Animal in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that affords ſuch and ſo many: And
we wonder not at all, that the Antients
have ſo frequently employ'd Vipers in their
<hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> and adorned their <hi>Medals</hi>
with them; thereby to deſign very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
things for the publick, and
for private men; forasmuch as this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
is very capable to furniſh them. For
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60888:88"/>
the uſe of it preſerves the natural heat in a
very good temper, it repaireth the ſame,
and reſtoreth it when 'tis altered; it yields
a very good food; helps digeſtion by its
heat, which is not exceſſive; it retards
old age and prolongeth life, by a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which Vipers have, to maintain in
good plight the whole habit of the Body.
Whence it is, that many have believed,
that both Staggs and Eagles, induced to
it by a natural inſtinct, eat all the Vipers,
they can meet with, and that 'tis upon
that ſcore, that their life is extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long.</p>
               <p>There is alſo adſcribed to Vipers, and
not without reaſon, a Renewing vertue,
capable to make young again; which they
tacitly ſhew, by caſting their skin twice
a year, and renewing themſelves by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of a new skin. This, joyned to the
ſubtile parts, of which the Viper is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
and to its lively and daring aſpect,
teſtifies it to be pertinent enough, that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have attributed to it the vertue of
clearing and ſtrengthning the Eyes.</p>
               <p>Vipers have alſo a very particular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Cleanſing the whole Body, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Bloud, and of expelling
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60888:89"/>
through the pores of its skin all the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities:
Whence it may be inferred, that
they are very proper to cure the <hi>Itch, Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
Eryſipelas</hi> or Saint <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire, <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
Small Pox,</hi> and the <hi>Leproſy</hi> it ſelf, the
uſe of them being long enough continued;
though I cannot well believe what <hi>Galen</hi>
ſaith, That the Wine, wherein one onely
Viper is choaked, is able to cure ſo great
an Evil, and which doth not ſo eaſily yield
to remedies.</p>
               <p>Vipers alſo may, by removing all the
impurities and obſtructions of the Body and
skin, cauſe beauty therein; and upon this
account it is, that many Ladies in <hi>Italy</hi> uſe
them for their ordinary food.</p>
               <p>By the good nouriſhment, they yield
by the purity they give to the blood and
to all the parts, and by the liberty they
give to the Spirits to do their functions
therein, they are a great relief to perſons
in a Conſumption, and to thoſe that are
emaciated by long diſeaſes, and waſted by
tedious Feavers. There are even Authors,
who aſſure that the uſe of them is capable
to cure the Venereal diſeaſe; for which we
doubt not but they may ſerve much, if they
do not altogether cure it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:60888:89"/>
Their mundifying vertue, joyned to the
Alexiterial, makes them alſo very proper to
expell all ſorts of poyſons, and even the
Plague it ſelf and all contagious diſeaſes.
They are alſo very contrary to all putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which commonly is the matter and
ſource of moſt maladies; whence it comes,
that thoſe who uſe them, are not ſubject to
diſeaſes, unleſs they live irregularly, which
is able to deſtroy all the good, which the
uſe of Vipers might afford.</p>
               <p>We might here ſpecify many other ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
that might be cured by the uſe of
Viper-fleſh; but we think not fit to do ſo,
ſince the general vertues, which we have
noted, may ſuffice to make men apply the
uſe to many particular Evils, that may need
it. Yet we ſhall deſcribe, in the Chapter
enſuing, the uſes and Vertues of the parts of
Vipers, taken as a Medicine, without any
great preparation.</p>

               <p>THE Vertues, which the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of
Vipers is able to communicate to
thoſe, who eat them for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are doubtleſs very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
but they are not the onely ones,
that Vipers are endow'd with; and not to
alledge ſuperfluous things, we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
our ſelves to the principal Vertues,
of which we have experimented the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part.</p>
               <p>It is very certain, that the <hi>Head</hi> of a
Viper, broyled and ſwallowed, healeth the
biting of that animal. The Heart and the
Liver may do the ſame. Reaſon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
have confirm'd it; and therefore
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60888:90"/>
in an urgent occaſion thoſe parts may be
very uſefully employed. The applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Blood of a Viper to the Biting,
as alſo that of its Head bruiſed, are neither
to be rejected, nor is that of the Entralls:
but theſe applications alone are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to cure it; for, the ſubtlety and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Spirits carrying them with
great ſpeed into the body, there muſt be
uſed internal ſpecifick remedies to repulſe
them; and you may alſo very pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repeat (at the mouth) the uſe of the
head, heart, liver, and the other parts of
a Viper, without fearing to take too much
of them, becauſe thoſe parts can never
do hurt, and they alwayes produce ſome
good effect. They may alſo ſerve for all
ſorts of venoms and poyſons, and againſt
all ſorts of contagious and epidemical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
               <p>Divers Authors aſſure, that the <hi>Head</hi>
of a Viper, hung about the neck, hath a
very particular quality to cure the Squi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
and all the diſtempers of the Throat;
and that the Brain of a Viper, wrapt up
in a little skin, and likewiſe hung about
the neck, is very good to make the Teeth
of children come forth; which effect
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60888:91"/>
others believe to be due to the great teeth
of Vipers. If we had experimented it, we
could then ſpeak with more certainty. The
remedies are eaſily practicable, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
harmleſs; wherefore thoſe who need
them may make tryal of them.</p>
               <p>Some alſo have affirmed, that the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
of a Viper, ſwallowed, keeps one from
being bitten either by this Animal, or
by any other ſerpent, and that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Vipers hath the ſame efficacy. But
we muſt not rely upon their report; we
onely believe, that the Liver ſwallowed
is capable to heal the biting of a Viper;
like the heart, fleſh, and other parts, of
which we have ſpoken; and that it may
much facilitate the delivery of Women
with child, as doth the Liver of Eeles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Skin</hi> of a Viper is not altogether
deſtitute of vertue; for beſides that it is
alſo, as they ſay, very good for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of women, making a garter of it
about the right leg, it hath a very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
vertue for all the diſtempers of humane
skin: And although all the other parts,
eaten, may work the ſame thing; yet, that
we might have benefit from all, we have
experimented, that the Viper-skin does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60888:91"/>
heal the inveterate mangie of Dogs,
making them eat it boyled or raw. It might
alſo be ſaid, that the ſpecks in the Viper-skin
ſeem to ſignify the marks of the itch
or mangy, or, if you will, of the leproſy,
which the ſcales of the skin repreſent yet
better, and ſo tacitly expreſs its vertue.</p>
               <p>Some have believed, that the <hi>Gall</hi> of a
Viper applyed, can heal its biting; but we
give no credit to it, no more than to the
application of its bruiſed head. But this
we judge, that it is proper for the wound
of the biting, onely as it is for all other
wounds, and for ulcers themſelves, having
a great abſterſive, mundifying and cicatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
vertue. It is alſo very good for the
weakneſſes of Eyes, above all, for ſuffuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and films, being taken inwardly, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
outwardly; ſo far it is from doing
them hurt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fat</hi> of Vipers hath very great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
for, beſides that it is very good in the
dreſſing of the Viper-fleſh (as hath been
ſaid) it is able alſo, taking a drachm of it,
to give great relief in Epidemical diſeaſes,
and to expell the venom thereof. It is alſo
very uſeful to facilitate the travel of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and to diſſipate the ſwellings of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60888:92"/>
the throat, anointing it outwardly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
It alſo much relieves Gouty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and ſerves to reſolve nodoſities. It
unſwels all hard and inveterate tumors, and
even thoſe that proceed from Venereal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes;
and for this reaſon 'tis, that <hi>Jean de
Vigo</hi> hath uſed it in the Plaiſter which bears
his name. It is likewiſe very good for Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
puſtuls,' and all diſtempers of the skin;
and laſtly, it is very powerful againſt all the
illneſſes of the Sinews, and of great vertue
for the parts attackt by the Palſy. We
might alſo adde many other vertues, adſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by Authors to other parts of the Viper;
but we forbear, becauſe we have not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented
them.</p>

               <p>SInce we do not alwayes meet with
perſons, who, having need to make
uſe of Viper-fleſh, are diſpoſed to
eat thereof; it is very neceſſary to have
ready ſuch remedies, that be as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to the inclination of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
as fitted to remove the malady.
The knowledge, which Phyſitians have
bad of the great Vertues of the Viper, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the difficulty, met with in the point
of pleaſing Patients, hath obliged them
to ſearch for divers Preparations, in which
the Antients did not well ſucceed; and if
we would bind ourſelves to their way of
preparing the <hi>Powder</hi> and the <hi>Trochiſques,</hi>
we ſhould looſe the principal vertue of the
Viper, and retain onely the moſt uſeleſs.
For, in the opinion, which they entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60888:93"/>
that there remain'd alwayes ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
in the fleſh of the Viper, if it were
not freed therefrom by ſome preparation
or other; their practice was, to put
the fleſh of Vipers in ſome earthen pot,
and having luted it, to ſet it in a Bake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oven,
after the Bread was drawn out, and
to leave it there, till this fleſh was reduced
to powder. In which preparation the beſt
of this fleſh, which is the Volatile Salt, was
certainly diſſipated. They alſo made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
medicines with this powder, mixt
among other medicaments divers wayes;
of which we need not to enlarge. We ſhall
content ourſelves, here to ſet down a
preparation of the <hi>Powder</hi> of Vipers, which
ſhall be grounded on Reaſon, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all the vertues of the Viper; eaſy alſo
to prepare, and very convenient for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to uſe.</p>
               <p>Take then towards the end of <hi>Aprill,</hi> or
in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> ſuch a quantity of
Vipers as you pleaſe, Males and Females,
chuſing big ones, and ſuch as are fat and
vigorous, and uſing none of thoſe Females,
which are already big with eggs; and then
prepare thoſe, you ſhall have thus choſen,
as follows: Without whipping and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60888:93"/>
them, cut off, with a pair of ſizers,
their heads and tailes, flea them, and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
them of all their entrals, of which you
are to ſeparate the heart and the Liver;
and lay aſide their fat for its peculiar uſes.
Waſh the trunks of the bodies, the hearts
and livers in clear water, and after that in
white wine; then dry them with a very
clean linnen cloth, and having put the
hearts and livers again into their trunks,
tye all the trunks with ſmall pack-thred,
each at one end, and hang them up in the
air in the ſhade, and leave them there, till
they be well dryed; which will be in three
or four dayes. After that, cut theſe
trunks into ſmall pieces, and ſtamp them
in a great Braſs-mortar with an iron-peſtle,
and ſearce all through a very fine hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
and ſo keep it for uſe. This is the
right Powder of Vipers, which contains
all the vertues; to which may be added
a drop of Cinamon-oyle, to give it a good
ſcent.</p>
               <p>There are ſome, who, to make this
powder would have the trunks of Vipers
cut in pieces, and put together with their
hearts and livers in a Glaſs-cucurbit, and
this covered with its head and luted, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60888:94"/>
ſo placed with a recipient, in a very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Balneum;</hi> thereby, continuing that
warmth for three dayes together, to draw
the phlegm of Vipers, accompanied with
a ſmall portion of the Volatile Salt, and to
keep this liquor apart; and then to take
out of the Cucurbite what ſhall remain
there, and of it to make the powder of
Vipers.</p>
               <p>But, beſides <hi>that</hi> this method is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
enough; <hi>that</hi> the fire of a <hi>Balneum</hi> is
not ſufficiently ſtrong to ſend forth enough
of the Volatile Salt, at a time when 'tis
not yet looſen'd from its ſubject; <hi>that</hi> 'tis
notwithſtanding too much ſo, not to emit
inſenſibly ſome ſmal portion, which would
afterwards be wanting in the Powder, and
which alſo may exhale out of the water;
beſides alſo <hi>that</hi> the Vipers are in danger
to be too much dry'd in the Cucurbite,
and even to be there roſted in part: We
eſteem, there is cauſe to prefer <hi>our</hi> Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to <hi>this,</hi> in regard it is much eaſier,
and, without any deſtruction or alteration
of the good parts of Vipers, carries away
all their ſuperfluous and uſeleſs humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
               <p>You might notwithſtanding follow this
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60888:94"/>
way in part, if you ſhould deſire to have
good Viper-water; but then you muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the fire of the <hi>Balneum,</hi> and finiſh
the diſtillation in much leſs time, and yet
take heed not to haſten the fire too much
at the latter end, leaſt the water ſmell of
the <hi>Empyreuma</hi> or burning. You muſt
alſo, after you have taken out the parts
of the Viper, that reſt in the Cucurbite,
put them into a glaſs-retort well luted,
and ſet this into a reverberating furnace,
dapt and exactly lute to it a great Recipient,
and give it a fire increaſed by degrees, and
hotter about the end, to obtain the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Spirit, Salt, and Oyle, that could not
riſe by the fire of the <hi>Balneum;</hi> which are
to be ſeparated and rectifyed, as we ſhall
ſay hereafter. Then take a portion of this
Volatile Salt well rectified, and diſſolve
it in diſtilled water, and keep it carefully
in a well ſtopp'd bottle, as an excellent
remedy; of which you may increaſe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
the doſe, according to perſons and
occaſions; and according as you ſhall have
diſſolved more or leſs of the Volatile Salt
in it.</p>
               <p>Upon this occaſion, I thought fit to
advertiſe thoſe, who diſtill Capons, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60888:95"/>
ſlices of Veal, or other parts of
Animals, in a Glaſs-limbec (as the cuſtom
is,) and who employ for that purpoſe the
fire of a <hi>Balneum,</hi> or that of Sand or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes;
that by a moderate fire they cannot
make riſe almoſt any thing but uſeleſs
flegm; and that, not being able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the fire without making the diſtilled
water ſmell of the <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> they would
ſucceed better, if in this they did, what
I was juſt now ſaying of the water and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Salt of Vipers; and if they joyn'd
their water with the volatile Salt of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled
Animals, in which reſides the chief
vertue. Thoſe, that have no mind to take
ſo much pains, ſhall do better not to give
diſtilled waters to their Patients, as the
cuſtom is, ſince they have no vertue at all,
if none be communicated to them by the
volatil Salt of the Animal,</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Trochiſques,</hi> the Antients
have as ill invented, and as ill ordered
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the <hi>Powder.</hi> For, not to ſtay to
blame here (as I have done elſewhere)
the whipping, which they uſed, and which
was not onely uſeleſs, but alſo very noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
I ſhall ſay in a few words, that the
decoction, they made of the body of the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60888:95"/>
Viper in Water, with Salt and Aniſe, till
the fleſh would ſever from the bones,
which they afterwards caſt away as well as
the broth, was not a <hi>Preparation</hi> of the fleſh
of the Viper, but rather a <hi>deſtruction,</hi> ſince
it was made to leave its principal vertue in
the broth; and that they weaken'd it yet
more, by incorporating it with very dry
bread, of which the proportion of a fifth
to four times as much weight of fleſh,
though but little in appearance, came yet
to a moiety, ſince that four ounces of
this fleſh, and one ounce of bread (which
was ſo dry that it could not be leſſened)
make onely two ounces of <hi>Trochiſques,</hi>
when they are well dry'd. This we have
more at large examined in our Treatiſe of
the <hi>Theriaque;</hi> and becauſe their fault is
very eaſily underſtood, I ſhall inſiſt on
it no farther; nor on their reaſons for
making uſe of Boyling to correct a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
in the fleſh, (of which there is none)
and to be able to ſever it from the bones,
which they believe naught, or at leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſefull,
which yet are very good; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as all their reaſons are ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
in the ſame Book, and becauſe they
are yet more ſo, by what we have eſtabliſh'd
in this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:60888:96"/>
And although it be not alwayes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to make <hi>Trochiſques</hi> of Vipers, ſince
we might be without them; yet there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome uſe of them, and to preſerve
their name, you may take a little Gumm
Arabique, very white and pure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it to powder, and infuſe it in good
Malvaſy, till it be well diſſolv'd, and the
wine ſomewhat tinged thereof: then take
of the powder of Viper, prepar'd as we have
lately directed, and incorporate it with a
ſufficient quantity of this gumm'd Malva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
braying them together in a Marble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortar
with a woodden-peſtle, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the whole into a ſomewhat ſolid paſte;
whereof make Trochiſques, of the ſize
and ſhape you pleaſe, and dry them in the
ſhade upon a hair-ſive.</p>
               <p>I ſaid, that we might be <hi>without</hi> Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſques,
becauſe that having the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which they are made of, that may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for our uſes; but there is one incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
in the Powder, in that it will
ſcarce keep any conſiderable time, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if it be not well ſtopt up, and if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides;
ſome art be not uſed to hinder the
breeding of worms in it: Whereas Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſques,
being made compleat by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60888:96"/>
of Malvaſy, and by the cloſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the parts of the Powder, they
are not ſo eaſily penetrated by the Air, nor
ſo ſubject to corruption. The Trochiſques
being dry, they may be ſlightly rubbed
over with a little Balſom of <hi>Peru,</hi> which
will give them a good ſcent, and help to
preſerve them.</p>
               <p>The Uſe both of the Powder and Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſques
is excellent and alike; but the
Trochiſques are to be reduced into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
when they are to be uſed. Neither
of them have an ill taſte, and they contain
all the vertues, we have aſcribed to the
Fleſh of Vipers, as having loſt nothing in
drying, made without the heat of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams,
but a ſuperfluous moiſture, which
could ſerve for nothing but corrupt them,
if it had remained. They may be given
in cordial waters, broths, wine, or ſome fit
decoction, or you may make <hi>Bolus</hi>'s of
them with Syrrups, Conſerves, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
Confections, or turn them into tablets
with ſugar.</p>
               <p>Their main effect is, to purify, open, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate,
and to drive to the extremities of
bodies all venom, corruptions, impurities,
ſuperfluities, and they may be very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60888:97"/>
uſed in many occaſions for divers
maladies, without the fear of any ill ſucceſs.
For both have this quality, that they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſome good, but never any harm.
Their doſe is from a Scruple to a drachm
or two; and they may be given to all ages,
and ſexes, and at all times.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Salt of Vipers made by
the Ancients.</head>
               <p>AMong many different Preparations
of the Salt of Vipers, made by the
Ancients, of which we finde the
deſcriptions in their Books, there is none
more famous, nor that hath been longer
in uſe, than one that is very ample and
much enriched by many Alexiterial reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
whence tis alſo, that they gave to
this Salt the name of <hi>Theriacal.</hi> But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conſidered this pompous Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60888:97"/>
we do not wonder, that a much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author hath not given it his approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſince we cannot finde any thing in it,
that is according to rule or reaſon, no more
than there is in the reſt. We finde, that
the ſentiments of that Author proceed
from an underſtanding ſo judicious, and ſo
knowing, that we cannot but ſubſcribe to
them, almoſt in all: For, in the Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they uſed, there remain'd nothing
but the <hi>fix't</hi> Salt, which contains but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little vertue; Vipers, as all ſorts of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
having but little of Fixt Salt,
whereas they have much of the Volatile,
which ſoon riſeth in the Calcination, and
carries away with it the principal and the
moſt eſſential vertue of the Animal. They
were alſo much miſtaken, when they
thought, that <hi>four</hi> Vipers, which they
burn'd with <hi>fourty</hi> pounds of Sea-ſalt, or
<hi>Sal Gemmae,</hi> or <hi>Sal Ammoniac,</hi> (as ſome
would have it) and with a great quantity
of Simples, ſhould communicate great
vertues to theſe Salts and theſe Coales.
For in the Calcination, which they uſed
to make in an earthen pot luted, with
its cover on, and yet in one place
pierced, the Volatil Salt of the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60888:98"/>
four Vipers would certainly fly quickly
away; and if it had ſtay'd (which yet we
do not grant) and there had been half an
ounce of it (which is a quantity beyond
what the four greateſt Vipers could yield,)
what, I pray, would that be to 40. pounds
of Sea-ſalt, and to many pounds of Coales,
more than a ſmall rivolet mingled with the
Ocean? But as to the fixt Salt, four Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
are not able to afford half a Scruple
of it.</p>
               <p>'Tis alſo certain, that both the Sea-ſalt
and <hi>Sal gemme,</hi> do not periſh in the Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but ſtill remain there. But if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Salt Ammoniac be employed, the
Urinous and Volatile part, which is in that
Salt, will not fail to make its eſcape, as
well as the Volatile Salt of Vipers, and
there will onely remain the fixt Saline part
of the Salt Ammoniac, mix't with ſome
terreſtrial parts; which is that, we finde in
the Diſtillation, after we have driven out
all the Volatile Salt, of which afterwards,
changing the veſſel and the fire, we draw
an acid ſpirit, very much approaching to
that, we draw out of Sea-Salt, by wayes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
like theſe.</p>
               <p>Artiſts know alſo, that Herbs, Wood,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60888:98"/>
Horns, Bones, and other ſuch like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
if they ſhould be calcined in an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
pot, luted and covered, though a hole
were left in the cover, would alwayes be
afterwards found in the form of very black
coales, although they had endured a great
fire; and that the Salt cannot be ſeparated
from them, unleſs they be calcin'd again
in an open veſſel; or they being reduced
to aſhes, the Salt be then ſever'd from them
by a Lixivium, and by Filtration.</p>
               <p>On which occaſion we relate an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of an imperfect Calcination, which is
naturally made in the Earth about the
Summer-Solſtice, of the end of the root of
many Plants, and among others, of <hi>Mugwort</hi>
and <hi>Plantatin;</hi> on which end, the ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Fire, or, if you will, the Fire of the Sun,
working, and yet being ſurrounded by the
Earth, (which is to the root what the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
pot, luted, is to the Vipers, and to
the Mixts, that were ſhut up with them)
burns it and reduces it to coales, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
turn it to aſhes. I have often found
this to be true, and lighted upon a little
coal at the end of the root of thoſe Plants,
at the time above-mentioned.</p>
               <p>So that, although the Fixt Salt of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60888:99"/>
be Simples in the Coales, yet it would
have been more proper, and more metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical,
to have quite calcined thoſe coales
to reduce them to aſhes, and ſo to draw
from them and to purify the Salt for
uſe, than to make people ſwallow the
groſs, earthy, and uſeleſs part of theſe coales.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Antients added to this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Salt calcin'd, the powder of many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexiterial
Druggs, which not being deveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of their vertue by any calcination,
may communicate, and even alone furniſh
the greateſt part of the good qualities, by
them aſcribed to this Salt. And 'tis upon
the account of theſe principally, that the
name of <hi>Theriacal</hi> may belong to it, which
impertinently would be attributed to the
Vipers, ſince they have loſt their prime ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in the Calcination.</p>
               <p>This Preparation of <hi>Theriacal</hi> Salt doth
ſufficiently ſhew us, that the Antients did
not take pains to know the inward parts,
of which mix't bodies are compounded,
and that they did not well know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the poyſon of Vipers, of which
they imagin'd they ſhould be infected by
the fumes proceeding from their Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
although none could come from
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60888:99"/>
them, when there was none, as we have
made appear. And although the ſmell,
as well of the Vipers, as of the Simples,
were troubleſome, whilſt they burned,
yet they were not therefore at all veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
               <p>The little knowledge, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
had, and many Moderns ſtill have,
of the nature of the two Salts in Vipers,
hath led them into a great fault, viz. to
calcine the bones of Vipers, to draw from
thence, as they thought, the true Salt of
Vipers, which they were not at all like to
finde, after they had diſſipated it by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination.
The firſt fault hath drawn after
it a ſecond; for the ſmall quantity of <hi>fix't</hi>
Salt, they found in them, not much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
them, carried thoſe, that had no
great ſenſe of honour or conſcience, to a
very great abuſe, which was, to mix
among thoſe calcin'd bones a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Sea-ſalt, to diſſolve this Salt, and
and to boyle all together in water, to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and coagulate it, and to ſell at a
great rate this Counterfeit ſalt for true Salt
of Vipers.</p>
               <p>But, to accommodate ourſelves to
thoſe, who, intending better, will make
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60888:100"/>
no ill uſe of it; and to furniſh them with a
pleaſing Salt for thoſe, that may deſire it
for ordinary uſe; we ſhall here deliver the
way of preparing a Salt of Viper, that ſhall
have much vertue; the method of which
ſhall be very eaſy, and the uſe very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p>Take three dozen of great Vipers, well
choſen; cut off their heads and tails, flea
them, and empty the bodies of all their
entrals, and waſh them well, together with
the Heart and Liver: Boyl all together in
ten pints of common water, ſo long till all
be perfectly boyled. Then ſtrain it, and
ſqueeſe well all the parts; and in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
diſſolve four pounds of Sea-ſalt;
and carefully filter it; afterwards, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
or, if you will, chryſtallize this Salt,
which will be found white and abounding
with the vertue of the Vipers, and of no ill
taſte at all; which you may uſe in all things
as common Salt.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew, that theſe boyled and
ſqueeſed parts have left much of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in the Decoction, and yet that they
have not left all, and that ſtill there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
ſome of it, principally in the Bones;
lay them abroad, and dry them, and then
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60888:100"/>
diſtill them, and you will draw from them,
eſpecially from the Bones, a Volatile Salt
and oyl, but in much leſs quantity, then if
they had not been boyld.</p>
               <p>If you would have a Viper-Salt of more
vertue, and that might even be call'd <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacal,</hi>
you muſt proceed after the ſame
manner, as hath been lately ſet down;
but in ſtead of Seal-Salt, take a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Salt, drawn from <hi>Alexiterial</hi> and
<hi>Theriacal</hi> Plants, as the roots of <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Imperatoria, Angelica, Leaves</hi> of <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
the little <hi>Centaurium, Carduus Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus,</hi>
and the like. 'Tis true, that this
Salt is a little more diſpleaſing to the taſte
than the former, but it may produce more
conſiderable effects, and be uſed in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
occaſions.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſorts of Salt have indeed good
vertue, and are convenient for laſting, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the two firſt: But the Volatile Salt
hath ſomething more particular, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
better: the properties of it are
innumerable, and it is an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the
excellent qualities, contained in Vipers.
We ſhall now ſpeak of its Preparation, as
alſo of the Phlegm, of what is called vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Spirit and Oyle, which accompany
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60888:101"/>
it; and of the <hi>Fixt</hi> Salt, which remains
after diſtillation, mixed among the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial

of their vertues and uſefulneſs.</p>

and the Fixt Salt, and

               <p>WE make here publick our
Preparation of the <hi>Volatile</hi>
Salt of Vipers, with the
more frankneſs and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
becauſe we eſteem it one of the
beſt Medicines in Phyſick. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that ſome Authors have already
ſpoken of it; but there is none, that
hath deſcribed it with more exactneſs, than
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60888:101"/>
we, nor that hath more deſired, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one might, according to this Method,
obtain for himſelf and his occaſions a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
which goes beyond many others,
to ſay no more. We hope, that our
way of proceeding will be well received by
all, and that, if there be any that ſhall
finde fault with it, they will be ſuch only,
who are unwilling to communicate what
they have, and often wrap it up under the
name of <hi>Secrets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take onely the Bodies, Hearts and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Vipers, or, (to have the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of all) add to them the Heads, Tails,
and skins, and generally all the parts of a
Viper; of which you will have a care to
take away all the Excrements and Worms,
as alſo the Eggs, that may be in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi>
of the Females. Small and great,
Males and Females are of the ſame good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as alſo the Salt is, that ſhall have
been drawn from all the parts of the Body.
Dry in the ſhade all theſe parts ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then cut them into bits, and fill with
them your Glaſs-limbec up to the neck,
which is to be well luted. Put it in the
midſt of a Reverberating furnace, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
to its bigneſs, cover it with its
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60888:102"/>
head, and ſhut the Regiſter of it; Fit to
the Limbec a Glaſs-recipient, which muſt
be very large; and lute well all the joynts.
Then begin to give a ſmall fire, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
for about two hours, ſo that the
Limbec be heated gradually, and the
Phlegme begin to diſtil into the Recipient.
Afterwards increaſe the fire gently unto a
ſecond degree; and give a little opening
at the Regiſter, and continue the ſame fire
likewiſe two hours; then increaſe it, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Regiſter yet more, and ſo continue
two other hours; at the end of which you
are to give it the fire of the laſt degree,
quite opening the Regiſter, and you muſt
continue to drive the fire, till no more
come out of the Limbec, and the Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
be all obſcured by the Volatile Salt,
which will ſtick to its ſides, towards the
bottom, and to the upper part. Then let
the veſſells cool, and the Furnace alſo; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which you are to un-lute the Recipient,
wherein you will finde the Phlegme, that
part which is called Spirit, the Volatile
Salt, and the Oyle mingled together; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a part of the Volatile Salt, that may
yet adhere to the upper part, and to the
ſides of the Recipient, which you may dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60888:102"/>
take away, and, if you will, keep
for uſe, as 'tis. This Volatile Salt, Spirit,
and Oyle, are ſo penetrating, that you are
not able to hold your noſe over it.</p>
               <p>Powre out, what you find in the Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient,
into a Gloſs-Body, which muſt be
large, tall, broad below, and whoſe figure
goes up ſtraightning towards the orifice;
to which you muſt adapt a Glaſs-head, that
is to have ſomewhat a high body, and
large, and a very ſtraight mouth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to that of the Glaſs-body. Lute
the joynts exactly with paper and ſtarch;
put the Body in a Sand-bath, and ſink it
down as low as the matter reacheth; fit a
ſmall Recipient to the beak of the Head,
and lute that alſo: kindle under it a very
gentle fire, and order it ſo, that the Sand
and the Glaſs-body may be heated gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
after which you may increaſe it a little,
but onely ſo as to make it ſtrong enough
to drive up the Volatile Salt; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſ-engag'd from the parts of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
bodies, riſeth eaſily. It will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed,
and ſtick every where to the inſide
of the Head, like a Chryſtallized Snow.
There will ariſe at the ſame time a little
of the Spirit, which is properly nothing
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60888:103"/>
but a portion of the Volatile Salt, having
carried up with it a little of the Phlegme,
that will run into the little Recipient, and of
which even a part will congeal into Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals.
You muſt alwayes be careful in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
the Fire; for how little ſoever
you increaſe it, the Phlegme will riſe with
ſome of the Oyle, and they will diſſolve
and hide the Salt; and then you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commence
the Rectification; but govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fire well, when you ſhall ſee the
Head well lined with Salt, which will be
very white and very Chryſtalline, you muſt
then un-lute it, and take it off, and lute
on an other head, inſtead of the former.
You are to take out the Salt, as ſoon and
as well as you can; and to encloſe it in a
ſtrong bottle, with ſuch a mouth, that
the Salt may paſs through it, and which
may be exactly cloſed, without which the
Salt will eaſily fly away. Mean time, you
are to continue a like fire under the Glaſs-body,
and when no more of that Volatile
riſeth, you are to deſiſt, and to take out
of the head the Salt there gathered, and
keep it as the former. Your Sand being
cold, take off the Glaſs-body, and decant
from it the remainder through a great
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60888:103"/>
Glaſs-funnel, covered with paper for fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration,
held over ſome veſſell. All the
Phlegm will paſs thorough the Paper;
but you'l finde ſome Oyle there, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
paſs, which you may make run through
the Funnel into a bottle, having pierced
the paper with ſome convenient inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that ſhall deſire a high and much
more perfect Rectification of this Volatile
Salt, may make it in manner following.
Take two pounds of Ivory calcin'd to
whiteneſs, and reduced to a fine powder;
which is to be mixt with four ounces of
this Salt. Then put all into a new Glaſs-Body,
of the ſame ſhape with the former.
To this let there be adapted and luted a
blind Head, or ſuch an one, the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of whoſe beak is well ſtopp'd (for <hi>that</hi>
is uſeleſs for this purpoſe, there being no
phlegme; and if there were, the calcin'd
Ivory being a dry Body, and in part ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
would lick and retain it, as it would
alſo the Oily part, that might happen to
be among the Volatile Salt:) let there be
given to this Glaſs-body a moderate Fire,
with the ſame cautions as before; the Salt
will quickly riſe, and ſtick to the Head;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60888:104"/>
where, the Sublimation being ended, you
will finde it in the form of Chryſtals, white
like ſnow; which you are to put up and
keep in a bottle exactly cloſed, to uſe it
upon occaſion. This Salt thus rectified
ſmells not of Fire, and hath nothing but
its own natural ſtrong and penetrating
ſcent.</p>
               <p>There may perhaps be found Artiſts,
who will take it ill, that we have been ſo
large and ſo particular in exactly ſetting
down all the things, that are to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in preparing and rectifying this Salt.
But it is not for them, that we have done
it, but for thoſe, who not knowing it will
be glad to learn it. We have given them
ſincerely the true means uſed by ourſelves;
which they may alſo practiſe in preparing
and rectifying the Salts of the parts of all
Animals. Thoſe that have any tincture
of Chymiſtry, will here find enough to
teach themſelves; as we have done, and
do daily. Mean time they muſt not be
offended, that there remain with us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ſubject ſuch things, which could
not be ſaid, nor well comprehended but
by thoſe that have labour'd a great while
in this Art. Intelligent perſons, that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60888:104"/>
ſhall examine our proceeding, or have a
mind to experience the ſame, will find
our ingenuouſneſs, by finding the ſucceſs of
all we have made them expect, together
with the facility, we give, of the Operation.
They will alſo find, that our way of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Retort as far as the neck, is more
proper than that of leaving a third part
empty, as ſome would have it, in the Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Bones, Horns, and other dry
parts of Animals; although thoſe, that
underſtand it, practice it not but in matters
that will melt, and may break the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,
or let ſomething run out by the
beak, when 'tis fill'd too high. But in
dry ſubſtances, as are our Vipers, and the
Horns, and Bones of Animals, Crabs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyes,
Stones, and the like, it is enough to
leave this neck empty, to give vent to
the parts raiſed from the matter, and that
are to go into the Recipient. They will
alſo acknowledge, that our way to leave
the Oyl among the other ſubſtances, when
we will ſever them by ſubliming and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
them, is not without reaſon, in regard
that the Oyl hath commonly with it much
Volatile Salt, which leaves it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
riſeth in the Rectification.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:60888:105"/>
We eſteem alſo, that this Preparation
will be preferr'd before many others, that
are operoſe and have little method in
them; and, among others, before the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which ſome pretend to make by
the addition of Spirit of Salt to the
Phlegme, and to that which is call'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and to the Volatil Salt: which inſtead
of rectifying this Salt, and of making it
purer and better, changes its nature; and
inſtead of ſubliming it to the Head and the
top of the Body (as they have pretended
it did, after the Phlegm was riſen,) the
Spirit of Salt riſeth it ſelf in its firſt form,
in its ſmell, colour and taſte, leaving at
the bottom the Salt, which is there found
like fixed, having the taſt and the other
qualities of the Spirit of Salt, but being
leſſen'd of two thirds of its weight. That
kind of men have fill'd Books with many
Preparations they underſtand not, nor have
experimented: For, forgetting, among
other things, in the proceſs of this, ſuch
methods as are abſolutely neceſſary, and
without which they do nothing, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
impoſſible ſucceſſes, and putting
the Cart before the Horſes, they fix the
Salt when they pretend to ſublime it, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60888:105"/>
ſo very unadviſedly proſtitute themſelves
to ſhame and confuſion. For, inſtead of
rectifying firſt the Volatile Salt (as more
intelligent men might have taught them,
of whom they had borrowed this Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
and of ſubliming it, and of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it by this means from other parts;
they labouring to diſguiſe the Proceſs,
have retrenched the main and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
part of it, and employed at the
very firſt that method, which they ſhould
have obſerv'd to fix it, believing that
that would ſublime it; not conſidering,
that having by that means inverted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the ſucceſs would prove anſwerable
to it. I ſet a ſide their unwarrantable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of adding a pound of luke-warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
among the ſubſtances found in the
Recipient, after the firſt diſtillation, ſince
it is an Augmentation, not onely uſeleſs,
but troubleſome, of that Phlegme, which
muſt needs be ſeparated.</p>
               <p>Now, although one part of this Salt,
remaining in the Body of the Limbec, may
yet afterwards becom Volatil, by mixing
it with ſome Lixiviat Salt, and making it
to ſublime; yet <hi>that</hi> is not done but with
a new and very great loſs of its weight;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60888:106"/>
nor is the taſte of it better than of that,
which ſhall have been well rectified accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the method, we have before deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed;
ſince the Lixiviat Salts, by revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it in part, give it as diſpleaſing a ſmel
as the former. We may further add here,
that the uſe of tall and ſtrait-neck't Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
is much more proper for this Rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
than the uſe of Matraſſes with
long necks, myſelf having experimented,
that the Phlegme fals back again more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily,
and that the Volatil Salt riſeth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
in the Bodies of our faſhion; of which
the <hi>Figure</hi> may be ſeen on the <hi>Title page,</hi>
where alſo is that of the Retort and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient,
for the firſt Diſtillation.</p>
               <p>Now although the ſame men, that
have given us cauſe to reprehend them,
have affirmed contrary to truth, that
there is no <hi>fix't</hi> Salt in the parts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals:
To prove that there is, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
by that of the Viper; Take what
ſhall remain in the Retort, commonly
called the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> which you
will find of the form and colour of Coales;
calcine it in a Furnace, or, to ſave expences,
in a Potters Oven, till all become white
and of the form of Chalk, pulverize it
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60888:106"/>
well, and make it boyl in a competent
quantity of water, that may receive and
diſſolve the Salt; filter it, and make it
euaporate and conſume. You'l find at
the bottom a coagulated Salt; though in
a ſmall quantity, and ſuch an one, as that
of five pounds of Viper-bones well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd,
we have obtain'd no more than
three ounces of fix't Salt. This Salt
hath a very ſharp and poynant taſte; it is
Lixiviat, and approaching enough in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
regards to the fixt Salt of Tartar.
You'l find on the Filter the Terreſtrial
part, ſtripp'd of all its vertue; which then
may juſtly be call'd <hi>Caput Mortuum.</hi>
And thus you'l have the Phlegme, that
which is call'd Spirit, the Volatil Salt,
the Oyl, the Fixt Salt, and the Earth;
into which all the parts of the Viper have
been reduced in their ſeparation.</p>

have in it, to ſpeak truth,
nothing offenſive, but its ſtrong
and piercing Smell, and that thoſe, who

many perſons, offended with the
piercing odour, which is firſt perceived in
this Salt, and beſides diſſatisfied with its
eaſy Avolation, unleſs it be extreamely
well cloſed, have endeavoured to fix it,
and ſo to free it from this ſmel, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that this ſmel cannot be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeparated from this Salt, but its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
muſt be ſo too, and that the fixation
changes its nature: And inſtead of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60888:107"/>
themſelves to rectify it well, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to carry away, as much as may be, the
adventitious ſmel, which it may have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by the violence of the fire by the
firſt diſtillation, they have ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
deſtroyed it, and have dealt
with it, as if one would deprive <hi>Muſc</hi> and
<hi>Amber-gris</hi> of their good ſent, and <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida</hi>
of its bitterneſs; and many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
of their operations, which would
not be what they are, if you ſhould robb
them of the leaſt of thoſe parts that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them.</p>
               <p>We ſay therefore, that after the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of this Volatil Salt, (ſuch an one
as we ſhall ſet down beneath,) the beſt and
ſureſt preparation would be, to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe to it, but to make it to be uſed in
that condition, only mixing with it things
accomodated to the Patients taſte, or with
ſuch other remedies, as do not change
its nature, nor make it looſe any thing of
its force or vertue.</p>
               <p>If the Fixed Salt of Vipers were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to arreſt and retain the Volatil, there
were then nothing to be ſaid againſt this
fixation, becauſe having been both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
jointly and in the ſame body, they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60888:108"/>
have no averſion to, but rather are able to
help one another; But this common ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and this friendſhip which they have
contracted, whilſt they lived together in
one and the ſame ſubject, hinders them from
deſtroying one another, and maketh, that
what is Fixe can nor will change the nature
of the Volatil. And indeed, although
you mixe them together, and that the
quantity of the Fixe be five or ſix times
greater than that of the Volatil, and that
they may alſo lodg with one another; yet
they both equally keep their nature and
vertue, and they may be ſeparated by fire,
and manifeſt at all times their ſeveral and
diſtinct vertues. But this hinders not the
taking one Salt among the other, nor that
the Fixe ſhould not then borrow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the ſubtilty of the Volatil, the
better to penetrate the Entrals and Veſſels,
to open the more vigorouſly the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to expel the impurities, it meets
with, by ſiege or urine; and that, on the
contrary, the Volatil Salt, helped by the
Fix't Salt, ſhould not carry away and drive
out through the pores of the skin or other
ways, the more groſs and more viſcous
parts of the humors, that perhaps might
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60888:108"/>
have eſcaped its quick and ſubtile operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For which uſes, both Salts may be
mix'd together upon occaſion, without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
an impoſſible fixation.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially, the fixing of this Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Salt by <hi>Quick-lime</hi> cannot paſs with all
Artiſts but for an operation altogether deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructive
to it; and 'tis that, which is moſt
of all to be avoided, becauſe not only
it carries away the ſmel, taſte, and vertues
of this Salt, but quite changeth its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and converts it into its own, by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying
the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Fixation of this Volatil Salt, by
the Spirit of Salt, although it ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
it and change its nature, in that it
carries away the ſmel and taſte of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil
Salt, may notwithſtanding be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
rather than the other, in regard that
the Spirit of Salt, by preſerving the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
it hath to open all the obſtructions of
the inward parts, working upon the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil
Salt, may appropriate to it ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of its vertue, eſpecially that which
is able to ſecond its action, and to expel
together with it, by urine or other ways,
the moſt tenacious and moſt ſtubborn hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.
Thoſe that would expel the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60888:109"/>
by theſe ways, may uſefully prepare
it after this manner.</p>
               <p>Mix four ounces of the Volatil Salt of
Vipers, well rectifyed, with four ounces
of Water; put them into a Glaſs-Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
Somewhat high, of a narrow mouth,
broad and flat towards the bottom, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
about two pints. Fit to its mouth
a Glaſs-funnel, the end of whoſe pipe is
very narrow: Lute the funnel quite round
about the orifice of the Cucurbite, ſo
that there may be no other aperture but
that of the end of the funnel. Then
powre, little by little, and drop-wiſe,
ſome Spirit of Salt well rectified upon
the Volatil Salt. At firſt there will be a
conflict betwixt them, which will cauſe
an ebullition, but that of a ſhort duration.
Continue to powre upon it of the ſame
Spirit of Salt, gently and leiſurely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as you find the ebullition ceaſe, and
by intervals ſtir alſo the Cucurbite; and
repeat this ſo often, that at laſt there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
no motion any more, and the
Spirit of Salt have as 'twere mortified and
fixed the Volatil Salt. Then place the
Cucurbite in ſome receptacle furniſh't with
Sand; fit to it a head, lute it (though at
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60888:109"/>
the beginning that be not neceſſary) and
by a ſlow fire draw away all the moiſture
of the Spirit of Salt, and of the Volatil
Salt, which will riſe almoſt inſipid. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the fire ſtill, and when you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a taſte of the Spirit of Salt in what
ſhall be diſtill'd, change the Recipient,
increaſe a little the fire, and drive it (yet
without too much violence,) until there
diſtil no more, and that the Salt remain
at the bottom of the Cucurbite altogether
dry and of a gray colour. You'l find in
the Recipient a Spirit of Salt of the ſame
taſte, of the ſame colour, and of the
ſame force it had when it was powr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Volatil Salt; but you ſhall not
find any part of the Volatil Salt riſen to
the head, nor to the top of the Cucurbit,
as ſome have given out it doth, without
having experimented it, as we have done.
The gray Salt, found at the bottom, is
but in a ſmal quantity, being leſſen'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of two thirds: It's taſte is very ſharp,
biting, and much differing from what it had
before it was fix'd, and as 'twere mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Spirit of Salt. After this you
may diſſolve this Salt in water, filter it, and
make it evaporate, and letting it cool,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60888:110"/>
you'l find at the bottom a ſmal quantity
of Salt coagulated in the form of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals.
Powr out by inclination the water
ſwimming on the top, to have the Salt by
itſelf, which you may dry in the Air, or
the Sun, or over a little fire. You may
alſo make good uſe of the Salt that ſhall
have remained in the water that ſwam a
top, by making it evaporate in part,
Chryſtallizing and drying it, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
You might, if you pleaſed, very well
omit luting the Funnel upon the Cucurbit,
when you will powre the Spirit of Salt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Volatil Salt; foraſmuch as we have
found by experiment, that in the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit of Salt upon the Volatil
Salt, there riſeth nothing but phlegme,
that hath neither vertue nor ſmel; although
the ſame perſons, that have err'd in many
things in the rectification of the Volatil
Salt, have fear'd they ſhould looſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a Volatil Spirit, which was only in
their imagination: And the luting, which
we have adviſed, was only to prevent
peoples belief, that a part of the Volatil
Salt might have eſcaped that way.</p>
               <p>But although this Volatil Salt appear
fix't, and remain as ſuch at the bottom of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60888:110"/>
the Cucurbit, after diſtillation, yet
there is a part, which retakes its former
nature, and becoms Volatil again, if it
be mix'd with Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> or with
ſome other Lixiviate Salt, putting them
together in a ſubliming veſſel. For theſe
<hi>Lixiviate</hi> Salts, being of a nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>acid</hi> Salts and Spirits, do morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
them and retain them to themſelves,
and let go the Volatil Salts, which the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
ſpirits had, as 'twere, mortified and
fix'd, and all that was Volatil in this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly
fix't Salt, riſeth in a white form,
and hath almoſt the ſame taſte and the
ſame other qualities of the Volatil Salts
well rectified. Yet you will alſo find there
a great diminution of its weight, ſo that
it will be more advantagious to keep it in
the condition, it was in before this laſt
ſublimation; the greateſt advantage of
which is, to come to know, that the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
that hath been made by the Spirit
of Salt, although it have as 'twere chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the nature of the Volatil Salt, and
hid its diaphoretique quality under that of
the diuretique, yet hath not quite deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, ſince there is ſome part, that can
retake its priſtine form and vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:60888:111"/>
This Salt thus fix'd poſſeſſeth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of a Spirit of Salt concentred, but
they are found augmented by thoſe,
it hath borrowed from the Volatil Salt.
Thoſe, who would only carry away, by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
or ſiege, the ſuperfluous humours of
the body, may uſefully prepare and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it; but thoſe, that ſhall uſe the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Salt well rectified, without chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its nature, nor diverting its action by
any fixation, will finde therein ſuch effects,
as will be incomparably more apparent and
more ſenſible, and will not waſte of it ſo
much.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Vertues of the Volatile
Salt of Vipers, and of what
the other parts, ſeparated by
Diſtilla on, may perform.</head>
               <p>THE Volatile Salt of Vipers is to
be conſider'd, as a Sun, as well
among the parts, that riſe by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation,
as among thoſe that reſt in the
Retort; there being none among thoſe
that are come over, but have borrowed
from it almoſt all the vertue it can have;
nor any of thoſe that have ſtay'd, but have
need of it, or are uſeleſs without it. The
<hi>Flegm</hi> that riſeth firſt, carries alwayes ſome
part with it, without which it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
no effect. That which is called
<hi>Spirit,</hi> is nothing elſe, to ſpeak aright, but
a Volatile Salt, which in the diſtillation
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60888:112"/>
hath been followed by a little Flegme
diſſolving it, and giving it the form of a
Spirit: which may be ſhewed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
wherein that ſaline volatil part
is ſeparated, raiſed, and coagulated into a
white and chryſtalline forme, and leaveth
at the botom of the cucurbite the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
that had changed its nature, and is
nothing elſe but flegm. We ſay, on this
occaſion, the ſame thing of what many
Authors improperly call the Volatil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of an humane skull, of Harts-horn, and
of other parts of Animals, they being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but Volatil Salts mixt with
flegme, which they afterwards quit, when
they are rectified. The <hi>Oyle</hi> alſo would
have but very little vertue, if it borrowed
no Volatil ſalt, and if it retained not in it
a good part thereof, as may be obſerved
in the Rectification: for, if the Oyle were
meaſur'd, or weighed, before 'tis put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the reſt into the cucurbite for recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and if it were weighed again after
that all the Volatil Salt is riſen, it would
be found much diminiſhed in quantity,
and in ſtrength alſo, becauſe moſt of the
Volatil Salt, which had joyned it ſelf to
it, hath been carried away by the rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60888:112"/>
So thoſe, that ſeparate the Oyle
from the other parts to rectify them, and
who uſe it not but for wounds or ulcers,
and to take away ſuperfluities, do doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
not know it aright; for it is alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with other vertues more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
of which we ſhall ſpeake in this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
The Fixt Salt, which reſts in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,
mix't among the terreſtrial part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is to be put in the rank of Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat
Salts, and poſſeſſeth few other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
but thoſe of Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> yet
retains ſomething of the nature of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
ſalt. And thoſe, that have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this Salt as a <hi>Cauſtick,</hi> have had good
ſucceſs with it, without knowing its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſeing they imputed it to the maligne
parts, which they believed to be in Vipers,
whereas they ſhould have aſcribed it to
the nature of Lixiviate ſalts. But this
Salt being taken at the mouth, will be
much more effectual, if you mingle ſome
Volatil Salt with it; this Cauſtique fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
not hindring but that it may be taken
ſafely and beneficially in appropriated li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
as many other lixiviate Salts are.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> part hath nothing in it,
that deſerves to be conſidered, and it may
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60888:113"/>
juſtly be called <hi>Terra mortua,</hi> Dead earth,
after it is freed from its fixed Salt. So that
all the parts, that riſe by diſtillation, as
well as thoſe that cannot riſe, are of ſmall
force, or altogether uſeleſs, without the
Volatil Salt. It is therefore upon good
reaſon, that we attribute to it the principal
vertues, which a Viper can furniſh.</p>
               <p>The ſimilitude of ſubſtance, which the
Volatile Salt of Viper hath with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
parts of our Body, conjoyn'd to its
ſubtile and piercing quality, maketh, that
accommodating itſelf to their condition,
and finding all liberty in its actions, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
all the effects, it is capable of, and
penetrateth without any oppoſition into
the most ſecret and the moſt remote parts
of the Body. It hath this peculiar, that
thought it act as a Soverain, and finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of reſiſtance to its dominion, yet it
exerciſeth it not as a Conquerour, nor as
a Deſtroyer, but rather as a Reſtorer of
the places and parts, where it paſſeth; and
although all its courſes be extraordinary
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> precipitate, yet they are ſo well

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> is unuſeful, but rather very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60888:113"/>
to all the places, where it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
               <p>Now ſince the fleſh, the heart, the liver,
and the other parts of the Viper, taken as
an Aliment, or as a Medicine, may ſerve for
the cure of many maladies, and produce ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſiderable effects; 'tis not at all tobe
doubted, but that this Salt, which is the
moſt ſubtile and the moſt potent of them
all, is ſomething more ſublime and more
efficacious. And we are aſſur'd, that if it
were well known to us, it would paſs for an
almoſt Univerſal medicine; men would be
careful of preparing it, and we ſhould ſee
it often preſcribed by Phyſitians, and find
it ſucceed in innumerable obſtinate diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
that are but ſeldom and difficultly
cured.</p>
               <p>To Judge well of the Effects, which
this Volatile Salt can produce in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
we muſt know its manner of operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is, to open, to comminute, to
attenuate, to pierce, and to drive to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
parts of the Body, and through the
pores of the skin, all the impurities, and
all the ſtrange bodies, that can get out by
thoſe wayes. Further, it is an enemy to
all corruption, very friendly and very agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60888:114"/>
to our nature, which it aſſiſts and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies,
enabling it to expell, not onely by
the pores of the skin, but alſo by ſiege and
urine, and by all the Emunctories of the
Body, the ſuperfluous humors, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
it: Whence it comes to paſs, that it
produces admirable effects upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
occaſions, curing a great number of
ſickneſſes, or at leaſt giving great relief
therein, even in thoſe, that are moſt refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and moſt difficult to cure; ſuch as are
Apoplexies, Lethargies, Convulſions, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
and many other maladies, believed to
have their ſource in the Brain. It is alſo a
great relief to the Diſtempers of the Breaſt,
as Swoundings, Palpitations of the Heart,
Difficulties of Breathing, and Pleuriſies.
Beſides it particularly unſtops the Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Liver, Spleen, Meſentery, and
other parts of the lower Belly. It diſſipates
all inward impoſtumes, in their riſe, and
diſlodgeth ſecret and unknown pains,
which have their origin in the Spirits. It
helps digeſtion, the purification of the
maſs of the blood, and its diſtribution to
all the parts of the Body, and reſolves and
prevents coagulations: And ſo being an
Enemy to all corruption, it is very proper
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60888:114"/>
for all ſorts of Fevers, cauſed thereby;
as for moſt intermittent Feavers, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<hi>Quartans.</hi> It alſo worketh pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
in the diſtempers of the <hi>Matrix;</hi>
and is a remedy to all the vices of the skin,
and to the Leproſy it ſelf: but above all,
'tis ſpecifique againſt all Bitings and ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of venomous creatures, againſt all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noms
and poyſons, if they be not corroſive;
for in that caſe, recourſe muſt preſently be
had to Vomitives and to Unctuous things,
after which it produceth good effects. It
hath a particular vertue againſt the Plague,
againſt all Contagious diſeaſes, and Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
ones, ſuch as are the Meaſels, Small
Pox, and the like. In a word, the Inductions,
we can draw from the great number of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
we have ſeen of it, at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
times, oblige us to affirm, that its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
goes beyond what can be expreſſed.
And thoſe, that ſhall make reflexion on
what we have ſaid of it, will be able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and uſe it beneficially to many other
ſickneſſes, which to enumerate would be
too prolix and too tedious.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, we cannot forbear to
relate here a very remarkable Experiment,
made upon a Gentleman, who ſuffered
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60888:115"/>
about a month ſince, a violent and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
paine, doubled and redoubled, at the
right part of his front pretty near the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
the end of a finger might cover the
place of the pain; there appeared no redneſs
nor ſwelling, and there was perceived no
hardneſs. Yet the pain, though it was, as
'twere, fixed in a point, was communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the other neighboring parts, ſo that
the Gentleman could not chew, nor ſo much
as open his mouth to take down a little
broth, but with extreme pain, though
hunger urged him. The Phyſitians, that
ſaw him, had uſed ſeveral means to relieve
him, and, among the reſt, <hi>Venae</hi>-ſections
in the arm and foot; they had purged him
often; they had employed frictions of his
neck and ſhoulders; they had applyed to
him Veſicatories, and Snailes, behind his
eares: they had cauſed his temporal arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be open'd, and drawn from him ten
or twelve ounces of arterial blood, and
then cauteriſed the Aperture; they had
alſo preſcribed him powerful Sudorifiques,
which were continued many dayes morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and evening, and had made him ſweat
very copiouſly; and the Patient himſelf,
of his own accord, being extremely preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60888:115"/>
by the violence of the pains, cauſed
one of his upper teeth, which was very
ſound, to be pulled out, hoping thereby
to give ſome vent to them: But after he
had uſed all theſe means in vain, one doſe
of the Volatil Salt of Vipers, given in
wine, remov'd preſently all the pain,
which cauſed as great a wonder in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants,
as ſatisfaction in the Patient. This
ſo ſurpriſing effect, which demonſtrateth
better, than all reaſons, the force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of this Volatil Salt, may alſo conclude
the diſcourſe of its Vertues.</p>
               <p>There remains now, that we ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the vertues of the <hi>Oyle,</hi> which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
by Diſtillation with the Volatil Salt,
of which it alſo retains a part. Its ſtrong
ſent is the cauſe, that it is not often em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed;
whence it comes, that ſometimes
it is more advantageous to the Preparer,
to profit by the rectification of the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Salt, which it hath, than to keep it
in its condition for Patients that ſhall uſe
it notwithſtanding its ſtrong ſmel and ill
taſte. This ſmel is ſo intimately ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, that there is no rectification,
able to remove it. But we make herewith
known to all thoſe, that ſhall be able to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60888:116"/>
comply with the uſe of it, that it is one of
the beſt and moſt efficacious outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
in all Phyſick, provided it be
made uſe of, when 'tis yet indued with
its Volatil Salt: For it opens, attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,
reſolves, is abſterſive, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
cleanſing; and we know, who
have experimented it, that the continued
anointing with it, accompanied with the
internal uſe of the Volatil Salt, produceth
admirable effects in the parts labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Palſy, and deprived of motion,
and even in thoſe, that are dryed for want
of the communication of Spirits and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.
A little Spunge imbibed with
this Oyl, carried in a little box pierced,
and often ſmelled to, is very good in the
time of the Plague, to keep off the ill
Air, and to fortify the Brain, and the
noble parts. It is alſo good to make it to
be ſmelled, to put of it in the noſtrils, and
to annoint the Temples with it, in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptical
Symptoms, and for thoſe, that
are troubled with giddineſs, and have
their Brain charged with vapors or flegme;
for it gives them vent, and diſpels them
powerfully. It hath alſo a conſiderable
effect againſt the ſuffocations of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:60888:116"/>
and againſt all ſorts of worms; in
which caſe, ſome drops of it may even be
given at the mouth, in wine, or broth;
and the hollow of the ſtomach anointed
therewith. It viſibly diſſipitateth all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
contuſions, and ſerveth much for
inward ones, and eſpecially for thoſe of
the Head. It reſolves tumours and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
giving iſſue by the pores to ſuch
matter, as can tranſpire, digoſting the
greſſer, and bringing them to a laudable
ſuppuration. It is alſo abſterſive and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
all ſorts of Ulcers, and healeth all
the diſtempers of the skin, even the moſt
ſtubborn, provided the internal cauſe
thereof be removed. In all which evils its
effects are yet more quick and powerful,
if it be enforced by the internal uſe of the
Volatil Salt, which, in a word, is that,
which gives it its main vertue.</p>
               <p>We ſhall add, on this occaſion, that the
Ancients valued very much their Oyl of
Vipers, which they prepared ſeveral ways,
ſome by infuſion, ſome by the decoction
of Vipers in Oyl of Oliues. If they had
rightly proportioned the quantity of Vipers
with that of the Oyl; if they had added
thereto what moiſture was neceſſary; and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60888:117"/>
if in this they had employed ſome good
method, this Oyl might produce good
effects, and we ſhould approve of it,
and refer our Readers to it. But finding
nothing regular in all the Preparations, by
them deſcribed, we thought good here
to ſet down one, according to all the
rules of Art.</p>
               <p>Take about the end of <hi>May,</hi> or the
beginning of <hi>June,</hi> a dozen great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
newly taken, cut each of them into
ſeven or eight pieces, and put them into a
well glazed and ſtrong earthen pot: powr
upon them three pounds of Oyl of Olives,
and one pint of white wine; cover the
pot well, and make it boyl over a gentle
fire to the conſumption of the moiſture.
Then ſtrain all, ſqueeze out the Vipers
well, and keep the Oyle for uſe. In the
mean time, fear not (as the Antients did)
the Vapors, that may iſſue out of the pot
during the decoction; for the Vipers, as
we have ſaid, have no poyſon in all their
body. This Oyle, thus prepared, hath
not, 'tis true, all the ſtrength and vertues
of the diſtilled Oyle, of which we were
ſpeaking a little before; but it may very
well ſerve for an oyntment in all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60888:117"/>
of the skin, in contractions of
nerves, in rheumatiſmes, &amp; in many other
evils.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Manner of uſing the
Volatil Salt.</head>
               <p>ALthough it be impoſſible to ſpecify
in particular all the wayes of Uſing
the Volatil Salt of Vipers, no
more than one can well enumerate the
ſickneſſes, that may have need of it; Yet,
in ſome degree to ſatisfy thoſe that may
deſire it we ſhall make here an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a good part of what we have ſeen
practiſ'd by Phyſitians, that perfectly know
the qualities and proprieties of this Salt,
and uſe it daily to the great benefit of their
Patients.</p>
               <p>You muſt <hi>firſt</hi> know, that its piercing
Taſte hinders it from being given alone,
and that it muſt be mix't, <hi>now</hi> with ſome
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60888:118"/>
Aliment, as in broth, the yolk of an egg,
a roſted apple, a little jelley, &amp;c. <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi>
with Medicines, and that innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wayes, which partly depend from the
humour and diſpoſition of the Patient, but
chiefly from the wit, knowledge, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the Phyſitian. For this Salt
calls for a Phyſitian, that hath ſufficient
ability to know and meaſure its force and
activity; that is intelligent and verſed in
all Maladies, to be able beneficially to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it in thoſe that require it, that knows
to chuſe a favorable time and occaſion;
and to mix it pertinently and to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
with ſuch things, as may not change
its nature nor divert its operation, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the indication, he ſhall have taken.
So that 'tis neceſſary, to be equally aſſur'd
of the genuine and methodical preparation
of the Salt; of the knowledge of its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and vertues; of the nature of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
of the condition, temper, and
ſtrength of the Patient; of the fitneſs of
its exhibition among aliments or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
medicaments, and of the occaſions
and the time, in which it may be uſefully
employed. And when a due regard hath
been had to all theſe circumſtances, men
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60888:118"/>
will not fail to finde very good effects of it.
But that thoſe, who are not accuſtom'd
to make uſe of it, may not unawares finde
in it effects contrary to the nature of this
Salt, we have thought ourſelves obliged
to advertiſe them, that they muſt above
all things avoid mixing them among <hi>Acids,</hi>
and eſpecially among Spirit of Salt, Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol,
Brimſtone, and the like, which would
fix it and deſtroy its operation. To find
therefore facility in its exhibition, it may
be taken in diſtilled waters, or ptiſane, or
ſuch decoctions as are appropriated to the
diſeaſe; as alſo in Juleps, Emulſions, or
Potions diverſly compoſed. It may alſo
be mix't in Conſerves, Extracts, Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the like; as alſo in Lozenges and
Opiats, diverſly made according to the
nature of the diſtemper, and the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Phyſitian; It is alſo mingled
with Purgatives, Sudorifiques, Aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Diuretiques; and no leſs, with
its own fix't Salt, and ſuch other Salts, as
are not contrary to it. It is alſo given in
Wine, and among certain Mineral waters.
It may be adminiſtred to both ſexes, and
to all ages, at all times and hours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
meals according to the nature of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60888:119"/>
the diſeaſe, and the intention of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.
It may be taken, if one will, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times in a day, and even at night; and
the uſe of it may be continued for a good
while.</p>
               <p>As to its doſe, that is different, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the occaſion, age, temper and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the Patient, and the nature of
the diſtemper, and the reiteration made of
it: For, the doſe is to be much leſs for
thoſe, who take it often in one day, and
continue the uſe of it, than for thoſe, that
take it but once in a caſe of need. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
'tis eſteemed ſufficient to give 6. 8.
10. or 12. grains of it; but on certain
occaſions we may give 20. or 25. grains,
and ſome-times, half a drachme, and even
a whole drachme. But diſcretion and skill
is to be uſed; without which, this Salt, as
excellent as 'tis, may produce effects quite
contrary to what the Phyſitian and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
might expect from it.</p>

               <head type="sub">Divers Remedies or Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
of which the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Salt of Vipers is the Baſe
or Ground.</head>
               <p>WE had not undertaken to deſcribe
the vertues, nor the Uſes of the
Volatil Salt of Vipers, no more than of
the Fix't Salt, and of the Oyle that riſeth
by Diſtillation, if this our Book were only
written for the skilful Phyſitian, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
knows all, and eſpecially the parts
that may be drawn from the Viper. But
being deſirous to do a good office to ſuch
perſons, as have no knowledg thereof, or
that knowing it in part, have need to be
directed, eſpecially in the exhibition of
this Volatil Salt; we thought good to
conclude this Book with the <hi>Receipts</hi> of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60888:120"/>
the chief Compoſitions of which this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latil
Salt may be the Ground, which are
not found in Books, and may produce Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
worthy of this Salt.</p>
               <p>And knowing, that there are many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
perſons, who having a great eſteem
for the Viper and its uſes, make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof in private, following the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts</hi>
they find in Books, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
are well, ſome-times ill preſcribed,
or ill executed; Weſt all impart to them
an <hi>Elixir</hi> of <hi>Vipers,</hi> that ſhall be of great
vertue, pleaſant to the taſte, of eaſy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
and of long duration.</p>
               <p>Take four douzen of Hearts and as
many Livers of Vipers, dry'd in the ſhade,
and reduced to powder; two drachmes of
good Cinnamon, half a drachme of Cloves,
groſly beaten: put them into a ſtrong
glaſs-bottle, holding about two pints.
Powr on it a pound of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary's</hi>
Water, a pound of Meliſſe-water,
half a pound of Orange-flower-water, and
half a pound of Roſe-water. Cloſe the
bottle exactly, and expoſe it to the Sun
for fourty dayes; after which diſſolve
in the liquor a pound of fine Sugar, and
paſs all through a clean bagg. Put up
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60888:120"/>
this Elixir in a Bottle, and add to it half
an ounce of the Volatil Salt of Vipers,
well rectified, twelve grains of Levant-Musk,
and as much of Amber-gris. Cloſe
the bottle exactly, and you may keep this
<hi>Elixir,</hi> to uſe it in time of need, from half
a ſpoonfull to a whole. You may take
of it in the morning upon an empty Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
and at all hours, according as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
ſhall require. This medicin is very
good and very convenient: It is not onely
proper againſt all Poyſons, againſt the
Plague, and all Contagious and Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
diſeaſes, but it alſo fortifieth all the
noble parts, preſerves the Natural heat
in good condition, and by this means the
uſe of it conduces much to preſerve
Health, and to prolong Life.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Elixir</hi> following deſerveth alſo to
be communicated to the Public, as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
that is not common, and is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable,
not onely for the Sickneſſes of
men, as well in the Brain, as the ſtomack,
and all the noble parts; but alſo very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
for moſt of the diſeaſes of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
I ſhall give you here the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. Take an ounce of good Saffron,
as much of fair Myrrhe, as much of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60888:121"/>
Socotrina,</hi> and the ſame quantity of
White Amber; a drachm of the Extract
of <hi>Opium,</hi> and as much of the Extract of
<hi>Caſtor.</hi> Mingle your Extracts in a little
Spirit of Wine; pulverize all the reſt;
and put altogether in a Glaſs-Body: powr
upon it three pounds of Spirit of wine tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarized;
place the Body in a Bath of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes;
fit an Head to it, with its Recipient,
well luted together: Give it a moderate
fire, and draw from it about the moiety of
the Spirit of Wine; then unlute your veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
decant the tincture, that will ſwim
above your powders, which will be found
very much imbued with all their qualities;
and keep it by itſelf in a bottle well-cloſed.
Powre the Spirit of Wine, which you
have drawn off, upon the remainder in the
Body; Fit again to it the Head and the
Recipient, and draw again from it the
half of the Spirit of Wine. Decant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the tincture ſwimming a top, mingle
it with the firſt, and keep it likewiſe. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hobate
for the third time the Spirit of
wine, drawn off, upon the remainder in
the Body; proceed as before, and powre
off the tincture ſwimming a top, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
it with the former: then filter all three
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60888:121"/>
together, and powre all into a ſtrong Viall,
adding to the whole an ounce of the Volatil
Salt of Vipers, which will eaſily diſſolve in
it; keep the whole thus mix't and well
cloſed. The <hi>doſe</hi> may be from ten to ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
drops.</p>
               <p>We ſhall yet adde to this an <hi>Opiate</hi> of
great efficacy for moſt diſtempers of the
Brain; and tis this. Take half an ounce
of the Extract of the root and ſeed of the
male-Paeony; and of the true Miſſeltoe
of the Oak, and of that of Betony-flowers,
and of that of Clove-gilly-flowers, the
ſame quantity of each of them; three
drachms of the Confection of <hi>Alkermes</hi> of
<hi>Meſue,</hi> three drachms of the Volatil Salt
of Vipers, one drachme of the Volatil
Salt of <hi>Succinum,</hi> two drachms and an
half of prepared Pearl, and as much of
Crabs-eyes prepar'd; three drops of Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-oyle,
and as much of the oyle of
Mace: Mingle all according to Art, and
make an Opiate of it, and keep it in a pot
of Fayence (a ſort of fine white Earthen
pots) well cloſed. The doſe of it may be
from a ſcruple to a drachme.</p>
               <p>You may alſo make, in the following
manner, an opening and laxative Opiate,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60888:122"/>
that ſhall conduce to the cure of ſundry
long and ſtubborn diſeaſes, eſpecially of
thoſe that are cauſed by ſeveral obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the parts. Take of the Conſerve
of Tamarisk-flowers, of the Conſerve of
the Flowers of <hi>Geniſta</hi> or Spaniſh-Broom,
of that of Mary-gold, and of that of the
Male-peach flowers, of each ſix drachms;
half an ounce of the Volatil Salt of Vipers,
as much of the Extract of the ordinary <hi>Iris</hi>
root, and as much of the Extract of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb;
two drachms of the fix't Salt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
as much of the Mineral Bezoar, and
as much of the Salt of Worm-wood; a
drachme and an half of Roſin of Scammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and as much of the Extract of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida;
and a drachme of the powder of
Cinnamon. Mix all theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and adding to it, as much as needs,
of the Syrup of Succory, compounded
with Rubarb, you ſhall make an Opiate of
it, the Doſe of which may be from one
drachme to two, and even to three for
ſtronger Bodies.</p>
               <p>There may alſo be made Pills, that ſhall
have a vertue near the former in efficacy,
to be taken in a leſs quantity. Take of
the Extract of Aloes, made with the juyce
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60888:122"/>
of the cleanſed flowers of Violets, of the
Extract of Rubarb, and of that of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant-Sena,
of each two drachms; as much
of the Volatil Salt of Vipers, as much of
the Roſin of Scammony, and as much of
the Gumm Ammoniac in drops; one
drachme of Mineral Bezoar, and the like
quanitty of the Fixt Salt of Vipers. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all into a maſs of Pills, of which the
doſe ſhall be from half a ſcruple to two
ſcruples.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, whoſe ſtomach ſhall be troubled
with tenacious humors, ſuch as could not
be carryed away by Purges, or other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies;
thoſe, that have a nauſeouſneſs,
and are ſubject to troubleſome reſentments
from the Stomach, may to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
uſe the following powder.</p>
               <p>Take of Coriander-ſeed (that is not
prepared with Vinegar, according to the
ill way of the Antients, but ſuch as is ſold
in good ſhops,) of Anis-ſeed, of ſweet
Fennel-ſeed, of the root of Lickoriſh well
ſcraped and dryed, of each half anounce;
three drachms of the Volatil Salt of Vipers,
and as much of Crabs-eyes prepared; two
drachms of the Fixt Salt of Vipers, and as
much of well-choſen Cinamon. Bring all
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60888:123"/>
to a fine powder, and adde to it its weight,
or if you will, double its weight of fine
powder'd ſugar. Cloſe this mixture in
a Glaſs-veſſel, or in one of the fine white
Earthen pots, and cloſe it carefully. You
may take of it, at a time, from half a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to a whole, according as you have put
more or leſs Sugar to it. You may alſo
adde to the powder ſome drops of the Oyl
of Anis, and of the Oyl of Cinnamon, and
even of Musk and Ambre-gris.</p>
               <p>This Volatil Salt is to very good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
mix't among the Sneezing powders;
for beſides that it penetrates exceedingly
by its activeneſs, it alſo diſcharges the
Brain powerfully, and withall fortifieth it.
It may be mixed with the powders of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,
Marjoram, Roſemary, Arabic, Stae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas,
Sage, and the like, not putting but a
ſixth part of our Volatil Salt among theſe
powders.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that would have an Opiate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
not onely to fortify the Heart, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and all the noble parts, but alſo to
expell all kind of Venom, and all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities
of the maſs of Bloud, and of the
ſolid parts, and to make them iſſue out at
the pores of the skin, or at the other emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60888:123"/>
may prepare very beneficially the
following Opiate.</p>
               <p>Take two ounces of the Conſerve of
Gilly-flowers, one ounce of the Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Alkermes, ambred and musked, ſix
drachms of the Volatile Salt of Vipers
well rectified, half an ounce of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Hyacinth, as much of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
of <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> three drachmes of
the Mineral Bezoar; and of Pearl prepar'd,
of Crabs-eyes prepared, of the Extract of
Angelica, and of that of Carlina, of each
of theſe the ſame quantity; two drachms
of the Salt of Carduus Benedictus. Mix
all together, and reduce it to an Opiate,
by adding to it ſome Syrup of kermes, or
the Clove-Gilly-flowers, as much as needs
to give a good conſiſtence to the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition:
Which you are to keep cloſe for
your occaſions. You may take of it, for
a preſervative, half a drachm, at a time, in
Wine, or broth; but in urging ſickneſſes,
you may take of it a whole drachme, and
even two drachms.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that will uſe the Oyl which hath
been drawn by Diſtillation, may either em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it all alone, or mingle it with an equal
quantity of <hi>Unguentum Martiatum,</hi> and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60888:124"/>
even adde to it Oyles diſtilled of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
Sage, Lavender and the like.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, that ſhall well conſider theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts,
will finde therein not onely a fit
proportion in the doſe of all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
but alſo great cautiouſneſs in mixing
nothing with them, that may deſtroy or
change the natnre of our Volatil Salt;
which is the thing, moſt to be avoided in
the exhibition.</p>
               <p>We might here adde many other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
of which the Volatil Salt of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
may be the Ground; but we have
contented ourſelves to deliver theſe for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
knowing, that there may be found
divers others, good enough, in Books,
and eſteeming, that 'tis better to prepare
them upon occaſion according to exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and following the Receipts, which able
Phyſitians may preſcribe thereof.</p>
               <p>We have alſo explain'd ourſelves ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
in all particulars. We would have
been more large, if we had not apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
we might exceed our bounds, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
things, which might be thought to be
beyond our reach, and to belong onely to
knowing Phyſitians.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that know well to prepare this
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60888:124"/>
Volatil Salt of Vipers, and to unite it well
with the Volatil parts of Plants, and with
the Sulphureous parts of certain Minerals,
that are friendly to our nature, may ſay, that
they have made ſome progreſs in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
We labour daily, and wiſh our
ſelves able in time to impart ſomething to
the publick, that may be more accompliſht.</p>
