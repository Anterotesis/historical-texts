            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat we cannot but be much ſadded to ſee our undoubted Right of Petitioning with-held
from us, having attended ſeveral days at your Houſe-door with an humble Petition, deſiring
the making null of that moſt unrighteous, illegal Act made againſt Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> by the late
Parliament, although it is the known duty of Parliaments to receive Petitions: and it is ours and
the Nations undoubted right to petition, although an Act of Parliament were made againſt it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your
Honours may pleaſe to call to minde the unjuſt and unrighteous Acts made by King <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus</hi>
in the caſe of <hi>Mordecai</hi> and the Jews; yet <hi>Esther</hi> that righteous woman being encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the juſtneſs of the Cauſe (as we at this time are, through the juſtneſs of Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi>'s
Cauſe, and the common Cauſe of the whole Nation) did adventure her life to petition againſt ſo
unrighteous Acts obtained by <hi>Haman</hi> the Iews enemy. Your Honours may pleaſe to conſider
whether the late unjuſt and illegal Act againſt Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> was not obtained by ſuch an enemy
as proud <hi>Haman</hi> was, having no more cauſe for ſo doing, then <hi>Haman</hi> had; neither do we hope
that your Honours, upon mature conſideration, will have the leſs regard unto our Petition, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
women; judging that you will not be worſe unto us, then that Heathen King was to
<hi>Eſther,</hi> who did not onely hear her Petition, but reverſed that Decree or Act gone forth againſt
the Iewes, and did ſeverely puniſh the obtainer thereof, as in truth we hope your Honours will
judge that man to deſerve no leſs puniſhment, who obtained the ſaid moſt unjuſt and illegal Act
againſt Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> (though a favourite, as <hi>Haman</hi> was.) Truely we cannot but judge the
ſaid Act againſt Mr. <hi>John Lilburne</hi> to be of no leſs concernment to our ſelves and the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then unto Mr. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> ſince what is done or intended againſt him (being againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
right, and in the face thereof) may be done unto every particular perſon in the Nation.</p>
            <p>Your Honours may be pleaſed to call to minde that never-to-be-forgotten deliverance obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the good women of <hi>England</hi> againſt the uſurping Danes then in this Nation. You may
likewiſe conſider the readineſs and willingneſs of the good women of this Nation, who did think
neither their lives, nor their husbands and ſervants lives and eſtates to be too dear a price for the
gaining of yours and the Nations ancient Rights and Liberties out of the hands of incroachers
and oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>And therefore we hope, that, upon ſecond thoughts, your Honours will not ſlight the perſons
of your humble Petitioners, nor with-hold from us our undoubted right of petitioning,
ſince God is ever willing and ready to receive the Petitions of all, making no difference of
perſons. The ancient Laws of <hi>England</hi> are not contrary to the will of God: ſo that we
claim it as our right to have our Petitions heard; you having promiſed to govern the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in righteouſneſs: therefore we truſt that you will not ſuffer any further proceedings to
be had upon that moſt unrighteous Act againſt Mr. <hi>Lilburne.</hi>
