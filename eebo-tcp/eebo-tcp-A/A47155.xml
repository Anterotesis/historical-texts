         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Juſt Vindication
Of My Earneſt
EXPOSTULATION,
Added to my Book, called
The Antichriſts and Sadduces detected, &amp;c.</head>
            <head type="sub">Directed to the Pious and Learned, in the Church of England,
and among the Diſſenters, againſt the Trifling Exceptions
of Edward Pennington, which he calls Some Obſervations,
&amp;c.</head>
            <p>PAſſing by his Unchriſtian and Uncharitable Cenſures, of my being guilty of
Pride, Ambition, Malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Monopolizing Knowledge among the
Quakers; which laſt he goes to prove, with a lying Story he takes out of
a lying Book, publiſhed againſt me, ſaying, <q>It ſeems he told a Friend of
ours in <hi>America, If you ſerve</hi> G. K. <hi>ſo,</hi> G. K. <hi>will leave you, and then ye ſhall wander
about for lack of Knowledge, and ſhall not find it:</hi>
               </q> Which is an abominable Falſhood:
And this and the like falſe Accuſations, are the beſt Armour, theſe my Adverſaries
have to Fight againſt me, as alſo his falſly charging me, with impoſing fond Notions,
and Unſcriptural Creeds upon them (but what he calls ſo, were no other, then ſome of
the great Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion, the Denyal whereof I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
proved them guilty of, in the Meeting at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> 11th. of the 4th. Month,
1696. and in the Printed <hi>Narrative</hi> of the Proceedings there) I think fit to give ſome
brief Reply, to his Charge, p. 4, 5. where he ſaith, I once gave a different Character
of their Learning and Piety too, to whom I directed that Expoſtulation, for which he
citeth ſome Paſſages in a Book of mine, called <hi>Help in time of Need.</hi> Printed above
30 Years ago. But none of theſe Paſſages prove, that I did judge there were none
among them all, Pious and Learned, for indeed I was never ſo uncharitable. This
Man who will needs print Books, had need to go to School to learn that from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
to the Univerſal, the Conſequence is not good. What I ſaid againſt the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
then taught, in the Colleges of that Nation, many learned and Pious Men in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95818:2"/>
both Nations, will aſſent to be true, to wit, the Jeſuit Philoſophy; for that was it
which was then taught, and which I learned almoſt Word by Word out of Jeſuit Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors:
And ſince that time, both that College, and I ſuppoſe all the other Colleges
in both Nations, have changed that ſort of Philoſophy, out of their diſlike to it, as
I my ſelf had done, before I was a Quaker. But what if I ſhould blame the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
that is now taught in all the Colleges? Is there no other good Learning,
but that called Philoſophy? He has but little Learning, that ſo argues. What I then
ſaid againſt Schools and Univerſities, was againſt the ill Conſtitution and great Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in them at that time, but not againſt Schools, well and duly conſtituted, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was <hi>Luther,</hi> whoſe Authority I cited againſt them. Next as to what I ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Prelacy, and Lording Biſhops, (for ſo I cautioned it) in that Book. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth this prove, that I did conclude there could be no pious Biſhops; for within a
few Lines, in that very page, I did own there were ſome Biſhops in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days,
to whom the Lord had a regard, according to their Faithfulneſs to what they ſaw; by
Lording Biſhops, it is obvious, what I meant, even the ſame that is meant 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3.
<hi>being Lords over God's Heritage.</hi> But doth this prove, that I did judge there are
none to be found Pious and Learned among any here in <hi>England,</hi> Epiſcopal or others.
<hi>Even, Bernard, Thauler,</hi> and <hi>T. Kempis,</hi> with divers others that lived in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as well as I, have eſteemed both Pious and Learned.
Indeed I have to my Experience, found ſuch great Lording and Tyrannical Impoſition
in <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>William Penn,</hi> with their Lording Brethren of the Yearly
Meeting, 1695. as I never found in any of the Biſhops, either <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Scottiſh;</hi>
for by none of them was I ever Excommunicated: but by the Former I was Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
for bearing my Faithful Teſtimony againſt moſt Vile Errors, oppoſing the
Great Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, that I found among them. But however, to take
away all Shadow of Clamour againſt me, on the account of any hard or uncharitable
Cenſures I had formerly at any time paſſed on any of the ſeveral Profeſſions of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
whether Eſpiſcopal or Diſſenters of all ſorts, or on the account of the hard
and uncharitable Names I have at any time given to any of them, that were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
them. I have oft by Word of Mouth freely and openly acknowledged my
Raſhneſs in ſo doing, and in my Book of Retractations, ſhortly to be publiſhed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
and retract them All that I have ſaid or writ, or printed at any time againſt any,
that did not deſerve the ſame, though it were eaſie for me to prove, that they who now
thus accouſe me, have far exceeded me, in giving hard Names, and paſſing hard Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
upon the Miniſtry of all Proteſtant Profeſſions differing from them. But the
things is ſo evident, that it were to waſte Paper, to prove it, That they have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
called them Thieves, Robbers, Conjurers, Witches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But let them own and
declare, whether notwithſtanding theſe hard Cenſures and Names, they have given
generally to all Diſſenting from them, of all Profeſſions of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> do they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this ſevere Cenſure to all and every one of them? Are all and every one of
them Witches Conjurers Thieves, Robbers, the Peſt of the World, the Bane of
Soul and Body of the Univerſe, Idle Gormandizing Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the unlovely Epithets.
they have given Diſſenters from them, both <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> and <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> in general,
do they make no exception? Is all <hi>Britain</hi> become ſuch a <hi>Sodom,</hi> that there are
not ten Pious or Righteous Perſons to be found in it among all the Millions that
diſſent from them? If they will affirm it is ſo, their uncharitableneſs is deteſtable;
but if they will allow, that ſome Righteous and Pious Perſons are to be found
among them, then why do they quarrel with me, for allowing the ſame, and that
there are Learned Men among them, far beyond any ſtock of Learning any of the
Quakers lay claim to, I ſuppoſe they will not gain-ſay; what is then my Treſpaſs,
for allowing that there are ſuch in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and among the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi>
when they do the ſame?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95818:2"/>
And whereas they ſay, pag. 6. <hi>Hath he ever retracted this? If not, what encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have ye to become his Journey-Men, to work under him?</hi> To the former I ſay,
I have both by Word and Writ, and is deſigned by me to be in Print very ſhortly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
all the hard Cenſures and Names that I have at any time given to any, who
have not deſerved them, as is above-ſaid. But what a baſe Inſinuation is it in them,
that I would have any of the Pious and Learned of the ſeveral Proteſtant Profeſſions,
to become my Journey-men to work under me? Is there any thing like this in my
Expoſtulation with them? O ſhameleſs Men! Have ye no better Weapons to fight
againſt me, but ſuch Lying Inſinuations! Let my <hi>Exp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtulation</hi> be examined, and
nothing of that ſort will be found. Nay, I have not deſired any of their Aſſiſtance to
defend me (I am content they let me ſtand or fall to my own Maſter; for my Truſt is,
that God will uphold me) but my Expoſtulation was with them, and my Serious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
unto them, by their Pious and Learned Writings, to oppoſe and refute
thoſe Vile Errors, boldly avouched and publickly broached in the late Printed Books
of ſome Leading Men, among a Gang and ſort of Quakers.</p>
            <p>He ſaith, <hi>He ſhall digest the Matter he propoſeth to treat upon into ten Heads.</hi> But
what indigeſted matter he brings forth to his and their ſhame, whom he defends, I
think to take ſome notice. The firſt Head is my repreſenting the Quakers, as worſe
than Papiſts. On this Head he is guilty of groſs Untruth and Falſhood in two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
1. That I repreſent the Quakers as worſe than Papiſts. But the very
Words he cites cut of my Expoſtulation clear me, I charge not the Quakers indefinitely,
or univerſally, but a ſort and gang of them, if he be ſuch an Idiot to make no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
betwixt a part and the whole, how is he fit to print Books 2. That he makes
me repreſent them, I ſo charge, abſolutely worſe than Papiſts: Whenas I cautioned my
Words thus,—<q>Vile Errors not only as bad as any Popery, but much worſe than
the worſt of Popery in DIVERS RESPECTS..</q> Obſerve, in <hi>Divers Reſpects:</hi> I
ſaid not abſolutely, and in <hi>all reſpects,</hi> but in <hi>divers reſpects.</hi> And this I can very
eaſily prove. And as to his Inſulting Queries, to anſwer to ſome of them; which
Anſwer will comprehend an Anſwer to them all. <hi>Do we promote Errors,</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>worſe than worſhipping a piece of Bread as God?</hi> I ſay, that's a Tranſition from the
ſubject of the Controverſie betwixt them and me, to another foreign ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi>
Tranſubſtantiation; it ſeems this bold Novice has not leareed that Maxim, <hi>Verba
ſunt int<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lligenda ſecundum ſubjectam materam,</hi> i. e. Words are to be underſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſubject matter If I ſay, this is not one of theſe reſpects, wherein I have
charged them, this Junior Sophiſter is at a non-plus. But ſeeing I have clearly proved
that <hi>G. W.</hi> has Deſtroyed the true Object of the Chriſtian Faith and Worſhip, by denying
Chriſt to be either God or Man, as I have ſhewed in my <hi>Narrative,</hi> and, That it is
needful to our Salvation, to believe in Chriſt as he ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Theſe
mens Error may be juſtly thought equal to that of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in that very reſpect,
if not to exceed it. The adoring a falſe Chriſt within, is fully as great Idolatry, as the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> adoring a piece of Bread without. And it is a falſe Chriſt within, which
they adore, who ſet up a falſe Notion of Light within, and a falſe Lying Spirit that
hath led them to Vilifie and Reproach the Man Chriſt Jeſus without them, and boldly
to ſlight his precious Blood, and call Chriſt without, glorified in the Heavens, <hi>an
imagined God beyond the Stars,</hi> that is denyed by the Light within; therefore that
Light within, that denyeth Chriſt without, who is the true Chriſtians Saviour, and
who is both God and Man, is not the true Light, but a Lying Spirit of the Devil.
And let ſincere Chriſtians judge, whether is the greateſt Idolatry, to worſhip the
Devil within, or a piece of Bread without? I am ſorry they give me this occaſion
to detect them; but ſince they will needs give it, it is fit they be anſwered. And
the ſame or like Anſwer will ſuffice to his Queries, about worſhipping Images, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Saints and Angels, Merits and Purgatory: And as to Merits, I am ſure moſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
are more ſound than ſome of them; for whereas <hi>Papiſts</hi> generally profeſs highly to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95818:3"/>
value Chriſt's Merits, and own their firſt Juſtification to the Merit of Chriſt's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Righteouſneſs without them: <hi>William Penn</hi> hath called this Doctrine, <hi>A
Doctrine of Devils, and an Arm of the Sea of Corruption, deluging the whole World.</hi> In
vain are all his ſhufling Aggravations againſt me, upbraiding me with my being changed
in my Opinion, of what theſe Quakers were: I have owned it again, and again, that
I am changed in my Opinion of them; but how doth this prove me an Apoſtate, or
ill man? Are they all ill Men, that have the ſame Opinion of them as I now have?
And as I have formerly told them, they have changed their Opinion of me, as much
as I have of them, ſo that in that reſpect, they have no advantage againſt me. I
own it, they deceived me, they were the Deceivers and I was the Deceived; and which
was worſe, let the Intelligent judge. But now I bleſs God, I am undeceived in them,
I know them better: And what would they have more?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Head, hath nothing in it worth noticing, but their Unjuſt charging
me with Malice, both with reſpect to them, <hi>viz.</hi> that Gang of Quakers above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and with reſpect to ſuch whom I directed my <hi>Expoſtulation</hi> unto, their Application
of that place in <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 28. againſt me, is very Abuſive and Shameleſs. The <hi>Jews</hi>
cryed, <hi>Men of Iſrael, help.</hi> But againſt what? againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> and the worthy Name of
Chriſt which he bore Teſtimony to. Did I make any ſuch Cry, to help againſt that
worthy Name, or any true Profeſſors of it, by my Inviting them to oppoſe the
Vile Errors that are contrary to it? But how doth he prove that I am malicious to
the Pious and Learned in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or among the <hi>Diſſenters?</hi> They,
and not he, nor his Gang are a fit judge of this. Am I malicious either to the one or
the other, to tell them, I would not have the <hi>Bapiſts</hi> out-do them, in Zeal for the
Chriſtian Faith? Is it not an evident Argument of my love to them? His baſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation,
that I would ſtir up Perſecution againſt them, ſeeing I had ſo fairly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
againſt any ſuch Jealouſie, both in this <hi>Expostulation,</hi> and in my Printed <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,</hi>
I think not worth the leaſt regarding.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Head, ſo far as it contains a falſe Reflexion on me, I ſhall not notice,
but in ſo far as it tells a moſt impudent Untruth, with reſpect to the People called
Quakers, I cannot omit it; for whereas I have ſaid, That many of their chiefeſt
Teachers, have with great boldneſs provoked ſuch as differed from them, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Diſputes. This he denyeth to be true: But with what Face of Braſs could he
deny it? That is a thing ſo notoriouſly known, which thouſands both of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> and Diſſenters, can teſtifie. But the Colour he would put upon it is,
That what they did, was to clear themſelves, and to detect the Abuſes put on them.
As if they had been only on the defenſive part, in all the publick Oppoſitions they
made in Congregations, and elſewhere; whereas it is abundantly known, they were
the firſt Aggreſſors, and firſt of all began to charge all the Miniſtry in the Nation,
with being Falſe Teachers, Hirelings, holding falſe Doctrines; and though it were
to carry Water to the Sea to prove it, yet let but their own Books in Print, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>George Fox</hi>'s Journal, and <hi>Edward Bou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oughs</hi> collected Treatiſes, bear witneſs to
any ſuch Novices among the Quakers that know it not. And was G. F's Primmer,
to the two Univerſities, which he himſelf could not read, and his <hi>Battle door,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Words of many Languages, of which he knew not one Letter, only to clear
the People called Quakers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Head contains nothing but repeated Recriminations and Reflections againſt
me, already Anſwered; except that in the latter part of it, they propoſe it, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it would not be moſt equal and reaſonable for them, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch to whom I have
directed my <hi>Expoſtulation,</hi> to begin with me, by calling me forth to a publick hearing
upon my former Books. To this I Anſwer, that I am moſt willing they do, and what
I cannot juſtly and ſafely defend of any paſſages in my former Books, I will fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.
But whereas they upbraid me again, and again, with contradicting my
former Doctrines and Principles, as to Articles of Faith, I cannot find that they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95818:3"/>
have proved it againſt me in one particular. But that they to
whom I directed my <hi>Expoſtulation,</hi> ſhould begin with me, I ſuppoſe
they will not think ſo proper, becauſe whatever juſt Offence I have
given to any of them, my late Adverſaries of that Gang among
the <hi>Quakers</hi> have far exceeded me, and they have that which caſts
the Ballance as to them, that they juſtifie all they have ſaid, and
printed againſt them, to every tittle, to maintain their Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
which I have not done, but in divers things I confeſs my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes,
and wherein I have juſtly offended any, I humbly ask their
Forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> and <hi>Sixth</hi> Heads, having ſufficiently Anſwered them
both in my <hi>Narrative</hi> and <hi>Expoſtulation,</hi> I ſee not the leaſt cauſe to
ſay any thing unto, but leave them to the Readers impartial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
Only I take notice of the bold Untruth he chargeth me
with, of my propoſing the diſturbing of their Meetings; for I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
it expreſly, that what ſhould be done to refute their Vile
Errors, might be done at the end of their Meetings, or at other ſet
times; and this is more regular, than what divers of them have
done, to make Oppoſition in the Meetings of others, before their
Meetings were ended, as <hi>Jacob Talner</hi> lately did, in one of our
Meetings, who is one of their Preachers: And ſeeing they juſtifie
what ſome of them did, by way of publick Oppoſition, to clear
themſelves, and to detect the Abuſes put on them, and that they
allow this to be equal and reaſonable, and no treſpaſs againſt the
Civil Peace; and that many, or rather indeed all of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
do judge that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have miſrepreſented them, and
put Abuſes on them, why ſhould they not think it fair, that theſe
of other Profeſſions, who think themſelves injured by them in
point of Doctrine, ſhould have freedom in publick, to their Faces,
to clear themſelves. And why ſhould not I alſo by the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have full Liberty to clear my Innocency, and detect the Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
they have put upon me, and that Face to Face, without any
breach of the Civil Peace? Was the taking away the Preachers
Hour-glaſs with <hi>G. F.</hi> juſtified, but a clearing themſelves? And
<hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> coming into a publick Aſſembly, here in <hi>London,</hi> all
beſmeared with Mans Excrements, and one that got on the Pulpit,
and began to ſow and ſtitch with a Needle?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> Head, is nothing but an unjuſt Inſinuation, That
I would excite the Civil Authority againſt them, and that I would
fain inſtruct the Civil Authority, what their Duty is in this Caſe. But
they bringing no Proofs of their Charge againſt me, it were a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
labour in me to Anſwer them on this Head. I am very
hopeful that as formerly I have had the Countenance of ſome in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95818:4"/>
Civil Authority, in my publick Oppoſition to their Vile Errors, ſo
I may have the like for the future. Their Inſinuation, <hi>That ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of any in the Civil Authority, would be a breach of an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Act of Parliament,</hi> is ſo ſilly and ignorant, that it deſerves not
the leaſt Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eighth</hi> Head is a bare-faced Calumny, <hi>My high Opinion of
my ſelf in ſetting up for Director, both of Church and State, in Methods
to be uſed for the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion.</hi> Doth any
honeſt Man, that propoſeth his humble Opinion, what may be
good for both the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and State of the Kingdom,
deſerve ſuch an unworthy Character? Is not the like commonly
practiſed from time to time, without the leaſt offence? Had not divers
of the Teachers among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> particularly <hi>G. F.</hi> the Younger,
given far greater occaſion to be judged, having a high Opinion of
himſelf, in what he printed of Adviſe to the King himſelf, viz.
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and what others have Printed of the like Nature,
and what <hi>G. F.</hi> the Elder, and <hi>E. B.</hi> have printed to Parliaments?</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Ninth</hi> Head, whereas they charge me, with being either
groſly inſincere, or elſe very ignorant of the Law in ſuch Caſes,
which deeply affects both Perſons and Eſtates, by Impriſonments,
Fines, and Pillory, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe I ſaid, <q>If Order were given by
them, bearing Authority in this Nation, that all ſuch Books of
them, as contain Vile and Abominable Errors were ſuppreſſed, they
<hi>viz.</hi> my Oppoſers among the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhould have no Cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</q>
To this I Anſwer, 1. Were not by the ſame Argument
they inſincere or ignorant, who have charged not only ſome of their
Brethren, but differing from them in Punctilio's of their Church-Government
and Women's Meetings, as in particular <hi>Chriſtopher
Taylor</hi> his charging <hi>William Rogers</hi> with high Blaſphemy, in a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Book of his, but alſo in charging with Hereſie and Blaſphemy,
many of the Miniſtry in the Nation, reputed Orthodox by Civil
Authority? But, <hi>2dly,</hi> muſt not their Vile Errors and Hereſies be
oppoſed, and the Authors of them witneſſed againſt, and warning
given againſt them, otherwiſe all that do ſo, muſt they be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Perſecutors and Malicious. O ye partial Judges, why judge ye
ſo partially and inſincerely that in another, wherein ye are ſo guilty
your ſelves? If that were any Guiltineſs, to call Error and Hereſie
by their true Names.</p>
            <p>In their <hi>Tenth,</hi> and laſt Head, they labour to ſtate the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
their Books, and my Books, from <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> as far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and that my Books were juſtly ſuppreſſed by them, here at
<hi>London,</hi> they think it was but common Prudence, to hide the Bone
of Contention, leſt my quarrelſom Books, as they are pleaſed to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95818:4"/>
call them, ſhould infect ſome with the ſame Spirit of Diſcord.
But they plead hard, that their Books ſhould not be ſuppreſt. To
this I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1. Had it not been more honeſty in them, as well
as Chriſtian Prudence, to have diſowned theſe groſs Errors, which
I evidently proved againſt them in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> out of their own
Letters and Manuſcripts, as well as by other Proofs, than to have
hid and cloaked them, and Excommunicated me, for my faithful
oppoſing them. 2. But where is the far different caſe? why they
ſhould ſuppreſs my Books, and the Civil Authority ſhould not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
theirs? Why? my Books would have been a Bone of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
to infect ſome with the ſame Spirit of Diſcord. But muſt
not the Truth be contended for? Are we not commanded to <hi>Contend
earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints?</hi> and ſuch was the
contention of my Books, and of my Spirit. The caſe indeed, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
is very different, but to their great diſadvantage, and to my
great advantage. They did well, they think, to ſuppreſs my Books,
leſt ſome Diſcredit or Reproach ſhould fall on them, if it ſhould
be known, that any of them did hold ſuch Principles, which all
true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> abhor, being contrary to the Eſſentials of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
But their Books muſt have free and full Scope to paſs current through
the Nations, that have been a far greater Bone of Contention, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not only to bring Infamy upon all other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Profeſſions
and Profeſſors, but Reproach and Contempt upon the Perſon and
Doctrine of our bleſſed Saviour, and his holy Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
as not only I, but others have made clearly to appear, and
may be yet made more to appear in due time.</p>
            <p>His idle Story, about the <hi>Revolutions,</hi> which they have ſo nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouſly
repeated, and which I have oft fully Anſwered; to anſwer
it any more, would be a needleſs Repetition, therefore I let it paſs
with his other Impertinencies and Calumnies, not worth the noticing.
But were I inclined to retort his idle Story of <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> againſt me,
on the Hypotheſis of the Revolution, (or Tranſmigration) I might
ſay theſe my late Adverſaries, who place all upon the Inward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
excluding the Man Chriſt Jeſus from being our Saviour,
are the old <hi>Stoicks, Epicureans, Pelagian Brittains redivive,</hi> and other
Ethnick Philoſophers, who bitterly oppoſed the Chriſtian Faith.
But though they have not their Souls, I am ſure they have their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh,
Antichriſtian Principles.</p>
