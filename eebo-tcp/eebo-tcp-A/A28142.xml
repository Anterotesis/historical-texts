            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That this is not then <hi>(Honorable Heroes)</hi> the disburdening of a particular fancie, or the humorous complaint of one ſo addicted to the made of Melancholy, as to render him distracted, teſtie, or troubleſome, but the common grievance (and I do but now make their ſuſpirations articulate) of all thoſe who have prepared their mindes and ſtudies, and took their flight above the lowe pitch of Vulgarity, to advance Truth in others, and from others to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, thus much may evince and ſatisfie.

And when we make reflection back of what great things you have done for us, equal to what hath been done in any Nation, either ſtoutly or fortunately, and what ſteps you have made forward in this great deſigne, we are led to believe a gallant progreſs you will make, and bring us back from that great diſtance we have run in a line from the firſt point of errour, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt its largeſt latitude and diſſomination from the Aequator of Truth, into the true Cauſ-way, and unto our journies end.

Give me leave to tell you, and I will henceforth labour to obtain to have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, That the Art which in the ſimplicity of Nature God has revealed, is true and natural, truely Phyſical, Nature's <hi>Auter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> not a whit belowe her ſelf, though they ſeem never ſo mean, by the which we may attain to all the ſecrets and myſteries in Nature. And this is the Art, the centre of the Phyſicks of the ancient Philoſophers; becauſe Natural Philoſophy is the <hi>Baſis</hi> or main Fundamental of Medicine: for where Philoſophy ends, there Medicine is to be enterpriſed, whence it's clear, that ſuch as is the inſight of a Phyſitian into natural things, (namely, whether it be ſuperficial, or profound) ſuch alſo will his perfection be in Medicine. For He who is ignorant of the myſtical <hi>Arcana's</hi> of Phyſicks, of neceſſity it will follow, that the more occult ſecrets of Medicine ſhall be hid from his eyes. This is not in the ſpurious productions, and <hi>Coloſſian</hi> Library of <hi>Galen,</hi> that God ſhould turn it over to him and the Apothecaries. <hi>Inſecta ex putredine Galeni.</hi> It's a baſe unworthy, and terrible thing truely, to prefer <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to <hi>Emepht,</hi> and condemn the Truth of God, to juſtifie the Opinions and Traditions of Man. This is an <hi>Humour</hi> that runs not in their <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and they are wholly unacquainted with any of its Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Their Writings are ſo ſuperficial, and ſo remote and alien from the Centre, and true Marrow of this Science, that the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and ſecrets of Phyſicks being omitted, or by ignorance neglected, we catch at onely painted Butter-flyes, and ſpeculate not the <hi>Magneſia</hi> or ſubſtantiality of Phyſicks, but rather its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrage; not the Body, but the Bark, and ſuperficial outſide. 'Tis not rare, but very frequent with them, (and ſurely they are taught from their own experimental unſucceſsfulneſs) to admire, and mouth out the ſuppoſed perfection of their Art; and yet they have nothing in their mouthes but <hi>Ars longa, Vita brevis;</hi> and true enough: for they cure either late, or never, which makes their Art long: but they kill quickly, which makes life ſhort; and ſo plowing with their heifer, the Riddle is expounded. A Sect there are of people in this Nation, who make a great famous buz of the Spirit, but it is but like ſome <hi>Dor;</hi> who ſay, they ſee

God in all and every thing. I wiſh it were true; but let me deal plainly, An evil ſpirit is gone out, to ſeduce them to lye unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to the Truth of God. For thoſe things they ſee, hear, taſte, and handle, they know not what they are, neither without nor within themſelves. He is too inward in the private Cells and Receſſes of his Creatures for their ſhallow and unhallowed eyes to penetrate; and none of them all can ſee him without fire, not the Chymiſts Kitchin-fire, but the true Philoſophical fire,
<q>

And if yonder Sun ride ſure, ſo ſhall he know all things that Art and Nature can tutor him in. The God of all grace and good gifts grant then, that we may ſeriouſly compoſe our ſelves to apply to the declarations of Himſelf in his works of the Creation, and lead me by the hand to receive Truth from himſelf, and give it out to others.

For ſo long as they are tutor'd in thoſe untrue Notions, and corrupt Elements, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, Opinions, and Principles of Naturalities, and that of Pagans and Infidels too, till the body of Phyſick be changed and reformed, there's little hopes that a better Sanation of Diſeaſes, or a Melioration of the languid condition of men and women will follow, then what has been hitherto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what that has been, let the clamours of the Sick, and ſtanders by, the cries of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Orphans, and the ocular unſucceſsfulneſs of Phyſitians in their own practice, decide, whether the things that I now move for, chiefly as to this, and the promiſes within conſidered, do not groan for a Reformation; therefore deſerve not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, if the moſt urgent and exceſſive grievances, happening in the Medicinal Profeſſion, be worth the laying to heart, which, unleſs Charity be far from us, cannot be neglected.</p>

And that it may be allow'd and granted for the glory of this Nation, and the good of the people thereof, that the whole Syſteme of <hi>Practical,</hi> as well as <hi>Theorical</hi> Phyſick, may be calculated by the <hi>Aſtrolabe</hi> of clear Reaſon and Experience, to ſee if the Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof cannot ſquare to a greater meaſure and perfection, beyond the Lines of <hi>Galens</hi> degrees and complexions, or the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks</hi> Elements, or the conſtituted diſcipline of <hi>Coe:</hi> or whether the <hi>Cruſe</hi> of the knowledge and power of Healing, can run no other Oil then what is ſublim'd and drawn off by an Alembick of a Colledge-Diſpenſatory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I would obtain to have it appear, that the daily inſight of Phyſitians into the unſucceſsfulneſs of their own practice from that

veſſel of Phyſick, which was not long ago broach'd, and exhibited from their new and late poliſh't <hi>Pharmacopoeia,</hi> do not deſerve to be thought worth our patience to expect, and ſtudy and labour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a richer liquor of knowledge, of more refin'd ſpirits then what the <hi>Sympoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That the moſt excellent and natural Art of Chymiſtry, ſcarce yet beyond ſeeming uncouth, and unheard of, as being the <hi>Terra incognita</hi> in the old world of Phyſick, may be called from her <hi>Oſtraciſm,</hi> and may with eye open and allow'd be call'd to the bar, to the touch, and her readings reviv'd, and operations gratifi'd with your countenance; for they whom this thing concerns, will not receive theſe things from a private inſtruction, whereby it eaſily appears that it is not reaſon now adayes that ſatisfies and ſuborns the common credence of men. Perhaps in time to come, others that reſpect a publike good, and have not their underſtandings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd and made inſenſible by the itch of gain, will know how to eſteem what is not every day put into their hands, when they have markt events, and better weigh'd how hurtful and unwiſe it is to hide a pernicious rupture under the ill counſel of a baſhful ſilence. If no body will after me thus ſecond their own occaſions, they may ſit hereafter and bemoan themſelves, to have neglected through faintneſs the onely remedy of their heavy ſufferings. What have I left to ſay, but your own goodneſs to eſſay, and to attend when you ſhall be invited from thoſe poor reflections to take the advice of more noble thoughts and vaſt conſiderations? It remains, that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my ſelf to wait for the accompliſhing of theſe things wrought into me by your own deſignations and conſequencies from your lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable endeavours, by making good wiſhes, and breathing after theſe huge attempts, the purſuance whereof ſhall embalm your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories to all poſterity.

that there are ſome</hi> Flowers <hi>that have reſpect to the</hi> ſunne, <hi>in two kinds; The one by opening and ſhutting; and the other by bowing and inclining the</hi> head. <hi>For</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-golds, Tulippa's, Pimpernell, <hi>and indeed most</hi> Flowers, <hi>do open or ſpread their leaves abroad, when the</hi> ſunne <hi>ſhineth ſerene and fair. And again (in ſome part) cloſe them, or gather them inward, either towards night, or when the ſkie is overcaſt. Of this there needeth no ſuch ſolemne Reaſon to be aſſign'd; as to ſay, that they rejoice at the preſence of the</hi> ſunne; <hi>and mourn at the abſence thereof: For it may be nothing elſe, but a little loading of the leaves, and ſwelling of them at the bottome, with the moiſture of the aire; whereas the dry aire doth extend them: And they make it a peice of the wonder, that</hi> Garden-claver <hi>will hide the</hi> ſtalk <hi>when the</hi> ſunne <hi>ſheweth bright; which is nothing but a full expanſion of the leaves. For the</hi> bowing <hi>and</hi> inclining <hi>the</hi> head <hi>it is found in the great</hi> flower <hi>of the</hi> ſunne, <hi>in</hi> Mary-golds, Wart-wort, Mallow-flowers, <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

but it is their domeſtick and innate vertue. Theſe things happen in <hi>plants</hi> vegetably <hi>animate.</hi> The leſſe wonder. But that they have place in <hi>minerals</hi> alſo, I thus prove. There is almoſt nothing made in Nature, without his proper motion: and there is nothing moved of its own accord, or by himſelf, but by reaſon of the propriety put into it by the Creator, which the Ancients call <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> and will have <hi>philautie</hi> to be nature, firſt-born, innate and given for the cuſtody of its ſelf. And where this is preſent, its neceſſary alſo there be <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy,</hi> in reſpect of the diverſity of objects. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="73"/> To this I will bring a pregnant example.

We would have all <hi>ſects</hi> confine themſelves to a mediocrity in opinioning, and not ramble over the whole <hi>wild</hi> of Fancy: For a very little patience, e're you hear, that the <hi>Earth</hi> hath of her ſelf a <hi>ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> vertue of producing <hi>herbs,</hi> which ſhe therefore beggeth not from heaven. For the whole <hi>propriety</hi> of <hi>herbs</hi> is from the <hi>ſeed,</hi> and the ſeminative power is taken from the <hi>Earth,</hi> according to <hi>holy writ,</hi> and not from the faces of the Lights of <hi>Heaven.</hi> For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſixteen or twenty <hi>ſtarres</hi> make a <hi>Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or one of the twelve <hi>Houſes,</hi> and is extended

            </p>
            <p>For our own part we chiefly admire in <hi>ſimples</hi> a ſincere compoſition which is made according to the compoſure of <hi>God.</hi> In <hi>Comfrey</hi> we finde a <hi>full remedy</hi>

But as oft as the things have not by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what is intended, then we admit additions, if the things acquire that by being coupled together, which they have not apart: Which thing is to be confirm'd by an <hi>experiment.</hi> And indeed we have a moſt pregnant inſtance hereof in <hi>Inke</hi> and <hi>Tinctures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oftentimes under the penance of ſtudies we have conſider'd that ſince there was in <hi>Nature</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proportion of <hi>matter</hi> to <hi>matter,</hi> and <hi>form</hi> to <hi>form,</hi> that there was the ſame obſerv'd in <hi>properties</hi> to <hi>properties,</hi> and conſequently in <hi>effects</hi> to <hi>effects.</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61316:44"/>
But the compoſition of <hi>ſimples</hi> did by and by teach our underſtandings, the defect of theſe; where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations preſently enter upon the mixture of ſeed, and for the moſt part deſtroy one another; no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the ſeeds of many things pounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and blended, elude the expectation of encreaſe. Afterwards we knew by much <hi>ſweat</hi> and <hi>oil,</hi> that the <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>remedies,</hi> exalted to a higher dignity by meer preparation, aſcend to the top of <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, liberty, ſubtilty,</hi> and <hi>purity</hi>; and would far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the <hi>decoctions, ſyrups,</hi> and <hi>honyed</hi> pouders of the Shops.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="95"/> if they acknowledge diſeaſes to ariſe from a <hi>humour</hi> that is <hi>ſharp, bitter, ſalt,</hi> or <hi>acid,</hi> they yet palliate, and ſeaſon all their remedies with <hi>honey,</hi> or <hi>ſugar</hi>; thereby abating the properties of them, though of themſelves they be feeble enough; as if the only <hi>cure</hi> and <hi>top</hi> of all diſeaſes conſiſted in that which is ſweet.

            <p>To the ſecond we ſay, that the anſwer is frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as long as the firſt is not ſatisfied.

            <p>That to many, the taſt of <hi>Aloes</hi> is more pleaſant then the drinking of <hi>honey.</hi> Finally, though they deſire to ſooth the <hi>tongue,</hi> yet they cannot ſooth the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> which turns at the very ſight of medicines cover'd with the <hi>Leger-demain</hi> of ſugar: of the ſame ſize of foppery is that <hi>bauble</hi> for <hi>babies, gilded pills.</hi> Notorious it is, that a thing of <hi>

For <hi>ſugar</hi> is <hi>diametrically</hi> oppoſite, is the <hi>antartick</hi> pole, and at enmity with the <hi>acid</hi> ferment of the <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> and therefore makes the digeſtions more difficult.

            <p>To the third, we ſay, that the Schools do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="97"/> confeſſe their ignorance, that they know not how to preſerve <hi>medicaments</hi> from <hi>corruption,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>ſaucing,</hi> and <hi>caſtration</hi> of their vigour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>fraud</hi> of beaſtly <hi>ſyrups, Loches, Eclegm's,</hi> and other the Tribe of <hi>daubing medicines,</hi> hath been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently detected; which are made only of <hi>ſimples</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, with the additament of <hi>honey</hi> or <hi>ſugar:</hi> and it makes for this, that <hi>vegetables</hi> being boil'd in <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and frighted out of their wits, only lay down their juice and mucilage; which being <hi>crude</hi> and <hi>impure,</hi> cauſe trouble to the ſtomach, untill being digeſted with <hi>honey,</hi> they make us heirs of their vertue; eſpecially in that the <hi>gummoſity</hi> of herbs, which are fryed with <hi>honey</hi> and <hi>ſugar,</hi> is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and diſpleaſing to the ſtomach, and in boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is made a great waſt of the vertues. I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="98"/> praiſe God who hath been ſo bountifull to me, as to call me to the practiſe of <hi>Chymistry,</hi> out of the dregs of other Profeſſions: Since <hi>Chymistry</hi> hath <hi>principles</hi> not drawn from fallacious reaſonings, but ſuch as are known by nature, &amp; conſpicuous by fire; and ſhe prepareth the <hi>Intellect</hi> to penetrate, not the upper deck or <hi>ſurface</hi> of things, but the deep hold, the <hi>concentrick</hi> and <hi>hidden</hi> things of nature; and maketh an inveſtigation into the <hi>America</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, farther then the whole <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> yea, then the whole Common-Wealth of ſciences, all put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and peirceth unto the utmoſt confines and profundities of reall truth.

For beſides the <hi>manifeſt</hi> entity and creation of things, there is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomical lecture of the <hi>various</hi> creations and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of them, to be read of us, and underſtood by us: Beſides the <hi>generall</hi> and <hi>manifeſt creation</hi> of things, the <hi>particular form</hi> of <hi>things,</hi> not the <hi>Peripateticks forms,</hi> is to be examin'd, and much to be read and learn'd from the variouſneſſe, and that, not only of the generall form, but every ſingle and particular form of the <hi>Individuall.</hi> And we muſt note, that the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naglyphe</hi> or exteriour <hi>Cortex</hi> and figure of things is the <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of an eſſentiall, true, reall, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull ſpirit; beyond all the <hi>artificiall, ſuperficiall, pyramidall Hieroglyphicks</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptians:</hi> For in thoſe dead leaves, is written in <hi>folio,</hi> in large <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,</hi> a living power or ſpirit of life; for beſides its own ſpirit, it hath another, which is the wheell or <hi>primum mobile</hi> of it.

and to be ſenſibly perceiv'd by the eye of the <hi>Intellect.</hi> For the <hi>Sunne</hi> of every <hi>ens,</hi> concentred in its own <hi>firmament,</hi> doth not ſo diradiate its beams of vertue, and ſtrength, to its <hi>Earth,</hi> the exterior <hi>Cortex,</hi> as to have her <hi>vestall virgin</hi> beauty proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and ly open to the <hi>foul rape</hi> of an impure <hi>Tact,</hi> and embracement; or contaminated by the cloudy emiſſions, of our <hi>baſilisk</hi> corporall eyes; but is to be gently handled, and drawn forth by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick <hi>Pyrotechny.</hi> For the moſt High is to be prais'd for his tranſcendent glory, who hath given this <hi>art</hi> to little ones <hi>gratis.</hi>

There is no man that is ſtudious of Truth who doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this thing preſently, that the <hi>Baſis</hi> of healing of the Antients is overthrown, as well in reſpect of the <hi>humours,</hi> as of the <hi>ſelection</hi> of <hi>ſolutive</hi> medicines. To me ſeriouſly it's a wonder not much on this ſide an aſtoniſhment, that the world hath not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd the <hi>perniciouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>laxatives,</hi> who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe can ſo quickly ſent and perceive any <hi>vile</hi> arts bordering upon their own <hi>purſe</hi> or <hi>profit.</hi> It's out of doubt truly, but that <hi>laxatives</hi> may carry an <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult</hi> poiſon, which hath made ſo many thouſands of poor <hi>widowes</hi> and <hi>orphans.</hi> Nor do they bring forth a ſingular <hi>humour</hi> after them, which things never were in Nature, unleſſe in the books of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="116"/> Well, go to yet, I pray you, why doth that your choler following with ſuch a ſwift flux, ſtink ſo abominably, which but one quarter of an hour before, did not ſtink at all? For the <hi>celerity</hi> of the flux, takes away the occaſion of <hi>putrefaction,</hi> and ſo alſo of <hi>ſtink.</hi> For 'tis a <hi>Cadaver</hi> or dead body that ſtinks, &amp; not the <hi>turd</hi>: Neither could it ſo ſuddenly borrow, or be impregnated with ſuch a ſavour of a ſtrong ſtinking turd from the gutts. Therefore <hi>ſtink</hi> ſmells of <hi>poiſon,</hi> and <hi>indicates</hi> an efficient <hi>poiſon,</hi> and <hi>cadavorous</hi> matter taken from the living: which I doe thus experimentally prove. If any one have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61316:54"/>
drunk a dram of <hi>white vitriol,</hi> diſſolv'd in wine,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="117"/> by and by it provokes <hi>vomit.</hi> But if preſently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the drinking of it, he takes down a draught of <hi>beer, water,</hi> &amp;c. he ſhall truly have moſt ſtools, and yet verily without ſtink. <hi>Scammony</hi> therefore and <hi>vitriol</hi> do equally liquate the <hi>meſaraick</hi> bloud: This truly, with the violent ponticity of it ſelf; but that, with the putrefactive and ſtinking ſtrong poiſon of the <hi>laxatives.</hi> For which conſideration alone, a <hi>purgation,</hi> ought to be ſuſpected as a cruel and ſtupid invention. For if according to <hi>Galen,</hi> while the <hi>bloud</hi> begins to putrefie there is made <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="118"/> then that ſame ſtinking, and yellow melted matter driven out by laxatives, and <hi>counterfeiting</hi> choler, is generated of <hi>putrefied bloud:</hi> And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the laxatives themſelves are reſolvers and putreiyers of the bloud: which is eaſily gather'd out of <hi>Galen,</hi> againſt the ſchools wills. For he chiefly commends <hi>Triacle,</hi> foraſmuch as it power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſiſts poiſons: alſo he aſſerts it, to be the moſt knowing ſigne of the beſt <hi>Triacle,</hi> that if <hi>Triacle</hi> be taken, together with <hi>laxatives,</hi> undoubtedly there will not follow any ſeiges. Do not theſe words of <hi>Galen</hi> convince, that <hi>laxatives</hi> are meer poiſons? To which ſuſpition, the <hi>effects</hi> alſo do agree. For a <hi>purging</hi> medicine being taken, both the <hi>ſick</hi> man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="119"/> and the <hi>ſound</hi> do equally caſt out reſolved matter, of the ſame <hi>colour, ſmell</hi> and <hi>condition:</hi> wherefore it doth not expell the <hi>peccant</hi> humour, before the <hi>non-peccant,</hi> but doth indifferently <hi>contaminate</hi> whatſoever it comes to. Moreover the ſchools do impugn this ſelective liberty which they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to laxatives. For if any humour of the four <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="120"/>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:61316:55"/>
be putrid in feavers, it doth naturally betoken the ablation of it: But <hi>Laxatives</hi> may ſelectively draw out the <hi>humour</hi> out of the <hi>bloud</hi>; yea, in ſound folks, as they liſt they liquefie the ſound fleſh; that thence they may obtain their ſcope, which is to pour down the ſtinking <hi>rotten</hi> reſolv'd <hi>matter,</hi> into the <hi>common-ſhoar</hi> of the <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> of which the <hi>womb</hi> makes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectment. Verily <hi>laxatives</hi> will not have the like liberty in feavers, to the drawing forth of the <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi> and putrid excrement. For the <hi>putrid</hi> hath no more its priſtine eſſence and properties, which it had before its <hi>putrefaction.</hi> For although the <hi>load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi> may draw <hi>iron</hi>; it will not therefore draw <hi>ruſt.</hi> Therefore though a <hi>purging</hi> medicine may reſolve the <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> that thence it may draw forth <hi>choler,</hi> which by a ſpecifick propriety, being o'recome, doth draw unto it ſelf: it doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in like ſort draw the putrid and putrefied mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter included in the <hi>veins,</hi> which would be the cauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="121"/> of <hi>feavers.</hi> There is no man truly ſhould ever dy by feavers, if thoſe two <hi>axioms</hi> of the ſchools were true: To wit, if putrid <hi>humours</hi> be the cauſe of <hi>fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>; and alſo, if they yield <hi>ſelectively</hi> to purges: It would over and beſide be mad <hi>caution,</hi> that <hi>purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> medicines ſhould not be given in the beginning of <hi>feavers,</hi> before the matter grew turgid; that is to ſay, before a maturity and concoction of the <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi> matter, whence is ſufficiently manifeſt, that the black and diſmall uſe of <hi>laxatives</hi> are hardly on this ſide the banks of <hi>phlegetontal</hi> and <hi>direfull</hi> evils. But if they ſhould be given after that the matter of the diſeaſe is rightly ſubdu'd, the aforeſaid <hi>caution</hi> contains an impoſture too, foraſmuch as the <hi>effect</hi>

procur'd of its own accord and by the benefit of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="122"/> nature, is attributed to the <hi>ſolvent</hi> medicine: from which alſo truly the good and honeſt Phyſitian ſhould more juſtly abſtain; becauſe elſe it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the <hi>criſis,</hi> and induce the danger of confuſion and <hi>recidivation</hi>: verily a true and perfect <hi>purge,</hi> which is to ſay, a <hi>cleanſer</hi> of the body, ought to work onely upon impure, unſound bodies.

Every laxative therefore is abſolutely <hi>noxious,</hi> and alſo <hi>fruſtraneous,</hi> we ſhould therefore be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before God, and uncharitable to man, if we did not perſwade to abſtain altogether from <hi>purges.</hi> For let but a virulent ſolutive be a little while detain'd in the <hi>stomack,</hi> and it doth putrefie, and contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate whatſoever was depoſited in the <hi>meſentery</hi> to better uſes: and drawes in place of the putrefi'd treaſury, the depurated bloud from the <hi>vena cava,</hi> and doth leiſurely contaminate it with a <hi>virulent</hi> contagion, and eliquate it with the ſtinking <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the cadaver.

Others gnaw us while they burn with their ſharpneſſe. But the greateſt part under a friendly and fair ſhew do beguile us, and hide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a deſtructive enemy. In a word, every thing is full of <hi>filth,</hi> and is horrid with impurities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of <hi>crudities, diſproportionableneſſe</hi> and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible pertinacy of <hi>perverſitie.</hi> For though man were brought into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> yet did the Creator know from eternity that the world ſhould be a dwelling for him; and as he gave the earth to the Children of men, ſo he created the ſame with all the contents thereof for man. At length taking a view of all things by <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> and ſeeing them more clearly, we repented of out raſtineſſe, and former fooliſh ignorance. For in both we adored in ſuppliant wiſe with admiration the immenſe

Clemency and wiſdome of the <hi>Architect.</hi> For he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="132"/> would not have poiſons be poiſons, or prejudiciall to us. For he made not death; nor any extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating medicine in the earth, but rather that by a little induſtry of ours they might be changed into great pledges of his love, for the uſe of mortalls, againſt the rage of future diſeaſes. For in them ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hid that help, which more kinde and familiar <hi>ſimples</hi> do otherwiſe deny. For the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick</hi> uſes of <hi>Phyſitians</hi> ſuch horrid poiſons are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For brutes ſcarce feed upon them, either that they <hi>intuitively</hi> know the poiſon, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is not diſcovered by the <hi>ſmell</hi> or <hi>taſt</hi>: or that ſome ſpirit governing bruits, doth keep thoſe poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for greater uſes, as being heires of the greateſt vertues. It is at leaſt ſufficient that the bruites leave to us the chiefeſt remedies, as it were by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the moſt High, who taketh more care of us then of beaſts. For <hi>crude Aſarum,</hi> with what <hi>anguiſh</hi> is it vomited up, being a preſent poiſon, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack doth ſufficiently teſtifie? as alſo how it is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated with boiling, and the poiſon changed into an opening diuretick, the remedie of ſlow feavers, which thing diſcovers the <hi>aroma</hi> that was hidden therein.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Aron</hi> boiled with vineger becometh milde, and is the cure of great <hi>Symptomes.</hi> Wherefore the Schools have ſet on foot <hi>Corrections</hi> and we could wiſh they were not ridiculous ones, and ſuch as <hi>gold</hi> and take away the force and vertue of <hi>ſimples:</hi> for they think that the laxative part flyeth away from <hi>Aſarum,</hi> by boyling, no otherwiſe then in length of time, everything putrefieth with its own mould.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61316:62"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="133"/> Yet at leaſt the root of <hi>Aſarum</hi> doth not alike grow milde being ſodden with wine, as if it be boiled in water; yet in alike degree of fire the laxative part thereof would in like manner expire. Others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think that the cruditie in <hi>Aſarum</hi> is the cauſe of <hi>Solution</hi>; but theſe neglect the <hi>herbs</hi> that are more crude then <hi>Aſarum,</hi> and conſider not that <hi>Helebore</hi> would not be brought to maturity by boiling, if vomiting aroſe from crudity. They boil <hi>Scammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> in ſowre things, that they may mitigate it, but ordinary Phyſitians know that <hi>Scammony</hi> is by this means gelded, ſo that if it be expoſed to the ſowre vapour of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> it will be wholly deprived of its vertue; ſo that ſo much ſourneſſe as it takes, ſo much of its own propertie is loſt.</p>
            <p>But we deſiring with a fatherly mind to correct the raging force of <hi>medicines,</hi> well underſtand that the antient powers of things ought to remain, and in their root to be turned inward, or under their ſimplicity, to be tranſmuted into other properties there privily lurking under the guard of the poiſon, or gotten anew by reaſon of the perfection added: by which meanes <hi>Coloquintida</hi> turneth inward its laxative and noxious qualitie, and there ariſeth from the bottome a reſolutive power, that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="134"/> cureth <hi>chronicall</hi> diſeaſes. For <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in the tincture of the <hi>Lily</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> did with praiſe attempt that; yet he concealed it, or was ignorant that the ſame cometh to paſſe in all the venomes of animalls and vegetables, by their <hi>circulated</hi> ſalt. For all their venome periſheth, if they return into their firſt entities. This high pitch, not the <hi>ſchools,</hi> but Gods <hi>choſen</hi> Phyſitians, whom the Almighty
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61316:62"/>
hath elected from their mothers <hi>womb,</hi> ſhall know in the age to come, and it ſhall make a difference between the ſheep and the goats, between them who enter into the <hi>medicall</hi> Temple by the door of the light of Nature, and the expert mechanick practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Philoſophy</hi>; and thoſe who climbe up by the window of their own pride, ſelf-conceit and the darkneſſe of <hi>Ethnick</hi> bookes. Wherefore the <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> that are of great powers are not to be <hi>castrated,</hi> nor to be mortified, but to be <hi>meliorated</hi> by <hi>art,</hi> for the extraction of the things that lie hid, or by the ſuſpenſion of the <hi>virulency,</hi> or ſubſtitution of one for another, by adding ſtrong ſpecificals.</p>
            <p>Thus much let this ſerve for them, to whom it hath not been given to taſt the power of the greater circulated ſalt. For ſome things laying down their wildneſſe, grow mild by the addition of other things, and become <hi>neuters,</hi> partaking of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on both ſides. Neither is it therefore lawfull to borrow ſuch kind of additions from the received <hi>Diſpenſatories</hi> of the ſhops, which doe not teach the <hi>melioration,</hi> or <hi>corrections,</hi> but the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of things, either altogether, or elſe afford but trifling <hi>Correctives.</hi> For example, the Marqueſſe <hi>Charles Spinelli</hi> Generall of the <hi>Tuſcans</hi>; when he had walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on foot about the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> and viewed all the walls, commanded the Phyſitians to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſaid unto them, that he had ſometimes been ſick of an <hi>Epilepſie,</hi> and was cured by <hi>Helmont,</hi> but afterwards was ever and anon troubled with a <hi>dizzineſſe</hi>: after that he paſſed over the ſea from <hi>Aquitane</hi> to <hi>Tuſcany</hi> the Colledge of Phyſitians, on the morning following preſcribe him a ſcruple of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61316:63"/>
white <hi>Helebore,</hi> and for a corrective adde as much <hi>Anniſeeds:</hi> Halfe an hour after he vomits, and in vain implores the help of his Phyſitian being abſent, accuſing his murtherers and ſaying: <hi>Helmonte mio, voi me lo diceſti gli medici tuccideranno</hi>: my Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, you told me the Phyſitians would kill me. He held his peace, and after two houres, his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack firſt ſuffering a convulſion, and then his whole body, he dieth in a ſwound. The Phyſitians ſeek excuſes, and the earth covered their fault. For thus the <hi>Confections</hi> of the Schools by their fooliſh corrective <hi>Diſpenſatories,</hi> take up many things to fill up the load. The <hi>Opiates</hi> have chiefly hot things ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them; but laxatives for the moſt part <hi>gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, mace, Anniſe</hi>; and whatſoever things eaſe gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, which follow from the laxatives. Oh with what licence doth ignorance rage uncontrolled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men! How little do they underſtand their <hi>Hippocrates: If thoſe things be taken away which ought,</hi> (that is, ſuch things as are hurtfull and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome) <hi>the patient mends, and eaſily beareth it.</hi> For ſince thoſe things that hurt within, do oft-times not weigh a dram, all the purgation that ends in health, muſt be an evacuation either imperceptible, or at leaſt very moderate, and with a reſtauration of the ſtrength. For theſe are the things which patients eaſily endure with content. Wherefore the <hi>corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives</hi> of medicines are unprofitable loads, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge of things deſcribed by the Schools, and ſo deſtructive to the <hi>medicines</hi> at leaſt, if not to the <hi>Patients.</hi> This part of Phyſick requires a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and exact ſecretary of Nature; becauſe therein, the ample riches of medicines, and the golden houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould-ſtuffe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61316:63"/>
of <hi>Glanra</hi> is found. The Schools had heretofore learn'd of our <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertues dwell in <hi>ſimples,</hi> that were guarded with deſtructive poiſons. This made way for the raſhneſſe of the Schools, who mingled the poiſons drawn out by expreſſion, and the corroſives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd with their antidotes: hoping that by the goodneſſe and quantity of the <hi>adjuncts,</hi> the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the poiſon would be overcome; as if it were agreeable to <hi>health,</hi> to have a peſtilent <hi>glove</hi> brought to gueſts into a chamber repleniſhed with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome aire. For we do not here accuſe the <hi>viper</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="134"/> 
               <hi>Triacle,</hi> without which it would but be as it were a cadaverous heape of <hi>ſimples.</hi> For the fleſh of <hi>vipers</hi> is in it ſelf unhurtfull and without poiſon, yea an <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt it. But the <hi>Troſhiſcks</hi> made thereof, by being boiled, leave all their vertue in the <hi>broth,</hi> which the raw fleſh did conſerve. Concerning <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenick</hi> in this place we complain, being <hi>Magiſterially,</hi> as they call it, put into <hi>Antidotes. For the Schools preſume for the raritie of their boldneſſe to deſerve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and to place the glory of ſtudies in the authority of poſſeſſion.</hi> Neither is it perpetual that the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertues attend about poiſons in the ſame ſubject, ſo that they are covered by the poiſons. For <hi>Arſenick, Orpiment</hi> &amp;c. though they be <hi>fix'd</hi> and <hi>dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corated,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="135"/> are yet never to be taken inwards, although others perſwade the contrary: they are onely good applyed outwards, and kill other poiſons of <hi>ulcers,</hi> and tame them if they themſelves be firſt tamed. Wherefore the <hi>corrections</hi> of medicines, are without the knowledge of <hi>properties, parts</hi> and <hi>Conſonancies.</hi> For what doth a <hi>ſpice</hi> weigh in reſpect of a <hi>poiſon</hi>?
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61316:64"/>
If the whole body being luſtie and full of life doth preſently fall down being ſmitten with the tooth of a viper? will <hi>Napelles</hi> grow milde with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of <hi>cloves?</hi> Will <hi>Coloquintida</hi> ceaſe to cauſe putrefaction with his torſions, if it be joined with <hi>Tragacant</hi>? Therefore <hi>corrections</hi> in Diſpenſatories are grievances, and dull <hi>additaments,</hi> which do not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="136"/> mitigate the virulencies, but waſt the powers of medicines. For as poiſons have a fermentall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of working, ſo care ſhould be taken that the ſtrength and quickneſs of medicines might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and they by the applications of Art be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected againſt the neceſſities of <hi>Chronicall</hi> and <hi>remote</hi> diſeaſes. This onely thing remained in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that we infringe and ſubdue the violence of the thing, with a fermental propagation. Wherefore as we in generall pitty the <hi>Compoſitions</hi> and <hi>Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the ſhops, ſo we yet more deteſt the <hi>precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, vitrifications,</hi> and <hi>preparations</hi> of <hi>Mercury, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, Tuty, Sulphur &amp;c.</hi> And alſo the <hi>adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Spirits</hi> from <hi>Aromaticks: hot ſeeds,</hi> of <hi>vitriol,</hi> of <hi>ſulphur &amp;c.</hi> For they are prepared for gain by our fugitive ſervants, and furniſh Apothecaries ſhops, rather in comtempt of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> then the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="137"/> defect of patients. In like manner we deplore the ſhamefull ſimplicity of thoſe, who with great hope preſcribe to patients thoſe painted <hi>butter-flyes</hi> of <hi>leafe-gold,</hi> and <hi>pounded Jewels</hi>; ſelling their <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> if not their <hi>fraud,</hi> at agreat rate. As if the ſtomack could thence expect the leaſt help. More ſuttle and therefore more to be condoled is the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of thoſe, who corrode <hi>gold, ſilver, Coral, pearles</hi> and the like with <hi>ſoure</hi> liquors, and thinke they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve

them, ſo that they will be eaſily admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the veins, truly communicating their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to us. For they are ignorant, alas! ignorant that <hi>ſoureneſſe</hi> is an enemy to the veins, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the forreign <hi>ſoureneſſe of the diſſolvents</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome and tranſmitted, ſuch <hi>metalls</hi> and <hi>stones</hi> are powder, as before. Which though it be brought into a moſt fine flower, yet cannot the ſame be ſubdued by the ſtomack, or impart its ſtrength to us. Which that it may be apparent to the ſight, poure ſalt of <hi>Tartar</hi> on the things diſſolved, in ſome pontick corroſive liquor, and preſently being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, it will fall to the bottome in form of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For if <hi>aqua fortis</hi> change not <hi>metalls</hi> in the ſubſtance, although thoſe things become <hi>tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> that were before <hi>opacous</hi>: nothing hinders but that <hi>ſilver</hi> may be thence again recovered.

For it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a ſubtile deceiver, that he might before his patients ſet a high rate on his potions.

may do no harm, yet to be ſure it doth no good, and is adminiſtred in vain. Fourthly, They who write of this <hi>ſtone,</hi> do not agree in the <hi>latitude, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> or <hi>doſe</hi> of it: For as in their <hi>petragraphicall</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>qualities</hi> of it, they make many a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age wide of the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and beyond the line of Truth; ſo in their deſcription of its dimenſions or <hi>quantity,</hi> they come ſhort of it; and at the Lands<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end fall foul, and ſplit upon the ſands of a ſmall and common <hi>doſe,</hi> of three or four grains. But <hi>Mathiolus</hi> preſcribes at leaſt ſeven grains. <hi>Garcius ab Horto</hi> unto thirty grains, and confeſſes that more may be taken without hurt. And we verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and from the premiſſes we before hinted do affirm, <hi>that one main reaſon why this stone is ſo little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, is becauſe it is taken in too ſmall a quantity.</hi> And it is recorded, that to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſour</hi> was given a <hi>dram</hi> weight at one time of this <hi>ſtone</hi> in pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is ſixty grains. <hi>Fumanellus</hi> alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends a dram of it to be given in the <hi>plague.</hi> And certainly if the ſtone be innoxious, a good quantity alſo will be innoxious. Thus therefore the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified vertue of this childiſh Rattle, like that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious trifle of the <hi>Counteſſe</hi> of <hi>Kents</hi> pouder, with thoſe ſeriovs fopperies of <hi>Pearls, Corrall</hi> and <hi>Crabs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones,</hi> either in pouder, or diſſolved in ſome <hi>acid</hi> liquor, crumbles away, and vaniſhes like a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dew, before the ſunne of Truth. Again, it's worth our noting that if wine or vineger be drunk in the ſame draught with the aforeſaid pouders, they do not diſſolve one ſixth part of the pouder, and leave not the reſt changed, but whole. The
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61316:68"/>
which will be manifeſt from this experiment. That if any one drinks the ſtone of <hi>crabs,</hi> not in pouder, but broken in little bits, and after excretion it be waſhed, you ſhall find the ſame <hi>weight</hi> of it as before, and truly nothing of it brought under ſubjection to the ſtomack, nor it to pertake any thing of thoſe <hi>ſtones</hi> by digeſtion. And here we adviſe the <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> to conſider how they are beaten with their <hi>own</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="144"/> weapon. For if the aforeſaid <hi>stones</hi> or <hi>pearles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken in pouder, do melt in us; they in vain attempt to diſſolve them in the <hi>acid ſalnie vitriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> qualities of <hi>wine, vineger</hi> or juice of <hi>Limons.</hi> For there is nothing of the indigeſtible <hi>diſſolved</hi> thing conveyed into us, but that it contains its own <hi>digestible</hi> part, as we before have ſaid of the lacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mucilage of <hi>animated</hi> ſtones. But if otherwiſe the <hi>diſſolved</hi> ſhould make progreſſe, and march in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Garriſon of the <hi>veins</hi> (which never happens) that he might offer and communicate his gifts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us (ſuppoſe it be <hi>pearls,</hi> or the aforeſaid <hi>ſtones</hi>)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="145"/> it would ſtir up a mutiny, and conſecution of more miſeries and anxieties from this <hi>ſoure</hi> enemy and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien,</hi> then helps or profit.

            <p>Yet ſeeing this ſink-ſcourer, the uſe of <hi>Clyſters</hi> is ſo generally and eaſily beleeved to be ſuch a ſafe and familiar practiſe, that he is accounted no better then an Aſſe that ſpeaks againſt it; I ſhall adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to leave them a hint, that Foolls are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellated to a capacity of <hi>medicinall</hi> principles, and that they ſtumble and erre in nothing more then in this their ſo much magnifying of <hi>Clyſters.</hi> Which common unworthy and ſhamefull help of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is to be abhorred as a cruel and beaſtly reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, taught us (as they ſay) from a Bird. Hence upon rationall deductions we conclude, <hi>That every Clyster is naturally an enemy to the Inteſtines.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it will eaſily appear, <hi>That all things are received for the manner and reſpect of the Recipient.</hi> Which we thus further explain. The tears of the <hi>eyes,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>ſaltiſh,</hi> yet are <hi>indolent,</hi> becauſe familiar and naturall to the <hi>eye.</hi> But <hi>ſimple</hi> water pains the

eye; and ſo doth any other thing elſe. The urine alſo, though ſalt, <hi>doth</hi> not <hi>mordicate</hi> or <hi>fret</hi> the <hi>bladder.</hi> But any <hi>decoction</hi> or <hi>liquor</hi> whatſoever conveyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by <hi>Cathaeter</hi> or other pipe, although very ſweet, doth yet grieve and pain the body. But if the <hi>piſſo</hi> hath drawn but the leaſt <hi>acidity</hi> from <hi>new-beer,</hi> or otherwiſe, by and by there followes a very great ſtrangury and guttation of urine. The ordure or turd therefore, ſeeing it is the naturall and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick <hi>content</hi> of the <hi>gutts,</hi> doth not prick or gnaw, nor is not felt, untill it comes to the fleſhy parts of the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> as executing the office of <hi>door-keeper,</hi> they do both feel and urge the protruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>excrement.</hi> Whence we conclude, <hi>That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Clyſter ſeeing it is an exotick gueſt and alien to the guts, it cannot chooſe but be troubleſome and ingratefull to them.</hi> Then, <hi>that a Clyster never aſcends to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="151"/> For if you caſt in eighteen ounces of <hi>decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> either the greateſt part is left in the <hi>pipe,</hi> or falls out in the <hi>delivery,</hi> and ſo it attains onely to the beginning of the <hi>Colon.</hi> And laſtly, if there be <hi>laxatives</hi> in the <hi>Clyſter</hi> (for ſo for the moſt part the ſick is deceived, fearing <hi>laxatives</hi>) as with the one hand even now we exploded the poiſon of <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,</hi> ſo by the ſame rule we throw down the uſe of a <hi>laxative</hi> Clyſter alſo. we confeſſe a <hi>Clyſter</hi> is leſſe hurtfull: foraſmuch as the mouth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is alwaies exerciſed in the moſt noble buſineſs of life, and the life is hurt with the laxative poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

For the liquors being injected, firſt of all, they mingle themſelves with the turd found in the ſame place; then they are poured into thoſe parts, to whom it's proper to change all things into <hi>turd</hi> or <hi>excrement</hi>; and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is clear by experience, that ſuch broths, if they be caſt forth again, two houres afterwards, they ſmel not only of a <hi>turd,</hi> but in a <hi>manner</hi> of cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verous matter.

            <p>Having now had a clear and uninterrupted <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> into the <hi>field</hi> of the <hi>vulgar medicines</hi> of the <hi>ſhops.</hi> We now deſcend and take the chair on the ſtage of <hi>Topicks,</hi> the ſcene of <hi>oiles</hi> and <hi>ſuets,</hi> which are but <hi>mutes,</hi> and of no value for <hi>ointments</hi> and <hi>plaisters, Dramatis perſonae,</hi> unleſſe perhaps to give <hi>conſiſtence</hi> (the <hi>Epitaſis</hi> of their action) to the medicine, and bring the <hi>heterogeneall parts</hi> into a <hi>chorus</hi> of mixture by their <hi>emplaſtick</hi> quality. For firſt a great part of men ſuffer not <hi>ointments</hi> applyed to the skin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they excite itchings and whelks with ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Next becauſe the <hi>oiles</hi> aforeſaid are for the moſt part made of herbs whoſe vertue lyeth hid in a <hi>mucilaginous</hi> and <hi>gummy</hi> juice, but that juice by boiling is drawn out into the <hi>porridge,</hi> or wrung out by the <hi>preſſe,</hi> which is not truly combined with the oiles, but at length being fix'd, groweth hard. But we collect the <hi>balſomes</hi> of flowers more rightly in <hi>honey.</hi> And we much more admit the ſimplicities of <hi>ſimple,</hi> then of <hi>compound</hi> oiles. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we chiefly explode the unmeet and abſurd compoſitions of <hi>unguents</hi> and <hi>plaisters</hi> ſold in ſhops; in that nothing is more fooliſh then that the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of <hi>vegetables</hi> under divers <hi>ſuets</hi> and <hi>fats</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly

Which if it be <hi>minerall,</hi> will not mingle with the <hi>fat,</hi> but is rather ſo drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, and impriſoned, that it is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and oneiy encreaſeth the weight. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be mingled with <hi>oiles, ointments,</hi> and <hi>plaiſters,</hi> which cannot in them be wholly <hi>homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="155"/> reſolved. It is alſo worthy of laughter that the moſt white <hi>ſugar</hi> is commended, not becauſe it is <hi>ſweeter</hi> and in its vigor more worthy; but becauſe it is <hi>dearer,</hi> and oftentimes hath been boiled with a <hi>lixivium</hi> of unſlaked lime. Where the very name of <hi>purity</hi> hath made the <hi>cheat.</hi> The contuſed flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of herbs &amp;c. being mingled with the whiteſt <hi>ſugar</hi> grow dull, which by meanes of ſweeter <hi>ſugar</hi> contract a ferment, and by heating, draw out the powers of the <hi>ſimple.</hi> But afterwards by the enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed digeſtion of the heat, the ferment is checked and they become more powerfull by far. But the diverſity of the ferment dependeth on the <hi>lixivium</hi> which one ſugar hath, and another wanteth. We are likewiſe wont outwardly to apply <hi>ointment</hi> with choiſe. For in ſuch maladies, whoſe cure proceedeth from the center outwards, as in <hi>wounds, contuſions, combuſtions,</hi> &amp;c. We adviſe that they be applyed warm; but where the inward malady requires outward help, as the <hi>dyſentery, Colick</hi> or <hi>nephritick Convulſions, ſchirrhus, &amp;c.</hi> ointments ſhould be cheriſhed from without, with a ſtone heat, or with hot ſand. And we have learned by viewing <hi>Chaffe</hi> in a kettle of warm water walking to and fro, as it were from the heat kindled under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath; and therefore that by a powerfull heat <hi>oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61316:73"/>
applyed, are quickned, and join their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with our bloud; We firſt gueſſed and after found by experience, that the maladie is by this meanes drawn out, and the violence of the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes</hi> ſtaid. And whatſoever Baths do in the whole, the ſame is done in part without prejudice of the whole, by ointments being heat and cheriſhed. For a fomenting tile, drives the ſmell of the plaiſter inwards, and draweth out thoſe things which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe do ſtick more cloſely. In like manner the ſpirit inforcing it ſelf is drawn together with the bloud, and is diſperſed with heat, another ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in its place, exhauſts the force of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and as it were boiling within, is reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe about the gathering of <hi>ſimples</hi> it is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="156"/> Certainly agreed upon. They conclude that <hi>roots</hi> are to be gathered about <hi>Autumne.</hi> But for the moſt part <hi>ſimples</hi> afford the more powerfull <hi>roots</hi> at <hi>ſpring.</hi> The <hi>Polypodium</hi> of the ſpring is chiefly <hi>green</hi> and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We conceive that each is to be gathered immediately before the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>maturity</hi>: for <hi>full</hi> maturity is the <hi>begining</hi> of declination. Wherefore let each <hi>fruit flower, root, leafe, barke, &amp;c.</hi> have its determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſpace of <hi>maturity</hi>: for even the <hi>juice</hi> in plants firſt floweth up, which in many afterwards dryeth up, or is conſumed and ſpent into leafes, ſo that the varietie of <hi>maturities</hi> begetteth variety of <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings.</hi> For thus ſome <hi>leafes,</hi> after the flowers are <hi>more vegetous</hi>; but others are more <hi>juycie</hi> before them. There are alſo others, which are ſtronger
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61316:74"/>
before the growth of the <hi>fruit</hi>; and there are others that perpetually perſiſt. Wherefore they more rightly determine, who gather <hi>ſimples</hi> according to the <hi>exigency</hi> of their ſcope and deſigne.</p>

The ſchools teach that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daveriety, and dull lethargy of medicines, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the <hi>Opium</hi> of a <hi>frigidal</hi> temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and that they are altogether <hi>idle, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe</hi> and <hi>dead,</hi> unleſſe firſt by our <hi>heat,</hi> as by a Cook; they are prepard and being excited are by it acua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: This they have concluded and ratified; in as much as medicines taken or apply'd, do not by and by explode their faculties in us, <hi>inſtar ignis:</hi> but they have need of a certain ſpace of time, whereby to produce their effects, by praevious diſpoſititions. Nevertheleſſe if a ſpace may be requir'd, that an alteration may be made, which is an effect of the medicine; that truly doth not a whit argue the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the medicine to be by our heat, otherwiſe then neceſſary, that the medicine might acquire the donation of his activity or liberty of working, which he hath obtain'd and was granted him from the creation whole and ſound, full and free. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the effects of medicines are not produced, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe firſt there be a diligent and ſkilful <hi>preparation</hi> and due <hi>application,</hi> and then with a more exquiſite <hi>appropriation</hi> they imprint their powers in us.

of one alone heat, ſhould be the fountain and primary cauſe to give life to ſo diverſe and manifold effects. Wherefore in good ſooth that matter may act in us, as touching this, ſhe hath no need of any other extrinſecal thing, <hi>extraſe</hi>: but as primarily; ſo alſo without delay, ſhe puts forth her powers by the importance of diſpoſitions, if it be duely apply'd. But becauſe the ſenſitive <hi>Anima</hi> (which the ſchools have baſely confounded with their <hi>Calor</hi>) doth apply the receiv'd powers, and then doth make a certain new and proper action to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="172"/> her ſelf, and truly vitall. Therefore the powers which the ſenſitive <hi>Anima</hi> hath received from the medicine, are onely occaſionall effective cauſes, and ſhe can if ſhe will paſſe them by, and neglect them, which is manifeſt in robuſt bodies, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt without trouble violent laxatives <hi>tanquam Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos.</hi> And in dying men; in whom there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of medicines, but not an appropriation; by reaſon of the neglect or defect of the ſenſitive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="173"/> Moreover if delay muſt intercede between the medicine that is apply'd and his effect; that doth not happen becauſe of the defect or exigence of the activity of things; but by reaſon of the neceſſity of the vitall, emergent and ſubſequent activity through an impreſſion made, by the medicine. For a virulent force is not wanting in the biting of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> although ſometimes it doth not ſhew its effect, by reaſon of ſome impediment: ſo many have ſo accuſtom'd themſelves to purges and laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that at length they work not a whit, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

            <p>Laſtly it's true and perpetual that all ſenſation, conſiſts rather in action and vitall judgement, then in a paſſion. Whether that ſenſation happens in the exteriour ſenſe; or in ſome paſſion of the mind: or in the natural and ſympathetick ſenſe of inanimate things. At leaſt it is clear, that medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines do not need the praegreſſion of our heat, that they may act ſimply: but a ſenſitive power, which is the principal actor, hath need of agents, and ſenſible objects, that ſhe may perceive, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving may act. Therefore the action of ſenſible things, doth occupy her ſelf on both ſides by the mean of an occaſional cauſe, in reſpect of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive <hi>Anima.</hi> For that cauſe neither do medicines work in a <hi>dead body,</hi> by reaſon of the defect of the principal and immediate agent, which is the <hi>life</hi> or <hi>ſoul.</hi> Whence alſo it is ſufficiently manifeſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="174"/> how prepoſterouſly hitherto the vertues of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are attributed to an agent, or principall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal efficient, and how neglected the principal agent hath ſtood as well in healing as effecting diſeaſes.

               <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> is unuſeful whereſoever it is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated not to be neceſſary: or where the <hi>indication,</hi> proper to it is wanting.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>phlebotomy</hi> in feavers is unuſeful.</p>
            <p>The major is proved: becauſe the end is the firſt director of cauſes, and diſpoſer of the meanes unto it ſelf. Therefore in what thing ſoever the end doth not point out a neceſſity of the meanes, they are in vain fitted and related to it, not being requiſite thereto; eſpecially where it is clear by reflection from the glaſſe of <hi>Contra-indication,</hi> That bloud is not drawn out of the rivulets, the <hi>veins,</hi> without the fall or loſſe to the whole ocean of ſtrength.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the table of directions for phlebotomy.</hi> And that it doth not run in a direct line to the ſanation of favers, but to the oblique angle of ſlackning the full blown ſails of abundance of bloud, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calming the puffs and guſts of too much plenitude, by the Trident of <hi>phlebotomy,</hi> the Midwife to deliver onely the ingravidate and bigge-bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed veins from the Tympany of a <hi>Plethora.</hi> But a <hi>Plethora</hi> hath no ſubſiſtance under the torrid Zone of <hi>Feavers</hi>: Therefore in the hot ſpur of <hi>Feavers</hi> the cooling card of <hi>phlebotomy</hi> is never turn'd up, and conſequently is not trump, is not requiſite, but dealt about as alwaies unuſeful.</p>
            <p>The concluſion indeed may ſeem to come out of the <hi>Eutopia</hi> of novelty and the <hi>Arabia</hi> of paradoxes, yet liveth in the <hi>Eden</hi> of ſober verity. Which ſhall therefore be further proved, <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſubſumption teaching, <hi>That there is more choler ſattered in every poroxyſmo of a feaver, then in two daies ſpace is generated.</hi> In the mean time the reſt of the members of our publick ſtate adjourn not, nor ſuperſede from receiving (according to the <hi>Iſonomy</hi> or <hi>pari-formall</hi> lawes of Re-publiques) nouriſtment of the accuſtomed bloud. That is, beſides the laviſh expences and exhauſtion of the common ſtock of aliment that is expended by this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61316:87"/>
new <hi>Tenant</hi> and Inne-houlder, the <hi>Feaver,</hi> who hath now taken <hi>livery</hi> and <hi>ſeiſen,</hi> they conſume their own patrimony, the fat of the ordinary bloud. Wherefore then from this advantage, it genuinely and neceſſarily followes, that if in a healthy perſon there be an allowance of eight ounces of bloud for a daily portion, that then ſo many alſo ſhould be tranſmuted into <hi>nutriment,</hi> or otherwiſe the man ſhould ſtraight protuberate into an exceſſive huge bulke, more deformedly corpulent then any Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua. Therefore if in a ſound perſon there is diminution made of eight ounces of bloud: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the greedy feaver will conſume no leſſe. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then there is little or no <hi>appetite</hi> of <hi>food, dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> or <hi>ſanguification,</hi> of unavoidable neceſſity, within two dayes, the full ſea of a <hi>plethora</hi> (if there was any in the new Moon or beginning of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) will ſhift its tides into a low ebbe, and in the wane of its fall and decreaſe, the falſe and dangerous ſhole or quick-ſands of indication for ſpringing a leak in the vein by <hi>phlebotomy,</hi> will appear as a <hi>mare mortuum,</hi> and accordingly vaniſh into the Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian Gulph of errors. But that there is no <hi>plethora</hi> in Feavers, they ſee; who ſuffer ulcers by an <hi>Iſ</hi>- or <hi>Cautery:</hi> which truly are preſently dryed up by the <hi>ſolstice</hi> of Feavers, nor make no effluxion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the accuſtomed manner of their purulent excretion. But it is chiefly and deſervedly to be noted, that the ſtrength cannot offend, and deſerves not to be blamed for its aboundance, no, not in <hi>Methuſalem:</hi> neither alſo doth good bloud become peccant by <hi>nimiety,</hi> becauſe the vital powers and bloud are <hi>Correlatives</hi>: ſeeing according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61316:88"/>
the <hi>ſoul</hi> or <hi>vital</hi> ſtrength, rides in the Chariot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="183"/> of the bloud. Therefore by conſequence a <hi>pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> can never be in good bloud.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſhew by and by, that bad and corrupt bloud doth never runne in the <hi>Canall</hi> of the veins.</p>
            <p>If therefore the extreame of a <hi>Plethora</hi> of the veins, can ever be poſſible, it ought to conſiſt in a mediety, betwixt corrupt and very ſound bloud: Whether we conſider the ſame ſtate of falling off and neutrality, or only, as mixt of both, at leaſt, the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> ſhould remember, that <hi>good</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from its Trunk, <hi>an entire cauſe</hi>; but <hi>evill</hi> from the racemation of ſeveral defects: and ſo that this ſtate ſhould not be called <hi>plethoricall:</hi> but <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymicall.</hi> Neither to deſire <hi>phlebotomy</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>purgation,</hi> which may ſelectively expell the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="184"/> bad, and leave the good. And ſurely theſe their contradictory <hi>Theſes</hi> being conceded, it will be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine illation, that the indication of <hi>phlebotomy</hi> is not yet in no wiſe proved. For according to the truth of the matter we before ſhewed, the <hi>Anarchy</hi> of a <hi>cacochymia</hi> keeps not court in the veins, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of whoſe Reigne is only the perturbation of the bloud.

               <hi>Hippocrates</hi> indeed it's confeſſed, commands to let bloud preſently and aboundantly in the ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous plethora of <hi>Athletick</hi> bodies: and that the ſchools every where thunder out for <hi>phlebotomy.</hi> But their allegations for that in the cure of feavers and diſeaſes, is extreamly ridiculous and worthy the bluſhes of learned men.

For there is no fear of a <hi>plethora</hi> in one afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a <hi>Feaver,</hi> nor that a vein ſhould be broke by exerciſe.

For thoſe who in any diſeaſe are debilitated by bloud-letting, are oftentimes diſappointed of the <hi>Criſis,</hi> and if in the dilatory expergefaction from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and raiſing its ſeige, they begin to recruit, and nature is not put upon ſuch hard duty, but they now become a little better; yet they paſſe out at the poſtern gate and narrow way of many anxieties, and a long flux of time it is, e're theſe valetudina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts arrive at the broad and pleaſant way of perfect convaleſcence, and not without fear of the freſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm of eluſory <hi>recidivation.</hi> But they who take their decumbiture in a diſeaſe without phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, are eaſily reſtored, and by and by attain to their priſtine ſtate of ſanity.

For let it be but ſeriouſly weighed in the ballance, and by the weighty motive of the preſſing neceſſities and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that follow, and it will evidently appear that Phyſitians may deſervedly ſuffer the laſh and feel compunction for their inhumane languifying practiſes. For is it not enough to a Phyſitian that the ſick <hi>pines</hi> and begins to grow faint, under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of an inexcuſable weakneſſe by a deplorable <hi>diſeaſe, hunger, loſſe of appetite, inquietude, pains, anxieties, waichings, ſweate, &amp;c?</hi> Nor ought a faithful Adjuvant or helper to lay load upon load, &amp; add weakneſſe to weakneſſes. Deceitful is that help which <hi>phlebotomy</hi> brings and his remedy ſo uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that no Phyſitian hitherto durſt promiſe from thence future ſanation.</p>
            <p>In earneſt it is worthy our moſt ſerious conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, when we take notice how every Artificer performes what he promiſes, to wit, the Image-maker <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="208"/> his Image, the Builder his edifice, the Shooe-maker faſhions his ſhooes, and all this <hi>ad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guem.</hi> But alas onely a Phyſitian, in a cold <hi>ſpaſme</hi> of inconſtancy, dares promiſe nothing of his Art: becauſe the infirm <hi>nerves</hi> of his <hi>ground work</hi> &amp; grand <hi>foundation</hi> leanes on the broken reed of uncertain <hi>principles</hi>; by accident only, and moſt times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully profitable: becauſe however the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is handled, it is full of ignorance to intend cure by procuring weakneſſe, that is, by a ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the bloud, largely made; nature being
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61316:95"/>
driven into the wild field of confuſion, ſounds a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and neglects the expulſion of her enemy. Which expulſion notwithſtanding, needs no vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume to confirme, that being the <hi>Epitaſis</hi> or heart of the buſineſſe, or the <hi>Epilogue</hi> and winding up of the matter, contains the whole <hi>ſcene</hi> of feavers and nature. Farther, it's an indubitate and irrefragable truth, That the febrile matter doth not take up its lodging in the vein above the heart: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="209"/> that the <hi>ſeminall fomenting</hi> or <hi>occaſionall</hi> matter, is in no wiſe exhauſted or let out by the key of <hi>phlebotomy,</hi> or effectuouſly cures, by the direct and perpendicular intention of healing.</p>
            <p>Finally, if bloud-letting be concluded for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the arteries through the facility of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, it is wholly fruſtraneous while the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="210"/> is yet in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and in its aſcenſion by the <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>max</hi> of aggravation, before it comes to the fire of ſublimation, and hath not yet mounted the <hi>Apogae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> of conflagration. And ſeeing that not in its fixation or <hi>stationary</hi> poſition, nor alſo in its <hi>retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation</hi> or declenſion, bloudletting is no whit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Therefore never. But not in the ſtate, is proved: becauſe the <hi>Criſis</hi> is hindred, ſeeing nature (as they write) is moſt oppoſed and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited in her reluctation and <hi>conflict</hi> with the forren invaſion of the diſeaſe, and for the moſt part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns conquerour, then would it be inconſiderate and invincible dotage, to flank her files and fall foul upon her in the rear, by a raſh attempt of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating her force: then would ſhe leaſt of all be able to ſuffer the loſſe of ſtrength, and retreat from the duel. But if in the <hi>State</hi> Nature be forc'd to reſign
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61316:95"/>
to the tyranny of the Conquerour, what ſhall bloud-letting be, any other then meer <hi>homicide?</hi> If therefore in the ſtate it is not convenient to open a vein, while the heat is in its <hi>Zenith,</hi> the anxiety and powerfulleſt reſpiration of the arteries is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated: Farre leſſe convenient ſurely will it be, in the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>augmentation.</hi> Eſpecially ſeeing that in the firſt daies, the fear of a <hi>plethora</hi> vaniſhes away, and ſo without doubt the perſpiration of the arteries is eaſy enough. But that diſeaſes in <hi>Perigaeo</hi> or declination, have not the leaſt latitude or intention for bloud-letting, and do neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, nor ſuffer it, is confeſſed by the common conſent of all, and is ſo clear as needs no <hi>Apoixis,</hi> nor cannot eſcape the moſt blear-eyed and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe obſervation, that no man will ever eſſay phlebotomy in the declination of a diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Moreover conſider we that in the <hi>meridian</hi> of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="211"/> feavers, the bloud that runnes in its <hi>ecliptick,</hi> the <hi>veins,</hi> is either good, or bad, or neuter. If good, that it will be good to keep good, there's none ſo devoid of his reaſon to appear we believe ſo much a ſceptick, to diſpute againſt it: becauſe it addes to the ſtrength. For (as elſewhere we have ſhewed) the fear of a <hi>plethora</hi> even ſtraight at the beginning, if there was any, ceaſed.

of this fable, and brings nothing but loſs of ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Moreover the ſchools teach, that phlebotomy in a feaver, is not commanded becauſe of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of bloud, which negative <hi>Theſis</hi> ſuppoſes <hi>evill</hi> and <hi>putrid.</hi> But they will otherwiſe learn when we come to ſhew that there is no corrupt thing in the <hi>Canals</hi> of the veins unto the laſt period of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and conſequently this drift of phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="212"/> will be caſhiered.

                  </gap>ebrilia</hi> to come to the heart, then before: yea, that in the place of difflating corruption (which in ſeverity of truth we have proved to be none at all) there is not occaſioned rather a freer paſſage of the putrid aire to the heart, towards which place ſeriouſly, the vacuity of the depleted veins doth attract the bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. Let them ſhew I ſay, how the <hi>effluvium</hi> of bloud, and diminution and exciſe of the ſtrength by the <hi>Cubit,</hi> will be ſuch a convenient mother, to own ſuch a production as will impede corruption, or import the correction and redintegration of the putrid. Let them alſo explain themſelves what
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61316:96"/>
they mean, when they ſay, that phlebotomy ſhould be made, that the arteries may more freely reſpire, when that putrefaction (if there were any poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it in the <hi>veins</hi>) would not affect the <hi>arterial</hi> bloud, the ſteward of whole Nature. Moreover let them prove that the good bloud and ſtrength being diminiſh'd, proportionably, there is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er power to the remaining impure and inquinated by corruption, (as they ſuppoſe) of preſerving it ſelf from the putrefaction that is imminent. Let them inſtruct us likewiſe contrary to <hi>Scripture,</hi> that the life and ſoul are rather, and more delectably in the remaining contaminated bloud, then in the purer that is taken away by phlebotomy. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we may have freedome enough to conclude, that the letting forth of the good, doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily and regularly include the augmented ſtock &amp; proportion, &amp; unbridled licence of the remaining evil bloud. What if then in the feaver and veins the bloud be bad, and they ſay it is good (as a ſign and effect) which in phlebotomy flowes forth bad: and ſhould they eſteem ſo much at leaſt of the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of bad <hi>bloud</hi>; to which we find no grounds for our belief to incline. For, firſt let them prove, whereby, that their incrimination and arraignement of the <hi>bloud</hi> to be <hi>noxious,</hi> may appear by the verdict of <hi>apodicticall</hi> evidence and demonſtration to be ſo indeed, as we before have, and by and by ſhall fully acquit and find not guilty. And then let them indoctrinate us how by ſuch a ſudden and large emiſſion of the bad bloud, no prejudice is made to the powers and ſtrength: and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining inquinated bloud, the ſtrength being now
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61316:97"/>
diminiſhed, and a depletion made of the bloud, ſhall be the cauſe why the corruption of the reſt of the blond is leſſe able to proceed? And whether they can hope, the bloud being, after what manner ſoever, once putrified in the veins, that from ſuch a privation there can be in nature any regreſſion: And alſo let them ſhew, not to contradict, how it is proper to the feaver to inquinate the bloud it ſelf, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="213"/> and this property to be taken away <hi>à posteriori,</hi> to wit, with the removing of the putrefyed humour?

ſecundum naturam, <hi>in every</hi> humidum, <hi>by another heat that is ambient.</hi> Here <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> requires three things neceſſary unto corruption. Firſt the ſubject or matter of putrefaction, which is, <hi>unumquodque humidum.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>form</hi> and <hi>eſſence</hi> of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, namely, the corruption of the proper heat from its own natural ſtate, ſo that of a natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtate, it is made <hi>praeter naturam.</hi> And laſtly, the efficient cauſe, to wit, the heat of the <hi>ambient.</hi> The which if one of theſe be wanting, corruption cannot then be made.</p>
            <p>In conformity and analogy to this, <hi>Alexander</hi> lends us his ſuffrage, in lib. 12. cap. 2. where he proves, <hi>The humours do not putrefie in the veins, but that they are rather congealed</hi> extra vaſa, <hi>then putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</hi> If they putrefy in the <hi>veins,</hi> wormes would be generated, becauſe that there the heat is more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, then in the Inteſtines, where animals are begotten of corruption. <hi>Joubertus</hi> alſo is not farre from us, thinking, <hi>That all corruption is made</hi> cum faetore. But in the veins there is no <hi>faetor</hi>; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no corruption. <hi>Joubertus</hi> alſo adds, <hi>That all things are conſerved in there proper places:</hi> but the <hi>veins</hi> are the proper <hi>Conſervatories</hi> of the bloud and humours, therefore putrefy not. <hi>Capriolus</hi> reſponds to this, That although every thing is conſerved in his proper place, yet the ſame may putrefy from cauſes proceeding ſom other way. He brings an exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mple of <hi>wine,</hi> which although it ſhould be conſerved almoſt alwaies in its proper veſſels, yet ſometimes it is corrupted in them, and putrefies by other cauſes. But becauſe it is <hi>indecorum</hi> to the regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>philoſophy</hi> to deny <hi>Theorems,</hi> we conſtantly
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61316:98"/>
aſſert, every thing to be conſerved in his proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle or native conſervatory. To the example of <hi>Capriolus</hi> which he brings of wine, we ſhall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, That <hi>wine</hi> is not in the Hogs-head or veſſel, as in his proper natural place, nor hath it a proper place, when it is not contained in his proper term or boundary; for the wine is detained in the veſſel againſt his nature. And thoſe bodies which are taken away by external force and injury, have not a proper and natural place. Man for this cauſe is mortall.</p>
            <p>We remain alſo doubtful in the generall <hi>Theory</hi> of putrefaction; for we find it not an unuſual (nor laudable) cuſtome for fluctuating ſpirits, whoſe lenity of belief inclines, or obſtinacy of will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreins them, to dilate the notions of things beyond the proprieties of their naturs. The ſchools they <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere quodlibet, ut probetur quidlibet,</hi> In their <hi>Theorems</hi> of putrefaction, which we thus prove: The bloud is kept <hi>fluid</hi> even in a <hi>Cadaver</hi> or dead body, in its Trunk, the veins, as appear, by the conſent of all Anatomy, but once let out by the key of phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy doth preſently by the <hi>deliquium</hi> of the <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> condenſe and coagulate into <hi>colchotar ſanguinis,</hi> clods. Now the coagulation of the bloud is the <hi>prodromus</hi> and <hi>Alpha</hi> only of putrefaction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the veins by their proper balme, (not ſhort of that of <hi>Memphis,</hi>) preſerve the bloud from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in a dead body, much more will they in the living.</p>
            <p>Its an argument <hi>a minori ad majus.</hi> It's true ſome forreign excrements may perturb the bloud in the veins, as we before hinted, to wit, the ſurpluſage,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61316:99"/>
or mean retinue as well of their own, as another <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,</hi> but never the Lord chief Treaſurer of life, the <hi>bloud.</hi> Becauſe according to ſcripture, <hi>it is the ſeat, the chamber and magazine of life.</hi> If therefore the grand ſeigniour himſelf, the life, cannot preſerve his own throne and Treaſury in the metropolis or Royaltie of the veins, from the invaſion or treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous undermining of that petty Rebell, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from becoming competitor or Tenant thereto, when then will he keep it? And how can it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver free from the ſame? And alſo if the life cannot ſave harmles &amp; keep indempnified from the charge of putrefaction, the bloud, <hi>cuſtos vitae,</hi> in which ſhe ſits enthron'd and growes and encreaſes in glory <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="218"/> and vigour, how will then the bones he preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
            <p>The veins therefore are ordain'd by the high court and Councel of Heaven to be Lord Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners deputed to keep the bloud from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: becauſe the life is confermented to the bloud of the veins, and therefore both are caſt out by the leaſe of ejectment of bloud-letting; they both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether have their current through the ſluice of <hi>phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy,</hi> and make their <hi>exit</hi> at one door, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="219"/> of the vein. Under this queſtion therefore the glory and deſtination of Nature doth come to ruin: or the whole courſe of healing hitherto ador'd by Phyſitians. But put the caſe that it be ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By what ſignes do the ſchools judge of putrid bloud? Is it not from the colour, whiter, blacker, yellow, gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, or browniſh? From the matter viſcous, thick, wateriſh, thin, &amp;c? And at laſt from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, not febrous, or not hanging together? But

we declare under the penalty of being convicted of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="220"/> a ly or ſuppos'd thing, if any one pleaſe to try and examine the bloud of two hundred common ſound perſons emit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed in one day, which though many of them may be very unlike in aſpect, colour, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and conſiſtence; and let many of theſe be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd, yet they ſhall be found to be equally uſefull and profitable in healing. For although many of them ſhould ſeem putrid; ſome aeruginous or atrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious: yet in the firſt place, theſe perſons whence the bloud flowes forth, are all ſuppos'd to be <hi>ſound.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="221"/> Wherefore we have ſlighted the table of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the <hi>Haemaſcopy</hi> or ſight of the extrave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated bloud, and have concluded, that the bloud commanded by the Phyſitians to be kept, was chiefly for this reaſon, that they might find out one viſitation in the ſick.</p>
            <p>Verily if putrefaction of bloud hath any place, and doth demonſtrate its emiſſion from that title, it takes place in the plague. But phlebotomy in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="222"/> plague is deadly; Therefore there is never no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction in the bloud.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe alſo there be <hi>thirty</hi> men alike afflicted with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="223"/> the <hi>Pleureſy,</hi> and ten of them give forth bloud appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently vitiated: (for the bloud of <hi>pleuretick</hi> perſons is like to red wine mixt with curdled milk) the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twenty I'le undertake to cure without bloud-letting. Certain it is, that thoſe twenty have their bloud no otherwiſe affected then thoſe ten, who were let bloud. And again that thoſe twenty that are cured, if a vein were opened, their bloud ſhall be found rectified, reſtored to its priſtine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and farre differing from the bloud of <hi>pleureticks.</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:61316:100"/>
Therfore the bloud of <hi>pleuretick</hi> perſons is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, although it may ſeem ſo: becauſe from the black pathes of corrupted bloud, there is no return to the way of life and ſanity. Black bloud therefore or livid, green, &amp;c. do not ſignifie the corruption of it: but are ſymbolizations of only its <hi>efferveſcence,</hi> or fermentall turbulency. For in the firſt place, if the more wateriſh and yellow bloud doth denote its vitioſity, the <hi>arteriall</hi> bloud ſhould be far worſe then the bloud in the <hi>veins</hi>; which is falſe. For the Tree of life, the <hi>bloud,</hi> is no otherwiſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the aforeſaid racemations, then as the wine is troubled, when the vine flowers, yet is not therefore corrupted; for take away the trouble, and it returnes again to its priſtine ſerenity and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="234"/> clarity. So likewiſe a feaver doth variouſly affect and perturb the bloud, and diſcolorate it with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and divers faces. But theſe <hi>larvations</hi> vaniſh, the feaver being taken away. Verily theſe <hi>Haema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tognomiſts</hi> or diviners by the <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> in the bloud, in their <hi>Gnomologies</hi> may be compared to thoſe who calculate and think to paſſe judgement on the Radix or ſcheam of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wine, by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant of their piſſe-pot; who will judge of good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="235"/> or bad Canary by looking on their urine. But they go on to ſay. That if <hi>putrefaction</hi> be not lodg'd in the <hi>bloud,</hi> and on the ſcore of being a troubleſome gueſt, why doth it therefore the third time, and not the firſt, or the firſt, and not the third time, ſpring forth with a bluſh purely red out of the <hi>vein</hi>? But this argument doth onely demonſtrate one part of the bloud to be more and ſooner troubled then the other, not the whole or altogether. And
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61316:100"/>
if it be putrefied, it availes to avert the putrefaction, then in vain to mitigate the feaver by refrigerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But ſurely thoſe things whatſoever, that reſiſt putrefaction, are <hi>hot.</hi> For <hi>myrrh</hi> now two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares preſerves the embalmed <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes; which otherwiſe with <hi>ſuccory, plantain,</hi> and your <hi>cooling</hi> things had long agoe putrefied. The putrefaction therefore of the humours, of the bloud alſo and the ſpirits are fabulous <hi>ſtories,</hi> &amp; a warring againſt them more ridiculous then a fight in <hi>Quixot.</hi> We adde one thing more, whatſoever has once <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatized</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="236"/> into an exotick <hi>Diatheſis</hi> of corruption in the body, nevr returns again into unity or favor: But the bloud of the veins howſoever it may ſeem corrupted <hi>returns</hi> agan into <hi>favor.</hi> Therfore it hath not bin <hi>once</hi> corrupted: The Major is proved, becauſ corruption <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="237"/> in us, is an effect of the ſequeſtration of the vitall diſpoſitions. The Minor is proved by thoſe cured of the <hi>Plague, pleureſy</hi> &amp; <hi>feavers</hi> without bloudletting.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="238"/> Alſo, if the bloud is everjudged to be putrid or corrupt, exiſting in the veins, it is that chiefly, which is <hi>haemorrhoidall:</hi> but this is not corrupt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be almoſt as it were extravenated. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bloud is never to be judged putrid in the veins. The <hi>Major</hi> the whole practiſe of <hi>Chirurgery,</hi> proves, by <hi>ulcers</hi> begotten of the <hi>haemorrhoides.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, becauſe we make a <hi>met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi>

Therefore that <hi>bloud,</hi> is received into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine favour, and they feel themſelves well.</p>

               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:61316:101"/>What hinders now, if taken up and committed to the managery of a judicious and deliberate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, but that this <hi>fabulous ſcene</hi> of putrid <hi>bloud</hi> will appear on all hands worthy the hiſs off the ſtage of medical <hi>Theorems</hi> for phlebotomy; and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it but in the liſt of nothing.

            <p>At length we come to cut off the Cable of that <hi>Anchora ſpei</hi> of <hi>revulſion,</hi> and ſo to take away alike all the leſſer tackling of <hi>Co-indications,</hi> that as in a mappe may appear the dangerous rock of theſe their unleavened <hi>Heterodoxes,</hi> as the miſerable and tenacious ſubterfuges of <hi>Pertinacy.</hi> It is a mad help in <hi>theoricall</hi> or <hi>practicall</hi> phlebotomy (for they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly draw out and exact a plenty of it for this end) in ſhunning the <hi>Scilla</hi> of <hi>feavers</hi> to fall into the <hi>Charybdis</hi> of <hi>menſtrua's</hi>; and either in the firſt, or onely in the laſt to let bloud for revulſion: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

that the feavoriſh matter doth not ſwim in the bloud, or fluctuate in the veins, as a fiſh in the water: but is fixt to the veſſel within.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="233"/> Now it is to be conſidered if there be any uſe of <hi>Revulſion</hi> in feavers. For in ſooth, ſeeing pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily there is no other need of revulſion, then phlebotomy, to which the ſucceeding bloud that is about to flow, is hoped for, by accident, and by the benefit of which, it will not flow to the place affected. According to which <hi>Theſis</hi> it followes,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61316:103"/>
That by ſuch an evacuation the peccant feavoriſh bloud, diſperſed in the veins will be drawn; (<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niventer loqui</hi>) which otherwiſe, latent in its own neſt, farre from the heart, would not communicate the <hi>ferment</hi> of its hurt ſo haſtily and fiercely to the heart. Which is as much as to ſay, That by ſuch a revulſion, the peccant humour would be drawn from the ignoble part, to the more noble. For more crude and feculent is the bloud in the maze and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birinth of the <hi>meſaraick</hi> veins; but more defecate which comes to the pallace of life, the heart. For otherwiſe the firſt weapons of miſchief had been placed by indiſcret nature neer the fountain of life. Therefore ſeeing the ſtream of the feavoriſh matter flowes not in the veins, nor takes up quarters neer the heart: Farre be it from any ſober head to fall into that dotage to believe, That it can be drawn forth, or caus'd to ſhift its quarters, by the rude hand of <hi>phlebotomy,</hi> however oftentimes a <hi>multico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorate</hi> bloud by the Court-ſhip of iterated bloud-lettings may be ſent forth. It's a cruel remedy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if unto the place of the emitted bloud, ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall come from more remote places. For ſo the tincture of labefaction of one place, ſhould be communicated to the whole and to the more noble parts.</p>
            <p>Finally if once the old Troops of errors of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="234"/> 
               <hi>Ethnicks</hi> were diſbanded and caſhiered the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of knowledge, the pretended <hi>Reformades,</hi> or part new modell'd Moderns would have more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regard to the life of their neighbour; and would likewiſe know, that the childiſh <hi>Theory</hi> of revulſions are but vain and ridiculous comments;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61316:104"/>
and that the loſſe of the Treaſury of bloud and ſtrength is pernicious; and that there is no hurt from the bloud within the veins; but only from <hi>hoſtile</hi> and alien <hi>Excrements:</hi> and alſo that God hath ordained ſufficient Emunctories for any filth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; nor is there any need of inciſing the veins for the cure of feavers. Thus having evidenced, at leaſt made dubious the litigious <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>ſupinity</hi> of this practiſe of bloud-letting we think, and have ſome grounds to be confident, that the ingenuity and rationality of it will prevail more then our ſlender performances; whereby to fix as a very large diſcouragement, and diſſervice to the activity of thoſe ſpirits who are the patrons and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of this practiſe. Herein we have been more elaborate, and the longer inſiſted, becauſe the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is material, and a wicked and bloudy practiſe, and concernes oftimes the life of man; an error to be taken notice of by <hi>State,</hi> if they will make good that title and divine attribute to be merciful like Gods as they are called. And thus we could not but think it our duty, (according to our capacity,) wholly to ſubvert and diſrobe this bloudy mantle of the exſecrable, and deſtructive <hi>Theorems</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demick</hi> practiſe of bloud-letting; the ſecond man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evacuation.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="235"/> Now it will be ſeaſonable for us to come to the 3 <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>evacuation</hi> of the <hi>ſchools</hi>; which is <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanels</hi> or <hi>Iſſues,</hi> another univerſal main pillar of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and to examine it by the fire of truth, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dichotomiſe

Which of all theſe generall remedies hath the principality of verity and <hi>vertue,</hi> and the <hi>optimacy</hi> in ſanation, is not worth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. But this we believe. That this <hi>Trichotomy</hi> or Ternary of Racemations or branches of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall Root, is like the <hi>Taxus</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> which the firſt year bears <hi>fruit,</hi> the ſecond, <hi>leaves,</hi> and the third year, <hi>poiſon:</hi> and conclude, that but a mean ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion any thing well palated, will find no pleaſant taſt in this practiſe neither; except he have it brawn'd and made inguſtible, as being paved with the free-ſtone of Cuſtome, and the blew Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ſchools. We ſhall therefore endeavour a full delivery hereof; declaring the grounds of <hi>doubt,</hi> and reaſons of denial; which rightly underſtood, may, if not overthrow, yet ſhrewdly ſhake the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of this invention. Wherefore we will declare the ends and the effects of <hi>Fontanells</hi> and <hi>Cauteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cauteries</hi> in the firſt place are made by <hi>fire,</hi> and that either <hi>actuall,</hi> as by a red hot Iron: or <hi>potentiall,</hi> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="236"/> an <hi>eſcharoticall</hi> cauſtick: <hi>Fontanells</hi> alſo by a razor, or inciſion knife cutting ſomething away. Of late, they have a trick of paring away, (palpably laniarious) &amp; wounding the <hi>membrana Carnoſa.</hi> But others prefer a wound by fire, or <hi>Cauſtick</hi> fitted to it, which is layed open by inciſion: becauſe that by the actual heat and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="237"/> ſiccity, they are led to think the flux of <hi>humors</hi> is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impeded &amp; ſtopped in their deſcent. As if in ſuch a tantillation or moment of time, the fire ſhould burne ſomething beſides the <hi>Eſchar</hi>; or exſiccate ſome other thing, which they feigne is about to flow to the wound. And on both ſides, theſe dreams
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61316:105"/>
are magnifyed by the ſchools. Vain therefore are the <hi>Canteries</hi> or <hi>Fontanells,</hi> for the <hi>Revulſion</hi> and <hi>Exhaustion</hi> of humours, which have no real exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="238"/> in nature. For the adored <hi>Fontanell</hi> (for ſo they have chriſtned their wounds made in the fleſh, that the poor deluded vulgar may believe, that thereby diſeaſes are exhauſted, as by a fountain) helpes nothing, before the cruſtous <hi>eſchar</hi> be taken away; and the veſtigiaries of heat and dryneſſe be firſt removed.

                  </gap> Pyhſitians have determined</hi> that howſoever the <hi>Fontanell</hi> was made, at leaſt they would make ſolution of continuity, and keep it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="239"/> For what God hath made and ordained in its <hi>integrality,</hi> to be kept untoucht, and adjudged to be beſt, ſeems unto the controuling ignorance of the ſchools, better to be vulnerated and divided, and ſo kept. To be wounded therefore, and keep wounds open, avails much to the health of the ſchools. And ſeriouſly it is worth our notice, but more our wonder, that they have not put wounding among their Canons of conſerving health: foraſmuch as <hi>Cauteries</hi> or permanent <hi>wounds</hi> are thought to be ſo neerly related to it. But the difference betwixt wounding and burning is only this, that there happens an emiſſion of bloud: which one would think, under that title, ſhould excell with the ſchools, unleſſe the deceitfulneſſe

of phlebotomy had diſcovered it ſelf. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="240"/> and poſitively conclude forſooth, That a <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> or new impoſed <hi>Fontanell</hi> is a new <hi>Emunctory,</hi> by which Phyſitians may compell Nature with a wet finger to exonerate her ſelf. All which I ſay the ſchools have drawn into practiſe, upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of <hi>evacuation</hi> and <hi>exſiccation</hi> of ſuperfluities, wildly imagining to comprehend the competent quantity of bloud, Generation of the exotick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, and eaſy expulſion of the ſame under the ſingle <hi>ſynonyma</hi> of <hi>Fontanells</hi> or Iſſues: whereby they can cite or ſummon the <hi>Catarrhall ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that at this ſluice of <hi>Fontanells</hi> is expulſed the <hi>Nilus</hi> of defluxions, and particuliar ſtreams of <hi>gleeting</hi> humours, and it is now become a <hi>Cardinall</hi> point in the medicall compaſſe a main pillar of healing, and a <hi>Catarragogall</hi> Remedy cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up even to pulpitiſing, and has ſo farre prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that now alſo they are applyed unto children who have not yet attain'd unto 3 ſolar revolutions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea that univerſality it hath acquired, that it is the only remedy and <hi>refuge</hi> not only of very many <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> but alſo of moſt <hi>Externall</hi> and Cutany defects.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61316:106"/>
And laſtly we have conſidered the childiſh preſumption of Phyſitians, in that they ſo ſeriouſly perſwade themſelves, they can engage nature in her paſſive auſcultatory faculties to follow their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and expell the catarrh or defluxion at the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="241"/> hole that they have made in the fleſh.

For the ſchools teach, That by <hi>Fontanells,</hi> evil, yea exitious humours are forced out of the body, which otherwiſe would be either ſent to another place, or by its declive tendency would voluntarily flow downwards. It's well truly, that Nature with a looſe rein, againſt her will muſt dance attendance and wait upon the pleaſure of Phyſitians, and the apertion of the ſkin; that by that way ſhe may exon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſchools they teach, That the greateſt part of man-kind is in ſubjection to the Tyranny of a <hi>Cold Distemper</hi> of the <hi>ſtomack,</hi> &amp; an <hi>hot diſtemper of the liver, and that from the ſtomack,</hi> during the whole act of <hi>Concoction,</hi> (as abſurd as the former) doth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and aſcend whole clouds of vapours (the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent matter of <hi>Catarrhs</hi>) into the <hi>Baſis</hi> or loweſt part of the brain, and there fix upon a plane: and that the <hi>Brain</hi> by its native <hi>Temperament,</hi> being <hi>Cold,</hi> and ſet like a cover over a boiling pot, or the head of an <hi>Alembick,</hi> in the higheſt <hi>Region</hi> of the Body; and ſo all thoſe vapours that mount in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. by the help of the locall <hi>cold</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> are

For in the <hi>baſis</hi> of the brain is a narrow place called the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> or <hi>brain tunnel,</hi> which ſendeth two ſmall <hi>tubes,</hi> or outlets, toward the <hi>nostrills,</hi> and as many backward toward the <hi>neck.</hi> Which <hi>Cavities</hi> only could the Aſcendant vapour inſinuate it ſelf into; and thoſe are ever repleted with a <hi>muc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous</hi> or viſcid <hi>excrement,</hi> and perpetually by a kind of <hi>guttulous</hi> diſtillation, diſcharge it down of their own accord into the <hi>pallat,</hi> and <hi>Noſtrils,</hi> as the proper <hi>Emunctories</hi> or dreignes of the brain, deſtined to the evacuation of the ſlimy redundant humours: and therefore need no other vent or <hi>exit,</hi> as that unneceſſary one of a Fontanell or Cautery.

what a deſtructive man is he, and what an unworthy depraved quality it is, to maleficiate a humor in any part of the <hi>Head,</hi> which before was good, that he may from thence bring a malignant one to ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercutaneous part, which the Phyſitian commands to be wounded? And how obedient is that, which being an evil humour (and doubtleſſe over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides but a dead excrement) will ſuffer it ſelf to be wracked and hurried to another place, which at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time, and another place, not a whit ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of the <hi>oeconomy</hi> of life, by its own ſingle decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity conformes to the lawes of its ſituation! Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe things though conceded, yet it would want the eſſence and <hi>Etymon</hi> of a humour, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of an evil humour, namely, fleam, one of the four. For whatſoever doth once ſteam up from the furnace of the ſtomack in a vapour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes into drops, is neither thick, nor viſcous or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious, nor one of the four imaginary humours made in the <hi>Eutopia</hi> of the Liver: but ſhould be a poſthume guttulous liquor. Wherefore if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved impreſſion of the evil humour, the finall cauſe of a <hi>Fontanell,</hi> be not forged neither in the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Brain,</hi> nor <hi>Stomack,</hi> what then ſhall be the mint of theſe evil humours for <hi>Catarrhs</hi>?

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="263"/> At the beſt a Fontanel is alwaies but a <hi>palliative</hi> cure, and but in ſome neither, and hitherto farre below and very unworthy the venerable medicall ſchools.

For <hi>nidorous</hi> ructations, the averſion of ſpontaneous <hi>nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouſneſſe, fleſh, fiſh,</hi> and <hi>egges,</hi> yea the <hi>loadings</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the ſtomack it ſelfe, do call for and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the ſick be nouriſhed with only <hi>potables:</hi> for otherwiſe by things <hi>cadaverable</hi> you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſtrange accidents, defects of the minde, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incommodities of that kinde. Becauſe <hi>potati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> then do humect, and in the refection of thirſt, do refrigerate, and diſpel the fuliginous aridities and debilities flowing from thence.

We might here not impertinently ampliate what we hinted before in our Tractick of ſimple waters, of the <hi>digeſtion,</hi> or <hi>chilifactive</hi> tranſmutation of the ſtomack, whether it be <hi>pepſis</hi> or <hi>ſepſis,</hi> digeſtion by

Therefore as often as there is an averſation or oppoſition to fleſh, and <hi>nidorous ructations</hi> Aſcendant in the arched part of the higheſt orbe in the <hi>ſyſteme</hi> of our bodies, the mouth, it's the <hi>ſignificator</hi> of the preſentiality of <hi>heat,</hi> and the <hi>acid</hi> ferment in its <hi>detriment.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alſo this, how eaſily <hi>recent</hi> fleſh if bound to the foot or hot head, would putrefie and preſently ſtink. In a feavoriſh ſtomack therefore being very hot, wiſe Nature fears to make a <hi>Cadaver</hi> within her vital incommunicable world, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently there followes an averſation from fleſh.</p>
            <p>Whether then is the <hi>ferment</hi> of the ſtomack <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="288"/> gone in a feavoriſh perſon? What hath it demigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to another place? Or is it extinct?

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61316:123"/>
again from the winter of its privation. But the ferment is redintegral and <hi>redivivous.</hi> Thus therefore it happens. For either the diſcharging of the ferment out of the <hi>ſpleen,</hi> ſometimes doth not extend to the <hi>ſtomack,</hi> by reaſon of ſome defect of either of the preſidents or <hi>Archeus</hi> of the ſtomack, or ſpleen; or the <hi>ferment</hi> being entertained in the <hi>ſtomack</hi> is obvolved with an alien and feavoriſh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="289"/> Wherefore now whatſoever ſuffers an <hi>alimentary converſion</hi> in the ſtomack, in the form of a <hi>liquid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphanous</hi> reduction, by the vertue of its <hi>ferment,</hi> that hath entred the threſh-hold, and is admitted into the <hi>entry</hi> of a vital juice, although not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>eſſence</hi> of life: and for that cauſe doth not ſo naturally and freely putrefy. But whatſoever is not diſſolved, or if in it ſelf it be diſſolved, and yet doth not admit the ferment, as the <hi>ſerum</hi> of the <hi>bloud</hi> ſo called, and <hi>brine,</hi> &amp;c. it is either an <hi>excrement,</hi> or is facilly made ſo, and is obvious to <hi>corruption</hi>: Therefore in <hi>dieteticall preſcriptions</hi> the chief regard is to be had to the diſeaſes and food, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

That is to ſay, let the <hi>ferment,</hi> which ought to be the <hi>Caterer,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them, and not the Phyſitian according to his appetite and pleaſure, nor let him not make one laſt fit all ſizes.</p>
            <p>Laſtly exerciſe, labour, reſt, ſleep and air do depend on the rules which the importance of other digeſtions do dictate to us. Thus to conclude this is the true <hi>diet</hi> which Nature of her own accord and naturally doth ſhew and teach unto us. And let this one thing remain as a firm <hi>truth</hi> that ſhall outlive &amp; bear away its unhappy preſſures, that whoſoever by the ſweat and duſt of his ſober endeavours, and rifling the rich Treaſury of Nature hath lighted on ſuch choice remedies that are grand and powerful <hi>Arcana's,</hi> enriched with that ſublime <hi>energy,</hi> that can preſently reſtore the ſick, and free him from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſe whatſoever: he need not preſcribe any other diet to the ſick, then what the ſound are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly acquainted with. For to the ſound all things are adjudged ſound and wholeſome; becauſe that the digeſtive ferment does powerfully draw and conſtrain every thing into its own power and dominion.

they are thoſe things in which our <hi>Archeus</hi> finds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.

For then <hi>Dyſenteries</hi> and <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> or <hi>bloud-letting</hi> ſhould neceſſarily make us hungry: But in famine there is a devaſtation of the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that of the ſtomack it ſelfe, not by the intenſe <hi>peptick</hi> quality, but by the vigour of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtible, eſurine</hi> and <hi>depaſcent</hi> ferment. For as often as the ferment of the ſtomack is well diſpoſed, not having an object whereon to work and ſate its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, it conſumes the proper aliment of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack. Famine therefore ſuperſedes from raging and hath his <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> by <hi>meat</hi>; not as it's contrary to the ferment, nor that it is like to the ſame: but becauſe it is an appropriate remedy. The like is in the healing of all diſeaſes whatſoever, namely, there is required an adaequation of the remedy to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> and taking away the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional cauſe. Which appropriate conveniency of the remedy or the doſe, preſuppoſes a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well in the degree, as quantity, as alſo adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and application, with a ſpecifick adaequation of conformity. Thus farre alſo it includes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication and cognition of the end: the habitude and exigency of our faculties and the accord of them with the remedy, in which again the doſe is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

But to this <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf will anſwer, who teaches that by a ſtrong fire moſt medicines do depone all their <hi>acrimony</hi> &amp; <hi>mordacity.</hi> And beyond all doubt, and by common experience it appears, that by this <hi>Spagyrick</hi> art the fierceſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are tamed, and by it medicines that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe poiſonous, their <hi>deletory</hi> parts being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, are tranſmuted into <hi>Cardiacall.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over though the eſſences of <hi>vegetables</hi> and <hi>aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="302"/> are hot: yet their <hi>volatile ſalts</hi> (which few have ſeen) are temperate, ſo that if thou knoweſt to tranſmute oile of <hi>Cynnamon, Cloves, Lavender, &amp;c.</hi> into a <hi>volatile ſalt,</hi> you have then attained a temperate <hi>medicine,</hi> effecting as much as can be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61316:129"/>
for from thoſe <hi>ſimples,</hi> in an old <hi>vertigo, palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Apoplexie,</hi> and the like. As for example. If <hi>oile of Cynnamon, &amp;c.</hi> be mingled with his <hi>alkaal ſalt,</hi> and progreſſing by a moſt artificial and <hi>occult circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> for three moneths without any water, till the whole be changed into a <hi>volatile ſalt,</hi> you have then a real temperate medicine of a great value; and then it will truly tranſlate the eſſence of its ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into us, and bear it into our firſt conſtitutive principles. Verily the admirable powers of moſt excellent things cry aloud to heaven, as if they had come in vain; when there is ſcarce any man can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancipate them from their fetters, and looſen their bonds, and free them into a <hi>Jubilee</hi> of liberty to act, and pay that <hi>benevolence</hi> which they owe unto mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls. And to conclude this objection the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers may be compared to the <hi>Fox,</hi> that deſpiſed the <hi>grapes</hi> for their <hi>ſoureneſſe,</hi> when in Truth they hung too high for him, and ſo were out of his reach.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, that they are <hi>ſophiſticated</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated, we reply, That we have to do with things and not words: we have to do with medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and not with things nothing related to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Artiſt; with their right preparations, not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticated or careleſſe preparation. Shall the abuſe of a thing take away the uſe? And to come nearer to themſelves, what greater coſenage and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtication is there in their magnified Cardiacall ſtone of <hi>Bezoar</hi>? Will they therefore not uſe it at all? We confeſſe we cannot but acknowledge that there is much baſeneſſe and fraud uſed in the common <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry</hi> of the ſhops. For it is certain that fraud is
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61316:130"/>
the adjunct, and is alwaies connected to gain, and ſo to the adulteration of medicines. But how this does ſquare to the <hi>opprobrie</hi> of <hi>Chymists</hi> and their <hi>remedies,</hi> we leave to the deciſion of impartial and ingenious heads.</p>
            <p>It is no great thing to deceive the ignorant in things which themſelves profeſſe to be unskilful in. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="303"/> Yea, thoſe gentle things which their demure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſties dare cloſe with, as their <hi>eſſentiall oyles,</hi> which are ſold for a deer price, are all and every one of them adulterated: if nine parts of <hi>oyle</hi> of <hi>Almonds</hi> be mixed to one part of the <hi>eſſentiall oyle,</hi> the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment is eaſily made. For caſt it into a ſpoonfull or more of <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> and whatſoever ſwims a top, is of the <hi>eſſentiall oyle</hi>; but the reſt <hi>Amygdaline.</hi> And this more ſafely and clearly may be made manifeſt, if you experiment it in <hi>Balneo. Oyle</hi> of <hi>Sulphur</hi> is halfe rain water: But the <hi>acid water</hi> of <hi>vitriol,</hi> wholly a cheat. Which with a <hi>ſimple</hi> examination in <hi>Balneo</hi> will preſently appear, that ſcarce the ſixth part is pure. And thus many more <hi>medicines</hi> which are gotten into familiar acquaintance now with <hi>Galeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Phyſitians, and are commonly uſed and preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, may in time when the <hi>Spagyrick</hi> art ſhall come to be refined and ſublimed, appear very ridiculous and worthy their <hi>bluſhes,</hi> being ſuch as they will be aſhamed to own. This then may ſerve to wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that dirt which they have endeavoured to caſt on the lovely face of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> and conclude this <hi>objection,</hi> deſiring them to take notice that <hi>dogs</hi> bark not at the <hi>ſpots,</hi> but <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the 3d. That they are <hi>virulent medicines,</hi> power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully poiſonous, as appears by the ſmal <hi>doſe</hi> or <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi>

But this doth verify that <hi>Adage,</hi> that knowledge hath no other enemy but the <hi>Ignorant</hi>; which is manifeſt by this, that theſe <hi>Corroſives</hi> and manifeſt poiſons, by <hi>Art</hi> may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſweeter then ſugar.
