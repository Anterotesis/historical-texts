            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>King CHARLES the Firſt, <hi>No Man of Blood:</hi> BUT <hi>A Martyr for his People.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THAT there hath beene now almoſt ſeaven yeeres ſpent in Civill-Warres, aboundance of <hi>Blood-ſhed,</hi> and more Ruine and Miſery brought upon the <hi>Kingdome</hi> by it, then all the ſeverall <hi>Changes, Conqueſts</hi> and <hi>Civill-</hi>Warres it hath endured from the time of <hi>Brute,</hi> or the firſt Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of it; every mans wofull experience (ſome only excepted who have beene gayners by it) will eaſily aſſent unto.</p>
            <p>No mervaile therefore that many of thoſe (who if all they alledge for themſelves, that they were not the cauſe of it, could bee granted to be true) might eyther have hindred or leſſned it: would now put the blame of ſo horrid a buſineſſe from themſelves, and lay it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any they can perſwade to beare it. And that the Conquerours, who would binde <hi>their Kings in Chaynes and their Princes with fetters of Iron,</hi> and thinke they have a Commiſſion from Heaven to doe it (the guilt of it being neceſſarily either to bee charged upon the Conquerors or conquered) are not willing to have their <hi>triumphant Chayres,</hi> and the glories (as they are made beleeve) that hang upon their <hi>ſhoulders</hi> defiled with it; but do all they can to load their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives with it: But howſoever, though the ſucceſſe and power of an Army hath frighted it ſo farre out of queſtion as to charge it upon the King, and take away his life for it; by making thoſe that muſt of neceſſity bee guilty of the fact; if he ſhould have beene (as in all reaſon hee ought to have beene acquited of it) the only Judges of him.</p>
            <p>It may well become the judgement and conſcience of every man that will bee but eyther a good Subject or a Chriſtian, not to lend out his Soule and Salvation ſo much on truſt, as to take thoſe that are parties, and the moſt ignorant ſort of mens words for it: but to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115401:3"/>
enter into a moſt ſerious examination of the matter of Fact it ſelfe, and by tracing out the foote-ſteps of Truth, ſee what a concluſion may be drawn out of it. In purſuance wherof (for I hope the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of this <hi>Sea</hi> of blood will not prove ſo unſearchable as the head of <hi>Nile.)</hi> Wee ſhall enquire who firſt of all rayſed the Feares and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies. Secondly, repreſent and ſet down the truth of the matter of Fact, and proceedings betwixt the King and Parliament; from the tumultuous &amp; ſeditious coming of the People to the Parliament and White-hall, untill the 25. <hi>Aug.</hi> 1642. when he ſet up his <hi>Standard</hi> at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> &amp; from the ſetting up of his <hi>Standard</hi> untill the 13 <hi>Sep.</hi> 1642. when the Parliament by their many acts of hoſtility, &amp; a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive &amp; Churliſh anſwer to his propoſitions, might well have put him out of hope of any good to be obteined from them, by meſſages of Peace ſent unto them. Thirdly, whether a Prince or other Magiſtrate, labouring to ſuppreſſe or puniſh a rebellion of the People, be tied to thoſe rules are neceſſary to the juſtifying of a warre if it were made betweene equalls. Fourthly, ſuppoſe the warre to bee made with a neighbour Prince, or between equalls, whether the King or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were in the defenſive or juſtifiable part of it. Fiftly, Whether the Parliament in their pretended magiſtracy have not taken leſſer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to puniſh or provide againſt inſurrections, treaſons &amp; rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as they are pleaſed to call them. Sixtly, Who moſt deſired Peace, and offered fairelieſt for it. Seventhly, Who laboured to ſhorten the Warre, and who to lengthen it. Eightly, Whether the Conditions proffered by the King; would not have beene more profitable for the People if they had beene accepted, and what the Kingdome and People have got inſteed of it.</p>

For they had found the way, and loſt nothing by it, to be ever jealous of the King; And whileſt he did all he could to ſhew them, that there was no cauſe for it, they who were jealous without a cauſe, could bee ſo cunning as to make all the haſte they could to weaken Him, and ſtrengthen themſelves, by ſuch kind of artifices.</p>
               <p>But hee that could not chooſe, but take notice that there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ties and combinations betwixt his <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Subjects, the latter of whom the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves underſtood to be no better then Rebels, and therfore ſerved in places of Command in His Majeſties Army againſt them.

               <p>Or if any other cauſes or provocations ſhould bee imagined as miſuſing the Parliaments Meſſengers, or the like: wee know the King (unleſſe it were by his patience and often Meſſages for Peace) was guilty of no provocations; but on the contrary, though hee had all manner of ſcornes and reproaches caſt upon him, and his

               <p>To ſight for the defence of the Religion eſtabliſhed (as they made alſo the People believe) that was as needleſſe; when the King offered to doe every thing might help to promote it: and they are ſo little alſo to bee credited in that pretence, as wee know they did all they could from the beginning to ruine it; tooke away <hi>Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> the hedge and bounds of it, brought in <hi>Presbitery</hi> to preach up and aid their <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and when their owne turnes were ſerved encouraged <hi>Conventicles</hi> and <hi>Tub-preachers</hi> to pull down the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitery:</hi> And being demanded at the treaty at <hi>

               <p>As for the reſtrictive part of the Lawes to keepe the People in ſubjection, wee can very well perſwade our ſelves, no ſuch Warre was ever made yet in the World, nor any People ever found that would engage in a Warre for that they obeyed, but againſt their wills: And for that part of the Law that gives them the Kings protection, priviledges, immunities and certainties of deciding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies (which are more fitly to bee called the Liberties of the People, then to have 45. of the houſe of Commons or a Faction to make daily, and hourely Lawes, and Religion, and Government, and vote their eſtates in and out to pay an Army, to force their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it) if wee had not outlived the Parliaments diſguiſes, and pretences, ſaw them now tearing them up by the roots, that there may bee no hope of their growing up again, and ſeting up their owne as well as the <hi>ignorant,</hi> and illiterate <hi>fancies</hi> of Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niques, and <hi>Souldiers</hi> in ſteede of them; wee might have ſaid that alſo had beene needleſſe, when the King had done aboundantly enough already; and offered to grant any thing more could in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon bee demanded of him.</p>

               <p>THe ods was ſo great betwixt what the Parliament laboured to get, and the <hi>King</hi> to keep, as that which ſwayes the ballance in moſt mens actions will bee argument enough to conclude they were more likely to looſe by a peace then a war: therfore the more willing to continue it: and if their owne intereſts would not put them ſo farre upon it, their vaine glorie and ambition would bee forward enough to perſwade them to it, and if not that the ſucceſſe of their armes, or miſcalled providence would make them looke (as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells us they did) upon any tenders of peace, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great did upon <hi>Darius</hi> his offer of halfe his Kingdome: and if not that, their feares and jealouſies now growne greater by wronging of the King, then ever they were when they ſuſpected him; could never think it ſafe to let an inraged <hi>Lion</hi> into his den they had ſo long kept out of it. But the King could not fight for his owne but hee muſt adventure the undoing of his <hi>owne;</hi> and could not but know that ſo much as was loſt of his Subjects, would bee ſo much loſt of a <hi>King;</hi> and therefore doth all hee can to preſerve a People, had no minde to preſerve themſelves; and before hee had gathered up the bayes hee wonne at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> ſends a Proclamation of pardon to thoſe, that the day before did all they could to kill him; and in all his actions of warre afterward behaved himſelfe rather like a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing father defending himſelfe againſt the ſtrokes and violence of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient Children. Had the Parliament accepted of his offers before hee came to <hi>Beverley</hi> or beſieged <hi>Hull,</hi> hee had never ſet up his <hi>Standard</hi> at <hi>Nottingham;</hi> or had they loved his People, but halfe ſo
