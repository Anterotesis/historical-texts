         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

EXPEDIENT
For taking away all Impoſitions,

By Erecting Bankes for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Expect ſo little credit will be given the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that, ſhould I be large on the Subject, I
queſtion whether it would be eſteemed worth
peruſal: And having propounded ſo great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by erecting Banks, I conceive it proper
firſt to give You ſome hints of the nature of
them.</p>
            <p>A Banke is a certain number of ſufficient men of Credit and
Eſtates joyned together in a ſtock, as it were for keeping ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
mens Caſh in one Treaſury, and letting out imaginary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
at Intereſt, for 3. or more in the hundred <hi>per annum,</hi> to
Trades-men or others, that agree with them for the ſame, and
making payment thereof by Aſſignation, paſſing each mans Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
from one to another, yet paying little money: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much;
that if a Merchant or other perſon want money, if he
hath or can procure credit in Banke, he may make as good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Aſſignment in Banke without it: As for Example, the
ſaid Merchant buyes Cloth of a Clothier for 100<hi>l.</hi> value more
or leſs, and goes with him to the Banke, where he is Debtor for
ſo much as he takes up, and the Clothier is made Creditor for
ſo much as he ſold his Goods for to the ſaid Merchant: Then
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97447:4"/>
ſuch Clothier having occaſion to pay money to a Stapler or
Wool-monger for wool bought, the ſaid Clothier is made De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor,
and the Wool-monger Creditor upon account, the ſaid
Wool-monger buyes wool from a Countrey Farmer, for ſo
much money more or leſs, ſo the Wool-monger is made Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and the Farmer Creditor; the Farmer muſt pay Rent to
his Landlord, and is likewiſe made Debtor and his Landlord
Creditor; the ſaid Landlord for his occaſions buyes goods of a
Mercer, Grocer, Vintner, or the like, or from all, then he is
made Debtor, and ſuch Mercer or other Trades-man Creditor;
then peradventure ſuch Mercer or other Trades-man buyes
goods from the ſame Merchant that took up the firſt credit in
Banke, and ſtands yet Debtor there, but upon ſale of his goods
to the Mercer or other Trades-man, both clears their accounts
in Banke. And ſo in all Trades, as occaſion preſents.</p>
            <p>Theſe Bankes in the ſeveral parts of <hi>Europe</hi> where erected,
being ſo held by Merchants and others, joyned together in a
ſtock, and credited by the monies brought in thereunto (which
money for the moſt part there remaining, and payments being
made upon the credit thereof by aſſignment in Banke as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid)
might as well be done here onely upon the credits of
Landed men, whereof they have few in <hi>Holland,</hi> and in other
parts, lying convenient for Trade; where Land is, the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
thereof are ſeldome found to be Merchants: So that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(if but ſenſible of it) hath an advantage of all parts in the
world, as lying in the centre of the Trade of <hi>Europe,</hi> enjoying
ſafe and commodious Harbours, wanting few neceſſaries, no
Lands nor perſons naturally inclined to Trade, if not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by great Cuſtomes, Exciſe, and the abuſes in Collecting
it, and by the want of ſtock, or a ſupply thereof at reaſonable
Intereſt.</p>
            <p>To free <hi>England</hi> of theſe inconveniencies, and ſupply it with
a ſtock for Trade, as great as ſhall be requiſite, without bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in more <hi>Bullion,</hi> it may be done three manner of wayes,
never yet practiſed in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the whole profits thereof
(which will be conſiderable) be alſo converted to His Majeſties
Revenue for defraying the publique charge of his Kingdom,
in caſe His Majeſty and Parliament ſhall think fit to erect either
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97447:4"/>
of theſe following kind of Bankes, for the accommodation of
Trade, in the moſt proper places of <hi>England;</hi> aſſigning to each
a proportionable diviſion of the Countrey adjoyning, where all
mens Eſtates in lands, houſes or rents, either for Leaſe of years,
Lives or in Fee,<note place="margin">This may be done, ſo as all fraudulent Conveyances may be pretended, and yet no mans Eſtate be diſcovered more than at preſent: For if the propriety be found to be in <hi>A</hi> by the Regiſter, its no matter though <hi>B</hi> be the true proprietor, for then <hi>A</hi> can wrong none but <hi>B,</hi> who hath intruſted him; or if <hi>B</hi> be doubtful to truſt <hi>A,</hi> and yet deſire to conceal his Eſtate, which he cannot well do without him, <hi>B</hi> himſelf may own the Eſtate, and allow <hi>A</hi> to enter a Morgage to (or near) the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and take his defeizance for the ſame: ſo that in this caſe <hi>A</hi> cannot cheat <hi>B</hi> if he would, nor either of them any other, though both ſhould combine therein.</note> may be regiſtred; as alſo all morgages, claims
or other intereſts pretended thereunto, with morgages or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes
at any time to be made thereupon.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid places for Bankes being eſtabliſhed, Eſtates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred,
and a Survey taken of ſuch Eſtates, whereby the value
may not be entred above its real worth. Any perſons may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to have credit in Banke, for any ſumme ſafely to be lent
under the value of his Eſtate, without other ſecurity or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Conveyances,<note place="margin">This Survey may be taken by a Jury in every Pariſh, and delivered to the Sheriff of the County, or at the Banke upon Oath, and will be done with a ſmall charge to His Majeſty, and in little time.</note> than the hand and conſent of ſuch perſon
as is the proprietor, he paying Intereſt for the ſame at 4. <hi>per
cent. per ann.</hi> quarterly into the ſaid Office.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, to effect the end aforeſaid, it may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
money, by a Law enjoyning all payments to be made in
Banke of any ſumme above 20<hi>l.</hi> ſterling, for all lands, goods
and merchandizes ſold whatſoever, which is done voluntary in
other parts, where Bankes are erected by almoſt all perſons, who
find both eaſe and accommodation thereby, and the Bankes here
(like thoſe in forreign parts) will be and ſerve as a general or
National Caſhkeeper of all mens moneys and accounts, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
them from one perſon and Countrey to another with
much facility, not onely preventing the danger of Robbery, but
the trouble of counting, and loſs in receiving clipt and bad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which is the cauſe that payments made in Banke are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
eſteemed better than <hi>in specie</hi> by ten ſhillings in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97447:5"/>
pound;<note place="margin">At firſt erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bankes in Holland, all local payments were enjoyned to be made in this manner, but the eaſe and accommodation being found thereby, it became a moſt voluntary act, as it doth at this day continue, to the great enriching that Countrey.</note> which would have the like eſteem in <hi>England,</hi>
were Bankes once erected.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Expedient is, without any Impoſition, leaving
all perſons free to take or make payment, either in Banke, or by
money <hi>in specie;</hi> which will, I preſume, bring in the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to His Majeſties Revenue; but not properly be erected
without two millions of money; but if once ſetled would out of
the ſame produce a million <hi>per annum</hi> profit, and ſtand alwayes
as a conſtant increaſing Revenue: For, by computation there is
yearly paid in <hi>England</hi> for Intereſt Bortomree, and other kinds
of Uſury, two millions; for which ſhould all Uſurers call in
their principal, it would amount unto thirty five millions;
when there hath been but twenty two millions coyned in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in and ſince the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both in
Gold and Silver, which, I preſume, is at leaſt one half exported,
whorded up, or melted down; and allowing the Uſurous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
to be the moyetie in all Coyn paſſing from one hand to
another, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that all the ſaid great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
is brought into them by five millions and an, half real ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
money; which is no Paradox, conſidering that all monies,
though paſſing but through the hands of Uſurers, doth yield to
each of them the full yearly Intereſt; which may by done for
one and the ſame ſumme of monies ten times in twelve mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths;
moreover by the money brought into Banke,<note place="margin">The two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions herein mentioned, is intended for the payment of all ſuch as deſire their money out of Banke, for its preſum'd ſuch there will be, and ſuch a Banke as this muſt have money alwayes ready; for the being punctual in payment will ſo creditifie Banke, that moſt will keep their Caſh therein for their own advantage.</note> (which
under the ſetled Government of ſo hopeful a Prince will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
moſt that ſhall be imployed in Trade) why may not
His Majeſty make a profit thereof as well as the States of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which doth let out the ſame at Intereſt, as they have done
great ſummes in <hi>England,</hi> and yet ſupport a much greater Bank
without Land upon their credits onely, it being generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that they have not at any time in ready Caſh the tenth
part of what the Banke ſtands Debtor for to private perſons,
although they abound in money for want of Land to purchaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97447:5"/>
The third is ſuch a Bank as may conveniently be erected both
of money and credit with a leſs ſumme, ſetting Intereſt at ſuch
differing rates, as in time may invite all men to eſteem credit as
good as money, which is accounted better in forreign parts, as
in truth it is, though ſeemingly otherwiſe; which diſparity will
be at all times reconciled by an Exchange or kind of Broker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
like that of Plate and Black-money, where currant; which
ſeveral kinds of Bankes having no Preſident, I ſhall not preſume
to prefer either as moſt proper,<note place="margin">In this way the Banke will not be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced for want of money, but be ſupplied with Bills, which may be a Sovereign ſtamp be allowed to paſs in a City or County inſtead of money, and be returned within a year, ſo that by ſetting a lower Intereſt thereon, will cauſe it to be equal in eſteem with real money.</note> but ſubmit them all with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that the worſt of them will prove of great uſe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to <hi>England,</hi> if once erected.</p>
            <p>That all Merchants that have no Eſtates real in Lands or Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
as aforeſaid, may alſo have credit in Banke, upon depoſiting
any Goods (not periſhable) of an equivalent value in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Ware-houſe, in every Port or other place where ſuch Bank
ſhall be erected; and that any perſon having monies in Caſh or
in Bank in one place, deſiring to have it transferred for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
and to have it again either in Caſh or in Banke
in another, may be accommodated, allowing onely 10<hi>s.</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

               <head>Other neceſſary heads to be conſidered for the encreaſe of Trade,
and encouragement of Navigation.</head>
               <p>I preſume, none will deny but that Trade ought to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as well with reſpect had to publick as private intereſt; and
therefore, I hope I ſhall be held excuſed for my Opinion, in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Forraigners ought to have the like priviledges with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
both Trading in Engliſh ſhipping, which I conceive to
be the beſt Expedient to make Exports of <hi>England,</hi> exceed
the Imports, without which this Kingdom cannot be richer then
it is, and ſince every particular will in ſome meaſure be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
within the general good of Trade, I ſhall preſume to
hint how far, (and with what reſtraint) it ought to be encouraged.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97447:7"/>
Firſt, for Exportation of our native Commodities, ſuch as
Lead, Tin, Wax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of little or no workmanſhip; <hi>England</hi>
cannot be too liberal in, nor grant too many immunities and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
(though to her very Enemies) that may encourage the
ſending out of all Manufactures perfectly wrought up and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricated:
regard being had to Wools, Timber and Leather,
which in no reſpects ought to be Exported.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for Importing of forraign Goods, ſuch as Linnen,
Sugars, Raw-ſilk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we ſtand in need of. It ought not
neither to be diſcouraged by Impoſitions, though otherwiſe it
be proper, to lay convenient duties on ſuch Commodities Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
as obſtruct the ſale of our own Manufactures; whereby
to hold a Ballance in Trade without prohibiting forraign Goods,
which if we once do, other Nations will do the like by us; and
ſo obſtruct our Trade in General.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for Tranſportation of ſuch forraign Commodities, as
are firſt Imported, (if done in Engliſh ſhipping) it will prove a
great help to the over-Ballance of Trade, and therefore ought
to have the like due encouragement with a reaſonable reſpect
ſhewn to forraign Veſſels, though not equal to our own.</p>
               <p>In all which three reſpects, <hi>England</hi> might have advantage
of all the World, and by induſtry (under good Lawes) ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Mart of <hi>Europe,</hi> by reaſon of its ſcituation ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Sea; the ſafeneſs of her harbours and ſuperfluities of
ſundry Commodities which other Nations ſtand in need of,
which would be the ſooner effected, were theſe ten particulars
obſerved, there being many others alſo worthy, which I omit at
preſent.</p>
               <p>1. By Impoſing all duties to be paid alike, upon all Goods,
by all perſons, the difference to be only upon Commodities
Imported or Exported in forraign Bottoms, <hi>(viz.)</hi> ſhips not built
in <hi>England,</hi> and failed by Engliſh Marriners.</p>
               <p>2. By permitting all people of forraign Nations to Live, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
and Trade freely amongſt us, whereby moſt of them will
ſoon become profitable Natives, and beſtow their wealth brought
hither or here gotten, in Lands for their poſterity; which the
preſent Lawes of <hi>England</hi> compels them to Export, to the great
inriching of forraign parts, and impoveriſhing of this Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97447:8"/>
3. By uſing all waies of encouragement to advance the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
imployment, and His Majeſties aſſuming His Prerogative of
being Lord of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Ocean, which by the moſt ancient
preſcription ever belonged as Rightly due to the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
ſo that by prohibiting others to Fiſh on our Coaſt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the ſame to this Nation, it will ſoon become of more
worth to <hi>England,</hi> then the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> are to the Kingdom of
<hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. By encouraging new Manufactures and profitable inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with due rewards and priviledges, which will bring artificers
from forraign parts, and in time (by induſtry) make all Arts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
amongſt us; wherein we come much ſhort of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
to the diſadvantage of our own.</p>
               <p>5. By erecting a ſtanding Committee of Trade, whoſe corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencie
ſhould reach over all Trading parts of the World; the
effect whereof will not only inable them the better to contain
the improvement of Trade here: but alſo to prevent many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
that have late fallen on <hi>England</hi> by the undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
actings of forraign Nations, who have robbed us both of
our Money and Trade, for want of a timely remedy.</p>
               <p>6. By Con<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ituting a Court of Merchants, where all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and Merchant-like cauſes and differences may be Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
decided.</p>
               <p>7. By uſing meanes to encreaſe the general ſtock of <hi>England,</hi>
either in raiſing the value of money for incouraging it to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
(which I will not much commend) but rather do incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the ſupplying it imaginary upon the Credit of Lands, to
paſſe in payment by aſſignment in Bank as aforeſaid, one of
which is abſolutely neceſſary in order to the increaſe of Trade in
this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>8. By taking way Exciſe from all Imported Goods, or at leaſt
forthwith to produce the ſame under the management of the
cuſtoms whereby to take off the ſuperfluous number of offences,)
it being but a ſmall advance to the revenue, and an intollerable
bur<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen on Trade, in the way its now managed.</p>
               <p>9. By lightning the duty of cuſtoms, eſpecially on Goods
Exported and Manufactured here in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo regulating
the Book of Rates made for payment thereof; that in few or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97447:8"/>
no particulars the Rates exceed what is paid for the like Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modities
in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. By granting a free Tranſportation of forraign Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
with little or no cuſtoms detained for the ſame, whereby
Goods here Imported may go out without being loaded with
impoſitions, and find a market in forraign parts to the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
which will make <hi>England</hi> the Magazen or ſtore-houſe
of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Each of theſe ten particulars deſerves to be more amply ſet
forth, but I have been ſhort in this as in the former, ſubmititing
it alſo to the ingenious Reader to Paraphraſe thereon, taking
only to ſet forth how much the putting them in uſe will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Revenue.</p>
               <p>There being nothing in this whole diſcourſe that reflects on
the Revenue, but the taking away Exciſe from forraign Goods
uſually amounting to 175000l. <hi>per annum,</hi> and the granting a free
Tranſportation thereof, 19000l. <hi>per annum,</hi> which is in all
194000l. <hi>per annum,</hi> which doth coſt in managing 35000l. <hi>per
annum,</hi> ſo the real decreaſe is but 159000l. yearly, which I am
bold to affirm puts the whole Nation to as much Charge, by the
trouble and other inconveniences of keeping a greater number
of ſervants to attend the ſeveral Offices; the fetching of Tickets,
and the interruption of the (too many) Exciſe Officers in the
improper manner its now collected, which ſumme ſo expended
would be otherwiſe imployed in Trade; and His Majeſty, I
preſume, might have as much advantage by a reaſonable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
out of the returns made thereof, which would be then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
paid, for that none will hazard their Goods, but all make
due entries; ſo that the continuing thoſe Duties fills the Cheſts
in the Exchequer, as water doth a veſſel, being poured in at
the Specket whilſt it runs out at the Bung.</p>
