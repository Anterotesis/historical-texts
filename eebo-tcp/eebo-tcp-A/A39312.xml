            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere came lately to my Hand a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Book, bearing the Title of, <hi>A Friendly Conference, &amp;c.</hi> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving turned over, I found the Drift and <hi>Design</hi> of it was to <hi>infame</hi> the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> by representing their Principles absurd and heterodox, <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stating</hi> some, and with sophistical Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>perverting</hi> and opposing others. This, when I had observed, I held my self concerned to vindicate those Truths which we believe and make Profession of, from the Absurdities and Errors which the Author of that Book partly through <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> but principally through <hi>Envy,</hi> hath endeavoured to fasten on them. This
<pb facs="tcp:98068:3"/>
is the Occasion and Subject of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Discourse, which I recommend to thy serious and impartial Perusal.</p>
            <p>Who the Author of the <hi>Conference</hi> was I did not know, when I wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to it, he not having so much Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> his Name to his Book. But after the Answer had a good part passed the Press, I received In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation concerning the <hi>concealed</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, both Who and What he is, his Name, Place. &amp;c. which I forbear at pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ent to publish, in Expectation that he himself should do it in his next. If he persist a <hi>lurking</hi> Adversary, let him n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t think much, if (after so fair a Warning) I give the World his Name with such an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> as his <hi>unmanly</hi> Dealing with us deserves. He writes himself, <hi>A Lover of the Truth.</hi> But seeing Truth seeks no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, what should induce him to <hi>conceal his Name</hi>! If he indeed believed that to be Truth, which he undertook to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he needed not to have been either

               <hi>afraid</hi> or <hi>ashamed</hi> to have openly avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched it. Although I do not think men strictly tyed, in all Cases, to affix their Names to whatsoever they write: yet in Matters of <hi>Controversie,</hi> especially wherein one man shall <hi>accuse</hi> or charge another Man or People, I conceive the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, in point of Honesty, obliged to give h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But leaving the Author for this time, to <hi>hug himself</hi> in the dark, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> in his own <hi>Obscurity,</hi> I shall offer two or three short hints, relating to the Book it self.</p>

               <hi>1.</hi> Some of the more minute and less material Passages in the Conference, I have purposely omitted, that I might have

more scope (without swelling this Book into too great a Bulk) more largely to insist on, and freely handle those things which are indeed of greater Weight and Moment.</p>

               <hi>2.</hi> In those Cases wherein I have had occasion to use the Testimonies of Ancient Authors, I have been necessitated, for want of some of the Books themselves (which in the Country I knew not how to procure) to take some few Quotations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trust from others; yet not without great Caution in the Choice of those Quotations: for I assure thee, Reader, I would rather choose to lay them all wholely aside, then knowingly to obtrude one wrong one upon thee.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> The first Chapter may peradventure seem not so much defensive as offensive, relating more particularly to that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, whereof my Opponent professes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Member.

            <head>CHAPTER I. Of the present Ministry: The Cause of the Peoples not profiting inquired: Some Reasons of it given.</head>
            <p>THE Nameless Author of the ill-named <hi>Friendly Conference,</hi> to lay a Foundation for his Discourse, causes his Parishioner to report, that <hi>At a</hi> Quakers <hi>Meeting, a notable Speaker propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this to the Consciences of the Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ers, Whether any among them could affirm, that he had received any Spiritual Advantage by his long frequenting of the Steeple-houses</hi>?</p>
            <p>Whether this Question was ever really thus proposed in any of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is not my present Business to inquire. But seeing it is now propounded after such a manner, and that by one who terms himself a <hi>Minister,</hi> I cannot but desire every one, who shall read it either in his Book or this, to consider very seriously of it; and if they be such as st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98068:6"/>
for it is indeed of great Concernment to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if</hi> (sayes he) <hi>after Inquiry, he found he had received no Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fit by it, he bad him further propound this Query to himself, Why am I thus? For if God had any regard to the Priests, or their Worship, he would not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give a Blessing to their Wayes, &amp;c.</hi> Thus far the <hi>Parishioner,</hi> to which the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi> replies, That <hi>the Goodness or Badness of the Ministry is not to be measured by the Want <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>f a sensible Effect upon the Hearts of indisposed and careless Hearers, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> The Question is not concerning <hi>indisposed and careless Hearers,</hi> but in general Terms, Whether <hi>any</hi> among them, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially consulting his own Conscience, could affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>m, that he had received any Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Advantage by his long frequenting of the Steeple houses; so that, in drawing it from <hi>any,</hi> to <hi>indispos'd and careless</hi> Hearers <hi>only,</hi> he rather avoids then answers the Question; which is so much the greater Fault in him, inasmuch as both Question and Answer were of his own framing.</p>
            <p>This however is observable, that we have here an implicit Acknowledgment of the <hi>Peoples not profiting under the present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi>

We read of some in former times, who (though they did probably take as much pains as any of these men now adayes do, yet) did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the People at all; and the Reason thereof is also given.

the Lord,</hi> vers. 32. Here the very Ground and Reason why that Ministry did not profit, nay, why it was rendred uncapable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting the People at all, is most plainly given by God himself, viz. <hi>He sent them not, nor commanded them</hi>: They used their Tongues, and said he saith, when the Lord had <hi>not</hi> spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them: They stole his Word every one from his Neighbour: They ministred not from <hi>that</hi> Word which <hi>Moses</hi> long before, and <hi>Paul</hi> long since declared to be <hi>in the Mouth and in the Heart</hi>;<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Now let us see how the Case stands with the Ministers of <hi>England</hi>; Hath God sent them, or do they <hi>send one another</hi>?

What he means by Divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he has not exprest; but that which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally urged as the Divine Institution, is the Words of Christ to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,<note place="margin">

the Promise of the Father, <hi>nor</hi> is indued with Power from on high, is <hi>not agreeable</hi> to this Divine Institution, and consequently not the Good Ministry.

               <hi>all Duty,</hi> &amp;c. but on the contrary, by plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Necessity of Continuing in Sin, makes such a Performance of all Duty to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impossible: And this is another grand Reason, why the People are not profited by their Ministry, <hi>the Fault whereof is in the Ministers.</hi>

When they first come into this School, their Confession is but Miserable Sinners: and most they be saying the same Lesson so long as they continue in the School? What! no Proficiency, no Improvement, no going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward! Surely it is not so in the School of Christ. But in this School he that comes in at Sixteen Years of Age, does but confess himself a Miserable Sinner, and the same Man, if he live till Sixty or more, confesses himself a Miserable Sinner still. So that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has travailed Forty or Fifty Years up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Road, after he has spent his Age in this School, if he be measured by his own Confession, he is not one step nearer his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's end, he is <hi>no whit bitter</hi> then when he first came in, and therefore worse.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I have insisted the larger upon this Instance to shew the Reader, That <hi>Iob,</hi> in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent part of his Life (before this unparalel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Tryal fell upon him) had indeed <hi>attain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and had passed through the Refiner's Fire</hi>?</p>
            <p>Now having proved this State attainable, by shewing that <hi>it was attained,</hi> the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie is determined; for the Question was not, whether it was possible for a man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving attained this State, to <hi>continue alwayes</hi> in it, but whether it is possible for him ever to attain it, grant this, and the other will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: If it be possible to <hi>attain it,</hi> it cannot be impossible to <hi>retain it.</hi> The same divine Power that <hi>brings man to it,</hi> is equally able to <hi>preserve him in it.</hi> If it be possible for a man to be preserved in this State an <hi>Hour,</hi> it is not <hi>impossible</hi> to be preserved a <hi>Day</hi>; if a <hi>Day,</hi> a <hi>Year</hi>; if a <hi>Year,</hi> an <hi>Age.</hi> But when I say it is <hi>possible to be kept</hi> in this State; I do not say it is <hi>impossible to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>His next and last Instance is of <hi>David,</hi> a man after God's own Heart; against him he objects, that <hi>he fell into the heinous Sins of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery and Murder,</hi> page 36.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To be a man after God's own Heart is to be just as God would have him to be; but <hi>was</hi> David <hi>a man after God's own Heart while guilty of Adultery and Murder</hi>? none I hope will so affirm; for Adultery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are Sins, and <hi>all Sin is utterly contrary to the Heart and Nature of God</hi>: Now then, if <hi>David</hi> was <hi>not</hi> a man after God's own Heart (i. e. not such an one as God would have him to be) <hi>while</hi> he was guilty of Sin, I thence infer that <hi>when</hi> David <hi>was a man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus have I endeavoured to <hi>vindicate the Lives</hi> of these good and godly men, from the <hi>false Suggestions</hi> of their and my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, wherewith he essayes to <hi>distain their Glory,</hi> by representing them <hi>Sinners all their

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If then after his Sense we read the former verse thus, <hi>Let us therefore as many as be</hi> SINCERE <hi>be thus minded,</hi> we must by the same Reason read the latter thus, <hi>Not as though I had already attained, or were already</hi> SINCERE; which were to make the Apostle charge himself with <hi>Hypocrisie</hi>; but to avoid this Absurdity, he would have it read <hi>perfect</hi> in the 12<hi>th.</hi> verse, and <hi>sincere</hi> in the 15<hi>th,</hi> although the <hi>Greek</hi> Word be <hi>the same in both,</hi> and to give some Colour to it, he inserts the 11<hi>th.</hi> verse. <hi>If by any means I might attain to the Resurrection of the dead,</hi> then follows, <hi>Not as though I had attained, either were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfect; intimating</hi> (saith the Priest) <hi>that he could not be</hi>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98068:41"/>
Resurrection implies a Death foregoing: This therefore cannot be the Resurrection by <hi>Paul</hi> here intended, but there is another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection mentioned in Scripture, by the Name of the <hi>first</hi> Resurrection (<hi>Blessed and holy is he that hath Part in the first Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, on such the second Death hath no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> &amp;c Rev. 20.6.)

            <p>The Priest being thus <hi>out</hi> in his Notion of the Resurrection, his interpretation of the Text (which he grounded upon this Notion) is not to be admitted; for he hath not offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any substantial Reason, why <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>ament any one place where it is so rendred, but for <hi>perfect</hi> it is generally used.</p>
            <p>The next Scripture he undertaks to open, is 1 John 5.18. <hi>We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not</hi> (thus far only he goes omitting the rest of the verse, which is thus,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98068:41"/>
               <hi>But he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that Wicked one toucheth him not.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23.</note> 
               <hi>and come short of the Glory of God,</hi> but this man who hath sinned coming now to be <hi>born of God,</hi> to be a <hi>new Creature,</hi> to have <hi>Christ formed in him,</hi> he now by the Power which he receives from Christ, <hi>keeps himself, and that Wicked one toucheth him not. Ye are kept by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, through Faith unto Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 1.5.</p>
            <p>The next Scripture is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98068:42"/>
can say I have made my Heart clean, I am pure from my Sin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No man can say in Truth, he <hi>himself</hi> hath made his own Heart clean; but he whose Heart God hath cleansed, can say, and that in Truth, <hi>God hath made his Heart clean.</hi> The latter Part of this verse depends upon the former: No man can say, I am pure from my Sin, by having <hi>my self</hi> cleansed my own Heart; but he whose <hi>Heart is purified,</hi> whose <hi>Iniquity is taken away,</hi> and his <hi>sin pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> by the Lord, he can say, in an humble acknowledgement, and to the Glory of him who purged him, <hi>The Lord hath purged me from my sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Scripture that he brings is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. which hath not the least Tendency to prove that man cannot be <hi>set free from sin in this Life,</hi> but that, <hi>if the Righteous man turnes from his Righteousness, and committeth Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity again</hi> (which implies there was a time when he did not commit Iniquity) that then <hi>his former Righteousness shall not avail him, but in his sin he shall dye,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Another is <hi>Iob</hi> 9.20. <hi>If I justifie my self, my own Mouth shall condemn me; If I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Self-Justification, and whatsoever
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98068:42"/>
is grounded thereupon, is indeed condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but the Justification which comes from God is not so: <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the Charge of God's Elect? It is God that justifies, who is he that condemns? Iob</hi> doth not here deny Perfection, but sheweth, that however it was with him, or how high soever his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments were, he would not take upon him to contend with his Maker, or <hi>justifie himself</hi> against the Almighty, but <hi>submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> unto him, and therefore he saith in the 15<hi>th</hi> verse, <hi>Whom, though I were Righteous</hi> (which all I suppose will grant he was) <hi>yet would I not answer, but I would make sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to my Iudge,</hi> yet to shew that he did not this from any <hi>Guilt of sin</hi> that lay upon him, he appeals to God himself <hi>Thou knowest</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I am not Wicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 10.7.</note> &amp; <hi>yet</hi> for all that, <hi>there is none can deliver me out of thy Hand</hi>; but though he thus expresseth himself in <hi>Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the Hand and good Pleasure of the Lord (whose <hi>Power and Soveraignity</hi> he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth) yet against the <hi>false Suggestions</hi> of his seeming Friends (who, <hi>like this Priest,</hi> would fain have fastned some <hi>Iniquity</hi> upon him) he vindicates his Innocen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy plainly and smartly.<note place="margin">chap. 27.5, 6</note>

dye</hi> (saith he) <hi>I will not remove my Integrity from me, my Righteousness I hold fast and will not let it go; my Heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</hi> And it is observable, that those three men who [<hi>like this Priest</hi>] had charged <hi>Sin</hi> upon <hi>Iob,</hi> were fain to <hi>offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and intreat</hi> Job<hi>'s Prayers</hi> on their behalf, to appease the <hi>Wrath</hi> of the Lord, which they had <hi>kindled</hi> against themselves, <hi>chap</hi> 42.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>He urges also <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. But that being the same with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. is explained before.</p>
            <p>Another that he brings is, <hi>Iames</hi> 3.2. <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This does not prove that the Apostle himself was an Offender, any more then that other saying of his concerning the Tongue, vers. 9. <hi>Therewith Bless we God, and therewith Curse we Men,</hi> can prove that the Apostle himself was a Curser, which I do not helieve this Priest, <hi>as forward as he is to sully the Saints</hi> will dare to affirm of the Apostle <hi>Iames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the Scriptures he hath quoted, to prove that St <hi>Iohn</hi> (in those words, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is born of God sinneth not</hi>) did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that any in this Life hath gotten an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Conquest over all Sin. But, in the respective Answer thereunto, I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Apostle may very well be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98068:43"/>
in this without the least Contradiction to any of these Scriptures, none of which plead for a Continuation of Sin, or deny a Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being perfectly freed from Sin.</p>
            <p>His 2d Reason, why those words of <hi>Iohn</hi> cannot be interpreted to signifie, that any in this Life hath gotten an absolute Conquest over all Sin is, <hi>because he would then contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himself also, having plainly said,</hi> 1 John 1.8. <hi>If we say we have no Sin, we deceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us,</hi> pag. 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> From the last Instance in the words of <hi>Iames,</hi> it is evident that the Apostles, in Condescension to those to whom they writ, did many times include themselves as in the Condition of others, that so they to whom they writ, might receive Exhortation the better. And thus did <hi>Iohn</hi> in this place, He, as well as <hi>Paul,</hi> writ of the several States and Conditions Growths and Degrees in the Church of God, in which no doubt there were some, who could not at that time truly say, <hi>they had no sin.</hi> To these he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descends, with these he includes himself. And as <hi>Paul</hi> in one place said, <hi>I speak after the manner of men, because of the Infirmity of your Flesh,</hi> Rom. 6.19. And in another place, <hi>To the Weak became I as weak, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98068:44"/>
I might gain the Weak,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.22. the same may be said in this place of John, who, for their sakes, including himself with them, did, in his own Person joyntly with theirs, speak of that State which some of them were then in, and which himself also had once been in, as well as they. But from this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension of his, to infer, that he himself was at that time, really and actually in that State, is neither fair nor true, for though some among them might not have attained so far, yet he himself had doubtless felt the Blood of Jesus Christ cleansing him from all sin, else could he not experimentally have said,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7.</note> 
               <hi>If we confess our Sins, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and just to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanse us from all Vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 9.</note> But if he did really and truly know, that the Blood of Jesus Christ had cleansed him from <hi>all Sin,</hi> from <hi>all Vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:</hi> Surely then he might at that time, without deceiving himself, have said he had no sin. He writes to Little Children,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.12, 21.</note> to Young Men, to Fathers; He tells the little Children, <hi>their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98068:44"/>
Sins were forgiven</hi>; yea, and that <hi>they knew the Truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.32.</note> which our Saviour told the <hi>Iews</hi> should <hi>make them free.</hi> But he tells the Young Men,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>they are strong, and the Word of God abideth in them, and they have overcome the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one</hi> (Is not that a Conquest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sin?<note place="margin">Vers. 28.</note>) He exhorts the Little Children, <hi>to abide in Christ; for whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not</hi>;<note place="margin">Chap. 3.6.</note> and <hi>we are in him,</hi> saith the Apostle himself; and <hi>he that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 2.6.</note> 
               <hi>ought also to walk even as he walked.</hi> Doth he tell them, they ought to do that which is <hi>impossible</hi>? or had not Christ an <hi>absolute Conquest</hi> over <hi>all</hi> Sin? <hi>We know</hi> (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) <hi>that whosoever is born of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 5.18.</note> 
               <hi>sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God, keeps himself that the Wicked One toucheth him not.</hi> If he be so kept, that the Wicked One (which is the Devil) touches him not, how can he sin? <hi>Doth any sin but whom the Devil touches?</hi> So long as any are kept <hi>out of the Devil's Reach,</hi> so long I hope he'l grant they <hi>may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98068:45"/>
Sin,</hi> These Young Men then, who had so <hi>overcome the Wicked One</hi> (the Devil) that he could <hi>not touch them,</hi> had not these gotten an <hi>absolute Conquest</hi> over <hi>all sin</hi>? Now if such was the state of the Young Men, what had the Fathers and Elders arrived to! <hi>These things</hi> (sayes John) <hi>I write unto you, my Little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> (not to countenance your <hi>continuance</hi> in sin, not to beget a Belief in you, that it is <hi>impossible</hi> for you to live without Sin; To what End then?) <hi>that ye sin not. And if any man sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>we have an Advocate, &amp;c. If any man sin</hi>! why, is it come to that?

Yes, yes, (saith this holy Apostle) if he abide in Christ; for <hi>he that abideth in Christ, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 3.6.</note> And in this he is not contradictory to himself; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the whole <hi>stream</hi> of his Epistle runs in this <hi>Channel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it seems strange to the Priest, that <hi>our Lord should teach his Disciples to pray as often for the Forgiveness of their sins, as for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98068:45"/>
their daily Bread, whilst we must suppose</hi> (says he) <hi>that when they so prayed, they had no Trespasses to forgive,</hi> pag. 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This will not seem so strange, if it be considered, that when our Lord taught his Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.4.</note> was <hi>weak,</hi> and sometimes almost ready to <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but we tell them, they have an Enemy; we tell them where this Enemy lurks, and how he works, We tell them,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.13.</note> this Enemy may be overcome, and also how.

            <p>But if <hi>Adam</hi> had fallen from a Covenant of Works to a Covenant of Grace, what had his <hi>Loss</hi> been? what had he suffered?

being forbidden by Christ, all Oaths are now unlawful, and therefore the Use of any Oaths must needs provoke the Displeasure of God against that Nation where they are used. This being the Subject of his Book, he did very a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

H.'s Book it is thus, <hi>And</hi> (as saith the Prophet) <hi>Every one that sweareth shall be cut off</hi> but this Parenthesis (as saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) the Priest leaves out, which was not fairly done of him; for it shews the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of R. H. to be only to allude to the words of the Prophet, as if he had said, as the Prophet saith in another Case, so say I in this; he said, every one that swears falsly shall be cut off, because it was <hi>unlawful to swear falsly then:</hi> I say every one that swears at all shall be cut off because it is <hi>unlawful to swear at all now</hi>; it was therefore <hi>ignorantly</hi> at least, if not <hi>malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> done of the Priest to infinuate that R.H.

brought these Scriptures to prove that all Oaths were as unlawful then as now; for himself confesseth that R. H. doth yield that some Oaths were lawful then.</p>
            <p>Besides, what Reason had he to say of those Scriptures, <hi>These are his Proofs</hi>? what doth he mean they were Proofs of? He himself in his own Book hath set at the Foot of his Title-page this Scripture, 2 Thes. 2.11. <hi>For this cause God shall send them strong Delusion, that they should believe a Lye.</hi> Did he intend this for a Proof? of what I would know? Is it to prove his Book a Conference between a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and a Parishioner of his? Is it to prove his Parishioner was inclining to <hi>Quakerism</hi>? Is it to prove that the absurd Opinions of that Sect are detected, and exposed to a just Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? (This is the sume of his Title) or is it to prove, that <hi>they who credit what he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>an say in defence of Swearing.</p>

               </gap>ll manner of Oaths, he takes upon him to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98068:59"/>
prove, and saith he will do it in this order</p>
            <p>First, <hi>By proving an Oath an Act of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion towards God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>An Act of necessary Iustice, and Charity towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That it is therefore a Part of that Moral and Eternal Law, which our Saviour professeth he came not to destroy, but to fulfil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That we find it practised in the new Testament,</hi> page 5.6.</p>
            <p>His first Proposition (viz.) <hi>That an Oath is an Act of natural Religion towards God,</hi> I deny.</p>
            <p>He offers to prove it by <hi>Reason, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Reason thus, <hi>That whereby we glorifie God, and adore his Attributes, is an Act of Religion; but by an Oath (rightly taken) we glorifie God, and adore his Attributes, therefore such an Oath is an Act of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The first Part of this Argument doth not reach the Proposition, he undertook to prove, namely, <hi>That an Oath is an Act of natural Religion</hi>; for in his Argument he drops the Word [<hi>Natural</hi>] and makes no mention of it, neither doth he in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Argument infer that an Oath is an Act of <hi>Natural</hi> Religion, but barely thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Consider now, I pray, <hi>What Act of Natural Religion is that,</hi> which, the <hi>more truly-Christian</hi> men become, the <hi>less need</hi> they have of it!

For if it were an Act of <hi>Natural</hi> Religion, an <hi>Increase of Truth</hi> in men would not render it <hi>needless</hi>; if it were a part of the <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Law, an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Truth</hi> in men would be so far from making it <hi>needless,</hi> that it would rather <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,</hi> strengthen and <hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ. First,</hi> The Ends of Justice and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are not served by the Use of an <hi>Oath,</hi> but by the Use of Truth, and Sincerity in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The abolishing of an Oath would not degenerate. Nay, I add, <hi>the continuing of Oaths doth derogate from the Honour of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</hi> The Honour of Christianity is, that it out-strips and <hi>excells</hi> all other Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Religion whatsoever: It is no Honour to Christianity to stand but upon <hi>equall</hi> terms with any other Religion, whether Heathenish or Jewish; but it mounts far above them all, and leads them that sincerely embrace it, to a Perfection beyond whatever was attainable in any of them, yet in them Oaths were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable: It is no Derogation to the Honour of Christianity that it hath made its Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents so Upright, just and true, <hi>that they dare not speak a Falshood,</hi> though others dare swear it. Is it any Derogation from the Honour of Religion, that the Professors of it are <hi>men of Credit,</hi> worthy to be believed (and if he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to be such, there is then (he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, page 61.) <hi>No Need at all of an Oath</hi>) <hi>The primitive Christians</hi> (saith Bp. <hi>Gauden</hi>) <hi>did so keep up the Sanctity and Credit of their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among Vnbelievers,</hi>

sum, <hi>I am a Christian. If any urged them further to any Oath, for matter, or manner, or Authority unlawful, they repeated this, as the</hi> ONLY <hi>Satisfaction they could give: There needed no more then the Veracity of their BARE WORD.</hi> But was this a Dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the Honour of Christianity?

               <note place="margin">page 22</note> 
               <hi>but such an Authentick Veracity, and Iust Credulity on all Sides, as might WELL spare even the MOST TRVE, sincere and lawful Oaths, keeping on all Sides as great a Distance from Lying, as from false Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>: The abolishing then of Oaths would no way derogate from the Honour of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the continuing of Oaths doth greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the Honour of Christianity.</hi> Why are Oaths continued? Because (saith m Opponent) <hi>there is not that Truth in Men that can make their bare Testimony of sufficient Credit</hi> (for if there were, he confesseth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98068:71"/>
there would be <hi>no need at all of an Oath</hi>) What can more derogate from the Honour of Christianity, then that its Followers should be so <hi>devoid of Truth,</hi> as not to deserve Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit? Again, Why are Oaths continued? Because (saith my Opponent) <hi>all men are Lyars, Mankind is generally leavened with Hypocrisie and Fear, Favour, Malice or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest sway with the far greater Part of Men.</hi> If his far greater Part of Men are such, as have no Relation to Christianity, his Instance then relates not to the matter, but if they are such, as by profession thereof, have Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereunto, <hi>How great a Derogation is this from the Honour of Christianity</hi>? Doth it not pluck down Christianity from its Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent Sphere, and debase it to an Equality with Heathenism: The most Barbarous Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then could be believed with an Oath; and canst not thou (<hi>a strong grown Christian, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thy Religion seated in the Rational Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> page 5.) be believed without an Oath: What then art thou better (in this respect) then the misbelieving Heathen? or how art thou in this Case an Honour to thy Religion, more then that Miscreant is to his? Let none therefore imagine, that the abolishing of oaths doth any way derogate from the Honour
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98068:72"/>
of Christianity; but let all endeavour by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving virtuous, just and holy Lives, and by speaking the Truth upon all occasions Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sincerely, to leave no Cause nor Place for Oaths, and thereby will Christianity be adorned, and its Honour highly advanced.</p>
            <p>But saith he, <hi>While the Apostle saith, An Oath for Confirmation, is the End of Strife; if you take away an Oath, you take away that which by God is ordained to be the most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means of ending it,</hi> page 63.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He should rather have said <hi>was</hi> ordained, then <hi>is</hi> ordained, if he had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deal fairly; for it was to <hi>them of old time</hi> under the Law (which was a State of <hi>Weakness</hi> and <hi>Childhood,</hi> and so of <hi>Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Strife</hi>) that Oaths were appointed; but in the New Testament, which is the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Peace,</hi> there is no such ordination, there <hi>Oaths are taken away,</hi> not ordained. Now it was to that State of <hi>Weakness</hi> the Apostle refers, when he speaks of an <hi>Oath, Heb.</hi> 6. for he writes there to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who had been under the Law, which shews he had Reference to the State of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but in all his Epistles to the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there is no such thing to be found. Besides, he fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the occasion of his Discourse in that Place
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98068:72"/>
from the <hi>Old Time</hi> (wherein Swearing was allowed) shewing how God confirmed his Promise by an Oath to <hi>Abraham</hi> ver. 13.) and then addeth (ver. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>we do not war after the Flesh,</hi> so say I in this Case, <hi>Though Saints are men, yet they do not walk as men:</hi> The same which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle also intimates in his Reproof to some among the <hi>Corinthians, Whereas</hi> (saith he) <hi>there is among you Envying,</hi>

yet he does not say, Every High Priest [<hi>was</hi>] ordained, but in the present Tense [<hi>is</hi>] or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, &amp;c. So also, speaking of the outward Tabernacle,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.35.</note> 
               <hi>Moses</hi> had that Way, who was but a Servant (and <hi>the Servant abides not in the House forever</hi>) But Christ, who is the Son, hath a <hi>more excellent Way,</hi> by establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing Truth and Righteousness in the Earth. <hi>The Law</hi> (in which the Oaths were) <hi>was given by</hi> Moses,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Self-denyal</hi>; instead of <hi>Vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> he brings in <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> and the Work of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is (not <hi>Discord,</hi> but) <hi>Peace</hi>:<note place="margin">Isaiah 32 17.</note> Thus he is made both <hi>the Lord our Righteousness,</hi> and the <hi>Prince of Peace.</hi> And thus by setting up Truth and Sincerity in the Heart, he takes away the Ground of Oaths. For the <hi>Priest</hi> confesses, <hi>If there were that Truth in men, that their bare Testimony were of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Credit, then there were no need at all of an Oath,</hi> pag 61. Now, though I will not invert the Charge upon my Adversary (which without any Inj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>stice to him I might do) yet I will make bold to tell him, that <hi>He shews but little Respect to Christ,</hi> while he grounds the <hi>Need</hi> of an <hi>Oath</hi> upon <hi>Lying, Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> yet would make CHRIST to <hi>continue the Vse of it</hi> in his Church.</p>
            <p>He is now come to his third Proposition, viz. <hi>That an Oath is a Part of that Moral and Eternal Law, which our Saviour profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth he came not to destroy, but to fulfil,</hi> p. 56. And this he infers with a <hi>Therefore,</hi> that is, Because it is an Act of Natural Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98068:75"/>
God, and of necessary Justice and Charity towards men, <hi>Therefore it is a part of that Moral and Eternal Law, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If nothing more should be said to this, yet the two former Propositions, on which he builds this, being before overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this in course must fall to the Ground: Yet nevertheless, that he may not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sleighted, I will take notice what he says here also. He <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>stirs</hi> himself not a little to prove that which I never yet heard any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, namely, <hi>that all Oaths are not Evil in themselves,</hi> which he <hi>gravely</hi> infers from their having been once confessedly lawful, p. 63. What else is this, but to mis-spend his Time, and bestow many a <hi>doughty Blow</hi> upon his own Shadow? His Proposition required him to prove, that <hi>some Oaths are Good in themselves</hi>; and he comes so near it as to prove, that <hi>all Oaths are not Evil in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> What thinkst thou, Reader? has he not shewed his Ability? Some things are <hi>forbidden,</hi> because they are <hi>Evil</hi>; and some things are <hi>Evil,</hi> because they are <hi>forbidden</hi>: An <hi>Oath,</hi> we say, is therefore <hi>Evil,</hi> because <hi>forbidden.</hi> That which made it <hi>lawful</hi> to the <hi>Iew,</hi> was its being <hi>commanded</hi>; that which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98068:76"/>
makes it <hi>unlawful</hi> to the <hi>Christian,</hi> is its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>forbidden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has another far-fetch by which he would prove <hi>Oaths moral,</hi> and that is, <hi>because they are not Ceremonial.</hi> But how does he prove they are not Ceremonial? Thus: <hi>They were used</hi> (sayes he) <hi>by the Patriarchs before the</hi> Levitical <hi>Law was given, therefore not Ceremonial,</hi> pag<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 63.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed! Was nothing then Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, that was used by the Patriarchs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law was given? Surely he consulted his own Credit more in <hi>concealing his Name,</hi> then in thus undertaking to prove Oaths a part of the moral and eternal Law, because used by the Patriarchs before the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law was given. Can any thing be more naturally inferred, then that <hi>he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts whatsoever was used by the Patriarchs, before the</hi> Levitical <hi>Law was given, to be a part of the moral and eternal Law</hi>? And could he have found a more <hi>direct</hi> medium, to discover his own Ignorance! Was not <hi>Circumcision</hi> in the Flesh used by the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, before the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law was given? Will he thence conclude <hi>Circumcision</hi> to be a part of the moral and eternal Law? <hi>Why then
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98068:76"/>
is he not Circumcised himself?</hi> Were not Beasts <hi>sacrificed</hi> by the Patriarchs long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law was given? Will he thence conclude, that such <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are a part of the moral and eternal Law? Nay, does he not himself call those Sacrifices, <hi>Types and Figures</hi>? (pag. 50.) And are they not then <hi>ceremonial,</hi> notwithstanding they were used before the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law was given? But of this more anon.</p>
            <p>Here he makes a Digression to fall upon some others, who, it seems, have offended him, in what they have written concerning the Nature and Power of the divine Will. He names only <hi>Szydlovius</hi> the <hi>Dutch-man</hi> but hints at some others of our own Nation, who (he sayes) by their Writings have not a little contributed to the <hi>Debauching</hi> of this present Age. Who these are, he does not say; but it is most probable they are some of those that <hi>for corrupt Interests have intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>That an Oath is not a part of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98068:77"/>
Law, is clear from what hath been said concerning the Morality of it, which proved it a part of Natural Religion and Iustice, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That which hath hitherto been said by him, to prove the <hi>Morality of an Oath,</hi> is no more then what he might have said, to prove the <hi>Morality of Circumcision</hi> &amp; <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: That</hi> was used by the Patriarchs before the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law was given, so were <hi>these</hi>; if then <hi>that</hi> is therefore moral<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> because so us'd, then are <hi>these</hi> also therefore moral, because so used. But if <hi>Circumcision</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are <hi>not</hi> therefore <hi>moral,</hi> although so used; then <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is an <hi>Oath</hi> therefore <hi>moral,</hi> although so used: So that hitherto he hath <hi>done</hi> in effect <hi>nothing</hi> towards the proving an Oath a part of the moral and eternal Law, which he must do, before he can make it an Act of <hi>Natural</hi> Religion and Justice.</p>
            <p>Besides, he sayes here (pag. 66.) that <hi>the ceremonial Law is a System of Types and Shadows</hi>: and in pag. 50. he calls the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> that were offered by the Patriarchs, before the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law was given, <hi>Types and Figures</hi>; by which he plainly alloweth them to be <hi>ceremonial,</hi> notwithstanding they were used before the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And yet he would have Oaths to be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98068:77"/>
not Ceremonial, but Moral, for that very Reason, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But he adds, <hi>Whatsoever was purely Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, was purely Typical, and if you cannot find in the Gospel an Antitype for an O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He is a great deal forwarder to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm then to prove.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98068:78"/>
yet I would not have him thence infer, that the Command for these things was <hi>no Part of the Ceremonial Law,</hi> but rather consider how over hasty he was in concluding the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of swearing to be no Part of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, unless an Antitype for an Oath can be found in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But saith he, <hi>If you say an Oath was a Type of any thing pertaining to the times of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, shew what was its Antitype or thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That I will do by and by, after I have shewed the occasion and rise of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is the Type, Man was created righteous, holy, pure, innocent: There was no <hi>Guile,</hi> no <hi>Fraud,</hi> no <hi>Deceit</hi> in him; nothing but <hi>Sincerity, Vprightness</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> In this State there was no <hi>Vse</hi> nor <hi>Need</hi> of <hi>Oaths</hi>; for while he abode in this, his <hi>Word was Truth,</hi> he spake a <hi>pure Language</hi>; but man falling from this State, set open a Door (as it were) to <hi>Fraud, Treachery, Perfidy, Lying, Falshood, &amp;c.</hi> and thereby to <hi>Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, Suspicions, Distrusts, Incredulities, &amp;c.</hi> These being entred wrought men by Degrees to that pass, that not daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon one anothers <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Promises,</hi> they sought other <hi>Expedients</hi> to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

by, whereof <hi>Oaths</hi> was one, so that <hi>Oaths entred through Transgression, for want of Truth and Sincerity</hi>; and the further men went from the Truth into Falshood, the more frequent did the Use of Oaths grow: This Bishop <hi>Gauden</hi> acknowledges, out of <hi>Polybius, In the better and simpler Ages of the World</hi> (saith he) <hi>Oaths were seldom used in Iudicatures,</hi>

by the Word <hi>Confess</hi>; plainly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Type was ended</hi>: As therefore he argues, that if his Parishioner cannot find an Antitype for an Oath in the Gospel, he may then be satisfied that the Command of swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was no Part of the Ceremonial Law; I by the contrary Reason infer, that having found an Antitype for an Oath in the Gospel, he and all his Parishioners (and all others) may be satisfied that the <hi>Command of Swearing was a Part of the Ceremonial Law,</hi> and so <hi>an Oath not moral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on thus, <hi>The second Argument to confirm you, that Oaths are not evil in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor Part of the Ceremonial Law, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Two things by this Argument he undertakes to prove, one whereof is by none (that I know of) denyed, &amp; it was <hi>warily</hi> done of him to begin with that, namely, that <hi>Oaths are not evil in themselves.</hi> What makes him harp so upon this String! He could not suspect that the <hi>Quakeos</hi> (whom he writes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst) held Oaths to be evil in themselves; for at his Entrance upon this Subject, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98068:80"/>
observed out of R. H. that they allow Oaths to have been lawful, page 52. yet no less then six times in his Discourse of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he inculcates this, that Oaths are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in themselves, which looks as if he design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perswade <hi>weak</hi> Heads they may do any thing that is not evil in it self.</p>
            <p>The second thing he undertakes by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove is, <hi>That Oaths are no Part of the Ceremonial Law, because they were of authentick Vse with the holy Patriarchs, and by them held Sacred before the Delivery of the</hi> Levitical Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If Oaths are therefore no Part of the Ceremonial Law, because they were of authentick use with the holy Patriarchs, and by them held sacred before the Delivery of the Levitical Law: Then by the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son no other thing is a Part of the Ceremonial Law which was of authentick use with the holy Patriarchs, and by them held Sacred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Delivery of the Levitical Law; that is in short, nothing that the Patriarchs did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously observe, before the Delivery of the Levitical Law, was Ceremonial, but Moral. This I take to be the natural Consequence of his Argument, and this I deny, let him prove it if he can. He may find (if he pleaseth) that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98068:80"/>
               <hi>Circumcision</hi> was of authentick Use with the holy Patriarchs, and by them held sacred,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.3.</note> What then will he think of the <hi>Sacrificing</hi> of Beasts, which was of Authentick Use with the holy Patriarchs, and by them held sacred, not only before the Delivery of the Levitical Law, but even before the Flood? will he say that <hi>Sacrificing</hi> was therefore no Part of the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law? I hope he will be more considerate.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In his Margent upon this place, he sayes, <hi>Rationes boni &amp; mali sunt aeternae</hi>: i. e. The Reasons of Good and Evil are eternal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:98068:82"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> For what Reason he brought this Sentence, I do not see, unless he would from thence infer, that an Oath is a part of the Eternal Law, because the <hi>Reasons of an Oath are Eternal.</hi> But if this be his Meaning, he had need consider, that the <hi>Reasons</hi> of an <hi>Oath</hi> (in his own account) are, <hi>Lying, Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi>; and I hope he will not say, <hi>these are Eternal.</hi> But if he will have it, that the <hi>Reasons</hi> of Good and Evil are <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> what are the <hi>Effects</hi> of Good and Evil? are they <hi>Eternal</hi> too? For, that <hi>an Oath is the Effect of Evil,</hi> he has already too far granted to deny.</p>
            <p>I have now followed him to his fourth and last Proposition, by which he undertook to prove, that all Oaths are not forbidden by Christ, viz. that <hi>some Oaths are used in the New Testament.</hi> His Instances are of <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Angel</hi>: Those of <hi>Paul</hi> are these which follow, Rom: 1.9. <hi>For God is my Witness, whom I serve with my Spirit in the Gospel of his Son, that, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To say <hi>barely</hi> and <hi>simply</hi> God is my Witness, is <hi>not</hi> an Oath. Read <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.10. <hi>Ye are my Witnesses,</hi> saith the Lord; so vers. 12. <hi>Therefore ye are my Witnesses,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>that I am God</hi>: Again, Chap. 44.8. <hi>Ye are even my Witnesses, &amp;c.</hi> Here God
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98068:83"/>
is pleased to <hi>call men his Witnesses,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> in the other place <hi>calls God his Witness.</hi> Now either God in these words did swear, or he did not swear, if any will say, he did swear in saying of Men, Ye are my Witnesses, then they will make <hi>God to swear by Men,</hi> the <hi>greater</hi> by the <hi>lesser</hi>; whereas God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.5.</note> whenever he is said to swear is alwayes said to swear <hi>by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> because he could swear by <hi>no Greater.</hi> But if God, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ye are my Witnesses, <hi>did not swear</hi>; it follows then, that <hi>Paul</hi> might say, <hi>God is my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and yet <hi>not Swear.</hi> How oft did <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses call Heaven and Earth to witness</hi>! Did he swear (will the Priest say) by Heaven and Earth? That was never allowed. But if this manner of Speech be Swearing, what will become of <hi>Paul</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Case,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 22.5.</note> where he sayes, <hi>The High Priest does bear me witness, &amp;c.</hi> Which is all one as if he had said, <hi>The High Priest is my Witness</hi>? Now if my Adversary will make <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>swear by God,</hi> in saying <hi>God is my Witness,</hi> how will he avoid making him <hi>swear by the High Priest also,</hi> in saying, <hi>The High Priest is my Witness</hi>? Yet he will not dare to charge <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:98068:83"/>
directly with Swearing by the High I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>est (although indirectly he does) for he knows full well, that so to have sworn had been <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi> even when Swearing was lawful. But if <hi>Paul</hi> did not swear in saying, The High Priest is my Witness, it is evident that that Form of Speech is not an Oath. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, how extreamly absurd is this Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Paul</hi>'s words! For, if I should have Occasion to say, <hi>Iohn is my Witness,</hi> or <hi>Iames is my Witness</hi> that I did or said so or so; by the same Reason, by which the Priest would prove that <hi>Paul</hi> swore by God, in saying, God is my Witness, he may as well infer that I swear by <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Iames,</hi> in saying, <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Iames</hi> is my Witness. But his Weakness in this is too plain to need any further Detection.</p>
            <p>His next Instance is <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. <hi>I say the Truth in Christ, I lye not, my Conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To speak the Truth in Christ, is <hi>not an Oath.</hi> In the time when Oaths were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it was not lawful to swear but in Solemn, Weighty and Extraordinary Occasions: but to speak the Truth in Christ was and is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon all Occasions. And indeed, if <hi>Paul</hi> should have sworn as oft as he spake the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98068:84"/>
Truth in Christ, he would have been a very <hi>common Swearer.</hi> But if to speak the Truth in Christ, be not Swearing; how can it be an Oath to say, <hi>I speak the Truth in Christ</hi>? But this is not all; he adds, <hi>My Conscience also bearing me Witness in the Holy Ghost.</hi> What will he infer from hence? will he make <hi>Paul</hi> here to <hi>swear by his Conscience</hi> also? Doubtless <hi>Paul</hi> made <hi>more Conscience</hi> of Swearing then so. This however tends to <hi>overturn</hi> his former Instance: for <hi>if</hi> Paul <hi>did not swear by his Conscience,</hi> in saying, My Conscience bears me witness (or my Conscience is my Witness, which is all one) and which if he had done, he had done Evil, and his Example had not been imitable) then <hi>neither did he swear by God,</hi> when he said, God is my Witness.</p>
            <p>His next Instance is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. <hi>But as God is true.</hi> And Vers. 3. <hi>Moreover, I call God for a Record against my Soul, that, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>His last Instance is <hi>of the Angel swearing,</hi> Rev. 10. 5, 6.

            <p>Besides, though he confidently saith, that God hath proposed the Angels to us as <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns</hi> for our imitation, I must take the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to tell him plainly he mistakes, and that in the very Case in Hand, which I thus demonstrate: In the time of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, among the Utensils of the Tabernacle (and afterward of the Temple) there were <hi>Censers,</hi>

            <p>I have now done with his Instances, and I hope to the Reader's Satisfaction. I should now

go directly to those two Texts in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> but for a passage or two which lie in my way, and I am not willing wholely to pass over</p>
            <p>The first is this, he saith, That <hi>every Oath impl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This I cannot brook, that he should thus charge God with using an Execration (that is, <hi>wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Curse</hi>) <hi>upon himself,</hi> which how great a <hi>Blasphemy</hi> it is against the divine Nature and Majesty of God, will mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we consider, that it tends to make the most high God acknowledge some other Being <hi>superior</hi> to himself; for he who exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates (or wisheth a Curse upon) himself, doth thereby own a Power above himself, which is able to bring or <hi>execute that Curse upon him</hi> as is plain from 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 3.9. &amp; 35. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.23.

            <p>The other Passage I take notice of is this, He saith, <hi>The laying on of the Hand, and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Book, we hold to be no essential Parts of an Oath, but only decent and comely Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, &amp;c.</hi> I wish the Magistrates in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would read this, and reflect upon those many great Fines, and sore Imprisonments inflicted by some of them upon many of us, even sometimes <hi>to the loss of Life,</hi> for not complying with those things, which are by this man asserted to be <hi>no essential Parts of an Oath,</hi> but <hi>bare Ceremonies</hi>; that from this Consideration they may be induced, for the future to exercise more <hi>Moderation</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and not expose their honest Neighbours to so <hi>great Sufferings</hi> for <hi>meer Ceremonies,</hi> when the Sum &amp; Substance is effectually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by <hi>our speaking the plain and naked Truth in the Presence of God.</hi>

            <p>First he attempts to prove that <hi>those Words of Christ [Swear not at all] cannot bear a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Interpretation, but must be taken with a limitation.</hi> Why so? <hi>You are not to suppose,</hi> says he, <hi>that 'tis our Lord's Design to forbid all manner of Oaths, &amp;c.</hi> (Yes say I, I do more then suppose so, and demand of him why I should not suppose so) <hi>because as has been already shewn</hi> (saith he) <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>had not only then been faul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> So then, the proof he offers here (against our general Interpretation of Christ's Words [<hi>Swear not at all</hi>] to forbid <hi>all manner</hi> of Swearing, and for his own Limitation of those Words, to forbid <hi>some</hi> Swearing <hi>only,</hi> not all) is neither more nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98068:91"/>
then what he saith, <hi>he hath offered before,</hi> namely the Instances of <hi>Paul</hi> and the Angel; which Proofs of his, being before in this book sufficiently (as I conceive) disproved and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervated, his <hi>conceited</hi> Limitation, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he shall build thereon, must inevitably fall to the Ground, unless he hath any other <hi>Prop</hi> to shore it up for a while, which I do not find he hath; for he goes on thus, <hi>Seeing our Saviour in that Gracious Law of his hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid nothing that is morally good, nothing that is either indifferent or expedient, it must needs follow that an Oath is no further forbidden then as it is evil, &amp;c.</hi> So that herein he offers no further proof, but as <hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true indeed; he did forbid only such Oaths as our Saviour had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and he <hi>could</hi> forbid no other, because <hi>our Saviour had forbidden All,</hi> advancing his Followers into an higher State then ever Oaths were used in (for Oaths were but as <hi>Expedients</hi> to supply the Defect and <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of a shadowy and legal State) and this the Apostle well knew.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98068:96"/>
after he had first given a <hi>general Prohibition</hi> (<hi>Above All Things,</hi> my Brethren, <hi>Swear No.</hi>) and then <hi>particularly</hi> forbidden the Erroneous Glosses of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Swearing by Creatures, &amp;c.

And herein doth the Wisdom of God shine forth, in that the Apostle, repeating his Master's Doctrine, which himself in the Mount was an Ear-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of, should be directed by the Holy Ghost so to express himself, that if any should fancy Christ's Words not <hi>so general a Prohibition,</hi> as indeed they were, but should think he allowed of <hi>some other</hi> Oath, though he condemned those of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> they might here be <hi>convinced</hi> of their <hi>Mistake,</hi> and assured that he allowed neither those Oaths used by the Pharisees, <hi>nor any other Oath whatsoever.</hi> And moreover, to take away all <hi>Occasion of Stumbling,</hi> and leave nothing whereon such a <hi>Mistake</hi> might be grounded, it is observable, that the Word <hi>Communication,</hi> which is used by our Saviour (<hi>Let your Communication be Yea, yea; nay,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98068:96"/>
nay: for whatsoever is more then these, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of Evil,</hi> Mat 5.37.) and from which very Word they that contend for Swearing do wrest Christ's Meaning from a <hi>general</hi> Prohibition of <hi>all</hi> Swearing, to a <hi>particular</hi> Prohibition of Swearing in <hi>Common Talk</hi> or Communication, is <hi>not used</hi> by the Apostle (<hi>but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into Condemnation,</hi> Jam, 5.12.) as if the Holy Ghost had designedly omitted it, to secure this Text from the like <hi>Violence.</hi> But to go on.</p>
            <p>The Priest sayes, <hi>Christ told them, that in ordinary Communication, those plain Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Observe his Way of Reasoning, from the Instance of <hi>Murder</hi> to this of <hi>Swearing,</hi> that as in the Case of Murder there's <hi>more</hi> forbidden by Christ then was by <hi>Moses</hi> (for <hi>Moses</hi> forbad the <hi>End only</hi> of Evil, sayes he, but Christ forbids <hi>that which moveth to that End</hi>) so also in the Case of Swearing, there is <hi>more</hi> for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> sayes,
<q>In the Law, as well as the Gospel, it is commanded not to use another Name in Swearing: but in the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98068:99"/>
Gospel he commanded not to Swear, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Heaven nor Earth, nor other Oath; but let Yea be Yea, Nay, Nay; for what is more then the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e is of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Therefore I suppose, that the Lord ordained concerning this, because of some men's Allegations, that would swear by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Names; and first, That we must not Swear, no, not by the Lord himself, nor by any other Oath, for it is an Evil Thing to SWEAR AT ALL.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chrysostom</hi> says
<q>A <hi>Christian</hi> must avoid Oaths by all means, hearing the Sentence of Christ, which saith, It was said to them of Old, Thou shalt not Forswear, but I say unto you, Swear not at all. Let none say therefore, I Swear in a just Matter: It is not lawful to swear, neither in a JUST nor Unjust Thing.</q>
Again, says he,
<q>If to swear TRULY be a Crime, and a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing of the Commandment, where shall we place Perjury?</q>
Again (speaking to them that tender Oaths to others)
<q>But if thou fearest nothing else (<hi>sayes he</hi>) at least fear that Book which thou takest in thy Hand, bidding another swear, and when thou turnest it over, and mark'st what Christ hath there commanded concerning Oaths,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98068:99"/>
Tremble and forbear. <hi>Quest.</hi> What doth it then say of Oaths there? <hi>Answ.</hi> But I say unto you, Swear not at all. Dost thou make that Law on Oath which forbids to swear?</q>
Oh injurious! Oh unjust thing! This cannot be understood of <hi>vain</hi> Oaths; for it is evident he speaks here of <hi>Iudicial</hi> Oaths, taken upon the <hi>Bible.</hi>
Again, <q>What then if any require an Oath, and impose a Necessity of Swearing? Let the Fear of the Lord be more forcible to thee (<hi>says he</hi>) then all Necessity or Compulsion: for if thou wilt alwayes object such like Occasions, thou wilt keep none of those things which are commaded.</q>Again (reproving the Clergy-men for tendring the Bible to be sworn upon) he says, 
<q>If it were well done to swear, ye said rightly that we gave them the Gospel to Swear, not to Forswear: But now ye know, that it is a SIN even to SWEAR WELL, how can ye be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that give the Occasion of sinning against God?</q>And a little after, 
<q>Be these things spoken of them that Swear by God, but‚Äî every one commits Idolatry, who swears by any thing besides God, if it were AT ALL lawful to Swear.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To these might many more Testimonies be
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98068:100"/>
added, such as that of <hi>Iustine Martyr,</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians <hi>ought not to swear AT ALL.</hi> Those other of <hi>Chrysostom, It is not lawful to swear AT ALL, nor to bring a NECESSITY of an Oath</hi>: And again, <hi>He</hi> (viz. Christ) <hi>forbids, not Perjury only, but to Swear AT ALL.</hi> So that of <hi>Origen, A Man that lives according to the Gospel, should not swear AT ALL.</hi> That of <hi>Lactantius, A Good Man will not swear falsly, lest he mock God; nay, he will not so much as swear at all, lest at one time or other he fall, even by Custom, into Perjury.</hi> That of <hi>Hierom, The Truth of the Gospel doth not admit an Oath.</hi> See <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s Discourse of Oaths, p. 42.</p>
            <p>By this time I hope I have satisfied my Reader, that to refuse <hi>all manner</hi> of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is no <hi>new</hi> Doctrine, nor <hi>contrary</hi> to the Primitive <hi>Christian</hi> Faith. Let me add one Testimony of a modern Writer, a Man of no mean Account in the <hi>English</hi> Church (and therefore perhaps more cogent to my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary) namely, <hi>Ier.

If <hi>Christians</hi> will live according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Word of a <hi>Christian</hi> were a sufficient Instrument to give Testimony, and to make Promises, and to secure a Faith, and upon that Supposition Oaths were use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Here is much Matter in few Lines, which I desire the Reader to observe: 1. This Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop sayes expresly, That <hi>Christ would not have his Disciples to SWEAR AT ALL</hi>; no, not <hi>in publick Iudicature, if the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the World would permit him to be obeyed.</hi> 2. In these last words, he very plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, That <hi>they who swear in publick Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do therein disobey Christ, whatever Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity they may plead for it.</hi> And by this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication he again asserts, that <hi>Christ did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all Swearing, though it were in publick Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature.</hi> This then overturns the very Foundation of that feeble Fabrick, which my Adversary the Priest hath been all this
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98068:101"/>
while raising for an Oath to lodge in. For i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> it be <hi>true,</hi> that Christ did (as this Bishop un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands) forbid <hi>all sorts</hi> of Oaths whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, then that must needs <hi>be false which the Priest sayes,</hi> namely, That Christ did not forbid <hi>all</hi> Oaths, but <hi>only</hi> the erroneous Glosses of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees.</hi> Nor is that all; for if it be true (as the Bishop understands) that Christ did indeed <hi>forbid all Oaths,</hi> then that is <hi>false which the Priest says,</hi> namely, that Oaths are Moral and Eternal. But there is yet more in the following words of the Bishop's Testimony, <hi>If</hi> Christians (sayes he) <hi>will live according to the Religion, the Word of a</hi> Christian <hi>were a sufficient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to give Testimony, and to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and to secure a Faith, and upon that Supposition</hi> (adds he) <hi>Oaths were useless, and therefore forbidden.</hi> Observe here, that he does not say, If <hi>Christians could</hi> live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Religion; but, if Christians <hi>will</hi> live according to the Religion [which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, they not only <hi>ought</hi> so to live, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>may</hi> so live] then the Word of a <hi>Christian</hi> were sufficient without an Oath, even in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Judicature; and upon that Supposition Oaths were useless, and therefore forbidden<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:98068:101"/>
This manifests beyond all Contradiction (of them that allow this Bishop's Testimony) that Christ did <hi>forbid all manner of Swearing,</hi> when he said, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> For without all doubt, Christ intended that his Disciples, those that were called by his Name, <hi>should live according to the Religion they protest,</hi> should be Christians <hi>indeed</hi>; which if they were, he knew their <hi>bare</hi> word would be <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> to give Testimony to make Promises, and to secure a Faith, and consequently that an Oath would be altogether <hi>useless.</hi> It would therefore be <hi>unreasonable,</hi> as well as <hi>unrighteous,</hi> to imagine that Christ did allow <hi>any Oath at all</hi> to his Disciples, since that were to suppose that he either <hi>permitted them to live contrary to the Christian Religion,</hi> or that he <hi>allowed them to take Oaths though use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>; which had been to <hi>take God's holy Name in vain.</hi> Thus, Reader, thou seest, that what the Priest hath said to prove Oaths lawful, is denyed &amp; disproved by a Bishop of his own, and <hi>Swear not at all</hi> proved to be <hi>an universal Prohibition of ALL Oaths whatsoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may now therefore draw this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a Period; seeing it is already proved,

that <hi>an Oath is not an Act of Natural Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (but was used of old as a Remedy only to restrain those Mischiefs, which Perfidy and Lying have brought amongst men (as the Bishop of <hi>Exeter</hi> notes out of <hi>Polybius</hi>) <hi>That it is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful amongst Good Men,</hi>

            <head>CHAP. VII. Of Taking Texts, Studying Sermons, and Selling them to the People.</head>
            <p>THE next thing the Priest takes in hand to treat of, is their Manner of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching from a Text, which he brings in after this manner; <hi>You pretend your selves</hi> (sayes the <hi>Parishioner</hi> to him) <hi>to be the Apostles Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors and Imitators; if so, how comes it to pass, that you preach not as they did; but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out a Text, our of which you compose your Sermons? what Warrant have you for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> To this he replies, <hi>The Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves took Texts out of Scripture, to expound and apply them: St.</hi> Peter <hi>did so in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Acts 2. <hi>and St.</hi> Paul <hi>in the Synagogue at</hi> Antioch, Acts 16. (I suppose it should be <hi>Acts</hi> 13 for in the 16th chapter there is no such thing.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If he and his Brethren have no better Warrant for singling out a Text, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98068:103"/>
               <hi>composing their Sermons out of it,</hi> then these Scriptures afford, their Practice will appear to be very weakly grounded. For <hi>Peter</hi> took no Text at all, but began his Speech thus, <hi>Ye Men of</hi> Judea, <hi>and all ye that are at</hi> Jerusalem,<note place="margin">Acts 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>be this known unto you, and hearken to my words; for these Men are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third Hour of the Day.</hi> No man I think will take these words to be Peter's <hi>Text</hi>: yet if any should, I desire him to shew me <hi>whence</hi> Peter <hi>took them.</hi> But if this be not <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Text,</hi> then <hi>Peter began without a Text</hi>; for this is the Beginning of his Sermon. 'Tis true, in the progress of his Discourse, he takes notice of several Passages of Scripture, though not naming the places; and if from hence the Priest will infer he took a Text, he may with the same Reason say, he took <hi>half a Dozen Texts</hi> together: for I think he referred to not fewer then half a dozen several Scriptures in that short Sermon of his.</p>
            <p>But he sayes, <hi>Both</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>also preacht Christ out of the same Text,</hi> namely, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That <hi>Peter</hi> does mention the words
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98068:104"/>
in <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.10. I grant; but that he took them for his Text, or <hi>composed his Sermon out of them,</hi> I deny: for he was <hi>beyond the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> of his Sermon, <hi>before</hi> he mentioned those words of the <hi>Psalmist.</hi> How then could they be his Text? The like is to be said of his other Instance of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> He took <hi>no Text</hi> neither, as appears plainly <hi>Acts</hi> 13.16. where he thus began, <hi>Men of</hi> Israel, <hi>and ye that fear God, give audience; The God of this People of</hi> Israel <hi>chose our Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> and so he goes on to give an <hi>Historical Account</hi> of the Dealings of God with that People, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the time of Christ, and many Passages of Scripture he refers to in <hi>Deuteronomy, Ioshua, Iudges, Samuel, Isaiah,</hi> and the <hi>Psalms</hi>; yet did not take any of them as a Text to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Sermon out of.</hi> But as for that place, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.10. (which the Priest would have to be his Text) he mentioned it not at all till he had well-nigh <hi>done</hi> his Sermon, so far was he from making that his Text, or <hi>composing his Sermon out of it.</hi> These Instances then afford <hi>no Warrant</hi> for the Priest to take a Text, and <hi>compose his Sermon out of it.</hi> And that which he next offers is as little (or less) to the Purpose.</p>
            <p>He says, <hi>The whole</hi> 4<hi>th Chapter to the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

               </gap>e Business: But if he does mean so, he discovers the <hi>greater Weakness.</hi> For what can it be but <hi>Weakness</hi> in any one to imagine, That the Apostle, in writing an Epistle, after he had gone so far in it as the three first Chapters, <hi>without</hi> a Text, should take a Text to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the 4th Chapter only out of, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> go on again without a Text; especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that that Epistle, when he writ it, was one intire piece, not divided, as it now is, into Chapters and Verses? But if he will needs have it, that <hi>Paul</hi> took <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. for a Text, out of which to compose this Chapter, because in this Chapter that Passage is mentioned; he may not only say the same of other Sciptures referr'd to in the same Chapter, but with the like Reason infer, that the Apostle, in that Epistle, took twice as many Texts as the whole Epistle is divided into Chapters, since more then so many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture are in that Epistle referr'd to.</p>

own <hi>Instances</hi> he adds two more, <hi>which,</hi> he sayes, <hi>were produced by Dr.</hi> Sherlock, whom he represents as <hi>speaking worthily,</hi> and <hi>like himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Who Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> is I know as little as I do who my present Adversary is: But this I know, that my Adversary has gone at least <hi>half as far</hi> as that Doctor; for he has spoken <hi>like himself,</hi> though <hi>not worthily.</hi> But let us see the Intances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One is of Christ, who</hi> (he sayes) <hi>took a Text, and preacht upon it,</hi> Luke 4.17, 22. <hi>The other is of</hi> Philip, <hi>who</hi> (he sayes) <hi>took a Text which the Eunuch read,</hi> Acts 8.30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To the Instance of Christ, I say, <hi>first,</hi> That it was in the time of the Law, and suitable to that Ministration; when Reading and Expounding the Law and the Prophets was a part of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Service: But it is not a <hi>sufficient Warrant</hi> for the like Practice in the time of the Gospel. 2. That it is no where recommended by Christ, or any of his Apostles, as <hi>an Example</hi> or <hi>Pattern</hi> for Gospel Ministers. 3. It is a <hi>particular</hi> Case (for in all the Sermons that our Saviour preacht, while he was upon Earth, we do not read the like) and the Priest himself sayes, p. 127. <hi>When any Text
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98068:105"/>
hath a Relation to a particular Case, that Text must not stand for a general Rule: for it is a grand Fallacy</hi> (he sayes) <hi>to draw an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Conclusion from Particular Premises.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Instance of <hi>Philip,</hi> I answer, That he did <hi>not</hi> take a Text to preach on, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that Scripture which the Eunuch was reading, and that too at his Request. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip did not single out any Text to compose a Sermon out of</hi>; but hearing the Eunuch read that Scripture, and being desired by the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch to inform him in the Meaning of it, he thereupon took an Occasion to preach Christ to the Eunuch. <hi>He abuses his Reader</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in saying, <hi>Philip</hi> took a Text: for it is evident that Scripture in <hi>Isaiah</hi> was of the <hi>Eunach's choosing,</hi> not <hi>Philip</hi>'s. So that if he will needs have it, that a <hi>Text,</hi> was taken, he should rather have said, <hi>The Eunuch took one</hi>; for he was reading it when <hi>Philip</hi> came to him. These Instances therefore afford him no more Warrant for his Practice of singling out a <hi>Text.</hi> and <hi>composing Sermons out of it,</hi> then the former; so that if this be all they have to say, the Doctor and he are still to seek a Warrant for their Practice.</p>
            <p>But he falls fiercely (and foully too) upon <hi>Rich. Hubberthorn,</hi> for the Reply he made
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98068:106"/>
to Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> which he sayes was in these words, <hi>O thou Enemy and Slanderer of Christ and the Apostles! Did they take Texts to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ure, and the Apostles shewed how he fulfilled the Scripture.</hi> And this he calls a <hi>Brutish Reply,</hi> and sayes, <hi>Did Dr.</hi> Sherlock <hi>any where lay such a Slander upon Christ and his Apostles, as to say, they took Texts to get Money with them, or to lie Half or a Quarter of a Year in them, as this Man so injuriously infers? Who then, think you, is the Slanderer? and who stood at this Man's Elbow to dictate unto him that wretched Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth?</hi> p. 88.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> For all his big words I would have him take notice, that he deals very unfairly with us, in reporting a Reply of <hi>R. H.</hi>'s, and not quoting the Page, nor so much as Book out of which he takes it; therein fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling short of the <hi>common Honesty</hi> of every fair Adversary. Yet will I not therefore (as I justly might) pass over this place unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but supposing the words to be truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, I say thus: Our Charge against the Priests is not <hi>only</hi> and <hi>barely</hi> for taking <hi>Texts,</hi> and <hi>composing Sermons out of them</hi> (though
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98068:106"/>
for that having no divine Warrant, they are condemnable) but also for <hi>selling those Texts and Sermons to the People for Money.</hi> Thus <hi>making a Trade of the holy Scriptures,</hi> they lie some of them three, some six Moneths in a <hi>Text</hi>; and what, by the Helps of Invention and Study, they gather into their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings that by Measure they <hi>sell out</hi> to the People, taking some <hi>Ten,</hi> some <hi>Twenty,</hi> some <hi>Forty Shillings</hi> and more, for an <hi>Hour's</hi> Discourse. This is Matter of Fact, and too Notorious to need Proof. Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> (as he calls him) to defend the Practice of the Priests, urges the <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi>: Whereupon <hi>R.

               </hi> to get Money with them (<hi>as you Priests do</hi>) and in lying a Quarter or Half a Year in a <hi>Text (as some of you do)</hi> thou art a Slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Enemy of Christ and the Apostle: for did they ever do thus? Now, this being our Charge against the Priests, not <hi>only</hi> that they
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98068:107"/>
take Texts, but that thay <hi>make a Trade</hi> of the Scriptures, <hi>taking Texts to get Money by, &amp;c.</hi> Doth not Dr, <hi>Sherlock,</hi> in bringing the <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>justifie</hi> the Priests Practice, plainly intimate he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that <hi>they took Texts as the Priests do</hi>? What else then is that, but implicitly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that <hi>they took Texts to get Money by</hi>? So that if the Case be <hi>truly</hi> stated and <hi>rightly</hi> considered, it will appear that <hi>the Doctor did slander</hi> Christ <hi>and</hi> Philip (in urging their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to justifie so bad a Practice) not <hi>R.H.</hi> the Doctor.

            <p>HAving briefly dispatcht the Business of <hi>taking Texts, framing Discourses</hi> on them, and <hi>selling those Discourses for Money</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that which comes next under Consideration is <hi>Humane Learning,</hi> which the Priest asserts the <hi>Necessity</hi> of in interpreting the Scriptures, pag. 90. He takes an Occasion to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject, from some words of <hi>R. H.</hi> which (as he sets them down: for he names no Book) are thus, <hi>The</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees <hi>were Learned Men, and they could not open the Scriptures</hi>; Peter <hi>an Vnlearned Man, he opened the Scriptures,</hi> pag, 87.

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He had no Cause to <hi>quarrel</hi> at this; for <hi>R. H.</hi> spake but the Truth. He did not <hi>magnifie</hi> the Learning of the Scribes and Pharisees, but <hi>barely</hi> said, <hi>they were Learned

Men,</hi> which none that understands what they were, will deny: Nor does he any whit <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> (as this Priest doth <hi>unfairly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate) but <hi>barely</hi> sayes, <hi>He was Vnlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; and so indeed he was <hi>in that sort of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> wherein the Pharisees were learned, to which his being unlearned is opposed.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes; there was great Difference, but <hi>not in point of Humane Learning</hi>: The Difference lay not there. He had no more of that Learning when he was a Disciple, then he had when he was a Fisherman. But the great Difference lay in this, that when he was a Fisherman, he was <hi>Carnally-minded</hi>; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, being a Disciple, he became <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually-minded,</hi> having <hi>received an Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> not from Study and Natural Means, but <hi>from God,</hi> as another Apostle said,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.20.</note> 
               <hi>We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98068:108"/>
that we may know him that is true, &amp;c.</hi> For <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, that a little before his Ascension,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 24.45.</note> 
               <hi>he opened their Vnderstandings</hi> (which was an immediate and inward O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of his Spirit and Power upon them) <hi>That they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Scriptures.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>He goes on, <hi>Had</hi> Peter <hi>been so long with him, that spake as never man spake, and is he still unlearned</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, unlearned still <hi>in humane Learning,</hi> as much as he was before; for Christ did not instruct him in that, neither did the <hi>Excellency</hi> of Christ himself lie in that; for when he spake as never man spake, it was not in respect of <hi>Humane</hi> Learning, but of <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Did the Holy Ghost,</hi> saith he, <hi>give him the Tongue of the learned, nay a Portion of the Cloven Tongues, by which he spake all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, to enable him to expound the Scriptures to all Nations, and is this</hi> Peter <hi>unlearned still</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, he was unlearned still in <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:98068:109"/>
and <hi>acquired</hi> Learning; for that which was given him by the holy Ghost, was not <hi>humane</hi> nor acquired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doth he not say</hi> (adds he) <hi>that the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and Vnstable wrest the Scriptures to their own Destruction, and is he himself Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, he himself, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, was Unlearned in <hi>that</hi> Learning, by which they, who were Unlearned in the Heavenly Learning, did wrest the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Now that this may not seem strange, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the Reader to consider, that there is a <hi>two-fold</hi> Learning, Knowledge, Wisdom, and Understanding. There is a Learning that is acquirable by <hi>natural</hi> Study and Industry, and this is called <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and this Learning, Man as Man, though never so ignorant of God, or never so great an Enemy to God, is capable of; <hi>this Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Peter <hi>was Vnlearned in.</hi> And there is a Learning which is given by, and received from God, without the Help or Means of Natural Study and Industry, and this is called <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Heavenly</hi> Learning; and this the <hi>Natural</hi> Man is not capable of, but he <hi>only,</hi> that is <hi>led by</hi> and <hi>taught</hi> of the <hi>Spirit, In this

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98068:112"/>
Thankfulness to our great Law-giver, in that he hath made those Doctrines most plain, which are most necessary to be believed, and those things least necessary which are most difficult, as for Example,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is not necessary to Salvation to be knowing in all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Levitical Rites, nor in all the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies of the Scripture, nor in all the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptical Prophecies, and therefore the Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them need not dismay us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It seems then, those Doctrines which are <hi>most necessary</hi> to be believed, are <hi>plain enough</hi> to be understood, and preacht <hi>without</hi> humane Learning; and that Learning is <hi>only necessary</hi> to the understanding of those things which are <hi>least necessary,</hi> which how little it conduces to prove <hi>a Necessity</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning in a Preacher of the Gospel, I leave to the Reader's Judgment.</p>
            <p>He said before (page 86.) <hi>Our only work is to explain and apply the written Word of God.</hi> He said but now (p. 92, 93.) <hi>All things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation, all things to be believed or done, all Gospel-Precepts, all Essentials of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> (with many more particulars there mentioned) <hi>are plain and easie to the shallowest Vnderstanding, to the most unlearned</hi>) and so have <hi>no Need</hi> of explanation) he saith now,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98068:113"/>
those things which are <hi>most difficult</hi> (and so have <hi>most Need</hi> of explanation) are <hi>least ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</hi> Compare now these three Sayings one with the other, and see if the direct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of them be not this, That <hi>their</hi> (I mean his, and his Brethrens) <hi>only Work is to explain, and apply those things, which are least necessary to be known</hi>; nay, which indeed <hi>are not at all necessary to Salvation,</hi> are <hi>neither to be believed nor done,</hi> are <hi>no Gospel precepts, nor essential to Religion</hi> O that all People would take Notice of this! <hi>that they might no longer spend their money for that which is not bread,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 55.2.</note> 
               <hi>nor their Labour for that which satisfieth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this I pass on to his second Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.) not finding any thing further in this that is remarkable, save that in page 94. he again acknowledgeth, that <hi>those Passages in Scripture that are of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Concern, are written in such a plain and familiar Stile, that the weakest and most illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or unlearned (of which number a greatest Part of the Members of the Church are) shall never be able to excuse the Neglect of them, the Omniscient Author of the Scriptures</hi> (which is God) <hi>herein graciously condescending to the shallowest Capacities, &amp;c.</hi> All which makes
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98068:113"/>
still more and more against the Necessity of humane Learning.</p>
            <p>His second Observation is, <hi>That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have been wrested,</hi> page 95. This being matter of Fact, he concludes to be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known without further proof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having spent a Page or two in <hi>exclaiming</hi> against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and some others (but them especially) for wresting them, he goes on to his third particular, whither I also fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, not doubting but by that time this Subject is discust, I shall prove his second ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation for him, by an <hi>undeniable Instance</hi> of himself, perverting these Words of <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His third Observation was, <hi>the Causes why the Scriptures are wrested, which he makes twofold, want of Learning, and of Stability. I begin</hi> (saith he) <hi>with the first, namely, the want of Learning, which is derided by</hi> Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berthorn, page 97.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It had been but fair for him to have given some Instance of R. H's. deriding Learning. R. H. was not a man apt or inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to deride any, being a <hi>grave, scrious, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, weighty</hi> man, as they who best knew him can bear witness, nor is it our manner to deride, or any way undervalue Learning,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98068:114"/>
which <hi>in its Place</hi> we know to be good and serviceable, but when others do so much <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver value</hi> it, and lift it up so high above its <hi>proper</hi> Sphere, as to make it the <hi>only Key,</hi> by which divine Mysteries can now a dayes be opened; that, <hi>without which the Gospel can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preacht,</hi> &amp;c. We are then necessitated to <hi>pull it down,</hi> and <hi>reduce</hi> it to its <hi>proper</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Service, which is to be conversant in <hi>Natural, Civil,</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi> Affairs, where while it is exercised, we are far from deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or under valuing it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that we give it that Esteem which is due unto it, as a <hi>Natural</hi> thing, and in our outward Occasions, make use of it our selves, so far as we have Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in it, which together with our E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours (though through great Difficulties) to educate our Children therein, may suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evidence <hi>our regard to Literature,</hi> and that our Exception lies not against <hi>Learning</hi> it self, but against the <hi>Abuse</hi> of it. This I thought needful here to be hinted, to rectifie the mistakes of any concerning us in this Case.</p>
            <p>He goes on thus, <hi>You are here to take special Notice</hi> (saith he) <hi>that Learning is by the holy Ghost declared so necessary for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of difficult Passages in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98068:114"/>
that the Cause of the wresting them is attributed to the want of it.</hi> This he saith, but doth not so much as attempt to prove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That Learning is necessary I grant, but the Question is what Learning: If he doth not mean <hi>Natural, Humane,</hi> or <hi>School</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, such as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> were skilled in, he equivocates; but if he doth mean such Learning, I deny his Proposition. I deny that <hi>Natural</hi> Learning, <hi>School</hi> Learning, such as is acquired by Art, Study and Industry, is the Learning here by the Holy Ghost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared necessary. If want of <hi>Humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> were the Cause why the Scriptures are wrested, how comes it to pass that they are wrested by those that have <hi>Humane</hi> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? for if we look back into former Ages, we shall find that the Scriptures for the most part have been <hi>wrested by learned men,</hi> great <hi>Schollars, acute Wits,</hi> men of much <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> as by the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and Jewish Doctors of old, the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy men</hi> in the <hi>Arrian</hi> and other Controversies; the <hi>Cardinals, Iesuits</hi> and <hi>Popish Priests</hi> in latter times. How came it to pass that these men <hi>wrested</hi> the Scriptures? was it for <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Humane</hi> Learning? that could not be; for that most of these men were <hi>profound</hi> Schollars
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:98068:115"/>
great <hi>Linguists, Vniversity men,</hi> men of <hi>much Reading,</hi> and <hi>great Learning,</hi> is undeniable, and yet these are the men, that of all others have wrested the Scriptures <hi>most frequently,</hi> and <hi>most perniciously:</hi> What was the Reason of this? surely if Humane Learning had been designed by God, as the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> means of understanding the Scriptures aright, they who had so much of that Learning should have understood them better then they did, then whom none hath ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood them <hi>worse,</hi> nor is it a thing to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at by any, who shall consider the words of Christ, <hi>I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 10.21.</note> 
               <hi>that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes; even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.</hi> Here then is the true cause why these <hi>learned men</hi> wrest the Scriptures; They seek to understand them by that <hi>Wisdom</hi> from which the true Sense of them is hid; they trust too much to their Brain Knowledge, and Humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with that undertake to interpret Scripture, not waiting for the Guidance of the Holy Spirit, whose Office <hi>alone</hi> it is to lead into all Truth. Experience therefore shews
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98068:115"/>
by the <hi>Errors</hi> of <hi>learned men</hi> in all Ages, that <hi>Humane Learning</hi> (whatever this Priest says) <hi>is not the Key that can open the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> none having more missed of the true Sense of them, then they that have sought it by that Learning.</p>
            <p>But saith he, <hi>Though the Apostles were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned when Iesus called them, yet to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Honour of Learning, he made them learned in all Tongues by a Miracle, before he sent them abroad to teach all Nations; teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us thereby, that men wholely illiterate are not fit to preach the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This at first Sight, makes a shew as if it had <hi>something</hi> in it; but look well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and it appears to be but a meer <hi>empty</hi> Flourish. <hi>Christ</hi> (he saith) <hi>by a Miracle made his Apostles learned in all Tongues, before he sent them abroad to teach all Nations.</hi> Well, what doth he infer? <hi>Teaching us thereby</hi> (saith he) <hi>that men wholely illiterate are not fit to preach the Gospel.</hi> Herein is a Fallacy, he should have said (if he would have said any thing to the Purpose) that men wholely illiterate, are not fit to preach the Gospel <hi>to all Nations,</hi> which if it were true (as it is not; for <hi>illiterate</hi> men may speak by <hi>Interpreters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.27.</note> which also was in use in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church) what is it to the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98068:116"/>
Purpose? If not having <hi>all Languages</hi> they should not be fit to preach to <hi>all Nations,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>all Nations</hi> could not understand their Speech, will it therefore follow they are not fit to preach to <hi>their own Nation</hi> that doth understand their Speech? But these Words [<hi>All Nations</hi>] he was willing in the last Clause to leave out, that he might beguile the ignorant into a Conceit that none but Book-learned men can preach the Gospel; but though he may twattle after this rate to his Parishioner (whose <hi>Respects</hi> to his <hi>Person</hi> may perhaps induce him to swallow any thing that comes from him) yet let him not think to <hi>impose</hi> such <hi>Sophistry</hi> upon us, as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as he takes us to be; we understand Words better then so. The Gift of Tongues to the Apostles doth not imply, that men wholely illiterate, are unfit to preach the Gospel. What was the End of the Gift of Tongues? was it to give the Apostles themselves the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> of the Gospel? was it to enable them to preach the Gospel <hi>sincerely</hi> and <hi>truly</hi>? or was it that they might express themselves to the Understandings of those several Nations to whom they were to preach? They were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to preach the Gospel to <hi>all Nations,</hi> which that all Nations might <hi>understandingly</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:98068:116"/>
hear, it was expedient it should be preacht unto them in their respective <hi>proper</hi> Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which that it might be, the Use of Tongues was requisite, and therefore given unto them, who were designed to that so <hi>Vniversal</hi> Ambassage: Observe then, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what was indeed the <hi>very</hi> Reason, and <hi>proper</hi> Service of Tongues, namely, that <hi>all Nations</hi> might hear and understand what was spoken: So that the Gift of Tongues was not designed to enable the Apostles to preach the Gospel, in such a Sense, <hi>as if they had not been able to preach it at all without them,</hi> but to enable them, in the preaching of it, <hi>so</hi> to express themselves in every Nation's <hi>proper</hi> Dialect, that they to whom they spake might <hi>understand</hi> what was spoken to them, but as for the Ability which they had to preach the Gospel simply it self, <hi>without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to other Nations,</hi> that, they received <hi>immediately</hi> from the Holy Ghost, which was poured forth <hi>upon</hi> them, and dwelt <hi>in</hi> them, and by Virtue of this <hi>indwelling</hi> of the Spirit, the <hi>most illiterate</hi> amongst them were able to preach the Gospel fully, and <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> to those of their own Nation (and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who understood their Language) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the additionall Gift of Tongues; but the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98068:117"/>
Priest in comparing humane Learning with the Gift of Tongues, and then inferring that because the use of Tongues was needful to the Apostles, in order to preach the Gospel to all Nations, who could not otherwise have understood them, therefore humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is needful (yea <hi>absolutely necessary</hi>) in order to preach the Gospel to them of their own Nation and Language, and who can understand us <hi>as well</hi> without it: In this I say, he <hi>covertly imposeth</hi> a Falshood upon his Reader, which he ought not to have done. He might rather have inferred thus, That if the Apostles having <hi>received the Promise</hi> of the Father, in the <hi>pouring forth</hi> of his Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on them, were thereby enabled and fitted to preach the Gospel, to <hi>their own</hi> Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in their own <hi>Mother</hi>-Tongue, without the help of other Languages, then such now as have received the <hi>same</hi> Spirit (whether in the same measure is not material, it being sufficient if the <hi>Measure</hi> received be <hi>suitable</hi> to the present <hi>Service</hi>) are thereby made able to preach the Gospel in their own <hi>Mother</hi>-Tongue, to such as understand that Tongue, without the help of <hi>Humane Learning,</hi> and this sets Humane Learning <hi>quite aside,</hi> as to any <hi>Necessity</hi> of it in preaching the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:98068:117"/>But he saith, <hi>There was great Reason for choosing illiterate men then, in order to the most succesful Promulgation of the Gospel, and the Glory of God; for had our Lord chosen the Philosophers and learned Rabbies of the time, his whole Doctrine might have been opposed with greater Force of Argument, and would have lost much of its Reputation, by being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to such mens Invention, as if its Success had been wholly owing to their Skill and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not to the mighty Power of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Reason holds good still; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience shews that these <hi>learned men,</hi> that call themselves Ministers of the Gospel now, do <hi>extol</hi> and cry up their <hi>humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> beyond the Power of God; for they make that Learning such an <hi>indespensible</hi> Qualification, and of such <hi>absolute</hi> Necessity, that though a man be <hi>indued with Power</hi> from on high, though he hath <hi>received the Promise</hi> of the Father, though he be <hi>full of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and of Faith, yet if he be not <hi>sk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But he saith, <hi>That was a time extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Disciples being to plant the Gospel in all Nations, and probably understanding no Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage but the</hi> Syrian, <hi>Christ therefore rains

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If that was an <hi>extraordinary</hi> time and occasion, in and upon which, Tongues were given, he is the more to <hi>blame</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring from thence a <hi>Necessity</hi> of Humane Learning, in <hi>ordinary</hi> times, and upon <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> occasions: He should have remembred what himself saith, page 128. <hi>That it is a most grand Fallacy, to draw an universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, from particular Premises.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He seems not rightly to understand Revelation but rather to have taken in some strange Notion concerning it. I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know of him, how he would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood when he sayes, <hi>God has revealed his Will to the Church in the Holy Bible.</hi> He
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98068:128"/>
sayes, <hi>The Letter is not the Word, but the Sense</hi> (pag. 96.) Does he mean then, that this Sense is so revealed in the Bible, that he that reads the Letter (though he hath no As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance therein, but only his own natural Understanding) shall be <hi>sure</hi> to find the <hi>true Sense,</hi> and understand the Will of God? This his words import. Yet this he cannot reasonably intend (if he will consist with himself) because he else-where, not only urges the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Humane Learning,</hi> but also confesses, <hi>the Spirit doth help them to understand the Scriptures,</hi> and that <hi>they</hi> therefore <hi>pray for his Assistance therein</hi> (pag. 103.) But if he means, that the Will of God is so revealed in the Scriptures, that they can understand it <hi>with</hi> the Help and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Spirit, but <hi>not without</hi> (which is the fair import of confessing the Spirit doth help, and praying for its Assistance therein) what else then, I pray, is this, but to say, <hi>They can understand the Will of God in the Scriptures, when the Spirit revealeth it unto them, but not otherwise.</hi> For if they could understand the Will of God <hi>without the Help of the Spirit,</hi> in vain do they invoke his Assistance: but if they <hi>cannot</hi> understand the Will of God in the Scriptures, <hi>without the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:98068:129"/>
Help of the Spirit,</hi> and therefore implore his Assistance, that shews the <hi>Necessity of the Spirit's Teaching</hi>: and if the Spirit <hi>vouchsafe his Help,</hi> and do <hi>open</hi> and make known the Will of God to them, that is, <hi>Revelation.</hi> How egregiously absurd then it is, for this man to <hi>exclaim</hi> (as he does) <hi>against Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> who, upon his own Principle, <hi>cannot understand the Will of God without it,</hi> let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>But he charges the <hi>Quakers</hi> with saying, <hi>The Bible is a Dead Letter, but the Word of God is Quick and Powerful, so is not the Bible,</hi> p. 107.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Word <hi>Bible</hi> signifies a <hi>Book,</hi> and the <hi>Book</hi> or Bible the Priests call the <hi>Word</hi> of God.

the Sense</hi>; so says this man, p. 96. But why then do they <hi>mean one thing,</hi> and <hi>speak ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>? But if the <hi>Letter</hi> be <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of God, how can the <hi>Bible</hi> be the <hi>Word</hi> of God, seeing the <hi>Bible</hi> is only the <hi>Book</hi> wherein the <hi>Letter</hi> is written? Yet does this man so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and jumble them together, that it is hard to know what at last he intends to be the Word of God. One while he sayes, <hi>it is not the Letter, but the Sense, that is the Word of God</hi>; by and by he sayes, <hi>The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the Word of God,</hi> as if he took the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> in which the <hi>Letter</hi> is written, to be the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi>: for he makes the <hi>Bible</hi> and the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> to be one and the same thing, namely, the <hi>Word</hi> of God: But the Word of God which is quick and powerful, he appears to be a Stranger to.</p>
            <p>But he asks, <hi>Whence we know that the Word of God is Quick and Lively</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By <hi>Experience</hi>; For though he, being with the <hi>Iews</hi> in the Unbelief, has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver peradventure <hi>heard the Voice of God at any time</hi>; yet, blessed be the Lord, we have; and when the Lord hath spoken in us, we have felt his <hi>Word living and powerful, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning and discovering the Most Secret
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98068:130"/>
Thoughts and Intents of our Hearts.</hi> But this Answer I conclude will not answer his End: He has fitted an Answer to his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and put it into his Parishioner's Mouth, to speak as for us, which is, That <hi>We learn out of the Bible, that the Word of God is Quick and Lively.</hi> Whereupon, as apprehending some Advantage, he layes about him with all his Might: <hi>What</hi>! sayes he, <hi>Out of that Bible which they call a Dead Letter</hi>? and so goes on for three or four pages together, in such an <hi>insulting</hi> strain, as if he had gotten some <hi>petty Conquest,</hi> and were now riding in <hi>Triumph.</hi> But a Wise Man would have defer'd his Boasting, until he had put his Armour off.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Bible, barely as it is a Book,</hi> is a Dead Thing; that the Scriptures, <hi>barely as Writings,</hi> are Dead Letters, none I think (that considers what he sayes, and dare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But sayes he, <hi>Though the Leaves and Letters have no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life in them, is therefore the Sense of the Scriptures dead</hi>? No, say I; The true Sense and Meaning of the Scriptures is not dead. But that Sense which man, by his Natural Understanding and Humane Learning only, doth invent and form to himself, as if he had it

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:98068:131"/>
(pag. 96.) <hi>It is not the Letter, but the Sense, that is the Word of God.</hi> So that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he will not have the <hi>Letter</hi> to be the <hi>Word</hi> of God, but the Sense, yet, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Piece of Ignorance and Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, he will have the <hi>Bible</hi> (or Book) to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as if the <hi>Book</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Letter</hi> it written, were the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Letter.</hi> Thus all his great Bluster and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour against others, ends in the <hi>Detection</hi> of his own <hi>Confusion.</hi>

            <p>He sayes, pag. 112. <hi>To look for more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, or a Repetition of the former, would be equally an Act of Impudence and Infidelity.</hi> Why of Impudence and Infidelity? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>Would it not be an Act of Infidelity not to believe God, when he plainly tells us, that the Scriptures themselves are able to make us wise unto Salvation through Faith, &amp;c. and to furnish us throughly to all good Works</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He <hi>corrupts</hi> the Scripture. Where doth God <hi>plainly tell him,</hi> that the Scriptures <hi>themselves</hi> are able, &amp;c? This word [<hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>] he puts in of his own Head, and yet sayes, <hi>God tells us plainly, that the Scriptures themselves are able, &amp;c.</hi> wherein he speaks Untruth of God. If this be not <hi>Infidelity,</hi> yet it looks as like <hi>Impudence</hi> as I have seen.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98068:131"/>
If the Scriptures <hi>themselves</hi> were able to make wise unto Salvation through Faith, &amp;c. there were then <hi>no Need of the Help of the Spirit.</hi> But I have already shewed, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the <hi>Spirit reveal</hi> and open them, the Scriptures themselves <hi>cannot</hi> be rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. And he himself, in saying, <hi>The spirit doth help them to understand them,</hi> and that <hi>they pray for its Assistance therein</hi> (pag. 103.) doth implicitly acknowledge as much. But if there be <hi>a Necessity of the spirit's Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,</hi> in order to a <hi>right</hi> understanding of the Scriptures, then it is evident that the Scriptures <hi>themselves</hi> are <hi>not</hi> able to make wise, &amp;c. <hi>without the Help</hi> and Assistance (i. e. the Teaching and <hi>Revelation</hi>) of the Spirit. Whether then it can be an <hi>Act of Infidelity</hi> to expect that, which there is so <hi>great a Necessity of,</hi> that men <hi>cannot</hi> be wise unto Salvation <hi>without</hi> it, I leave to the Reader's Judgment. Nay, let it be well considered, seeing Christ hath plainly and expresly told us, That <hi>he will send the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, the spirit of Truth, to his Disciples</hi>; that <hi>this spirit shall be in them, and shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with them forever</hi>; that <hi>he shall testifie of Christ</hi>; that <hi>he shall take of Christ's, and shew it unto them</hi>; that <hi>he shall teach them all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98068:132"/>
things, and guide them into all Truth</hi> (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the 14, 15 &amp; 16. Chapters of <hi>Iohn</hi>; I say, let it be well considered) whether it is not <hi>an Act of Infidelity</hi> in any, who profess themselves to be Christ's Disciples, <hi>not to believe and expect the Performance of this so absolute a Promise.</hi> Thus far as to the Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of expecting to have the Truths former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed to the Saints, revealed now to us <hi>by the same spirit,</hi> by which they were then revealed unto them (which I take to be the Meaning of that Phrase of his, <hi>a Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the former Revelations</hi>) Now to the Act of Impudence; for he sayes, <hi>To look for a Repetition of the former Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, would be equally an Act of Impudence and Infidelity. And is it not an Act of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi> (sayes he) <hi>when God has plainly told us, that we have sufficient, not to be contented with them</hi> (to wit, the Scriptures) <hi>but to expect and call for more?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Here again he lets his Pen run too fast, without due Consideration. I read in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the Holy Scriptures, that God hath said, <hi>My Grace is sufficient</hi>; but I never read that God said, <hi>The Scriptures are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi> Yet this man confidently sayes, <hi>God has plainly told us.</hi> He should have done
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98068:132"/>
well to have shewed us, where God hath <hi>plainly</hi> told this; and indeed, it behoves him yet to produce the place, if he can; otherwise, it will appear <hi>an Act of great Impudence in him,</hi> to say God hath <hi>plainly</hi> told that, which he hath not told at all. That the Scriptures <hi>themselves</hi> (as he speaks) are sufficient, <hi>without</hi> the Teaching and <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>spirit,</hi> I have before disproved. That the Help and Assistance of the Spirit is <hi>needful</hi> to understand the Scriptures, he has before granted. The <hi>spirit's</hi> helping to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Scriptures is by its <hi>Teaching</hi> the true Sense and Meaning of them, by <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, discovering</hi> and making known the Mind and Will of God therein exprest. <hi>This is Revelation</hi>: for whatsoever is <hi>discovered</hi> or made known is <hi>revealed.</hi> Now then, if the <hi>spirit</hi> doth <hi>open, discover</hi> &amp; make known the Mind and Will of God, then the <hi>spirit</hi> doth <hi>reveal</hi> the Mind and Will of God. And if the Mind and Will of God (although ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in the Holy Scriptures) cannot be truly understood or known, unless the Spirit open, discover and make it known, then it follows, that the Mind and Will of God (although there exprest) cannot be truly understood
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:98068:133"/>
or known, <hi>unless the spirit reveal it.</hi> So that still here is <hi>a Necessity of Revelation.</hi> And these very same things having been <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore revealed</hi> unto others, is not this <hi>a Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former Revelation</hi> (that is, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing of the same things to us now, that were formerly revealed to others?) And will he, upon second Thoughts, call it <hi>an Act of Impudence</hi> to expect this?

            <p>In the next place, he takes upon him to give the True Sense of Christ's Words in <hi>Mark</hi> 13.11.

Nor would I <hi>detract a Tittle</hi> from the <hi>due Praise</hi> of the Translators, or in the least <hi>undervalue</hi> or disesteem that <hi>Learning</hi> which they made use of in their Work, which I always a knowledge to be good &amp; service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>in its right place,</hi> as an <hi>outward</hi> Means (as <hi>writing</hi> also and <hi>Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But he saith, <hi>If Learning were at first ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the translating of the Scriptures, it is still as necessary for the Interpreting of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If by interpreting he means (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Acceptation of the Word) an <hi>Opening,</hi> and giving the <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of the Scriptures, I deny his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence; for though Learning was at first necessary to turn the Words out of one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage into another, yet it is not necessary to give the Sense, and open the meaning of the matter contained in the Words, because it
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98068:138"/>
neither was <hi>designed thereto,</hi> nor is <hi>capable thereof</hi>; for as in <hi>Natural</hi> things, <hi>what man</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>knoweth the things of a Man save the Spirit of Man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>but the Spirit of God. Now we</hi> (saith he) <hi>have received not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</hi> The Apostle here layes the <hi>Capacity</hi> of knowing the things that are given us of God upon our <hi>receiving the Spirit</hi> of God, and <hi>wholly shuts out</hi> the Spirit of the World from having any thing to do in it, and that not without great Reason; for he that hath <hi>most</hi> of the Spirit of the World, he who is <hi>deepest</hi> in the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Understanding of the World, and who hath climbed to the <hi>highest Pitch</hi> of humane Learning, is by all these Attainments but a <hi>Natural Man.</hi> And the Apostle saith expresly (ver. 14.) <hi>The Natural Man recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are Foolishness unto him; neither can be know them, because they are spiritually discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Where then is the <hi>Necessity</hi> of humane Learning to interpret the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But he intimates, <hi>That there is still a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98068:138"/>
of understanding these Tongues for the Translation of Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Not if the Scriptures be already <hi>rightly</hi> translated; but by this he implies, that <hi>the present Translation is not true</hi>: And what a Condition doth he leave <hi>them</hi> in then, to <hi>whom</hi> he proposes it as a <hi>perfect and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Rule</hi>; for if the Scripture (<hi>not the Spirit</hi>) is to be their Rule, then to them that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it not in other Languages (which not one of an hundred doth) <hi>the Translation of the Scripture must be the Rule,</hi> and if that Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation be <hi>not true,</hi> the Rule is <hi>not true</hi> (and what will the Consequence of that be) but if the Translation be true, then there is not a <hi>Necessity</hi> still of understanding those Tongues for the Translation of Scripture.</p>
            <p>But saith he, <hi>I pray by what way and means must we attain the Knowledge of it</hi> (speaking of the Scripture just before) <hi>but by the ordinary means of Study, Industry, or Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity Education?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Question implies he knows <hi>no other Way,</hi> and indeed I doubt he doth not; yet if he thinks there is <hi>no other Way,</hi> I would ask him why he saith (page 103.) <hi>He prays for the Assistance of the Spirit to help him understand the Scriptures</hi>? Is not that <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:98068:139"/>
Way then by Study, Industry, or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity Education.</p>
            <p>He next attempts to shew <hi>the use of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in unfolding difficult places in Scripture,</hi> namely, <hi>for the Vnderstanding the Literal, Moral, Mystical, Tropical, Metaphorical, Allegorical, Hyperbolical Senses, which</hi> he confesseth <hi>are hard Words.</hi> and <hi>hard indeed</hi> would the Case of Mankind be, if the Gospel could <hi>not</hi> be understood, and preacht unto them without understanding these <hi>hard</hi> words, but the best on it is, these <hi>hard</hi> words relate but to the <hi>difficult</hi> Places, which (he saith, page 93.) are <hi>least</hi> necessary, nay <hi>not at all</hi> necessary to Salvation: <hi>All Points whatsoever necessary to Salvation, either to be believed or done; the History of Christ's Birth, Death, Resurrection and Ascension; the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the first and second Table; the Love of God and our Neighbour, all Evangelical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and the Essentials of Religion, being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the most vulgar Capacity, and shallowest Vnderstanding, suited to the Capacity of the weakest and most unlearned, written in such a plain and familiar Style, and made such easie Doctrines, that he that runs may read them.</hi> So then here is <hi>no need</hi> of a lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But he chargeth <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>with mis-tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abusing the Prophecy of</hi> Joel, <hi>in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to this present Age.</hi> The words are, <hi>And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh, &amp;c.</hi> chap. 2.28. <hi>This Prophecy</hi> he tells us, a learned Commentator tells him, <hi>was cited and applied by St.</hi> Peter (Acts 2.) <hi>to the times of the Gospel.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> What doth he mean by <hi>the times of the Gospel</hi>? are not these times, which we live in, the times of the Gospel? what times I wonder doth he take these to be?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Peter</hi> explains the Word [<hi>afterward</hi>] by the <hi>last days</hi>; for whereas the Prophet had said, <hi>It shall come to pass afterward, &amp;c.</hi> The Apostle saith, <hi>It shall come to pass in the last Days<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> &amp;c.</hi> Upon this the Priest recites these Words of his learned Commentator, <hi>Whatsoever can be collected from this Place t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Benefit of the Pretenders, will receive a short and clear Answer, by considering the time to which this Prediction (and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of it) belonged, and that is expresly the last Days, in the Notion wherein the Writers of the new Testament constantly use that Phrase not for these Days of ours so far advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the End of the World, but for the time immediately preceding the Destruction of the</hi> Jewish <hi>Polity, &amp;c.</hi> page 123.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That this Prophecy then relates to the last Days (whensoever they fall to be) both he and his Commentator grant us, but we do not agree <hi>which are the last Days.</hi> He saith, <hi>these days of ours are not the last Days, but those Days immediately foregoing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of</hi> Jerusalem. That the last Days did <hi>then begin,</hi> I grant, but that they are <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ended,</hi> I deny.

Which is more properly the <hi>last,</hi> the <hi>foremost,</hi> or the <hi>hindermost,</hi> that that is <hi>gone before,</hi> or that that <hi>followeth</hi> after? But I observe he saith, <hi>The last Days are not these of ours, so far advanced towards the End of the World, &amp;c.</hi> as if he thought the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:98068:140"/>
of these Days so far towards <hi>the End of the World</hi> a fit Medium to prove them <hi>not the last Days,</hi> then which I think he could not have found an unfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But he would have it, <hi>That the Writers of the New Testament do constantly use that Phrase</hi> [the last Days] <hi>with relation to that time immediatly preceding the Destruction of</hi> Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No they do not <hi>constantly</hi> use that Phrase with relation to that time; the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> saith, <hi>In the last days perilous times shall come:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.1. 2 Pet. 3.3.</note>

            <p>But to shorten the Work, I will grant him that <hi>the Last Dayes did then begin,</hi> to which that Prophecy had relation: let him prove that the Last Dayes are <hi>at an end,</hi> or that the Spirit was to be poured out in <hi>some part only</hi> of the Last Dayes, and not in all<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> if he will have the pouring forth of the Spirit to be now ceased.

            <p>I Am now come to the <hi>Priests Delilah,</hi> the very <hi>Darling</hi> and <hi>Minion</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> TYTHES; which were wont to be claimed as of <hi>Divine Right</hi>: but I do not find this Priest <hi>hardy</hi> enough to adventure his Cause upon that Title. No; though he pretends to be a Minister of the Gospel, yet he takes the Law for the <hi>surer holding,</hi> and therefore betakes himself chiefly to that. Yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he would say for the other too, though not so much from himself as others. <hi>Let me tell you,</hi> sayes he, <hi>that those that insist upon the Divine Right of Tythes</hi> (as much as to say, I do not) <hi>derive them not from</hi> Levi, <hi>but</hi> Melchizedeck. It is then inquirable, Whether or no Tythes were ever due to <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> That which should make them due, must be a <hi>Command.</hi> They were <hi>not due</hi> to the Levitical Priesthood, until they were <hi>commanded</hi> to be paid; but after they

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.20.</note> He does not say, He <hi>paid</hi> him Tythes; but He <hi>gave</hi> him Tythes: which the Apostle referring to,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.2.</note> useth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the <hi>same</hi> Phrase, <hi>To whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so</hi> Abraham <hi>gave a Tenth Part</hi>; and again,<note place="margin">Vers. 4.</note>

            <p>But the Priest would insinuate, <hi>That this was not a Voluntary Gift of</hi> Abraham<hi>'s, but that he paid it as a Tythe,</hi> pag. 135.</p>

               </gap>o Right thereto can be derived from him to any other. Nay further, If <hi>Tythes</hi> had been due to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck,</hi> yet could not the Clergy of this Age derive any Right from him to them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as <hi>they are not of his Priesthood.</hi> For certain it is, that he was <hi>not made a Priest after the Law of a Carnal Commandment, but after the Power of an Endless Life.</hi> But every one knows, that these men are made Priests <hi>after the Law of a Carnal Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> These therefore, not being of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck</hi>'s Priesthood, could have no colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Pretence to <hi>Tythes</hi> from him, if <hi>Tythes</hi> had ever been due to him. And this the Priest (being in some things a wary man, as much overseen as he is in others) might not improbably fore-see, which made him at first so shye of adventuring his Cause upon that Issue.</p>
            <p>But if he has no Right from <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> to be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But then he starts a Question, <hi>Whether Tythes are not purely Ceremonial, and so abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by Christ</hi>? His Answer is, <hi>Tythes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But not to insist long on the Disproof of that, which he dares not undertake at all to prove, namely the divine Right of Tythes, I conclude thus, That <hi>the Payment of Tythes having never</hi> (that appears) <hi>been commanded by God to any Person, or in any time, save on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the</hi> Levitical <hi>Law, no man can justl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

plead a divine Right to Tythes, since that Law was abrogated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not finding any sure Footing for Tythes upon a divine Right, he urgeth that <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in general to the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is Iust, Reasonable, and established by a Divine Authority</hi> (and this he doth in order to prove a humane and temporal Right) for which he quotes 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That a <hi>Maintenance in general to the Ministers of the Gospel is Iust, Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and established by a divine Authority,</hi> I grant: But the Intent of the Apostle in those Scriptures which the Priest hath quoted, is not so much to set forth <hi>what</hi> the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is, as <hi>who</hi> they are from whom it is to be received, namely, <hi>such as receive</hi> their Ministry, <hi>such as believe</hi> them to be true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, <hi>such as are taught</hi> by them, <hi>such as are fed</hi> by them, <hi>such as are planted</hi> by them, &amp;c. This appears in the several Instances, <hi>The Ox</hi> that trod out the Corn (in the time of the Law) was <hi>not to be muzzeled,</hi> but was to be <hi>fed</hi> by him whose Corn he trod out, but it was not agreeable to the Equity of that Law that <hi>while the Ox trod out Corn for one Man, another should be bound to keep him,</hi> that had
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98068:147"/>
been unreasonable. The Apostle argues from a <hi>Souldier,</hi> a <hi>Planter,</hi> an <hi>Herdsman: Who</hi> (saith he) <hi>goes a Warfare at anytime at his own Charge? Who plants a Vineyard, and eats not of the Fruit thereof? or who feeds a Flock and eats not of the Milk of the Flock?</hi> Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der now, at whose Charge ought the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to go, but at <hi>his for whose defence he fights</hi>? He that plants a Vineyard, may eat of the Fruit, but it must be of the Fruit <hi>thereof,</hi> that is, <hi>of the Fruit of that Vineyard which he hath planted</hi>: So he that feeds a Flock may eat of the Milk, but it must be the <hi>Milk of the Flock which he feeds. If</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</hi> No, because he had <hi>first sown</hi> unto them; <hi>they had received of him,</hi> and therefore he might well expect to receive of them. This still shews that the Ministers of the Gospel are not to reap carnal things of any but those to whom they have <hi>first</hi> sowed spiritual things. To the same Purpose is that to the <hi>Galatians, Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teacheth in all good things</hi>; hence it is plain, that he that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth can expect this Communication of good things from <hi>none, but them that are taught by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98068:148"/>
him:</hi> All therefore that can be inferred from these Instances will amount to no more then this, <hi>First,</hi> That a Gospel-Minister may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and receive a Gospel-Maintenance <hi>from such as receive his Ministry. Secondly,</hi> That a Gospel-Minister ought <hi>not</hi> to expect any Maintenance from those that do <hi>not receive his Ministry.</hi> But what this Gospel-Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is, is expresly set down by Christ himself,<note place="margin">

And this is the very Maintenance which, in the Place fore-quoted by the Priest (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.) the Apostle asserts he had Power to receive (<hi>Have we not Power to eat and to drink,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 14.) And again, <hi>Having Food</hi> (saith he) <hi>and Raiment let us therewith be content.</hi> This was thought <hi>enough</hi> in that Day. Thus they who then <hi>preacht the Gospel lived of the Gospel</hi>; and if these men were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Ministers of the Gospel they also would be <hi>content with this</hi>; but this will not satisfie my greedy Adversary, nothing less then Tythes will serve his turn.</p>
            <p>He saith (pag. 146) <hi>The Gospel commands

               <hi>Answ.</hi> But that is not all, I shall discover his Fallacy <hi>further,</hi> by telling him, not only that I enjoy my Estate as a <hi>Temporal Right,</hi> but also that I <hi>claim it in a Natural and Civil Capacity,</hi> without Relation to a <hi>Ministerial Function,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Office, <hi>as a Man,</hi> not as a Minister of Christ. But the Priest doth <hi>not</hi> claim Tythes in this Capacity. He claims in a <hi>Spiritual Capacity</hi> although his Claim be false) his Claim depends upon a <hi>Ministerial</hi> Function. He claims <hi>not as a Man,</hi> but as a Minister of Christ (for such he pretends to be, though he be not) His claim therefore to Tythes, and my claim to my temporal Estate, <hi>differing</hi> in the very Ground and Nature of them, that which will make good my claim to my Estate, will not make good his claim to Tythes. For my claim to my Estate being grounded upon a <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>Temporal</hi> Consideration <hi>only,</hi> a <hi>Temporal</hi> Right is sufficient to make it good. But his
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:98068:161"/>
Claim to Tythes being grounded upon a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Consideration (as he pretends to be a Minister of Christ) a <hi>Temporal</hi> Right is no way <hi>equal,</hi> or <hi>suitable</hi> to his Claim. So that he hath still need (if he would still take <hi>Tythes,</hi> and still be reputed a Minister of Christ) to produce a <hi>Precept</hi> where God hath commanded <hi>Tythes</hi> to be paid under the Gospel, or an <hi>Example,</hi> where Christ or his Apostles did receive them. Which if he cannot do, <hi>he is justly to be reputed no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ,</hi> since they that are indeed his Ministers, are able to shew both Precept and Example for the Maintenance which they receive.</p>

A good <hi>Deed</hi> for a <hi>Temporal</hi> Estate, sounds some what like; but a <hi>Terrier</hi> and <hi>Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for a Minister of Christ, is new and strange Language, which Christians are not acquainted with. And for a <hi>Temporal</hi> Estate, held in a <hi>Civil</hi> Capacity, it is sufficient that the <hi>Deed</hi> be approved by the Laws of the Land, because the Estate it self is claimed, and held upon <hi>no other</hi> Considerations, then such as are <hi>Temporal.</hi> But it is <hi>otherwise</hi> in the case of Tythes: A <hi>Temporal</hi> Settlement of Tythes is <hi>not sufficient,</hi> because Tythes are claimed upon <hi>Considerations</hi> that are <hi>not Temporal,</hi> but <hi>Spiritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Parishioner puts the Question, <hi>If Tythes are Temporal Rights, how come you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> call them spiritual Preferments</hi>? The Priest answers, <hi>All Tythes are not so called, because all Impropriations are held in a Laity, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By this then it appears, that if the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:98068:163"/>
Impropriations are held in a Laity, Tythes are not <hi>so Sacred</hi> a thing, but that they <hi>may be</hi> and are <hi>alienated</hi> to common Uses, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the <hi>Dedication</hi> of them, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else he saith elsewhere (page 146, 147.) to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But other Tythes,</hi> the Priest saith, <hi>are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led spiritual Preferments, not in respect of the Profits, but the Persons who are capable of them, and therfore are they vulgarly called spiritual Preferments, because enjoyed by spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Persons,</hi> page 137.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> So then it seems the <hi>Persons</hi> injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tythes must be <hi>Spiritual,</hi> yea so Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as to communicate to the Tythes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Denomination of Spiritual Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet they must be held by a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Right; and why? but because <hi>they have no Spiritual Right to them.</hi> But letting that pass, two things I desire to be resolved in. <hi>First,</hi> Why these Priests, who <hi>hid such Defiance to the Inspiration of the Spirit,</hi> should affect to call themselves <hi>Spiritual Persons? Secondly,</hi> Seeing towards the Beginning of his Book (page 11.) he saith, <hi>some men for a corrupt Interest will intrude themselves into these Sacred Offices</hi>; and again, near the End of it (pag 160.) He tells us, <hi>the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98068:163"/>
Care of some of the Clergy, for the Maintenance of their Families, hath been excessive</hi>: I would gladly know whether he reckons these for some of his <hi>Spiritual Persons,</hi> seeing these do <hi>injoy the Preferments</hi> as well as any.</p>
            <p>He tells us (in page 140.) That which no-Body doubts, viz. <hi>That Temporal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have Power to establish Temporal Rights</hi>; from whence (in page 141.) he infers, <hi>That in Temporal Affairs, an Argument drawn from Temporal Authority (where the thing is equitable and Reasonable) is a good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Argument</hi>; and in the next page, taking an Occasion to repeat, he saith, <hi>I do not say in every Case a Temporal Authority can create a Right to a Temporal Interest, but in such Cases only as are Equitable and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I observe here he <hi>reels</hi> from <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing</hi> a Right to <hi>creating</hi> a Right: I hope he doth not think that to <hi>establish</hi> &amp; <hi>create</hi> is one and the same thing.

the <hi>Labour, Sweat, Care, Charge, Skill, Industry, Diligence, &amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> are included, and that <hi>inseparably</hi>: for these are indeed the <hi>Instrumental Causes</hi> of Production. To admit then a Power in any man, to give the Tythes of the <hi>Profits</hi> of his Land, beyond his own Life, were to suppose a Power in that Man to give away the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Care, Skill, Charge, Diligence, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry</hi> of another. But that Reason gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayes. For though a man may give away <hi>his own</hi> Pains, Charge, &amp;c. may make <hi>himself</hi> a Bondslave, if he will, and devote <hi>himself</hi> wholely to labour for others: yet can he not <hi>impose this Condition</hi> upon others. For as till it was <hi>voluntarily</hi> undertaken by <hi>him,</hi> he was under <hi>no Obligation</hi> to it: so in like manner until it be <hi>voluntarily</hi> undertaken by <hi>others,</hi> they are under <hi>no Obligation</hi> to it. Now for any one to plead, that <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> (or any other man) hath given him, the Tythes of the <hi>Profits</hi> of that Land that I possess or occupy, is all one as if he should tell me, that <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> (or some other) <hi>hath given him my Labour, Pains, Charges, Care, Skill, Industry, Diligence, Vnderstanding, &amp;c.</hi> seven or eight Hundred Years, it may be, before either he or I was born; a thing

            <p>Nor is it more agreeable to Justice and Equity. For if <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> a <hi>Papist,</hi> gave Tythes to the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy, he did it upon a Consideration, <hi>for the Health of his Soul and Remission of his Sins,</hi>

But let not any man imagine that they had Power to charge their Posterity with that <hi>which was no way theirs,</hi> nor which in any true Sense or Construction they could be said to have any Property in, and which is not paid by Reason of that which is derived from them. For indeed, if the Case be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stated, Tythe is not paid of Land, nor simply by Reason of the Land, but of the Profits and Encrease growing and arising and by Reason of the Labour and Stock imploy'd to the production of that Encrease. This will more plainly appear, if we observe that by the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Handycrafts-men (who possess no Land) are injoined to pay the Tenth of the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:98068:175"/>
Profits, Encrease or Gain, arising by their Trades or Labour, as well as the Husbandman the Encrease of the Land.

If a man so husband his Land that the Encrease of it is not to be severed from it, as (for Instance) if he convert it to <hi>Pasture,</hi> and feed Cattel upon it, he shall not be accountable for the Tythes of the Grass so eaten, but if any thing at all be demanded, it can be only a rate Tythe for the Cattel there feeding. But if he feed his Land with <hi>Horses,</hi> very little, if any thing at all is recoverable for Tythe. And if he <hi>plant Wood,</hi> and let it grow for Timber, he is not liable to any Tythe at all. From these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances it is manifest, both that it is in the

Power of the Occupant to make the Tythe <hi>much, little</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi> at all: And also that those <hi>Tythes</hi> that are paid, are paid not <hi>pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Consideration of the Land it self,</hi> but with Relation to the <hi>Stock</hi> &amp; <hi>Personal Estate</hi> imployed upon the Land, together with the <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Industry</hi> of him that occupies it.

            <p>He confesses (page 157.) That <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had not Tythes in their days,</hi> and he gives this as one Reason for it, <hi>because they could
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:98068:180"/>
not have them, if they would, the</hi> Levites <hi>being in Possession of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But if Tythes ought to have been paid, what hindred their receiving them of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were converted? some of whom were so <hi>zealously aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Again, he sayes, <hi>We ought to consider that Tythes were an Improper Maintenance for the Apostles, because of their Vnfixt State of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <hi>fixed your State of Life</hi>? who divided Provinces into Parishes, &amp; <hi>set up Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Priests</hi>? was it not a Pope? Had you not your fixt State of Life and your Maintenance by Tythes from one and the same power?
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:98068:181"/>
But I remember this Priest sayes (pag, 86.) <hi>The Apostles and we</hi> (the Clergy) <hi>act under Different Circumstances.</hi> And I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it; for so did the <hi>true</hi> Ministers and the <hi>false</hi>

            </p>
            <p>He has another Reason yet, why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had not Tythes, namely, <hi>They had no need of them; for as they had their Gifts, so their Maintenance by a Mira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is <hi>notoriously</hi> false. They had their Maintenance in an <hi>Ordinary</hi> Way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Miracle</hi> at all. <hi>Whatsoever was set before them,</hi> by such as did receive them, <hi>that they were to eat and drink,</hi> Luk. 10 7, 8. Where then was the Miracle? was it in the Believers setting Food before them? or in their eating it, when it was so set before them?</p>
            <p>But sayes he, pag. 158. <hi>If you conclude that we must be in all things as were the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, then must you of the Laity do now as the Laity did then, who sold their Possessions, and laid them down at the Apostles Feet,</hi> Acts 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That does not follow. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles (and in them all Ministers of Christ)
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:98068:181"/>
were commanded to preach freely (<hi>Freely ye have received, freely give,</hi> Mat 10.8.) and for their Maintenance to receive such things only, as by Believers were freely admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.7, 8. But the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were not commanded to sell their Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions; that was a <hi>voluntary Act</hi> in them, as is manifest from the Instance of <hi>Ananias, While it remained</hi> (saith <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 5.4.) <hi>was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own Power</hi>? So that he might have chosen whether he would have sold his Land or not; and after it was sold, he might yet have chosen, whether he would have brought the Money, or any part of it, into that Common Treasury or no. But the Apostles were not at their own choice, whether they would preach the Gospel or no. But sayes <hi>Paul, A Dispensation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is committed unto me, a Necessity</hi> (of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it) <hi>is laid upon me, yea, Wo is unto me if I preach not the Gospel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.16, 17. And the same Apostle, when he took his Leave of the Elders of the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Church, did not exhort them to covet other mens Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; but told them, <hi>I have coveted no man's Silver, or Gold, or Apparel: Yea, you your selves know</hi> (said he) <hi>that these Hands have mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred unto my Necessities, and to them that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:98068:182"/>
were with me. And I have shewed you all things</hi> (adds he) <hi>how that so labouring, ye ought to support the Weak; and to remember the words of the Lord Iesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give, then to receive,</hi> Acts 20.33, 34, 35.</p>
            <p>But he tells us <hi>We ought to pay them Tythes for Conscience sake, because the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it,</hi> p. 158.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Every Command of a King is not for Conscience sake to be <hi>actually</hi> obeyed. Histories, both Ecclesiastical and Civil, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, That many things have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Kings, which for Conscience sake ought <hi>not</hi> to have been performed. Instances of this kind abound in the Histories of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah.</hi> And if the King should command this man but to throw up his setled Maintenance, and <hi>preach freely</hi>; I question how forward he would be in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a Command. But if an <hi>active</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience must for Conscience sake be yielded to every Command of a King, it must be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther simply as he is a King, or as he is a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> King; if simply as a King, then if I lived in <hi>Turky,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> command me to maintain his Priests, I must do it. If as a <hi>Christian-King,</hi> then if I lived in <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King command me to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:98068:182"/>
his <hi>Priests,</hi> it seems by this Man's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, I must do it, and that for Conscience sake too, how contrary soever it be to Good Conscience.</p>
            <p>But he sayes, <hi>The First Fruits and Tenths is one of the fairest Flowers belonging to the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He greatly mistakes, being herein somewhat like the Crow, which is said to think her own Bird White <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Asinus asino, sus sui pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</hi>
               </note> though others see it to be Black. <hi>No Flower can be fair in an</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish <hi>Crown, which was taken out of a Pope's Mitre.</hi> If nothing else could be said against it, but that it once <hi>stuck in the Tripple Crown,</hi> that alone were enough to make it unworthy to be <hi>worn in an</hi> English <hi>Diadem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He seems greatly offended that he and his Brethren are counted <hi>Hirelings</hi>; and to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himself he makes a Comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Judges of the Land: <hi>You know</hi> (sayes he) <hi>the King has Twelve Iudges, &amp;c. and these have an Honourable Allowance from the Exchequer. Will you therefore say that they are Hirelings, and sell Iustice? and is not ours the same Case</hi>? pag 159.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:98068:183"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No: for you pretend to be <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ</hi>; whereas they pretend no higher then to be <hi>Ministers of State.</hi> You call your selves <hi>Spiritual Persons</hi>: but you reckon them but <hi>Lay Men.</hi> You challenge to your selves a <hi>Spiritual Function</hi>: they claim but a <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Temporal Office.</hi> They therefore standing in a <hi>civil Capacity,</hi> may reasonably and fairly, without any <hi>Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Injustice, receive what their Master is pleased to bestow upon them. But you, who pretend to be <hi>Ministers of Christ Iesus,</hi> are therefore <hi>justly condemnable</hi> as Hirelings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye will not be content with <hi>that Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> which he (whom ye call, though untruly, your Master) hath appointed, but <hi>seek for Hire</hi> from others.</p>
            <p>Again, He takes it ill, that any should think they would abandon their Profession, if they should be bereaft of their Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>I hope</hi> (sayes he) <hi>many of us can appeal to the Searcher of Hearts, that we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Ministry upon better Grounds, then Temporal Interests, &amp;c. I pray you therefore ask your own Conscience, whether it were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be Reason, or rather Envy, that drew up this Charge against us,</hi> p. 160.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I would not think hardly of them
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:98068:183"/>
               <hi>all</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> nor more hardly of any then they deserve. But yet I must tell him, he need not take it ill, if such a thing be questioned, considering <hi>what Ground</hi> has been given for it. I do not know his standing (because he had not Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity enough to give his Name) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can say nothing to him particularly. But if he be not a very Young Man, he cannot be ignorant, that once within these Twenty Years, when their Preferments were taken away, <hi>chose of his Profession were very scarce to be found,</hi> insomuch as at that day the old Proverb began to come in use, <hi>No Penny, No Pater Noster.</hi> Certain it is, <hi>the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds were fled,</hi> and had left their <hi>Flocks</hi> to the <hi>Mercy</hi> of those, whom they accounted no better then <hi>Wolves</hi>; and many good men thought the Reason to be, <hi>because they were but Hirelings,</hi> John 10.13. But to pass that by,</p>
            <p>There remains yet a material Point to be considered, viz. <hi>For what Reason the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>should pay Tythes, when by their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have no Benefit of his Ministry</hi>? His Reason is, <hi>That the Minister is not to Blame for their Separation, or lack of that Benefit, but desires they would injoy it while he is attending his Office,</hi> p. 161.</p>

Admit he be a man of <hi>tolerable Sobriety,</hi> yet if his Ministry can do me no good, am I not better without it? That which I am is the Salvation of my Soul. He tells me (pag. 92, 93.) <hi>That whatsoever is necessary to my Salvation, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready so plain in the Scriptures, that I may understand it without his Help.</hi> To what End then should I make use of him?</p>
            <p>But to come closer to the Point. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be a Minister of Christ. Where did Christ ever impower his Ministers to <hi>make people hear them, whether they will or no</hi>? or to <hi>exact Wages of them although they did not hear them</hi>? His Instruction to his Disciples was, <hi>Whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, shake off the Dust of your Feet,</hi> Mat. 10.14.

It may be he will say No, because a <hi>Popish Priest</hi> is not a Minister of Christ. <hi>A very good Reason against them both.</hi> But the <hi>Popish Priest</hi> no doubt will say He is, and the other <hi>does no more.</hi> But this man may say, <hi>He has Law on his side</hi>: so had the other <hi>too lately</hi> in this Nation, and has it <hi>still</hi> elsewhere.

               </gap>t by the same Argument by which he would condemn us, he justifies not only the Practice of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> against the <hi>Protestants</hi> here of old, but also the Dealings of other Secretaries against his Brethren and himself of late.</p>
            <p>Besides, it is <hi>most weakly</hi> argued, that we must b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>e, nor <hi>Tythe his Due.</hi> His supposing it so, is but begging of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. If he will say, it appears to be his Due, because upon Tryal he recovers it at Law; I shall answer, that that Argument will no more prove Tythes due to him, then it will, that they were due to the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> both which (the former of old, the latter of late) recovered them by Law. Will he therefore acquit them of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

            <p>But for a Minister of Christ to sue men at Law <hi>for his Belly,</hi> is without all <hi>Precept, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> or <hi>Ground</hi> in <hi>Scripture, Religion</hi> or
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:98068:186"/>

Or like the False Prophets mentioned by <hi>Micha, who prepared War against them that put not into their Mouthes,</hi> Chap. 3. But when or where did any Minister of Christ ever do thus?
